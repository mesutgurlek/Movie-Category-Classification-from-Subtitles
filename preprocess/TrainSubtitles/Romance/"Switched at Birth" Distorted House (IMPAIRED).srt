<i>Bay: I found another job
working at that amusement park,</i>

00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:04,897
<i>Maui, Kansas.</i>

4
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:05,949
I'm on games.

5
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,125
Where's Lana?

6
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:08,329
She took the baby and left.

7
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:10,316
The nurse just told me
she had a plane to catch.

8
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,779
We're engaged... to be married.

9
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:14,640
<i>I wanted you to have this.</i>

10
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,182
You can hang it up in Iraq,

11
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,254
or Afghanistan,

12
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,288
<i>or wherever "istan" you end up.</i>

13
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,683
Hey.

14
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,585
Oh my God, you're back.

15
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:28,422
Don't ever disrespect
a girl like that again,

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,473
do you hear me? Ever!

17
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:30,725
- Ty, don't!
- I'm sorry.

18
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,660
Where are you going?

19
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:33,661
<i>I talked to Angelo... </i>

20
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,429
he said I could stay over there.

21
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:36,631
I don't understand.

22
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:38,466
Why'd she go to Angelo's?

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,369
I guess she needed some alone time.

24
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:43,304
Can I stay the night?

25
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:45,573
You can stay as long as you want.

26
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,359
(Sighs) Morning.

27
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:07,194
Morning.

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,197
I wasn't sure if I should wake you.

29
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:13,100
Oh, I don't have to be
at the park till 10:00.

30
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:14,969
Is that pizza?

31
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:19,040
Uh, you want some eggs or something?

32
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:20,274
No, I'm good.

33
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:23,077
Well, at least let me heat it up for you.

34
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,378
I did manage to figure
out the toaster oven.

35
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,147
No, it's better this way.

36
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,249
I'm savoring my last few hours of freedom.

37
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:31,052
Right. Because it's such
a prison where you live.

38
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,821
(Chuckles)

39
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,990
Can I have some coffee?

40
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,158
Sure. Knock yourself out.

41
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:42,964
(Sighs)

42
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:44,765
Uh...

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,101
So when is Angelo coming back?

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,971
Well, he's about to meet
this family in Atlanta.

45
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:52,873
<i>So I guess however long it
takes to convince someone</i>

46
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,142
that they accidentally adopted his baby.

47
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:57,712
So you're staying until he gets back?

48
00:01:57,746 --> 00:02:00,614
Just until I find a job, I think.

49
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:01,882
You are welcome to stay.

50
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,751
<i>- Are you sure?
- Of course.</i>

51
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,052
Because I don't want to be crowding you.

52
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,555
(Sighs)

53
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:08,823
You are not crowding me.

54
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,525
You can't move out!

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm not moving out.

56
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,962
I'm just gonna keep Regina
company while Angelo's gone.

57
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:19,467
You know, I think Regina went
over there to get some space.

58
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,835
Regina's cool with it.

59
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:24,739
Honey, you were in the
Galapagos last summer.

60
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,741
Mom, Angelo's place is
in the same zip code.

61
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,743
You're still gonna see me.
You won't even know I'm gone.

62
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,578
<i>Daphne: Morning.</i>

63
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,582
And you'll have another daughter around.

64
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,351
I hope you guys are hungry,

65
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:40,688
I'm making Belgian
waffles with fresh berries.

66
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,623
Oh, thanks, but I already had pizza.

67
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:44,291
For breakfast?

68
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:46,761
And I should probably go pack.

69
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,397
We need to discuss this
with your father first.

70
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,732
Why? We already know what he's gonna say.

71
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,317
Hey, what's going on?

72
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,338
Okay.

73
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,340
Thanks, mom.

74
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,143
Did she just say "pack"? Where's she going?

75
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:05,346
She's going to stay with
Regina for a little while.

76
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,547
Why?

77
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,035
Hey.

78
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,037
Hey.

79
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:15,022
I didn't mean to crowd you out.

80
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,024
Oh, it's okay.

81
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,427
I mean, things have been weird lately.

82
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:22,329
I'll just move back into the guest house

83
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:23,397
and you don't have to leave.

84
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,032
No. Stay.

85
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,284
J and K love having you here.

86
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,336
And besides, it's better than
you being by yourself over there.

87
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:32,223
Okay, then I'll talk to my mom

88
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,974
and tell her to move back in

89
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,010
and that way nobody has to go anywhere.

90
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,299
Daphne, it's okay.

91
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,235
You don't have to fix this.

92
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,140
It's just until Angelo gets back.

93
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:46,042
I'm starting my new job at Maui, Kansas.

94
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,944
You should totally check it out.

95
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,012
I've been there.

96
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,814
My mom used to take me.

97
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,916
Oh, cool. Isn't it awesome?

98
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,119
All right.

99
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,788
I think that's it.

100
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,889
House is all yours.

So I'm in Atlanta for nothing?

Well, I guess I'm going to Virginia.

out if they have my daughter.

quit all of a sudden,

I got equipment problems, blah blah blah.

Look, we all have a day job, right?

Next breakfast is Tuesday.

147
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,755
- Tuesday. All right.
- Yeah. I'll see you there?

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,756
- Yes, sir.
- Be well.

<i>Way to attack. Strong. Here we go.</i>

164

You're almost in the alley. Move in.

165
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,971
Good. All right. Here we go.

166
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,023
<i>Watch it. Good.</i>

167
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,808
Very nice.

168
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,696
Whoa!

169
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:12,715
You're supposed to duck, remember?

170
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,950
Well, I didn't think you were
gonna try to take my head off.

171
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,702
You guys are really off today.

172
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,622
Our time is up. But for next time,

173
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,857
work on court communication.

174
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,842
Partners who are in sync

175
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,628
are partners who win.

176
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,762
Yeah?

177
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,636
What's going on?

178
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,971
You've been off in space all morning.

179
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,640
Kathryn.

180
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:40,676
Hey, Shauna. Hey, Lisa.

181
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,061
Hi, Mrs. Kennish.

182
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,697
Oh, you guys,

183
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,815
this is my daughter, Daphne.

184
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,117
Oh right. Hi.

185
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,786
Daphne, this is Shauna.

186
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,755
And this is Lisa.

187
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:53,989
Nice to meet you guys.

188
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:56,742
You two should play the
mother-daughter tournament.

189
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,963
I don't know. I think that it's a bit much

190
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,631
for us right now.

191
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,800
<i>- I'm ready, ladies.
- Both: Coming.</i>

192
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,535
Nice to see you two.

193
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,537
<i>- Hi, Gustavo.
- Hey. How are you?</i>

194
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,972
<i>Great. Okay. Here we go. Ready position.</i>

195
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,673
<i>Now get out in front.</i>

196
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,841
<i>Okay, good.</i>

197
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,827
<i>Uh-Huh. I'm ready. Very nice.</i>

198
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,495
<i>- Nice, honey.
- Very nice.</i>

199
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:17,579
<i>Watch the ball all the way to the racket.</i>

200
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,881
<i>That's it. Yeah!</i>

201
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,749
<i>(Ska music playing)</i>

202
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,691
<i>* thought we'd settle down *</i>

203
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,544
<i>* take everything head on. *</i>

204
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,663
And as you can see, even
the most skilled players

205
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,664
don't always win.

206
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,666
You should have had that last one.

207
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,786
So the question, Bay, is really this.

208
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,539
Who here woke up this morning and thought

209
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,290
"I'm gonna go to Maui, Kansas

210
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,343
and play some skee ball"?

211
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:48,610
No one. They come,

212
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,545
they get fluorescent braids in their hair,

213
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,231
eat a pineapple freezee

214
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,483
and scream their heads off on the rip curl.

215
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,352
But do you want to know my
favorite part of this job?

216
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,321
The games?

217
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:00,456
Yes.

218
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,158
And why are the games my favorite?

219
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,560
Because they make money?

220
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,528
Nope. It's not about the money.

221
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:09,398
It is about something better.

222
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,066
Power.

223
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:15,237
Do you know what we call this?

224
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,172
Something tells me I
shouldn't say "microphone."

225
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,340
Mm.

226
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,342
This would be the talking stick.

227
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,444
Whoever holds the talking stick

228
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,363
wields the power to overcome

229
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:27,116
one of the greatest obstacles known to man.

230
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,085
- Indifference.
- Not where I was going.

231
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,253
They don't care.

232
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,088
You will make them care.

233
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,057
But how, Mac? How do I do that?

234
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,292
By offering something far greater

235
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,061
than any mere prize.

236
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,196
<i>We are offering an experience.</i>

237
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,999
Primal fear. Ecstatic victory.

238
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,101
The ancient chariot races of Rome!

239
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,269
<i>(Clinks)</i>

240
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,937
You're seriously good
with the talking stick.

241
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,038
You will be too.

242
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,107
Okay, I gotta get to the penny drop.

243
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,909
Mary Beth can take it from here.

244
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,844
Got it, chief. Aloha.

245
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,180
Ha.

246
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:01,116
- That dude's intense.
- Yeah.

247
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,151
You're gonna have a lot of fun.

248
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,819
Games are the best.

249
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,855
Here you go.

250
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:12,861
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

251
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,798
Great. I was just finishing up this budget.

252
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,002
I hadn't saved that yet.

253
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,571
Close your eyes.

254
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,839
Okay.

255
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,511
All right.

256
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,679
Open your mouth.

257
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,484
- (Chuckles)
- Mmm.

258
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:36,652
That's really good.

259
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,921
It's devil's food with raspberry filling.

260
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:40,789
- Devil's food.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:42,524
What would Reverend Steve say?

262
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,395
You are just never gonna get
sick of those jokes, are you?

263
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,496
Nope.

264
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,564
All right. So...

265
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,699
budget?

266
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,417
So.

267
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:53,735
Flowers, photographers,

268
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,671
very expensive.

269
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,557
How do we not have enough?

270
00:10:58,608 --> 00:10:59,575
Nope. No no.

271
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:03,212
Do not touch the laptop of doom.

272
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,446
I will take care of it myself.

273
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,648
This doesn't have to be
just your problem, you know.

274
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,317
I'll figure it out.

275
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:11,453
You and I, we will talk about cake,

276
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,489
and about decorations,

277
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:15,324
and all the fun stuff.

278
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,080
<i>* to the sky *</i>

279
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,082
<i>* we can fly together *</i>

280
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,367
<i>* past the moon *</i>

281
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,302
<i>* almost there. *</i>

282
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:30,506
You, sir! With the sandals and the socks.

283
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,208
You have inner frustrations.
You should get up here

284
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,409
and un-frustrate them.

285
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,332
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
This is my first day.

286
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,150
I just need a customer.

287
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,152
Seriously. One person.

288
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,220
Please?

289
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,289
How about a little more enthusiasm?

290
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,157
Oh, you should have
been here two hours ago.

291
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,242
I was very committed.

292
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,094
I'll play.

293
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,213
You know, that's okay.

294
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,215
My shift's almost over anyway.

295
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,802
I'm sorry about the other day.

296
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,938
The text thing.

297
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,957
Don't worry about it.

298
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,910
Those guys were idiots.

299
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,177
But I shouldn't have let them get to me.

300
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:14,700
Yeah, you did kind of go Jekyll
and Hyde there for a second.

301
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,984
Hey.

302
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,686
I'm almost done.

303
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,054
Do you mind taking this
to the office for me?

304
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,689
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

305
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,657
Mary Beth, this is Bay.

306
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,658
We already met.

307
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,627
Mary Beth's been initiating me

308
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,729
into the rites and rituals of Maui, Kansas.

309
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,631
You're off to a great start.

310
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,932
Tomorrow it's gonna go even better.

311
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,701
Mahalo.

312
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,588
So that's your friend who works here.

313
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,873
Yeah. She's cool.

314
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,543
So how about you and I

315
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,711
hang out again sometime

316
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,679
like out in the real world?

317
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,615
I'd love to.

318
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,501
Maybe like get some tacos or something.

319
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,803
We can go ogle the poor
people of East Riverside.

320
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,457
You are never gonna let
me live that down, are you?

321
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,425
Mm-hmm.

322
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,693
What time are you off tomorrow?

323
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,595
- 4:00.
- All right. Well, then I'll see you then.

324
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,497
And I promise no Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde this time.

325
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,499
All right.

326
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,669
I didn't know you knew Ty.

327
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:12,341
Well, we almost kind of grew up together.

328
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,276
It's a long story.

329
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,644
Did I hear you guys saying

330
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:16,712
you were gonna do something tomorrow?

331
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,480
Yeah.

332
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,482
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

333
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,551
It's just... that's good.

334
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,269
That's a good sign.

335
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,223
I'll see you tomorrow.

336
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:39,974
Wait a minute,

337
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:41,980
<i>you said "yes" without talking to me first?</i>

338
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,749
And what would you have said?

339
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,717
"I'm sorry, Bay, you can't spend time

340
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:47,019
with your biological mother"?

341
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,605
You can't go live with a fresh out of rehab

342
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,856
alcoholic basket case.

343
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,608
And she would have done it anyway.

344
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,594
And given you the cold
shoulder for like a year.

345
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,629
Besides, Regina is not a basket case.

346
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,466
Honey,

347
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,401
it's only fair.

348
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:04,703
We had Daphne for weeks.

349
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,705
She's still here and Regina's back.

350
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,608
What if Bay decides she wants
to move in with Regina for good?

351
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:10,776
She won't.

352
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,544
Don't be so sure.

353
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,346
We are talking about the girl

354
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,348
who enrolled in a school for the deaf

355
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,516
and stayed there.

356
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,569
What happened to your rule
about not bringing work to bed?

357
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:23,555
That died the minute I
took on two full-time jobs.

358
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,407
You need a new manager.

359
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,592
Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,294
Honey.

361
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,363
I'm so happy to see you.

362
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,531
Come on in.

363
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,500
Come come.

364
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:37,136
- When does Angelo...
- Is it muggy out?

365
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,304
- Is Bay at...
- I don't know yet.

366
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,405
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

367
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,540
You go.

368
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:44,343
Do you have lunch plans?

369
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,410
Yes.

370
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,412
With a can of tuna.

371
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:48,547
Want to make me a better offer?

372
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,283
- Well, I was thinking...
- I accept.

373
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:52,451
(Both chuckle)

374
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:55,154
Sit down and I'll go change my clothes.

375
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,093
Oh. Sorry.

376
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:04,229
Without you or grandma, I
go back to my native ways.

377
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:06,999
(Chuckles) I'll help you clean up.

378
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh no no no no no.

379
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:10,135
You are a guest.

380
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,105
Give me five minutes and we'll go.

381
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:15,974
Okay.

382
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:33,058
<i>(Car door opens, closes)</i>

383
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,695
Good.

384
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,864
Looks like things are back to normal.

385
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,684
That guy, he came this morning?

386
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:48,653
__

387
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,709
What do you mean you fixed it? How?

388
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:55,450
__

389
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,450
(Chuckles) That's fantastic.

390
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,769
You saved me a chunk of change.

391
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,904
Thank you.

392
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:07,626
- __
- Sure.

393
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,821
__

394
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:24,543
I'm happy that you showed me this

395
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,445
<i>- 'cause I wanna talk...
- (Cellphone dings)</i>

396
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,417
I... I have to

397
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:34,219
call the office,

398
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,688
but I want to talk to you about that.

399
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,134
Okay?

400
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,452
All right. Thank you.

401
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:51,480
Hi. I'm looking at her.

402
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:54,984
<i>They have my baby.</i>

403
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,153
<i>No. I haven't said a word.</i>

404
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,388
But I'm telling you, it's her.

405
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:03,259
Please do whatever you need to do

406
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:04,894
so I can take her home.

407
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,229
Please.

408
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,961
Aloha.

409
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:23,912
I'm over at Loco Nuts today.

410
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,114
How'd the morning go?

411
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:26,949
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

412
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:29,085
You wouldn't happen to have
any napkins or something?

413
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,719
Yeah.

414
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,188
You should get some of these.

415
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,189
And some rubber gloves.

416
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,959
Pretty much what you imagine.

417
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:39,729
(Groans)

418
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:41,998
So how do you know Ty?

419
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,967
He and my brother were stationed
in the same unit in Kabul.

420
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,935
Oh.

421
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:49,605
What was it like over there?
I keep trying to ask Ty,

422
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,806
but I'm never sure if it's okay.

423
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,792
Yeah, they don't talk much about it.

424
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,510
I could never get much out of Justin.

425
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:55,678
- That's your brother?
- Yeah.

426
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:56,679
Is he still over there?

427
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:58,581
No no. He came home last spring.

428
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,850
But he had a hard time
and he didn't make it.

429
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,652
What do you mean?

430
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:05,788
He killed himself.

431
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,625
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

432
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,461
I go to this support group with my mom.

433
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:14,764
I guess a lot of guys have
a hard time coming back.

434
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm so sorry.

435
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:18,668
Thanks.

436
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:21,504
But that's why Ty kind of looks out for me.

437
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:23,372
He's a really good guy.

438
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,742
You guys have fun tonight.

439
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,868
Oh, hey.

440
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,871
I thought we were gonna go swimming.

441
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:44,007
Oh, I stopped by Angelo's

442
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,009
and had lunch with my mom.

443
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,010
That's nice.

444
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,912
- (Chuckles)
- (Exhales)

445
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:49,979
What are you doing?

446
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,816
Oh! I'm just looking
at these catering menus.

447
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,585
What do you think?

448
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,722
Bacon wrapped asparagus too
fancy for a barbeque side dish?

449
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:02,492
I'd probably just stick to the classics.

450
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:05,461
Corn on the cob, baked beans.

451
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:07,530
Yeah. You're right.

452
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,598
Then you can go...

453
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,866
Both: Fancy for dessert.

454
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,535
(Chuckles)

455
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,404
Oh! Oh.

456
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,472
What do you think about this?

457
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:18,374
<i>- That's cute.
- Yeah?</i>

458
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:22,612
So you wouldn't mind if I got you one?

459
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,714
Oh no. I'm fine in shorts.

460
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,617
Well, this is for something special.

461
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:31,688
I signed us up for the
mother-daughter tournament at the club.

462
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:34,490
We're not ready for that.

463
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:38,228
We just had a bad day.

464
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,697
Our first match is with Lisa and Shauna.

465
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,532
They're really good.

466
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,368
Lisa's good. Shauna chokes.

467
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:46,402
We can beat them.

468
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,404
Kathryn...

469
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,572
We just have to communicate better.

470
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,241
We can work on that.

471
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,343
It'll be fun.

472
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:55,445
Honey,

473
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,180
don't worry.

474
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,381
And we're gonna look great.

475
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,192
Okay, so we have a
misogynistic horror film,

476
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,145
some rom com that's
gonna make hate ourselves,

477
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,163
or a brain-dead comedy.

478
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm up for the comedy.

479
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,968
Okay.

480
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,408
Oh man.

481
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,910
Been a while?

482
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,077
Mm.

483
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:30,213
I've just had way too
much mac and cheese lately.

484
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:33,049
What's that like living on an army base?

485
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,851
I just picture it's like summer camp

486
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,119
but everybody's yelling
at you all the time.

487
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,021
It's not that bad.

488
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:40,990
Fort Powell's pretty nice, actually.

489
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,159
But it's kind of like
living at work, you know?

490
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:45,795
Which for me would be

491
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,764
sleeping in a gigantic tiki head.

492
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,799
(Chuckles)

493
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,836
It's just until they move
me somewhere else anyway.

494
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,838
So who knows what's next?

495
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,777
Uh, so Mary Beth was
filling me in a little bit

496
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,846
on your whole overseas thing.

497
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,648
Yeah?

498
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:06,950
Yeah, I mean, what she knew.

499
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,585
Which isn't much.

500
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,522
<i>She told me about Justin.</i>

501
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:16,960
Do you know what happened?

502
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:19,629
I mean, he made it home and then...

503
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,436
I don't know.

504
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,573
Um, he just couldn't
deal I guess, you know?

505
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,509
I'm gonna get some more napkins.

506
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,711
We should pick a movie, okay?

507
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,320
Hey, dad. You have a second?

508
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:45,388
<i>Yeah.</i>

509
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:48,374
You sure about that?

510
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:49,625
(Chuckles)

511
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,544
Yeah, you know, I'm just
trying to make sense of this

512
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,629
homestead tax relief bill.

513
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,331
Ooh.

514
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,333
Well, I can't help you with that,

515
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:59,435
but I can make your life
easier in another way.

516
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,304
And how much is that gonna cost me?

517
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,539
You mean, how much is it going to save you?

518
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,425
You need a new manager for the car wash.

519
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:06,576
I need a higher paying job.

520
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,078
Hire me as your manager.

521
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:11,247
We solve both of our problems.

522
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,149
Are you serious?

523
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,318
Check this out.

524
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:17,220
Now if you cut certain fixed costs

525
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,023
and raise your marketing
budget by just five percent,

526
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:21,391
you could increase your bottom line revenue

527
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,326
- anywhere from like...
- Whoa whoa whoa.

528
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,095
So are you telling me you put
all this together yourself?

529
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,397
Yeah.

530
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,266
It's just dollars and cents.
It's not particle physics.

531
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,003
Toby, you understand
manager is a full-time job.

532
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,204
I'm getting married now.

533
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,074
Ah. Well,

534
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,076
you know, your mother
and I are more than happy

535
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,277
to pitch in and help pay for this thing.

536
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:43,179
I know. And I appreciate that.

537
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:45,948
But Nikki is not wild about
taking money from you guys,

538
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:47,083
and honestly, neither am I.

539
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,152
Not if I can work for it.

540
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:51,954
You don't have to say yes tonight.

541
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:54,723
But let me at least show
you some of my ideas,

542
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:56,859
and you can think about it.

543
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,766
<i>Bay: Is it possible to
get herpes from a movie?</i>

544
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,134
'Cause they should have been giving out

545
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,837
brain condoms in the lobby.

546
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,912
Stop sign's not gonna turn green.

547
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:17,580
Are you okay?

548
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,882
Hmm?

549
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:21,818
Yeah.

550
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:24,854
'Cause you haven't really said much.

551
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,793
Um, I just...

552
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,463
I don't really feel like talking right now.

553
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,464
Is that okay?

554
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,731
Yeah.

555
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:36,732
Yeah. Of course.

556
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:41,504
Hey, you're cold.

557
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:43,372
- Here.
- I'm fine.

558
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,373
No, it's okay.

559
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:48,611
What's this?

560
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:52,715
Yeah, that.

561
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:55,518
When did you get this?

562
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,555
There was a...

563
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,524
this tattoo guy in Kabul

564
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:03,643
and a lot of the guys went, so.

565
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,597
It's not what it looks like.

566
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,398
Looks a lot like my poster.

567
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,076
I'm not freaking out or anything.

568
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,179
I'm just... surprised.

569
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,185
So when exactly did...

570
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,403
<i>(Car horn honks)</i>

571
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:33,055
Yes. Okay.

572
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,090
I'm going.

573
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,390
On the one hand there's Travis

574
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:51,977
who I have to say has really
stepped up and proven himself.

575
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,946
And on the other hand, there's Toby.

576
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,281
Who's your son.

577
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,083
I'm well aware of that fact.

578
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:00,919
You know, I'm just thinking

579
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:04,373
will Travis ever have
another opportunity like this?

580
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:08,977
Are you gonna hire an interpreter?

581
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:10,145
I mean, I hate to bring it up,

582
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,947
but it is a real question.

583
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,115
You think I have to?

584
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,050
He's not as oral as Daphne.

585
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,818
I mean, how is he gonna interact

586
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:19,137
with the dealership reps,
the vendors, the crew.

587
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:21,123
He's done pretty good so far.

588
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:24,760
Honey, he still has one
more year of school left.

589
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:26,962
I mean, what, is he gonna quit school

590
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,997
come fall just to keep this job?

591
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:32,067
Sounds to me like you think
Toby's the man for the job.

592
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:33,968
I don't know. I'm just
weighing the pros and cons

593
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:35,136
of each young man.

594
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,906
I mean, obviously Toby could handle it.

595
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,108
Is this really what we want for Toby?

596
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,109
To manage a car wash?

597
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:42,878
It's not forever.

598
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,614
Famous last words.

599
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,716
You know what I'm thinking?

600
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,551
If I give Travis the job,

601
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:50,886
I might be doing Toby a favor.

602
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,039
Isn't that what your
father tried to do to you?

603
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,241
<i>Impose his will on you for your own good?</i>

604
00:25:57,377 --> 00:25:59,008
I am not my father.

605
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,161
And job or no job, I will
always be in Toby's corner.

606
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:05,925
What about Travis?

607
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,437
Who does he have in his corner?

608
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:24,205
(sighs) Looks like I'm getting
over the whole early morning thing.

609
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,810
I heard you coming late last night?

610
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:29,595
Uh yeah, I went out after work.

611
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,546
Yeah, I got the text. Work friends?

612
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,889
No, uh... Ty, actually.

613
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,215
Ty... Mendoza?

614
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,725
- Wait, he's back?
- Yep.

615
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:44,112
Is he okay? Is he in one piece?

616
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,480
Yeah.

617
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,017
But... ?

618
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,020
I found out he had this friend

619
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,088
who made it back with him,

620
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:55,923
and then he killed himself.

621
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,025
<i>Which is awful,</i>

622
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,961
and I can't stop thinking about it.

623
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:03,097
And how's Ty?

624
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,200
I don't know.

625
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:08,202
He kind of overreacted

626
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,038
to this thing that happened the other day

627
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:11,939
and every time I try to talk to him

628
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:15,143
about anything beyond "what
movie do you want to see?"

629
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,078
He just shuts down.

630
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,070
Maybe he doesn't want to lay it on you.

631
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,039
He got this tattoo.

632
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,307
It's of my artwork.

633
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,042
- Really?
- Yeah.

634
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,177
So now I'm like half worried about him

635
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,913
and then I'm half freaked out
that he's like obsessed with me.

636
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,949
Does he seem obsessed?

637
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,016
No.

638
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,853
But I broke up with him

639
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,956
on the phone in the middle of
whatever he was going through.

640
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,124
<i>(Cellphone rings)</i>

641
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,994
It's Angelo.

642
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:44,995
Go ahead. Take it.

643
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,780
One second.

644
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,064
<i>(Ringing continues)</i>

645
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,867
Hey.

646
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,735
How's Atlanta?

647
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,070
<i>Angelo: Virginia, actually.</i>

648
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,838
<i>I thought the baby was in Atlanta?</i>

649
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,006
Wasn't her.

650
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,708
She's with a different family.

651
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,710
I saw her yesterday.

652
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,044
How did it go?

653
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,780
<i>I was not allowed to talk to them.</i>

654
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,882
I have to wait for all these lawyers

655
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,683
and adoption agencies.

656
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:10,020
And um...

657
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:11,054
how did you do it?

658
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,990
Do what?

659
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,092
<i>That day when you saw Bay.</i>

660
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,632
How did you keep yourself from
grabbing her right then and there

661
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,766
and take her home?

662
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,805
Sometimes I wish I had.

663
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,047
(Gasps)

664
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,050
Want to tell me why
you're following my family?

665
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,022

Oh!

677
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,460
Game.

678
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,529
<i>First set miner and
miner. Six games to one.</i>

679
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,482
<i>- Thanks, baby.
- (Chuckling)</i>

680
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,600
- Good one.
- Good shot.

681
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,568
I told you she was going down the middle.

682
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,537
Did you not see the sign?

683
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,788
I thought she was going wide.

684
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,540
You should have had that one.

685
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,677
Look,

686
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,480
I know it's hard without Regina.

687
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,482
But I'd appreciate it

688
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,351
if you didn't take it out on me.

689
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,319
She left because of you.

690
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:52,522
Regina left on her own.

691
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,726
I can't make that woman do anything.

692
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,629
(Exhales)

693
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,731
Can we just have one minute?

694
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,333
Yeah. Come on.

695
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,634
Look.

696
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:07,437
I miss Bay.

697
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,357
But I don't blame you.

698
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,342
You shouldn't have signed us up

699
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,694
for a tournament that we're not ready for.

700
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,662
Well, at least I'm trying.

701
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,280
Which is more than you.

702
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:19,499
A week ago, you'd have been diving

703
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,617
to return those shots

704
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,221
instead of standing there yelling at me.

705
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,223
Take some responsibility.

706
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:42,227
I'm here to see Tyler Mendoza.

707
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:43,328
<i>Private, maybe?</i>

708
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:50,169
(Sighs)

709
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:54,973
Thank you.

710
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:07,186
Ty, hey.

711
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,170
Regina.

712
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,171
What are you doing here?

713
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:10,956
I thought I'd come by.

714
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,925
Welcome you back.

715
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:16,862
Hiding out here without telling anybody.

716
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,864
Yeah, I was...

717
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,032
I was gonna get around to that.

718
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:23,769
So I looked up online what to bring you.

719
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:25,838
It says the number one thing you guys like

720
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:27,072
are those awful protein bars.

721
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,106
(Chuckles) Thank you.

722
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:29,908
This is really nice.

723
00:31:29,943 --> 00:31:31,043
You're welcome.

724
00:31:33,012 --> 00:31:36,949
So, this is where you
do your whole army thing.

725
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,751
Whatever that is.

726
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,954
Well, they've got me on motor pool.

727
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:44,957
So if you ever need somebody
who can fix a Humvee,

728
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:47,726
- I'm your guy.
- Ahh.

729
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,894
You look good.

730
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:58,837
Yep. There it is.

731
00:31:58,855 --> 00:31:59,938
You heard about that, huh?

732
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,574
I heard a lot of stuff.

733
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:04,643
You okay?

734
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:06,478
I'm fine.

735
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:08,580
Really. Everybody can just relax.

736
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:11,450
Well, you got some Vasquez women concerned.

737
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,719
You want us to relax, don't shut us out.

738
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:16,455
Yeah.

739
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:17,789
Yeah, okay. You're right.

740
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:19,658
I got it.

741
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,760
But...

742
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:24,463
you know, not everybody comes back damaged.

743
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,431
Maybe.

744
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,667
But I bet all of you come back changed.

745
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:34,506
You heard I went to rehab, right?

746
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,842
Bay mentioned something, yeah.

747
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,510
You know how that happened?

748
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,580
Thinking I could handle everything

749
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,682
all by myself.

750
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:47,753
And I am a lot tougher than you are.

751
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:56,245
Uh, guys, can we gather around please?

752
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,433
Okay, I got a few things to say.

753
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:05,571
First of all, I'm really sorry
that I've been away so much.

754
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,540
I know that it's been
hard since we lost Frank.

755
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,509
But...

756
00:33:10,543 --> 00:33:12,277
as of today,

757
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,512
we have a new Frank.

758
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,631
Okay, he's young.

759
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:17,449
He understands the business.

760
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,384
So I expect each and every one of you

761
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,520
to show him a lot of respect.

762
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:24,189
Okay?

763
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:25,257
Toby,

764
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,525
congratulations.

765
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,143
<i>(Applause)</i>

766
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,163
Thanks, guys.

767
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:32,331
Thanks.

768
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,234
Well, let's get back to work.

769
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:37,586
You heard the man. Back to work.

770
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:41,074
Hey hey.

771
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,076
Um...

772
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:44,494
look, I'm really sorry.

773
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:47,447
It was a tough decision for me.

774
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:50,083
But with you going back to school...

775
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:52,984
__

776
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,072
Hey.

777
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,140
How were the games?

778
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:15,976
Well, I managed successfully

779
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,111
to part some people away from their money.

780
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,179
So yay for me.

781
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:22,916
Glazed almond?

782
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,985
Oh, no thanks.

783
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,188
Err... okay.

784
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,328
You don't have to look at me like that.

785
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:35,929
Like what?

786
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,832
Like I'm gonna go off or something.

787
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:44,972
Well, you have been kind
of unpredictable lately.

788
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:47,074
I know.

789
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:49,009
I'm working on it.

790
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:55,716
Well, I'm gonna stop
asking prying questions

791
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,817
if that helps.

792
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:59,720
You can ask.

793
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:02,789
I may not always have an answer for you.

794
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,727
Why did Justin kill himself?

795
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,033
I don't know.

796
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,738
Do you ever feel the same way?

797
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:19,740
No.

798
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:26,747
I mean...

799
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:30,951
we saw some stuff, okay?

800
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:34,755
But I think it bothered him more than me.

801
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:41,828
I sometimes think about random things.

802
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:44,031
Just like...

803
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:46,667
dead dogs that we would
see lying in the road

804
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:50,704
or some kid's stuffed rabbit
in the street, you know?

805
00:35:56,744 --> 00:36:00,447
This one time when we were
driving the tank back to base,

806
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:03,617
we were handing stuff out to the kids.

807
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:05,452
They would come up to us
and we were just giving them

808
00:36:05,486 --> 00:36:08,488
like soap bubbles or gum. Stuff like that.

809
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:11,758
And that day I had this soccer ball.

810
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:15,595
So I'm looking around
for who to give it to,

811
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,397
and all these boys are running up

812
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,565
and they're reaching out for it

813
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,633
saying "me me. Give it to me."

814
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:24,404
But I see this girl standing there.

815
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:28,375
And she's just looking at the tank.

816
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,377
It was the one with your poster on it.

817
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:31,545
And... (Chuckles)

818
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,814
she just, uh... she does the pose.

819
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:35,615
(Chuckles)

820
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,801
Total badass, right?

821
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:39,786
<i>So I said "hey."</i>

822
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:41,421
And I tossed the ball to her.

823
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:42,622
Nice.

824
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:45,459
Yeah. And all the boys,

825
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,427
they were trying to take it away from her,

826
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:49,429
but she hangs onto it.

827
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,565
And the next day

828
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,400
there's this field by the base

829
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:54,568
where all the kids play,

830
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:56,403
and she shows up with the soccer ball.

831
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:58,605
But none of the boys are letting her play.

832
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,374
And we're yelling to them,

833
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:04,544
"guys, let her play.
You gotta let her play."

834
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,546
Finally they back down

835
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:10,484
and she starts to play, and she's amazing.

836
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:12,352
I mean, you should have seen it.

837
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:13,487
A real hammer girl.

838
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,355
Yeah.

839
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,329
And then...

840
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:25,298
this guy shows up and...

841
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,467
when he sees her playing,

842
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,136
he like flips out.

843
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,505
<i>And, uh... </i>

844
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:34,107
he starts screaming at the boys

845
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:36,276
and he's screaming at us, and he grabs her,

846
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,410
drags her off the field.

847
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:39,279
What did you do?

848
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:40,514
We couldn't do anything.

849
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,382
The interpreter said it was her Uncle.

850
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,351
And that makes it okay?

851
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:46,253
That's just how it is.

852
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:52,159
<i>What happened to her?</i>

853
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:57,230
I don't know.

854
00:37:57,265 --> 00:38:00,066
We never saw her again.

855
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:02,235
I asked around.

856
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,404
This one guy told me I didn't want to know.

857
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,543
Bad stuff happens to girls over there.

858
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:14,080
Like really bad.

859
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:16,449
That's when I got the tattoo.

860
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:19,419
I don't know, I just thought it would

861
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:23,323
keep her spirit alive or something.

862
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:34,773
You're back already?

863
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:37,576
Sorry I didn't call.

864
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,745
<i>Well, I would have picked
you up at the airport.</i>

865
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,719
I'm guessing things didn't go well?

866
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:48,671
It wasn't her.

867
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:51,523
I was so sure when I saw her.

868
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:56,595

- She's out.</i>

870

You know obviously we will
go back to the house tonight.

871
00:39:06,806 --> 00:39:08,524
No no no no.

872
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:09,942
Please stay.

873
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,814
I'd like my family with me.

874
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:30,696
Hi.

875
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,698
It smells good.

876
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:35,801
It's your recipe.

877
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:40,839
Can I help?

878
00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:44,576

880
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:53,919
Our tennis needs work,

881
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:56,622
but we're gonna rule at doubles lasagna.

882

(Chuckles)

883

We'll get them next time.

884
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:04,763
Yeah.

885
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,035
How come there's so much stuff left over?

886
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:14,039
Oh, the recipe makes two pans.

887
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:15,774
Oh.

888
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,810
We're gonna be eating lasagna for a week.

890
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:24,783
I wonder what Bay and
Regina are eating tonight.

891
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:27,019
Cereal.

892
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:30,622
Do you think

893
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:33,058
that they're ready for some real food?

894
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,627
I'll get the other pan.

895
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:42,751
Perfect.

What is this thing you guys are doing?

902
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:57,716
It's called bachata. It's
from Dominican Republic.

903
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,884
And you have to do it.

904

I did not inherit the dance gene.

905

We're all just going to have
to accept that and move on.
