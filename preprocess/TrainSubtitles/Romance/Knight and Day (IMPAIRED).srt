1
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:56,092
{Welcome to mid continent airport}
{convenient, friendly, affordable, fright less}

2
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:09,442
{BOSTON DELAYED}

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,729
- Excuse Me
- Sorry

4
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,776
So I'm goanna make it on to
the earlier flight, right?

5
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,158
Are you goanna check that?

6
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,530
Oh. No, I'm goanna carry it on.

7
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,989
It's got valuables in it.

8
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,412
- Here
- Thank you

9
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,474
- God! Excuse me
- No, I'm sorry...

10
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,031
My bag is a little heavy.

11
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:58,238
I was looking at my phone.
I hate it when people do that.

12
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:05,448
You have a little...

13
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,220
...smudge

14
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,414
What are these?

15
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:23,781
Those are two barrelled carburettors
for a Pontiac tri-power.

16
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,987
Those are exhaust tubes for a '74 Z-28.

17
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,704
I restore old cars, so...

18
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,585
Hair dryer

19
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,090
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry...

20
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,091
{LAUGHS}

21
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,504
- This is getting to be a habit
- Yea

22
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:58,869
Sorry about that.

23
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,680
- Here
- Sure

24
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:06,659
- Boston?
- Yeah

25
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,513
Gate 20

26
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:11,433
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Gracia.

27
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,362
Hello

28
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,946
I'm sorry, you're not
on this flight.

29
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:19,124
Well, I just checked in for
this one 10 minutes ago.

30
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,590
It must be some sort of mistake.

31
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,703
I'm sorry, the computer
shows that we're booked.

32
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,411
Listen Sherry.

33
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:27,418
Tomorrow my little sister is getting married.
I practically raised her...

34
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:29,566
I'm sorry, we are completely filled out.

35
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:34,434
Listen, can you help me out for a second?
She's my little sister. She's April and I'm June.

36
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,335
That's very sweet.

37
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:41,014
But the 11:50 will get you there by
tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

38
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,166
Your boarding pass, sir?

39
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,719
Sometimes things happen for a reason.

40
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:50,724
Thank you.

41
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:06,384
I should've seen it coming, boss.
It came undone.

42
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,565
Coming undone in our business
means you need a margherita.

43
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:11,655
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people
in a government lab and blowing it up.

44
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:14,219
It doesn't mean stealing an
object of critical importance.

45
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,947
Does he have the zephyr or not?

46
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,096
We believe so.

47
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,507
Uh, "you believe so".

48
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:23,406
I don't care what you believe, Fitz
I need you to clear...

49
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,175
- Put it back on.
- fix this. I want the Zephyr

50
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,085
We'll have it in hand by the
time he lands in Boston.

51
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,494
Find out who and what she is.

52
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,896
Should I just pick her up in Wichita?

53
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,507
No. I got a better idea.

54
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,455
Miss Havens.

55
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,176
We did find a seat for you.

56
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,328
MOVEMENT ALERT

57
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:02,708
Oh Fitz. What did you do?

58
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:09,402
No wonder these airlines
are going out of business.

59
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,330
There's nobody on the plane.

60
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,287
<i>The captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

61
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:27,598
<i>Please remain seated until the sign has been
turned off, and it's safe to move about the cabin.</i>

62
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,484
I'm June, by the way.

63
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,666
I'm Roy Miller.

64
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,354
- Nice to meet you
- It's very nice to meet you

65
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,891
- Tequila on the rocks?
- Yea, just in time. Thanks.

66
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,411
So your sister's getting married tomorrow?

67
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,479
Excuse me?

68
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,750
Your sister is getting married
tomorrow. Congratulations.

69
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:51,642
Yea, thanks.

70
00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:00,258
- You know, I'm a bad liar
- I'm sorry. How's that?

71
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:04,253
April is getting married,
but not until Saturday.

72
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,087
You had me fooled.

73
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,996
But, I do have a fitting tomorrow
so I do actually have to go home.

74
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,379
Hope this isn't goanna be a rough flight.

75
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:25,373
It might be.

76
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:31,145
You know, Wichita is a long
way to go for a carburettor.

77
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,968
It's not just any carburettor.
It is a triple deuce.

78
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:38,713
I am restoring a 66 GTO and
Kansas has the best scrap.

79
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,702
Really?

80
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,107
My dad had a garage, and when I
was a kid, he bought this chassis.

81
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,520
He used to take us to go
out and search for parts.

82
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:53,062
He died in '98 and now that
April's getting married,

83
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,943
I just figured, why not finish it up and
give it to her as a wedding present.

84
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,832
Kind of like a present from my
my dad too, you know?

85
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:02,935
- That's nice
- Yea...

86
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:18,100
I used to think that... someday

87
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,107
...when the last part went in.

88
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,814
I would just climb into that GTO,
and start it up

89
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:32,555
Just drive and drive and keep driving
until I got to the tip of South America.

90
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:37,454
- Cape Horn
- Yea

91
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:40,345
- It is beautiful how it still is
- Yes?

92
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,023
Pirate Islands.

93
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,746
- "Some day" is a dangerous word
- Dangerous?

94
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,263
It is really just a code for...

95
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,608
...never

96
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,505
I think a lot about the
things I haven't done

97
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:04,337
Diving the Great Barrier Reef...
Ride the Orient Express...

98
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,079
Travelling along the Amalfi Coast with
nothing but a motorcycle and a backpack.

99
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,796
Kissing a stranger on the balcony of
the Hotel Du Caps.

100
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,694
- Where is that?
- South of France

101
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,717
What about you?

102
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,258
What's your list?

103
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,287
Yours sounds pretty good.

104
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,883
- Thanks
- No problem

105
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,531
I'll just put this up here.
Is that all right?

106
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:52,126
You know, I'm goanna go back
and use the restroom.

107
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:55,476
I'll help you.

108
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,923
Thanks.

109
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,621
Turbulence, huh?

110
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:13,333
I'll be out in a minute.

111
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:27,884
A strange in the balcony of Hotel Du Caps?
What kind of line is that?

112
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,566
It's a really good line.

113
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:50,885
Did you see his hands?
By any chance?

114
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,766
They just snatched the bag right of the air.
Lightning fast reflexes.

115
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,345
Not cool

116
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,842
Obrigado!

117
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,819
Game's over, Roy...

118
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,614
Really?

119
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,757
Where's the zephyr?

120
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:07,472
Why is the girl on the plane?
Tell me.

121
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:10,441
Why did Fitz, put her on the plane?
Tell me.

122
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,348
Don't move, Miller.

123
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,888
So what are you goanna do?

124
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,841
Are you goanna let this opportunity
pass you by? No, of course not!

125
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,737
You're goanna walk right through that door.
You're goanna get right up on this.

126
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,456
It is not your first rodeo, woman.

127
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,441
I decided to join you.

128
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:26,446
Sorry...

129
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,233
It's okay

130
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:34,007
- It's that tequila
- Do not worry

131
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,051
My God, you're in a relationship.
I'm so sorry.

132
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,846
No, that's not it.

133
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,824
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

134
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:49,393
- Are we landing?
- No, not yet

135
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:57,269
Listen, there's no need to panic,
I have contained the situation.

136
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:01,147
- situation?
- Uh, yea...

137
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,766
- We've lost the pilots
- Where did they go?

138
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,483
- I mean they're dead
- The pilots are dead?

139
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,444
- Shot, yes.
- They were shot?

140
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,246
By whom?

141
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:25,187
I did, actually I shot the first pilot
and he shot the second pilot accidentally...

142
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,921
It's just one of those things.

143
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,149
Seriously... that's just great.

144
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,849
Really, I'm relieved you're
taking this so well.

145
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,600
Where are you going?

146
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:04,508
I have to check out things, think about landing
Would you mind putting your seat belt on for me?

147
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,651
This is weird.

148
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,840
- What's happening?
- Oh, hello

149
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:43,790
Sit down.

150
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:45,845
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

151
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:48,631
Everybody's dead in here...
Oh my god!

152
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,550
- Sorry?
- We're going down

153
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:54,345
Sure, this is a rapid descent.
Please, sit down.

154
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:58,091
- Sorry
- Are you a pilot?

155
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,146
- Who are you?
- Shoulder straps

156
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:05,746
Secure it right down there.
Right there.

157
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,818
You're done?
Here we go now.

158
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,426
Why can't we just land
at an airport?

159
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:18,403
No, no. That wouldn't be a good idea.
They'll be waiting for us.

160
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,364
What do you mean, waiting for us?
Who?

161
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,312
I think, the less you know the better.

162
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:24,014
What?

163
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,932
Ok, we're goanna have to pitch down here.

164
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:38,439
That's a truck!

165
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,096
Close, close!

166
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,779
God!

167
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,736
- This is good
- What's good?

168
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,594
Take a little sip of that.
It'll take the edge off.

169
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:37,025
- Are you shot?
- Yea, just a little scrape

170
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,129
That's good news.

171
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:45,678
June, we have to discuss
what's goanna happen next.

172
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:48,551
You need to go to the hospital,
and prison maybe.

173
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,564
There's people who'll come
looking for you now. Bad people.

174
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,481
I feel a little weird

175
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,465
Oh yea, that will pass when you fall asleep,
which should be a couple of minutes.

176
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,980
- What?
- I need you to listen, June

177
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,208
- Did you drug me?
- Yes

178
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,907
- You drugged me
- Yes, for your own good

179
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:08,719
These bad people who are going to come and
see you, they're goanna ask you about me.

180
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,727
You need to tell them that
you don't know me. June?

181
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,544
You need to tell them you
don't remember anything...

182
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,459
...and you need to avoid getting into
any vehicle with them at all costs.

183
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:20,466
- Wait. Who are them?
- Serious people, June.

184
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,230
They'll probably identify themselves as
federal agents, and they'll DIP you.

185
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,082
Dip me? In what?

186
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:32,009
Disinformation Protocol. They'll tell you a story about me,
about how I am mentally unstable, paranoid...

187
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,657
I'm violent and dangerous and
it'll all sound very convincing.

188
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,443
I am already convinced.

189
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,585
Here's a few common DIP
cue words to listen for:

190
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:47,165
Reassuring words. Words like
stabilized secure, safe.

191
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,250
If they say these words
particularly with repetition,

192
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,908
- ...it means they're going to kill you
- Oh, God!

193
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:56,692
...or intern you somewhere
offshore for a very long time.

194
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,672
Stay with me.

195
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,512
- If they say you're safe...
- They're goanna kill me

196
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:05,567
- Do not get in what?
- Vehicles

197
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:08,420
Any vehicles. You know?
Just run.

198
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,274
- I'm run
- Run

199
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,204
And if they ask you about me...

200
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,144
I don't know you.

201
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,965
I don't know you at all
Who are you...?

202
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,866
<i>Eat a good breakfast, June</i>

203
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:11,645
<i>...Back to our top news story of the morning...</i>

204
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:15,707
<i>According to the FAA, approximately
at 7:30 last night...</i>

205
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:20,395
<i>All passengers died when
the aircraft suffered turbulence.</i>

206
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:24,488
<i>The plane was passing through an area of
turbulence and may have been affected by...</i>

207
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,515
<i>...wind-shear or lightning storm
causing an electrical failure.</i>

208
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,104
<i>Now this is all pre-conjecture,
and all that's left of the plane...</i>

209
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,833
I'm coming!

210
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,986
Remember, do not tell anyone

211
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,050
Rodney?

212
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,505
Oh, thank God.

213
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,532
I wanted to make sure
were all okay.

214
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,231
Why?

215
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,413
- You were on that flight from Kansas, right?
- Yea

216
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:49,305
- I saw on the news about the crash
- What news? What crash?

217
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:52,954
- Anyway, you're alive
- I'm alive. Yes.

218
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:59,839
June... I told myself that if
I found you alive, that...

219
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:04,527
- I was goanna ask you to dinner
- How about I call you later, okay?

220
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,101
It's just another day.
It's just a normal day.

221
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,824
She's moving.

222
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,489
- Wow... and I gotta love the boots
- Yea.. I know

223
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,505
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.

224
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,262
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yea

225
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:41,148
- So, this weekend. I was thinking about dad's GTO
- Really?

226
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:47,689
I was sitting there and I was wondering how
you'd feel about maybe selling it.

227
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,542
You wanna sell dad's GTO?

228
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:55,439
- Ben and I. We really want our own place
- Excuse me

229
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,279
Anyone here belong to that
blue truck parked outside?

230
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,224
Yea, why?

231
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:00,406
You're about to get a ticket.

232
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,940
Forget to put enough
quarters or something.

233
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,188
I hate getting tickets.

234
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,002
Oh, excuse me.

235
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:14,542
Please step inside miss.

236
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,682
I'll just go grab a few things.

237
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:21,496
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent Charles Fitzgerald.

238
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:23,473
Will you join us inside
the car for a moment?

239
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:27,066
We know you were on the
flight with him last night.

240
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:28,997
The one that crashed.

241
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,723
Who are you again?

242
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:34,885
FBI.

243
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:38,793
- You do know Mr. Miller
- No, I don't

244
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:48,310
Well, we chatted a little bit
before we passed through security.

245
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,137
I see.

246
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:54,016
And once you were on the plane,
What happened then? More chatting?

247
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:56,811
- Is this funny to you?
- No

248
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,856
He's dangerous Miss. Havens, and out of control.

249
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:05,590
- He said that you'd say he was crazy
- So you did talk to him

250
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,634
And what about me?

251
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:09,537
No, not you specifically.

252
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:13,335
About whom then... Simon Feck?

253
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:16,231
I don't know who that is.

254
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:22,343
Look this is getting really twisted around
and I think I should probably call a lawyer.

255
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:32,568
We're goanna take you to a secure location,
until agents can have Mr. Miller contained...

256
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:35,295
...some place safe.

257
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,379
- With you?
- Yes, ma'am

258
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,964
You wanna tell me where we're going?

259
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:52,698
Fellas?

260
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,629
Do not worry, you're safe.

261
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:58,432
- Excuse me?
- You're safe with us

262
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,229
I wanna know where we're going.

263
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:04,166
It is just a shortcut until the situation
is stabilized, to keep you safe.

264
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,153
You said that already.

265
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,779
Because, I meant it.

266
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,938
What is Jackson doing?

267
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,578
Shooter, shooter!
Get down! Get down!

268
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,228
Shooter on the freeway.

269
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:19,620
The dot is on your back.

270
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,478
Follow me now!

271
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,965
Are you insane?
I'm not going out that door.

272
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,763
God!

273
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,917
- Hey June
- I can't see

274
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:00,919
- Get out of the way
- Open the door

275
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,692
Open the door June...

276
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:05,509
Beautiful dress, by the way.

277
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:08,649
Wait a second.

278
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,244
Who are you?

279
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,209
What are you doing?

280
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,867
- Hey June
- What are you doing?

281
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,881
Please unlock the door.

282
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,510
Unlock the door, that way
I can help you.

283
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,140
June, door...

284
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:27,237
Just pull over!

285
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,973
Oh my god!

286
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:29,974
{Screams}

287
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,746
C'mon over here...

288
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:43,579
You're doing good.

289
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:47,084
Hold this.

290
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:49,341
Well, well, well!
Check this out.

291
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,204
Nice.

292
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:58,025
These guys load the barrel.
You're doing well June. Excellent driving.

293
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,903
Beautiful dress
Is it for the wedding on Saturday?

294
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:05,593
- Uh-huh
- Yea, that'll be nice

295
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:15,168
Please... stop shooting
people, okay?

296
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,088
I understand, you're in charge.

297
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:22,928
You stay here while I go have a word
with the guys in the truck. Okay?

298
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:24,973
- Okay
- Okay?

299
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:29,612
Actually I'm just goanna go
shoot them, and I'll be right back.

300
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:35,044
By the way, your timing, when
you opened that door was sublime.

301
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:37,347
You saved us, I hope you know that.

302
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:38,880
You saved us.

303
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:13,946
Hey, wait!

304
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:21,544
Wait!

305
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,893
There you are.

306
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,008
June?

307
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:13,359
Rodney?

308
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:17,267
Hey.

309
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,216
What are you doing here?

310
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,904
Hey guys, say hello to June.

311
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:25,912
- That's some dress
- Thanks

312
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,746
- Everything all right?
- Yes

313
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:28,801
No, it's...

314
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,741
It's complicated.

315
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:32,697
You know what?

316
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:34,512
I've been feeling the same way.

317
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:37,331
You wanna talk? Maybe over some pie.

318
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,889
My point is...

319
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,228
My point is, that plane crash
made me think about our breakup.

320
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:48,222
You know this bell went off. Like "Bing"

321
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,604
Rodney, why have you given up?
You're being passive.

322
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,620
Getting back at her because she
didn't want the ring.

323
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,714
June does not want to be engaged right now
and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!

324
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:59,460
What about all the things you and June
wanted to do together, huh?

325
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:03,301
Our list, camping in Vermont,
with my brother and Sheila

326
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:04,566
Tickets to the Blue Man Group...

327
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,018
I wanna talk about
the plane crash. Okay?

328
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,956
- Sure. What about it?
- I was on it

329
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:13,386
I mean in it. I was in... it

330
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:15,767
So you were in the plane crash?

331
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:18,783
I wasn't supposed to be on it, but I was
and there was this guy who was...

332
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:22,433
Some sort of like secret
agent or something and he...

333
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:28,139
He killed everybody on board
and then he landed the plane

334
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:30,914
Next thing you know.
I wake up. I'm in my room.

335
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,200
I have no idea how I got there.

336
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,120
He must've drugged me or something.

337
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,927
And then I go to April's wedding cuz
I had to wear this ridiculous dress

338
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,425
And then these other guys,
these other agents come.

339
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,166
They snatch me off. Next thing you know,

340
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,714
I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the I-93.
Why're you touching my hand?

341
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:44,029
Because I'm here for you

342
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:46,804
- Geez, you are so stressed out
- Yea

343
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,979
And I get it, I completely understand
I mean...

344
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:51,250
- Wow, June!
- I know...

345
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:54,184
Your little sister is getting
married and that is stressful.

346
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,459
What are you talking about, Rodney?

347
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,009
You didn't even listen to
what I was talking about.

348
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:00,888
I would be the same way
in this situation.

349
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:02,771
What can I do to help?

350
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:04,644
- We can bring the guys over...
- No, no, no, no, no...

351
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:06,803
Christ...

352
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:08,592
Hi June.

353
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:12,291
Look, I'm sorry if I'm
interrupt anything but...

354
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,412
I'm Roy Miller.

355
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:17,293
Rodney Burst.

356
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:20,086
We're running out of time, and...

357
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,777
Maybe I didn't make it
clear enough,

358
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:26,812
but we're goanna have to stick
together because of our...

359
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,016
...situation

360
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,640
In case you didn't notice, Rodney
is a fireman so he's perfectly capable

361
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:36,444
of handling any situation that
comes up, thank you very much.

362
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,910
- You can leave us alone.
- I have no doubt.

363
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:43,167
Ever since I was a little kid, I've
had a great respect for firemen

364
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:46,019
And the fact of the matter is, I
don't think you guys get paid enough

365
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:49,093
- You're an engine tech?
- Yea, engine tech.

366
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:52,055
- Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet?
- Yea, we're goanna

367
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:55,714
- How's that going?
- It's a bitch

368
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,542
Do you have a do
a tour of that hall...

369
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,407
That's where the action is...

370
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:03,374
- Rodney...
- House of flames

371
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,631
I've often thought... I...

372
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:10,981
I should've been a fireman

373
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,141
What?

374
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,567
Is this the guy?

375
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,409
Sorry, who are you?

376
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:26,425
I'm the guy?

377
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:33,177
- I'm the guy
- This is the guy

378
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:38,987
Rodney whatever happens,
please for your own safety

379
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,743
- Please stay out of it
- What are you talking about?

380
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,478
Everybody get down!

381
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:53,374
Everybody get down or
I will blow her head off

382
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,895
What did I just say?

383
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:59,052
- Rodney what did I say?
- Just calm down

384
00:33:01,837 --> 00:33:06,638
Sorry, thought you were making a move.

385
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:09,751
It's okay, do not move
Pies for everyone!

386
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,412
Everybody gets pies, but no ice-cream.

387
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,029
We can survive, people.

388
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,261
Lincoln knew it. That's
why they got to him.

389
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,230
No one follows us or
I'll kill myself and then her.

390
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,211
- Get in the car please
- No

391
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:29,835
Watch your head.

392
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:36,508
- 560 Harris. They're getting into a blue Volvo
- Rodney!

393
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:47,054
Oh my God!
Rodney!

394
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,878
It's okay, I shot you
through and through.

395
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,780
No bone, nowhere near
the femoral artery. Okay?

396
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:57,600
It's goanna be better for you
to grow bone. It's all good. Okay?

397
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,674
You good?

398
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:01,508
Good?

399
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:27,296
I was forced to enter the restaurant, June,
because it proves you're my hostage.

400
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:29,754
Which cleared your name,
with the locals at least.

401
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:32,165
That is a start. Something to build on.

402
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:34,076
You shot Rodney.

403
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:35,977
Yea, I did.

404
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:40,022
- But I asked him to stay out of it
- You shot Rodney

405
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,683
Might be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

406
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,544
Yea, right because we all should
get shot every now and then.

407
00:34:45,573 --> 00:34:51,279
Rodney is a good guy, June.
But not really right for you.

408
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:53,095
In my opinion, but a good guy...

409
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:55,374
He took a bullet.
He's goanna be a hero.

410
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,559
Probably get a promotion.

411
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,114
Stop the car.
Stop the car!

412
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:01,977
It's okay.

413
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:03,907
- Stop the car!
- I can not

414
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,523
I want to leave, stop the car
please, now

415
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:09,055
I'm not one of those, "I
told you so" kind of guys,

416
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,552
but I did warn you to stay
off the plane last night.

417
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:13,963
When?

418
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:18,228
When I said that sometimes
things happen for a reason.

419
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,173
That's not a warning...
That's not a warning, Roy...

420
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,954
That's an expression or a bumper sticker.

421
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:30,780
Next time try: June, if you get
this plane you will fucking die.

422
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:34,634
Maybe they did meant it when
they said that I will be safe.

423
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,107
Do you really mean that, June?

424
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,581
Yea.

425
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,370
Did you feel safe with them?

426
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,286
Do you think that I do now?

427
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:44,304
Okay.

428
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,899
Just so you understand,
right now out there on your own,

429
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,844
your life expectancy is like zero...

430
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,145
With me, it's up here.
Without me, here.

431
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,281
With me...
Without me...

432
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:26,586
I would advise going home,
but you know? It's up to you

433
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,351
So, right now I need
another car to keep moving

434
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:31,004
And someone else depending on me.
Someone, whose life is in danger.

435
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,751
Someone who trusts me...

436
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:37,117
Every second I waste chasing
you, I'm letting him down.

437
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:26,326
<i>Rodney, what was it that you were thinking
when you performed the heroic action?</i>

438
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,767
<i>Well, I didn't think, I just did what
any man would do in that situation.</i>

439
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:34,801
<i>- You should be so proud
- Thanks</i>

440
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,913
<i>It really didn't even hurt,
it was kind of like a bee sting.</i>

441
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:38,871
<i>What a brave fire fighter.</i>

442
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:41,045
<i>Doctors tell me,
Rodney's going to be okay.</i>

443
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,494
<i>It's just a flesh wound.</i>

444
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:46,152
<i>A true blue Boston hero...
Back to you, Tom.</i>

445
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:01,969
That's what it's all about.

446
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,449
That right there is what everybody wants.

447
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,319
A Burger King toy?

448
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,046
Open it.

449
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:22,750
It's warm. What is it?

450
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:23,687
A battery.

451
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:25,733
A battery?

452
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:29,459
It's code-named Zephyr.
I'm not sure, if it's just...

453
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:33,273
It's high output.
It never runs out.

454
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:35,255
What do you mean never?

455
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:38,776
That little thing there, is the
first perpetual energy source.

456
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:39,938
It's the sun.

457
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:42,893
So what, your flashlight
never runs out of juice?

458
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,923
It can power a lot more
than a flashlight, June.

459
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,656
- Really?
- Hmm.

460
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:48,813
How much more?

461
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:53,270
A small city or like a submarine.

462
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,381
It's big.

463
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:01,154
The guy who invented it,
is barely out of high school.

464
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:03,132
Simon Feck.

465
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,818
I was assigned with another agent to
watch him at a facility lab in Wichita.

466
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:12,292
and the other guy, the agent, is the
guy who picked you up this morning.

467
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,701
Fitzgerald.

468
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:20,469
A couple of weeks ago I found out that
he was going to sell the battery...

469
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:23,263
...and kill Simon.

470
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:28,959
So I got Simon out of there,
you know, some place safe.

471
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:32,003
Went back for the battery
and Fitz set me up.

472
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:34,730
He made it look like I went rogue.

473
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,599
That's when I met you.

474
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:51,048
So...

475
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:55,909
So what's next?
What is the plan?

476
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,409
Maybe get some rest.

477
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,699
Pick up Simon and get you
back to your sister's wedding.

478
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,482
I am pretty good at what I do, June.

479
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,490
Tonight...

480
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,169
...we're safe.

481
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,001
Scout's honour.

482
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,068
"Safe and secure?"

483
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,693
Good night, Roy.

484
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:30,581
Were you really a boy scout?

485
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:34,983
Eagle Scout.

486
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:40,051
- I was a brown eagle
- That's cool

487
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:45,966
Good night, Roy.

488
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:06,039
Pies for everybody... everybody...
Everybody gets pies...

489
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:11,859
So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?

490
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,722
We're looking at a pawn.

491
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,565
I talked to her and so did he.
She owns a garage. No passport.

492
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,331
Gone nowhere. Been nowhere.
She's a nobody.

493
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,240
You've been two steps behind
since this began, Fitz.

494
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,878
Are you sure someone's
not taking you to school?

495
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,493
Clean this shit up.

496
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,173
Brooklyn, NEW YORK.

497
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,191
This is the safe house?

498
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:52,015
Simon!

499
00:41:58,882 --> 00:41:59,929
Simon?

500
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:06,359
Stay close.

501
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,331
Simon!

502
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:12,620
No time to play.

503
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:26,850
What is all this?

504
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,472
Simon. It's what he does.

505
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,380
It's kind of late.
Please keep guard.

506
00:43:44,472 --> 00:43:46,296
Hmm... Made in Austria.

507
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:03,729
Who are these people?
Are they Fitzgerald's guys?

508
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:06,003
No, these are other guys

509
00:44:06,004 --> 00:44:07,513
Other bad guys?

510
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:11,546
Worse guys.
Hold them.

511
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:13,159
Worse guys?

512
00:44:13,448 --> 00:44:17,251
Now, June, listen carefully
and do exactly as I say.

513
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:19,153
On three, I'm goanna lay down cover...

514
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:22,574
...and you're going to run to
those shells over there, okay?

515
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:23,671
Okay

516
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,482
Ready...? One..

517
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:34,004
Sorry...

518
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:34,998
I panicked.

519
00:44:35,462 --> 00:44:36,912
What number would you like?

520
00:44:36,913 --> 00:44:38,362
Let's just stick with three.

521
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,195
Okay... 1, 2, 3.

522
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,680
Good work, thanks

523
00:44:56,515 --> 00:44:58,704
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.

524
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:00,895
He is a Spanish arms dealer.

525
00:45:00,896 --> 00:45:03,085
He also wants the battery.

526
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:05,375
Ready?

527
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:06,090
Let's move.

528
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:10,095
June, June...

529
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,735
What the...? How the hell
are we goanna get out of here?

530
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:16,607
Where the hell is Simon?

531
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,458
- I don't know, but he left a message.
- Message?

532
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:30,254
What I need you to do
right now is to wait here

533
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:31,157
What?

534
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,943
I'll go find us a way out of here

535
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,134
Wait, wait.

536
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:36,056
Stay down.

537
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,386
Roy!

538
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,216
June...

539
00:45:56,528 --> 00:46:05,820
June!
June!

540
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,665
Please stop saying my name.

541
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,507
You keep screaming my name
and it is freaking me out.

542
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,387
Okay, I understand.

543
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,703
- Drink this.
- What is that?

544
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:20,456
Brotine-zero.
They're goanna smoke us with D5.

545
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:24,836
Where's yours?

546
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:28,801
Shit.

547
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:29,792
Sorry.

548
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:50,758
June...

549
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:53,639
Will you listen to me?

550
00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:55,753
We'll be out of here...

551
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,633
...in a couple of minutes.

552
00:47:00,314 --> 00:47:01,428
I gotta do something...

553
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:08,958
Alright. We gotta go June.

554
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,715
We've been hit!

555
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,605
But, it's okay.

556
00:47:23,384 --> 00:47:25,525
We get through this, we're home free.

557
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:28,335
Ready. Set. Go!

558
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:40,749
We're almost there.

559
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:09,858
ALPS

560
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,285
Hey there, sleepyhead.

561
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,165
How long have I been out?

562
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,306
18 hours.

563
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:42,370
Where am I?

564
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,184
My place.

565
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:48,944
We're off-grid.

566
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:50,861
No one's ever found me here.

567
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:53,654
It's a shame we can't stay longer.

568
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:55,633
We gotta rendezvous
with Simon. He's fine.

569
00:48:55,643 --> 00:48:57,469
I figured out his code.

570
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:59,610
He's crazy 'bout trains.

571
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:02,309
He used the password I gave
him and went to Austria.

572
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:04,324
You drugged me again, Roy.

573
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:05,440
Yea.

574
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:08,148
You can't do that!

575
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:10,933
You weren't coping well.

576
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:15,831
I'm not sure if you were awake,
they would have even let you live.

577
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:19,614
What am I wearing?

578
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:22,679
A bikini.

579
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:24,571
We're in the tropics.

580
00:49:24,647 --> 00:49:26,560
How did I get in a bikini?

581
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:33,921
June, I've been trained to
dismantle bombs in pitch black...

582
00:49:33,922 --> 00:49:36,922
...with nothing but a
safety pin and a Junior mint.

583
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:42,018
I think I could get you into
those clothes without...

584
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,404
...looking.

585
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:49,418
I'm not saying that's what I did, but...

586
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:52,367
Sorry... Reflex.

587
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,383
Yea, I deserved that.

588
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,729
Hit me again.
I won't stop you.

589
00:49:59,935 --> 00:50:00,981
June?

590
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:03,893
June...

591
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:07,656
June!

592
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:10,499
Pins and Junior mints...

593
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,104
"I'm not saying that's what I did."

594
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:20,009
Shit!

595
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,277
What is this thing?

596
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:33,579
Movement,Alert

597
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:37,478
5826, Amapola.

598
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,320
That's a '67 Grand Prix.

00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:44,521
{PHONE RINGING}

600
00:50:54,394 --> 00:50:55,559
April!

601
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:58,693
April! I know, I'm ok!
I'm ok! I'm ok!

602
00:50:58,886 --> 00:51:01,736
Listen, April....
April... April....

603
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:03,344
April, can you hear me?

604
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:04,408
April.

605
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:06,080
April, can you...

{PHONE DISCONNECTED}

607
00:51:13,926 --> 00:51:16,750
I know, I'm ok!
I'm ok! I'm ok!

608
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:20,993
What is Miller doing?
Who is the girl?

609
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,241
We do not know Antonio.
We traced her phone to the Azores.

610
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:26,296
We're in range now.

611
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:30,198
Until they contact the agency.

612
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:38,974
Perfect timing.
Lunch is ready.

613
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:41,771
You must be thirsty.

614
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:49,997
It's a coconut...
it's loaded with electrolytes.

615
00:51:52,508 --> 00:51:53,525
Whoa...
Ok...

616
00:51:58,183 --> 00:51:59,969
OK, just...
wow.

617
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:01,762
Yea.

618
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:05,991
You got skills.

619
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,553
My dad wanted boys.

620
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:11,726
Let me go!

621
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:14,408
You can get out any time you want.

622
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:15,547
I'll show you.

623
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,208
Hands like Houdini.

624
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:22,166
Turn your palms down, and all at once...

625
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,650
...throw your hands to the ground.

626
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:26,891
And your hips back...

627
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:30,839
Nice.

628
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:32,770
That was good.

629
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:49,942
Who are you?

630
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:52,975
Really.

631
00:53:07,277 --> 00:53:09,101
I don't understand...

632
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:12,233
Run.

633
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:27,619
I don't understand.

634
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:29,444
I came on a plane.

635
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,742
My phone was secure.

636
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:33,488
It's secure.

637
00:53:34,046 --> 00:53:35,349
Unless you didn't make a call.

638
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,242
No, I didn't make a call.

639
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:39,893
I took a call.

640
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:42,870
You took a call?

641
00:53:42,975 --> 00:53:44,801
It was a quick one.

642
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:52,979
I thought we were off the grid,
and then my phone rang.

643
00:53:53,013 --> 00:54:02,039
It was my sister and
I had to take the call.

644
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,934
No, I can't get into that.

645
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,824
I can't get into that thing.

646
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:12,644
Just put me out.
Use Broton 7 or whatever.

647
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:14,637
- It's okay
- You're grabbing my neck.

648
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,261
You asked me not to drug you.

649
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,382
Okay...

650
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:33,272
Hands like Houdini...
hands...

651
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:53,383
Roy?

652
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,260
Monte Casale, ALPS.

653
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,578
I can't feel my face!

654
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,663
Hey, it's time...

655
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:07,707
Pull on this traction system...

656
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,519
I have control of 50,000 metric tons.

657
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:15,062
This is diesel hydraulic.

658
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,978
Don't you want to see your Zephyr?

659
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:18,717
Yes...

660
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:35,260
- Excuse Me.
- Tell me lady.

661
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,056
Can you tell me where we are?

662
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:38,142
Of course, we are in Austria.

663
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:39,802
Austria...

664
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,828
Would you like some breakfast, Miss?

665
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:44,911
Yea, that would be great.

666
00:55:44,912 --> 00:55:45,574
Thanks.

667
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:48,715
Okay, I'm goanna have some pancakes.

668
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:53,176
Scrambled eggs and...
a glass of milk.

669
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,392
Excellent.

670
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,476
- A Harvey Wall banger, please.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,631
Incoming Call.
Unknown Number.

672
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:04,117
You know, statistically
you're a lot more likely to die...

673
00:56:04,118 --> 00:56:07,013
...riding on a train than any
other form of transportation.

674
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:12,747
10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane.

675
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,484
Simon?

676
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:17,500
Simon Feck?

677
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:19,325
Yes.

678
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:23,177
My name is June, I'm a
friend of Roy Miller's.

679
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,866
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?

680
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,171
No, not yet.

681
00:56:28,209 --> 00:56:30,102
Don't you wanna answer that?

682
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:31,879
Yea.

683
00:56:32,328 --> 00:56:34,730
But I can't, I'm not supposed to...

684
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,825
It may be Roy.

685
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:39,572
But he told me not to answer the phone,
because the signal could be tracked.

686
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,376
Oh, that's right.

687
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:48,100
<i>Stay in the room.
I'm with Simon.</i>

688
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:52,046
Did Roy happen to tell you why I'm here?

689
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,832
Are we supposed to meet him here or...?

690
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,737
What did you say that
drink was... Harvey...?

691
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,275
It's a Harvey Wall banger.

692
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:02,554
Do you mind ordering me one
of those, 'cos it looks great?

693
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:03,737
I'll just be right back.

694
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:06,462
You just stay here for a second,
I'll be right back.

695
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:08,424
Something's wrongs.

696
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:10,219
It's getting hotter, Roy.

697
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:15,182
She didn't answer her phone..
I told her not to, which is good news.

698
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,862
- I left a note. A Post-it.
- Roy, maybe the issue here.

699
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:24,692
This is getting too hot;
we need to cool it down.

700
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,680
Maybe she went to get something to eat.

701
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:28,544
Good. C'mon...

702
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:54,561
May I help?

703
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,424
Yea, I'm feeling a little bit strange.

704
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:58,251
So is it okay if I hang
out here for a while?

705
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:00,362
Of cause, I'll go get you some water.

706
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:04,177
Here you go.

707
00:58:11,878 --> 00:58:17,122
Antonio Quintana wants to know,
where is the battery.

708
00:58:24,841 --> 00:58:27,354
Where is the battery?

709
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,546
I'm sorry... I'm looking for...

710
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:43,592
Roy...

711
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:46,224
Miller.

712
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:48,753
You know him?

713
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:52,391
I... He's an assassin... platinum grade.

714
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:54,727
- He's trying to find Simon.
- Oh my God...

715
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,038
And to kill you...

716
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:57,864
Simon?

717
00:58:58,026 --> 00:58:59,718
June, Simon.
Simon, Jume.

718
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:06,441
I'm okay, I got it.

719
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:16,139
Simon, please move!

720
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,480
You have quite some balls.

721
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:35,293
Hands like Houdini!

722
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:44,811
I'm so sorry...

723
00:59:46,923 --> 00:59:48,815
But you were trying to kill me.

724
01:00:02,117 --> 01:00:03,297
That's disgusting.

725
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:12,941
Oh, my God.
Just die!

726
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:17,627
Oh shit...

727
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:21,826
I gotta get you guys some place safe...

728
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:33,186
- He's not on the train.
- Oh, really?

729
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:35,185
The cameras at the station show him.

730
01:00:35,186 --> 01:00:38,084
He must've gotten off
before the train stopped.

731
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:10,509
Always the classics, boy.

732
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:26,835
Salzburg, Austria...
Very nice.

733
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:39,952
Yes.

734
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:45,794
No, we just got here.

735
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,288
No, we're talking now...

736
01:01:49,031 --> 01:01:49,992
No, I understand.

737
01:01:49,993 --> 01:01:52,327
No, but it is great to
hear your voice too Naomi.

738
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:54,662
I'll meet you at the Caprice
as soon as you could be there.

739
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,273
It is a beautiful city.

740
01:02:06,147 --> 01:02:07,291
Yea.

741
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,007
I've never seen anything quite like it.

742
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:18,671
Neither have I.

743
01:02:21,554 --> 01:02:23,444
I have to go out for a bit...

744
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:25,528
Okay...

745
01:02:26,182 --> 01:02:29,816
I... I was thinking about
ordering some room service.

746
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:33,003
Maybe we could have dinner.

747
01:02:34,057 --> 01:02:35,951
That sounds great.

748
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,024
9 'o clock?

749
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,684
9 sounds great.

750
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:45,747
June...

751
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:48,569
Could you do me a favour?

752
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:51,490
Just stick around here... that's better.

753
01:02:51,746 --> 01:02:55,130
Yeah of course, where else am I goanna go?

754
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:57,310
See you in a minute.

755
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,317
They're not goanna hurt you.
You are too valuable to them.

756
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:06,645
Just breathe and listen to the music.

757
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:08,815
This is something special for you.

758
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:10,736
I know you like it.

759
01:03:10,784 --> 01:03:12,504
Cool! Thanks.

760
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:16,517
Order as much room service as you
like, but do not leave the room,

761
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:18,304
- Okay?
- Alright

762
01:03:18,438 --> 01:03:21,195
I really need to talk to
you about the Zephyr later..

763
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:22,982
And we will.

764
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:21,694
Can I get you something?

765
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:24,517
Red wine please.

766
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,380
Right away.

767
01:04:45,637 --> 01:04:47,491
You seem different.

768
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:49,516
Do I?

769
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:54,213
So, who's your company?

770
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,649
She is beautiful. The blonde.

771
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,227
She seems capable.

772
01:05:00,956 --> 01:05:02,935
I've just met her.

773
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:04,892
She is a nobody.

774
01:05:04,932 --> 01:05:08,793
Someone I picked up on the way.

775
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:10,791
That's a shame.

776
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:14,402
This is getting boring.

777
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,406
Are we goanna do the deal or not?

778
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:20,030
Don't speak to me like that.

779
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:25,082
I'll speak to you any way I please, Tony.

780
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:28,001
We both know you're lucky I'm here.

781
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:32,680
I have the battery.
I'm on a schedule.

782
01:05:32,718 --> 01:05:36,684
The world of is full of bad
guys and people are calling.

783
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:39,507
Ask him the price...

784
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:41,458
Alright then...

785
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:44,310
What's your price?

786
01:05:46,107 --> 01:05:47,998
I have a figure in mind...

787
01:05:48,065 --> 01:05:50,043
What's it worth to you?

788
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:53,035
Are you angry about your island, Roy?

789
01:05:53,069 --> 01:05:55,711
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.

790
01:06:07,322 --> 01:06:11,164
I'm Isabelle George, director
of counter espionage at the CIA.

791
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,398
I'm sure you are.

792
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,858
Forgive me, I just...

793
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,873
I just don't know exactly what to believe.

794
01:06:23,696 --> 01:06:28,504
That's understandable considering that the
last five days you've been fed a steady diet...

795
01:06:28,505 --> 01:06:33,311
...of misinformation and fantasy by an
agent of ours who's recently gone rogue.

796
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:37,583
He said that Fitzgerald was the one
who wanted to steal the battery.

797
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,240
Well, let's examine the facts.

798
01:06:39,432 --> 01:06:43,388
Miller told you that he was protecting the
Zephyr from people who wanted to misuse it.

799
01:06:44,194 --> 01:06:46,747
But now he's trying to sell it to
an international arms dealer.

800
01:06:46,957 --> 01:06:48,783
Antonio Quintana.

801
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:52,376
One of Europe's leading
weapons manufacturers.

802
01:06:52,577 --> 01:06:55,362
Ask yourself, Miss Havens...

803
01:06:56,228 --> 01:07:00,097
Has Roy Miller said anything
to you that's proven to be true?

804
01:07:21,352 --> 01:07:25,222
He used you as a mule to carry the
battery through security, Miss Havens.

805
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,979
He's been playing you.

806
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:31,763
He's a spy. That's what he does.
He lies for a living.

807
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:35,018
Any love, empathy... we train
that right out of them.

808
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,793
What did you imagine?

809
01:07:36,794 --> 01:07:39,456
The two of you would move into
a condo together? Get a dog?

810
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:42,404
You can't have a life
with him. That's fantasy.

811
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,180
But you can have your back...

812
01:07:45,285 --> 01:07:46,372
She's been gone eight minutes.

813
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,992
We need you to get back
to the hotel before Miller.

814
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:53,812
What am I supposed to do?

815
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,250
Alright...

816
01:07:56,859 --> 01:07:59,577
This pen is a transmitter.

817
01:07:59,645 --> 01:08:02,107
Once you have confirmation
that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr...

818
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:05,802
...that it is somewhere
nearby or on his person.

819
01:08:05,803 --> 01:08:09,906
You confirm this by
simply clicking the button.

820
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:19,549
Sorry, I'm late.

821
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,947
Everything go okay?

822
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,565
Sure enough.

823
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:33,413
It's getting hotter.

824
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:44,795
So, did you get your price?

825
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,605
I followed you tonight.

826
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,261
You have nothing to say.

827
01:08:57,463 --> 01:08:59,287
Here's to Wichita...

828
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:04,954
Where we first...

829
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:07,000
...bumped into each other?

830
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:12,528
Do you think that was fate, Roy?

831
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:15,653
I do not believe in fate.

832
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:18,381
But I believe in luck.

833
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:22,387
I don't know what to believe.

834
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:37,543
That hurt more than I thought it would...

835
01:09:41,432 --> 01:09:42,715
I'm going home.

836
01:09:52,966 --> 01:09:57,702
He promised that if you turned
yourself in, he'll protect you.

837
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:01,678
I love your optimism.

838
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:04,463
Never lose it.

839
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:09,247
Get him.

840
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,282
Get her out of here.

841
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:29,558
He's not here, Sir.

842
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:32,372
They tell you you're going home?

843
01:10:32,507 --> 01:10:35,378
You sit inside the helicopter, June?

844
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:37,916
You can't go home.

845
01:10:42,861 --> 01:10:43,974
Shit!

846
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:03,271
Close the door!

847
01:11:04,038 --> 01:11:05,153
Get in the car!

848
01:11:54,192 --> 01:11:56,055
Don't let him escape.

849
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:11,460
He has the battery!

850
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:25,183
Hold your fire! He has the battery! 

851
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:44,826
They secure the kid?

852
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:46,881
Yes.

853
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,419
They found Roy?

854
01:12:56,631 --> 01:12:59,396
We'll find the body.
We have to.

855
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,259
He went down with the Zephyr.

856
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,891
Thank you guys...

857
01:13:48,749 --> 01:13:51,408
Schwedelbach, GERMANY.

858
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:04,619
Aah... Fitz...

859
01:14:04,725 --> 01:14:06,607
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn...

860
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:09,557
Ram stein is that way, West...
And I think we're going South.

861
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:12,274
You know what, you're right.

862
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,925
Tell him, we're back on track.

863
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,777
I don't have the battery, but
no one's goanna get it now.

864
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:27,698
Yea, I've got the next best thing.

865
01:14:27,794 --> 01:14:29,773
I'll see you in Spain in two days.

866
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:41,417
Hi, Wilmer!

867
01:14:42,697 --> 01:14:44,708
- How was the party?
- It was nice

868
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:46,023
I see the 'Goat' is still out there.

869
01:14:46,089 --> 01:14:47,513
Yea.

870
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:48,934
I thought it was a wedding present.

871
01:14:49,711 --> 01:14:51,622
It was, but...

872
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:55,598
I think I wanted her to want
it more than she wanted it.

873
01:14:55,675 --> 01:14:57,568
Okay...

874
01:15:00,516 --> 01:15:02,303
This just come in?

875
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:05,866
G-body Grand Prix.
Largest hood in history.

876
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,571
Gonne be a real beauty'.

877
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:20,608
Ru-pa...? No... Fe-pa...?
No, it's... Amapola 5826...

878
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:22,617
Let's see...

879
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:26,437
That's like an hour from here...

880
01:15:28,303 --> 01:15:30,183
I think it's a safe house.

881
01:16:03,002 --> 01:16:04,552
Here we go...

882
01:16:59,505 --> 01:17:00,551
Who's out there?

883
01:17:00,632 --> 01:17:02,347
I am not afraid to use this.

884
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:04,144
Oh, Frank! Look at her...

885
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,256
I wanna know what she's doing in my
lawn in the middle of the night?

886
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:08,023
I have the pistons you ordered.

887
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,109
Pistons?

888
01:17:09,177 --> 01:17:11,040
For the '67 Grand Prix.

889
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:13,084
Molly, I didn't...

890
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:16,610
You're all wet. Please, come inside.

891
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:25,293
That Pontiac you have out
there, Frank, is a real classic.

892
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:29,269
I really love pre-70s Grand Prix'.

893
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,794
So, you two lived here long?

894
01:17:33,828 --> 01:17:34,818
This old place?

895
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:36,865
It's been our home for forty years.

896
01:17:36,904 --> 01:17:39,719
Sit down, honey.
Have a cookie.

897
01:17:39,949 --> 01:17:43,724
Frank thinks we should
move, but I am uncomfortable.

898
01:17:43,762 --> 01:17:48,391
And we can afford to stay, thanks
to Publisher's Clearing House.

899
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,406
You won Publisher's Clearing House?

900
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:52,974
Twice.

901
01:17:53,072 --> 01:17:56,587
Plus we won two lotto quick picks and
Frank doesn't even remember buying.

902
01:17:56,812 --> 01:17:58,005
Oh, I didn't buy 'em.

903
01:17:58,038 --> 01:18:00,931
Oh, yeah. Like you didn't
order pistons off the Internet.

904
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:04,746
You don't know what you're
typing into that computer, Frank.

905
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:07,599
In a couple of minutes we'll
have your clothes, honey.

906
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:10,634
So...

907
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,351
Roy Miller?

908
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,212
This was one of his safe
houses, wasn't it?

909
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,976
What the hell are you talking about?

910
01:18:23,138 --> 01:18:27,758
Honey, what's this all about?

911
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:33,435
I'm sorry, I thought...
Maybe I must have this all wrong.

912
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:39,284
I was just... looking for some
information about my friend Roy.

913
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,541
If you'd like to change, there's
a proper room right there.

914
01:18:53,845 --> 01:18:55,440
That's our son Mathew.

915
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:58,637
We lost him in Kuwait.
It was a chopper crash.

916
01:18:58,686 --> 01:19:02,459
He saved the lives of
two of his crewmen.

917
01:19:03,428 --> 01:19:05,341
He used to always take care of everyone.

918
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:07,066
He was an Eagle Scout.

919
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:10,171
This was taken the day he
got that swimming badge.

920
01:19:10,206 --> 01:19:15,983
He could swim clear across lake
Sunapee with practically one breath.

921
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:18,739
I just...

922
01:19:21,505 --> 01:19:24,376
I believe we've... I'm June Havens.

923
01:19:24,578 --> 01:19:27,267
I'm Molly Knight.

924
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:29,635
This is June Havens and
I'm leaving a message...

925
01:19:29,636 --> 01:19:33,000
...on my own machine for whoever's
listening to this phone call.

926
01:19:33,097 --> 01:19:34,249
I have the Zephyr...

927
01:19:35,056 --> 01:19:37,908
I have the Zephyr and
I'm ready to make a deal.

928
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:42,711
I'm sitting on Route 28,
right outside New Hampshire.

929
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:47,484
And if you want the Zephyr,
you better come and get it.

930
01:20:21,913 --> 01:20:23,130
Hey fellas.

931
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,658
So...

932
01:20:29,764 --> 01:20:31,587
You want the Zephyr?

933
01:20:31,712 --> 01:20:34,363
I got the Zephyr.
It's right here.

934
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:36,156
Come and get it.

935
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:41,991
Seville, SPAIN.

936
01:20:52,475 --> 01:20:54,671
Come on...

937
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:55,403
Let's go!

938
01:20:56,617 --> 01:20:58,556
Welcome to Espana.

939
01:21:03,407 --> 01:21:06,163
It will take a while,
for it to take effect.

940
01:21:08,122 --> 01:21:10,995
Today is the Festival of San Fermin.

941
01:21:13,049 --> 01:21:15,902
Have you ever seen a
bullfight, Miss Havens?

942
01:21:21,702 --> 01:21:24,469
My name is Antonio Quintana.

943
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:25,574
I know who you are.

944
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:30,165
What did he give me?

945
01:21:31,192 --> 01:21:33,170
It is something we're
developing in my company.

946
01:21:33,247 --> 01:21:35,130
A new kind of truth serum.

947
01:21:35,197 --> 01:21:37,022
Really?

948
01:21:38,117 --> 01:21:41,097
I have a few questions
for you about the battery,

949
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:45,570
since we both know what you
gave to my men was a joke.

950
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,574
I don't like you very much...

951
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:53,521
The truth?

952
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:57,085
Good.

953
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:59,005
It worked.

954
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:01,955
You know, I really like Miller though...

955
01:22:01,993 --> 01:22:04,807
Did you know I was totally
wrong about him in Salzburg?

956
01:22:04,904 --> 01:22:07,447
He wanted me to hear that phone
call so that I would follow him.

957
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,315
I'd turn him in and then
he could get me home safely.

958
01:22:10,348 --> 01:22:12,410
He was trying to protect me.

959
01:22:12,413 --> 01:22:16,934
It's crazy that I could feel so
powerful and capable around him.

960
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:18,417
Shut up...

961
01:22:18,464 --> 01:22:20,222
- He takes care of me
- Shut up!

962
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:23,160
Where is the battery?
Where is it?

963
01:22:24,434 --> 01:22:27,774
I bet you've never made a girl
an omelette, have you Antonio?

964
01:22:29,962 --> 01:22:31,723
Don't test me, June.

965
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:33,759
Or got her to her sister's
wedding on time?

966
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,762
It's really the little things. Honestly.

967
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:38,202
- They count so much
- Enough!

968
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:39,499
Okay!

969
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:41,300
Miller is dead! Roy Miller is dead.

970
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:43,066
He's out. Est muerto! Comprendes?

971
01:22:43,099 --> 01:22:45,337
No. No, he is not.

972
01:22:46,183 --> 01:22:48,074
He can hold his breath
for a really long time.

973
01:22:48,103 --> 01:22:50,860
Si est muerto!
He is dead!

974
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,635
I'm not goanna ask you again.

975
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:31,391
If you don't tell me
what I need to know...

976
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:32,304
...you're goanna die.

977
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:33,989
I do not know where the battery is.

978
01:23:34,023 --> 01:23:35,641
Then why did you tell
everyone you had it? Why?

979
01:23:35,675 --> 01:23:38,093
Because I was trying to find Roy.

980
01:23:38,132 --> 01:23:39,982
This white bitch is driving me crazy.

981
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:44,817
Antonio, wherever there's bad guys like
you around Roy's not too far away.

982
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:46,738
You are going to kill her.

983
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:48,640
Kill her.

984
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:50,561
You're goanna die.

985
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:02,960
Finally.

986
01:24:04,054 --> 01:24:05,783
Nice to meet you...

987
01:24:05,909 --> 01:24:07,703
- John
- Antonio.

988
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,779
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.

989
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:13,630
Where is the boy?

990
01:24:16,358 --> 01:24:18,375
I thought you would not?

991
01:24:20,873 --> 01:24:23,272
Why don't you follow me down to
the river and bring the money?

992
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,136
Okay.

993
01:24:57,193 --> 01:25:00,665
<i>Is this thatching? Because, I've
never seen anything like that before.</i>

994
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:04,137
<i>We have really good architecture
in Boston, but nothing like this.</i>

995
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:11,302
It's so clear.

996
01:25:11,336 --> 01:25:13,135
It's time to kill her.

997
01:25:13,168 --> 01:25:15,232
Is this all weapons money,
or is this family money?

998
01:25:17,267 --> 01:25:20,162
Gardens... He likes gardens, huh?

999
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:24,681
<i>So, do you guys take care of the garden?
It's so relaxing...</i>

1000
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:27,440
This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers.

1001
01:25:27,564 --> 01:25:29,921
Ok, Eduardo, you don't
have to pull me around.

1002
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:32,281
You can just tell me where you
want me to go, okay?

1003
01:25:32,338 --> 01:25:33,115
This way, Blondie.

1004
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:34,672
See, now we're communicating.

1005
01:25:35,132 --> 01:25:38,073
Bet you're taking me
some place safe and secure.

1006
01:25:38,106 --> 01:25:40,430
Some place special.
Antonio's special place.

1007
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:42,755
Oh, Antonio has a special place?
That's so nice!

1008
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:44,503
Everyone should have a special place.

1009
01:25:44,537 --> 01:25:44,735
Come on.

1010
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:54,480
Luis?

1011
01:25:54,514 --> 01:25:56,551
Is there a problem, Eduardo?

1012
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:57,727
Shut up!

1013
01:26:02,111 --> 01:26:03,935
- Hi Roy.
- Hi June.

1014
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,410
You're supposed to be home.

1015
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:06,789
You're supposed to be dead.

1016
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,515
- I can explain
- You don't have to

1017
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,689
I came here to get Simon.
I just get caught up in something.

1018
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,783
Oh, that's cool.

1019
01:26:15,481 --> 01:26:16,652
Be careful.

1020
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:18,582
His name is Eduardo.

1021
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:20,438
Eduardo, habla Engels?

1022
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:24,685
I need you to listen, because when you wake
up you'll call your boss and tell him...

1023
01:26:24,686 --> 01:26:28,868
...that Roy Miller, that's me, has
the battery and escaped with the girl.

1024
01:26:28,906 --> 01:26:29,982
- Oh, you have the battery?
- Yea

1025
01:26:30,117 --> 01:26:31,817
Will you tell him?

1026
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:33,892
Comprende?

1027
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:34,918
Yes.

1028
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:37,742
Let's go.

1029
01:26:37,752 --> 01:26:39,071
I'm worried about Simon.

1030
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:42,296
I haven't seen him and my tracker is blank.

1031
01:26:42,392 --> 01:26:43,409
Being with you is so exciting.

1032
01:26:43,457 --> 01:26:45,222
You excite me, Miller.

1033
01:26:45,256 --> 01:26:48,222
- Took you long to get here
- 7 'o clock

1034
01:26:57,806 --> 01:26:59,699
I think I feel like having sex.

1035
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:03,511
You know, really great sex.

1036
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,586
Did they give you something?

1037
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:09,284
You need to rehydrate.

1038
01:27:10,245 --> 01:27:11,224
Roy...

1039
01:27:16,142 --> 01:27:17,927
Roy...

1040
01:27:22,807 --> 01:27:23,825
Roy...

1041
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:25,649
June...

1042
01:27:30,595 --> 01:27:32,353
June?

1043
01:27:34,246 --> 01:27:36,291
You don't seem very
happy to see me, Roy.

1044
01:27:38,193 --> 01:27:39,173
What?

1045
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:41,132
Not really.

1046
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:01,021
I am happy.

1047
01:28:09,566 --> 01:28:10,820
So the red dot is us?

1048
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:13,691
No, we're yellow.
Red dot is Simon.

1049
01:28:29,979 --> 01:28:30,900
Grab tight.

1050
01:28:47,441 --> 01:28:48,372
Hello?

1051
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:49,887
It's Eduardo!

1052
01:28:49,888 --> 01:28:52,782
He says his name is Roy Miller,
He said he has the battery.

1053
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:56,084
- That's impossible.
- She disappeared with him.

1054
01:28:56,834 --> 01:28:57,909
No!

1055
01:28:58,783 --> 01:29:00,693
Miller is here.

1056
01:29:04,527 --> 01:29:05,572
There they are!

1057
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:09,318
This way.
Follow me!

1058
01:29:20,095 --> 01:29:21,921
Oops...

1059
01:29:37,203 --> 01:29:39,142
There's Fitz.

1060
01:29:39,176 --> 01:29:41,085
I see him!

1061
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:02,258
Slow... slowly...

1062
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:29,237
Get the guns.

1063
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,041
Okay.

1064
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:33,002
- Here
- Wow!

1065
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,815
- What next?
- Lead them

1066
01:30:58,867 --> 01:31:01,738
June Havens!
You've got skills.

1067
01:31:42,162 --> 01:31:44,102
- See you down the hill
- Are you sure?

1068
01:31:44,112 --> 01:31:45,062
No.

1069
01:32:04,891 --> 01:32:06,282
Freeze right there, Roy.

1070
01:32:06,283 --> 01:32:07,211
Hey, Simon.

1071
01:32:07,408 --> 01:32:09,813
- Get down on your knees, now.
- Roy!

1072
01:32:10,727 --> 01:32:12,762
Put 'em in the water,
in the water.

1073
01:32:12,983 --> 01:32:14,846
I just want the kid, Fitz.

1074
01:32:15,873 --> 01:32:19,172
Okay, well I hope you brought
what you want otherwise,

1075
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:22,472
I'm goanna have to kill him,
and I swear to you I'll do it.

1076
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:25,439
I believe you.
Just like Wichita.

1077
01:32:25,487 --> 01:32:27,380
- I understand
- Okay

1078
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:28,620
I'm just goanna get the battery.
It's right here.

1079
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,019
Please don't give it to him.

1080
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,414
Roy, please don't give it to him.

1081
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:35,612
Put it on the deck.

1082
01:32:35,646 --> 01:32:36,732
- Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy!
- Easy

1083
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:37,819
- Please don't give it to him.
- Easy

1084
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,730
- Simon, it's goanna be okay
- Roy, don't give it to him

1085
01:32:39,749 --> 01:32:41,536
Shut up!

1086
01:32:49,459 --> 01:32:53,235
- Okay, okay, I'll make another one
- Simon don't talk

1087
01:32:54,137 --> 01:32:56,116
Make another one?

1088
01:33:12,501 --> 01:33:14,354
Am I dying?

1089
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,286
No, you fainted.

1090
01:33:18,287 --> 01:33:19,319
I'm sorry.

1091
01:33:19,633 --> 01:33:20,981
That's okay.

1092
01:33:21,361 --> 01:33:23,036
No, I've been trying to tell you...

1093
01:33:25,956 --> 01:33:28,708
Why is it hot?

1094
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:31,460
Because it's filled with power.

1095
01:33:31,565 --> 01:33:34,062
The battery! I messed up.
It's deteriorating.

1096
01:33:34,095 --> 01:33:37,238
I know. It's unstable.

1097
01:33:46,855 --> 01:33:49,564
You're a smart guy, Simon.

1098
01:33:49,565 --> 01:33:50,918
I know you'll figure it out.

1099
01:33:54,731 --> 01:33:56,459
Oh, my God.

1100
01:33:57,488 --> 01:33:59,437
Roy, you're shot.

1101
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:03,183
Get help.

1102
01:34:17,772 --> 01:34:19,635
You're beautiful, June.

1103
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,941
Stay with me.

1104
01:34:39,852 --> 01:34:41,744
We're here Miller,
we got you.

1105
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:47,439
June...

1106
01:34:52,516 --> 01:34:55,241
WASHINGTON

1107
01:35:12,449 --> 01:35:15,262
It's been a spectacular
couple of weeks, Miller.

1108
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,104
It's good to see you, Isabelle.

1109
01:35:22,899 --> 01:35:24,868
Hey, guys.

1110
01:35:25,847 --> 01:35:29,042
We cleaned house, Roy.

1111
01:35:29,043 --> 01:35:30,640
I have to thank you for that.

1112
01:35:31,705 --> 01:35:34,805
I trusted the wrong man.

1113
01:35:34,806 --> 01:35:36,355
That happens.

1114
01:35:37,574 --> 01:35:40,768
Simon's happy.

1115
01:35:40,769 --> 01:35:42,367
He's got a new life.

1116
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,181
Where June?

1117
01:35:45,182 --> 01:35:47,082
I sent her home.

1118
01:35:49,906 --> 01:35:51,798
She gets it.

1119
01:35:52,758 --> 01:35:56,600
She knows you two lead different
lives, and she's moving on.

1120
01:35:56,638 --> 01:35:58,618
As should you.

1121
01:35:59,616 --> 01:36:01,828
You gave up those things.

1122
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:06,254
You let go of who you were.
Family. Friends. That's the deal.

1123
01:36:07,146 --> 01:36:09,595
Why are we still talking about this?

1124
01:36:09,596 --> 01:36:12,045
Because the agency
invested a lot in you.

1125
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,964
And you are an asset only
as long as you stay focussed.

1126
01:36:23,657 --> 01:36:25,461
You look good.

1127
01:36:25,462 --> 01:36:27,267
Get some rest.

1128
01:36:27,468 --> 01:36:30,380
We're goanna transfer you to a
secure facility tomorrow.

1129
01:36:30,389 --> 01:36:32,271
For your safety.

1130
01:36:58,135 --> 01:37:00,920
Nurse, what did you give me?

1131
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:03,860
Brotine Zero.

1132
01:37:16,335 --> 01:37:18,247
Stay under there, Roy.

1133
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:20,260
You're dead.

1134
01:37:23,068 --> 01:37:24,269
Make way, please.

1135
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:26,849
Going to the mortuary.

1136
01:37:31,655 --> 01:37:33,557
Do not worry, Roy.

1137
01:37:33,558 --> 01:37:34,508
I got this.

1138
01:37:35,602 --> 01:37:37,455
It's time for a vacation.

1139
01:38:34,082 --> 01:38:35,937
Hey there, sleepyhead.

1140
01:38:38,857 --> 01:38:40,643
What day is it?

1141
01:38:40,644 --> 01:38:41,833
Someday.

1142
01:38:43,631 --> 01:38:45,550
Someday, Roy.

1143
01:38:54,213 --> 01:38:56,930
What am I wearing?

1144
01:38:58,054 --> 01:39:00,146
A pair of shorts.

1145
01:39:01,003 --> 01:39:04,011
How did I get into these shorts?

1146
01:39:04,817 --> 01:39:07,785
Roy, I've been trained to
rebuild a 6 speed transmission...

1147
01:39:07,786 --> 01:39:10,755
using only a pair of pliers
and a crescent wrench.

1148
01:39:10,789 --> 01:39:14,364
I think I can get you into a
pair of shorts without looking.

1149
01:39:15,457 --> 01:39:17,318
I'm not saying that's what I did.

1150
01:39:17,977 --> 01:39:20,067
You're both the navigator and the DJ.

1151
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:23,112
We have a long way
to go to Cape Horn.

1152
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:31,165
With me.
Without me.

1153
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,563
With you.

1154
01:39:33,591 --> 01:39:36,857
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

1155
01:39:36,858 --> 01:39:37,946
Yes, ma'am.
