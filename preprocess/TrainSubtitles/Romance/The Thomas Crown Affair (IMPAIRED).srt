worn by Frederick Barbarossa

Three dates in six days.

to this story?

They both had to come out
of the same building.

Photos of the borders
of the Monet.

995
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:34,876
The borders?

996
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,253
Before insurers
indemnify a painting,

997
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,382
they remove it from the frame
and photograph the borders.

998
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,509
Borders are never
seen in galleries

999
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,386
or auctions,
so if a picture is stolen

1000
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,514
and someone tries to
pass off a forgery,
the borders won't match.

1001
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,016
And if the borders
do happen to match?

1002
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:53,019
Then the forger
was in the presence
of the original painting.

happens to be too good. . .
