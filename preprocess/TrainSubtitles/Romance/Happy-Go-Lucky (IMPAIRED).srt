00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,191
The Road To Reality.

3
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,949
Don't wanna be going there. (Chuckles)

4
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,870
Hiya.

5
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,992
An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.

6
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,950
Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?

7
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,751
Never been in here before.

8
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,591
I like your hat.

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,471
(Electronic beep)

10
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,993
(Beep)

11
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,713
Busy?

12
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,311
Hello?

13
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,033
(Beep)

14
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,119
Having a bad day?

15
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,430
No.

16
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,675
Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?

17
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,836
Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

18
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,233
<i>I won't bite.</i>

19
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,951
Don't worry, I'm going now.

20
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,398
Have a good day. Stay happy.

21
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,590
I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.

22
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,549
Beep, beep, beep, beep. (Chuckles)

23
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,596
Oh, no, no, come on.

24
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,711
That's just brilliant, that is.

25
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,114
Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

26

The music's stopped.

37
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,359
It stopped ages ago.

42
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,072
What's so funny?

43
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,873
- (Laughter)
- I don't know!

44
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,872
Can you just...

45
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,632
Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.

46
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,792
<i>Suzy, what's that?</i>

47
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,956
POPPY: <i>What is it? Is that your latest conquest?</i>

48
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
Oh, bless him!

49
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,435
Don't you ever pray that you're adopted, Suzy?

50
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,708
Oh, argh!

51
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,671
- Yeah.
- (Giggling)

52
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,756
You got me, Zoe.

53
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,951
- Ssssh!
- Who are you shushing?

54
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,070
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,875
She's right. Let's all enjoy the silence together.

56
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,311
Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in.

57
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,113
- (Laughter)
<i>- Ssssssh!</i>

58
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,593
Sorry!

59
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,353
- Sssssh.
- Fingers on lips.

60
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,038
Fingers on the tits.

61
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,116
- Fingers on tits.
- Fingers on the hips.

62
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,037
Can I borrow yours?

63
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,158
- Fingers on the tits.
- Oh, that is properly disgusting.

64
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,112
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?

65
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,957
- Oh, hello!
<i>- Can I have a go?</i>

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,309
Of course you can, Dawn, you don't need to ask.

67
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,079
- Anyone over there?
- Oh, I know where that's been.

68
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,678
(Laughter)

69
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,836
You have gone down in my estimation.

70
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,677
I'm sorry, Alice.

71
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,030
- I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
- Oh, don't you?

72
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,311
I mean, you just put them in your bra...

73
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,236
Yeah?

74
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,078
I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.

75
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,554
- Like a natural woman.
<i>- That's right.</i>

76
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,989
- I think it's in the wrong place.
- Ah, whoop!

77
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,712
Oh, look, you've got three tits!

78
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,671
She's like you, Zoe.

79
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,517
- No, that's three nipples.
<i>- Oh, right.</i>

80
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,039
Have you got three nipples?

81
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,270
She doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm going to give her a little hug.

82
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,834
- Over you go.
- Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.

83
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,791
Oh, really? Oh!

84
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,719
Ooh!

85
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,279
(Laughter)

86
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,316
Your cleavage looks great from up here.

87
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,271
- Thank you.
- I've got a bird's eye view.

88
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,311
Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.

89
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,112
Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.

90
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,593
Look at that!

91
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,108
- It's good, isn't it?
- They're amazing.

92
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,991
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

93
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,951
(Laughter)

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,594
I think we know where Poppy's sleeping tonight.

95
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,439
Morning.

96
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,391
Time to get up, sleepyhead.

97
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,671
Cup of tea here.

98
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,075
Come on. You can do it.

99
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,316
That's it. That's it, nearly there.

100
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,550
Oh, here we go.

101
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,478
- And she's up! Hey.
- Thanks.

102
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,999
You all right?

103
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,235
Yeah, I slept good.

104
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,350
I heard you. (Snores)

105
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,153
You always start that.

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,156
- I don't snore.
- I know. You never have.

107
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,831
- I don't.
- (Mimics) I don't.

108
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,958
- Are they still asleep?
- No, they buggered off ages ago.

109
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,115
- Did they?
- Yeah.

110
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,276
Oh, right.

111
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
- What's the time?
- About 10 past 12.

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,594
- They've got a bit of work to do.
- Have they?

113
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,155
- Dawn's late with her dissertation.
- Oh, no. When are your exams?

114
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,156
- Three weeks tomorrow.
- You'll be all right.

115
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,476
Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.

116
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,873
Of course you are.

117
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,831
- I'm cool.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,676
I'm just really stressed.

119
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,870
What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?

120
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,271
- Does anyone want any toast?
SUZY: <i>Yeah.</i>

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,470
- Yes, please.
- With marmalade, two slices.

122
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,953
Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,672
- Yeah.
- No crusts.

124
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,712
- Got it. Oh, do you know what?
<i>- What?</i>

125
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,756
- Oh, yeah.
- She's gone.

126
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,234
The thing is, we're starting with criminal justice.

127
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,589
- Is that your first exam?
- Yeah, it's crap.

128
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,111
If we had cyber crime first,
or, like, crime and pleasure,

129
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,435
I could ease myself into it.

130
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,710
- No probs.
- Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.

131
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,479
Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.

132
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,398
- You calling your sister an idiot?
- Calling you an idiot.

133
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,714
Thank you.

134
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,876
"Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.

135
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,876
- Sounds like last night.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,755
You'll be all right.

137
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,870
Yeah.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,679
- See you later.
- Alligator.

139
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,280
- When are we going to see Helen?
- Yeah, when's the baby due?

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,151
Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.

141
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,395
- Me too, she's getting worse.
- I know, bless her.

142
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,954
- Want to wait till after your exams?
- I want to get it over with.

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,673
All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.

144
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,998
- Text me, yeah?
- Work hard.

145
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,474
Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?

146
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,431
- Oh, yeah.
- (Laughs)

147
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,151
(Sings to herself)

148
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,990
- These make good legs?
- Great.

149
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,951
# I'm so excited...

150
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,474
- It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
- You reckon?

151
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,431
Just... whoosh!

152
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,039
- What? Like Mr Vertigo?
- Oh, yeah. I love that book.

153
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,433
- Yeah.
- Oh, vultures.

154
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,074
- Met a few of them.
- These could be useful.

155
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,839
Oh, yeah, they're great.
Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.

156
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,677
We could do an owl, they've got big heads.

157
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,109
Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.

158
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,276
- Cheers, Poppy.
- No, they're lovely.

159
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,639
Do penguins emigrate?

160
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,716
What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?

161
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,432
Emigrate, migrate, whatever.

162
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,153
- What about parrots?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,078
- Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
<i>- They're good colours.</i>

164
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,031
Beautiful.

165
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,518
So, are you going to get another bike?

166
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,030
Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
It's flown the nest now.

167
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,991
Definitely going to learn to drive, though.

168
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,553
- Going to book lessons?
- Might do.

169
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,349
Might not.

170
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,278
I told you, you're not learning to drive in my car.

171
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,548
(Clucks)

172
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,191
- Nutter.
- (Clucks)

173
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,118
- Chickens, we could do chickens.
- Chickens don't fly.

174
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,391
<i>Lazy</i> buggers.
What are we going to make, then?

175
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,034
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know.

176
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,038
- Where are they?
- Here.

177
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,958
- That far apart, are they?
- Yeah. Don't poke me.

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,911
Wasn't going near you.

179
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,191
- Go on, then.
- Great.

180
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,555
You should ask an adult to help you.

181
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,511
I don't know any.

182
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,951
(Squawks)

183
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,310
- I think they're quite good.
- Yeah, what do you reckon?

184
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,388
- I think we could pull in these.
<i>- Definitely.</i>

185
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,590
- Pub?
- Yeah, hair of the dog.

186
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,916
I'm ready. Put a bit of lippy on and away we go.

187
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,795
(Chirrups)

188
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,429
- Hi, <i>Liz.</i>
- Hi, Zoe. How are you?

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,633
Ooh.

190
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,391
Didn't expect that one!

191
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,589
Morning, Tina.

192
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,112
Birds that live here in North America,
they fly all the way to South America.

193
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,070
Yeah?

194
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,793
<i>That's a journey and a half, isn't it?</i>

195
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,276
But the... the biggest journey of them all
is of the arctic tern.

196
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,276
Because he flies from the Arctic...

197
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,759
Yeah? ...all the way - wow,
across the world - to the South Pole.

198
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,668
Isn't that incredible?

199
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,757
From the North to the South Pole
and that is... ssh!

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,554
And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.

201
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,556
Wow, wow.

202
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,556
(Children talking at once)

203
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,033
All right, Nick, do the other side now.

204
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,753
<i>Here we go, look. No, don't pull it out.</i>

205
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,556
What we can do... Shall we give him...
Shall we give him a few bits?

206
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
Do you want to give him... I like that, I like that.

207
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,470
<i>- Shall we give him one here?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

208
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,589
<i>No?</i>

209
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,833
- He's got eyebrows, look.
- (Laughs)

210
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,791
- Yeah?
<i>- Let me see.</i>

211
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,393
I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

212
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,271
Here we go.

213
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,515
Shall I put some more yellow in that?
There we go.

214
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,509
<i>What colours do you think</i>
<i>your feathers could be?</i>

215
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,438
See, you could do a rainbow colour.
That's a good idea, isn't it?

216
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,314
- I did a rainbow.
- Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.

217
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,952
<i>Don't put that on yet.</i>

218
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,639
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

219
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,795
Little bit more. What about the fringing?

220
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,479
You could do a bit more
on the fringing there, couldn't you?

221
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,159
Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.

222
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,760
But I'm not a cook.
It's lunch time in a minute.

223
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,313
We're going to lunch in a minute.

224
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,271
You can wash your hands.

225
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,958
- Who's ready?
- (All call out)

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,911
Hey!

227
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,871
(Squawking and clucking)

228
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,596
Oh, wow! That is fantastic. Look at you go!

229
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,514
Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.

230
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,953
Bit dangerous, innit?

231
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,514
What?

232
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,278
Putting these over their heads.

233
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,357
I'm trying to suffocate them.
That's my goal. Little buggers.

234
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,708
- They look great.
<i>- How was your weekend?</i>

235
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,910
- Crap.
- Oh, no, why's that, then?

236
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,110
I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.

237
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,434
It's the weekend, Tash.

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,835
- I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
<i>- Did ya?</i>

239
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,668
Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
I had to look after Jasmine.

240
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,234
- How is she?
- That girl eats too much.

241
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,429
Bless her.

242
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,393
She ate three chicken legs and four jam tarts
and then wants to tell me she's starving.

243
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,668
The little piglet.

244
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,029
- I dropped her off to my mum's.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

245
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,675
I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
that she needs to put this girl on a diet.

246
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,199
You'll give her a complex, she's 7.

247
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,710
All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
involved, for the first time in her life.

248
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,036
Then I'm just leaving the house
and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

249
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,115
Oh, no.

250
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,869
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
"Tash, you got a boyfriend?

251
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,913
Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
give your mother another grandchild?

252
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,190
You know she nearly 60. She getting old."

253
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,229
Aargh!

254
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,636
I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
I won't be getting married soon,

255
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,433
and, no, I won't be investing
in a mortgage in the near future,

256
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,959
thank you very much."

257
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,514
- Then I just closed the door and left.
- End of.

258
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,278
- You cooking?
- Yeah, are you cooking?

259
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,038
I'm cooking with gas. What we having?

260
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,672
- Food.
- That makes a change.

261
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,199
- Are you hungry?
- I'm ravishing.

262
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,435
- Aren't you just.
- Thank you.

263
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,754
How did it go today?

264
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,916
What, with my flying flock of feathered friends?

265
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,030
Good, they loved it. Flapping away they were.

266
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,479
- Were they?
- Yeah, bless them.

267
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,910
I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
before they flew out the window.

268
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,313
It was OK, though, was it?

269
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,477
Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky after lunch
just to calm them down.

270
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,239
- What did you play?
- The Rite Of Spring.

271
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,032
I booked my first driving lesson.

272
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,195
- Did you?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,912
- When is it?
- 12 o'clock, Saturday.

274
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,110
Excellent, well done you.

275
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
- I'll set the table.
- Yeah, it's nearly ready.

276
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,631
<i>(Buzz</i> of conversation)

277
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,753
POPPY: Yeah, I know.

278
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,836
ZOE: <i>I love the end of the week.</i>
<i>- You don't say.</i>

279
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,313
- I do, actually.
- Do you?

280
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,759
- Yeah.
- Oh.

281
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,837
You know I take this dance class
on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.

282
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,235
<i>I swear to God, half the kids are bigger than me.</i>

283
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,478
- That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
- No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.

284
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,873
You want to be careful, you know?

285
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,833
You don't want the kids jumping about
expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.

286
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,359
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

287
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,109
but then they spend the weekend indoors,
glued to their Nintendo DS.

288
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,196
Totally. A couple of weeks ago
I came in Monday -

289
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,435
I told Poppy - sat the kids down for carpet time,

290
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,436
asked them what they did over the weekend.

291
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,710
<i>Gorgeous weather.</i>
<i>Not one of them had been out.</i>

292
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,115
They'd all been sitting at home
on their PlayStations.

293
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,516
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
- When they got up, they were wheezing.

294
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,757
- That's pollution for you.
- We always used to go to the park.

295
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,792
<i>- A lot of them don't have parks to go to.</i>
- Yeah, exactly.

296
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,671
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

297
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,551
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

298
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,955
Parents are too frightened
to let their kids play out.

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,639
Even a bit of green by the estate,
they don't let them play there.

300
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,750
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?

301
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,598
They've had a hell of a week.
They're under pressure and stress.

302
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,677
- Tell me about it.
<i>- They get back from work, if they work...</i>

303
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,712
You know. A lot of them are
single mums, they're exhausted.

304
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,639
It's understandable if they don't take
their kids out for a lovely picnic.

305
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,195
It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
you want to find a way you find it, innit?

306
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,515
<i>- Some parents can't be bothered.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

307
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,438
So instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat rooms.

308
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,596
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's worrying.

309
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,234
- Scary.
- Makes me so angry.

310
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,397
A lot of seven-year-olds know more
about the internet than we do.

311
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,670
At least people are talking about it. That's good.

312
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
- Is it?
- Well, yeah. It means we're aware.

313
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,834
I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
It doesn't mean I'll stop.

314
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,950
- As long as you know what will kill you.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,069
Any time.

316
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,112
I know drinking's bad for me,
but, you know... I can't help myself.

317
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,071
- Oh, shame.
- Cheers!

318
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,839
Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
and all who drown in them.

319
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,353
Careful, Poppy, you got your first
driving lesson tomorrow.

320
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,118
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

321
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,071
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

322
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,192
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Oh, it's here. How many fingers?

323
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,593
(Laughter)

324
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,471
(Doorbell)

325
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,268
- That must be for you.
- (Sings) I'm so excited!

326
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,880
You should do some deep breathing
before you get in the car.

327
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,639
(Exhales) Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.

328
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,070
Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
services on standby.

329
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,839
<i>Any excuse, eh?</i>
<i>I know what you're like with firemen.</i>

330
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,393
Hello. Scott?

331
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,956
- Are you Poppy?
- That's me. Nice to you meet you.

332
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,718
Right, the car's just here.

333
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,990
They're not infected! What are you like?

334
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,794
They're clean, I just washed them specially,
honest.

335
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,671
- This it?
- You get in the passenger seat.

336
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,076
- You know it's me learning to drive?
- We have to talk a few things through.

337
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,190
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

338
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,037
- Did you choose this colour car?
- Make yourself comfortable.

339
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,311
- Thank you. Is this your car?
- No, it's the company's car.

340
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,669
- Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
- It is my car.

341
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,995
You said it was the company's car.
Make your mind up.

342
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,474
- Have you got your provisional licence?
- Yep!

343
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,232
There you go. That's me on a bad day.

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,111
- Is that your real name, Pauline?
- Right.

345
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,558
- OK, everything seems to be in order.
- Does it? That's good.

346
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,670
Now, have you ever had
a driving lesson before?

347
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,508
Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

348
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,632
Bunny-hopped down the beach.
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

349
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,716
We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?

350
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,479
We're not going to bunny-hop.
We'll focus and concentrate.

351
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm going to take you to a spot
we take all learner drivers.

352
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,588
- Are you?
- We'll go through the cockpit drill.

353
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,712
- Oh, naughty.
- You'll listen and take responsibility.

354
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,954
I'll see what I can do.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,798
- OK. Put your seat belt on.
- Will do, Captain Scott.

356
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,477
Here we go, gigolo.

357
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,793
- So you spoke to the office?
- I spoke to your boss.

358
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,798
He's not my boss, I work for myself.
I'm my own man.

359
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,549
But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.

360
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,953
(Poppy giggles)

361
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,594
And they told you the price - £22.50 an hour?

362
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,358
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

363
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,436
- We may be cheap but we're better.
<i>- Are you?</i>

364
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,472
You go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.

365
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,669
They don't?

366
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,551
<i>They've just passed their test and charge more.</i>

367
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,271
Bastards.

368
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,233
Us experienced instructors, we go
with small companies and charge less.

369
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,352
- That makes a lot of sense, that does.
<i>- Cheapness is relative.</i>

370
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,994
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

371
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,680
So, do you want the same time every week?

372
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,835
Go on, then.

373
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,678
- Do you or don't you? I need to know.
- Well, if you need to know.

374
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,154
If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.

375
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,111
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

376
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,192
- Do you like working Saturdays?
- I only work half day, Saturday.

377
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,470
- Oh, that's good.
- You're my last pupil.

378
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,799
What do you do for the rest of the day?
Are you going out tonight?

379
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,876
I shall go home and read my book.

380
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,798
Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?

381
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,598
It's a book.

382
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,756
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

383
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,434
- You see three pedals in front of you.
- Yeah, yeah.

384
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,790
Will you put your left foot on the left-hand pedal
and push it all the way down?

385
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,432
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

386
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,869
OK, Pauline.
Please take your boot off the pedal.

387
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,515
Nobody's called me Pauline
since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.

388
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,913
What am I supposed to call you?

389
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,951
- Oh, how about Poppy?
- Poppy?

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,399
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

391
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,829
No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I don't mind.

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,156
OK, Poppy. Your boots are inappropriate
for a driving lesson.

393
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,919
- What's wrong with them?
- You can't control a car in high heels.

394
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,316
I can do a lot in these.
You should see me in these on a dance floor.

395
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,352
- They may be good on a dance floor.
- Not just good on a dance floor.

396
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,435
They are "Oooh".

397
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,232
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

398
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,716
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
but they're not suitable for driving.

399
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,829
You're funny.

400
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,269
Now, next week
I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.

401
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,437
- I don't look any good in them.
- It's not how you look, it's how you drive.

402
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,074
I'll see what I can rustle up for you, Scott.
Leave it to me.

403
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,439
Right, you see three mirrors -

404
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,869
your two side-view mirrors
and your rear-view mirror.

405
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,673
- They make a golden triangle.
- Is that like the pubic triangle?

406
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,395
It's a pyramid and at the top of it
you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.

407
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,318
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

408
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,430
- You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
- No!

409
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,755
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
thank you.

410
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,553
It's not Lucifer. There are
two fallen angels before Lucifer.

411
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,275
- There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
- I don't have them in my phone book.

412
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,673
- Bear with me.
- Where is he?

413
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,119
- Bear with me.
- I can't see him.

414
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,593
- It's a teaching tool.
- Is it?

415
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,756
Let me explain something to you about teaching.

416
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,588
The teacher's job is to bring out good habits
in the pupil and to get rid of bad habits.

417
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,200
He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking.

418
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,629
And he does that by creating clear
and distinct images

419
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,272
that are easy for the pupil to retain.

420
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,231
- Oh, does he, now?
- Yes.

421
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,316
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

422
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,033
You remember. You will remember
Enrahah till the day you die

423
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,399
and I will have done my job.

424
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,318
Why don't you have something nice up there
like a giant strawberry?

425
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,952
Believe you me, it works.

426
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,797
- OK, stop!
- What am I doing now?

427
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,274
Please take your hand off the gear.
Off the gear stick!

428
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,799
- All right.
- Foot off the pedal.

429
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
- I'm not touching anything.
- Let me explain to you something.

430
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,512
This car is my livelihood.
This car is how I earn my living.

431
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,676
- I don't know how you earn your living.
- Yeah.

432
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,518
But if I walked into your pub
or your discotheque or your club

433
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,028
and I walked up to the DJ
and I scratched all his records,

434
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,354
or I smashed all the glasses,

435
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,552
and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know
what I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.

436
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,318
There is only one problem with that.

437
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,716
I don't own a bar or a disco.
I'm just a primary school teacher.

438
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,831
- Are you?
- Afraid so, kiddo.

439
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,677
Are you a Satanist, Scott?

440
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,474
- No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
- Are you the Pope, then?

441
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,193
- That's the same thing.
- Is it? Does he know that?

442
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,152
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
Accelerator, brake and clutch.

443
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,428
# Talking about...
Lovely.

444
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,708
- Good.
- Yeah.

445
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,193
ZOE: What's he like?

446
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,878
- You'd love him.
- Would I?

447
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,036
He made me laugh. He was funny.

448
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,036
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

449
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,913
- Bit of both, actually.
- So, what happened, then?

450
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,235
- He shouted at me.
- What? He gave you a telling off?

451
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,236
He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.

452
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,874
- Bet you wound him up.
- Might set you up with him.

453
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,831
- Is he fit?
- Yeah.

454
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,950
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

455
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,753
SUZY: What do I get out of it?
- You get a shag whenever you want.

456
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,438
When was the last time that happened?

457
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,951
Who's fault's that, eh?
Where are you going? Suzy!

458
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,911
- You all right?
- All right?

459
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,598
- What's going on?
- Come on.

460
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,551
- You shouting at my little sister?
- No.

461
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,591
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- Poppy!

462
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,551
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!

463
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,114
Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.

464
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,271
POPPY: Suze!

465
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,391
Ooh.

466
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,473
- Morning, Poppy.
- All right?

467
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,750
- What's the matter?
- Buggered my back, haven't I?

468
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,472
- Looks like it.
- Trampolining.

469
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,034
- Trampolining? Really?
- Yeah, I go every week.

470
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,752
- What? After school?
- I love it.

471
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,596
Great.

472
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,551
You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.

473
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,716
- Cos I've just started flamenco.
- You haven't?

474
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,638
- It's fantastic.
- I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.

475
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,908
- Careful.
- I'm all right.

476
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,757
- Come along, if you want.
- When is it?

477
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,392
Every Tuesday, 6:30.

478
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,431
- Well, see how you feel.
- All right.

479
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,271
- Morning, Leanne.
- Morning.

480
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,798
POPPY: Stink of urine round here.

481
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,070
- I can't smell anything.
- Have you peed your pants?

482
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,155
Yeah, sorry.

483
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,031
- You're a naughty girl.
- Tell me about it.

484
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,035
Ow!

485
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,274
- You all right?
- Yeah.

486
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,548
Come on, we're nearly there.

487
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,797
- Have you lost your sense of smell?
- Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.

488
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,035
- And your brain. Here we go.
- Go on, then.

489
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,268
Done that.

490
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,753
- All done?
- Yeah, thanks.

491
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,949
OK.

492
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,911
Take care.

493
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,599
- OK, who have we got next?
- Poppy Cross.

494
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,516
Thanks.

495
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,391
Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.

496
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,749
No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
Don't know who she is.

497
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,597
- My name's Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.

498
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,029
- You want to just follow me upstairs?
- Yeah.

499
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,509
- You're big, aren't you?
ZOE: Good luck!

500
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,313
- Just take your time.
- What are you going to do to me?

501
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,590
Ooh! (Laughs)

502
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,756
Makes me laugh.

503
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,394
OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
in your back.

504
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,749
- Right.
- And you let me know where the pain is.

505
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,711
I'll send you a text.

506
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,356
Strong fingers.

507
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,195
(Giggles) That tickles.

508
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,348
- Oooh! Bang on the money.
- OK.

509
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,278
- Ow...
- And this side?

510
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,878
Yeah.

511
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,989
OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
as if you're picking something up?

512
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,076
Picking chickens.

513
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,509
No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.

514
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,918
Is it your back?

515
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,949
Sorry?

516
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,719
Cos it can affect everything, can't it?

517
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,391
Like your mood and everything.

518
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,512
- Nice action.
- Lie on your back for me, please.

519
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,075
Must get one of these. Come in very handy.

520
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,473
Oooh! Ow.

521
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,752
OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
yourself onto your side, facing me.

522
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,358
You don't ask for much do you, eh?

523
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,630
I'm going to feel the muscles in your spine again.

524
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,879
Ooh.

525
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,676
Oh!

526
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,951
# What-d'you-ma-call-it,
ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!

527
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,353
OK.

528
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,470
All right, lie back.

529
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,388
There we go.

530
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,079
There's a joint in your spine that's jammed up.

531
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,314
Oh, no.

532
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,555
- Would you like me to release it?
- Is it serious?

533
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,955
- It's not too bad.
- What you going to do? Will it hurt?

534
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,911
It may for a few days.

535
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,516
- Go on, then. Go for your life.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

536
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,039
If you're quick.

537
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,074
OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
feel a short sharp click in your back.

538
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,038
OK? Breathe in. And...

539
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,958
Oh. Wait a minute. (Giggles)

540
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,991
OK. Are you ready?

541
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,268
Yeah.

542
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,470
- OK, breathe in...
- (Exhales)

543
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,159
- OK. (Inhales)
- And release.

544
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,634
(Snap)
- Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!

545
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,148
OK. Just relax for me.

546
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,596
Didn't know you were going to do that.

547
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,596
Ooh.

548
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,596
<i>Just relax and breathe normally.</i>

549
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,551
(Exhales deeply)

550
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,958
- (Sighs)
<i>- OK, would you like to sit up for me?</i>

551
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,911
Yeah.

552
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,399
Will this be a regular occurrence,
chopping and changing?

553
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,398
- Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
- I've got a life too, you know.

554
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,079
- I had to make an appointment.
- Isn't this an appointment?

555
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,838
I couldn't help it.

556
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,235
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

557
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,191
Sounds like fun.

558
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,039
Having a bad day, are you?

559
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,674
- I had a bad pupil this morning.
<i>- Oh, no, what did he do?</i>

560
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,676
He was late, he refused to pay his money.

561
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,233
He slammed the door and swore at me.

562
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,238
- You shout at him, did you?
<i>- I drove off, I'm not teaching him again.</i>

563
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,555
- You show him.
- He's rude, he's arrogant,

564
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,239
- he's overconfident and he's too street.
- (Giggles)

565
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,349
You don't like that.

566
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,994
He's been overindulged
and encouraged to express himself.

567
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,917
Express himself! Chop his hands off!

568
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,791
<i>Do you know what it means when they do that?</i>

569
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,558
- Go on.
- How little do they know.

570
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,033
How little do their mothers know.

571
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,632
And they smell.

572
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,108
It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?

573
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,350
Fancy meeting you here, hey? (Laughs)

574
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,715
You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.

575
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,592
OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.

576
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,073
- Steady progression.
- Sorry.

577
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,317
Take your foot off the brake.
There's no need to put your foot on the brake.

578
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,590
- Do you know what's doing that?
- What is doing that?

579
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,393
- Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
- No, I was taking my time.

580
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,795
- I panicked.
- Your boots, they're inappropriate.

581
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,829
OK, on.

582
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,155
Poppy, come on.
Let's pick up some speed. OK?

583
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,317
- Don't shout at me, Scott.
<i>- Well, don't dilly dally, let's just go. OK.</i>

584
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
- I'm just learning.
- Next left-hand turn. OK?

585
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,315
- You panic me.
- So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

586
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,510
- Gets me right there.
<i>- Enrahah, Enrahah.</i>

587
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,358
Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.

588
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,231
I don't like that, gives me the creeps.

589
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,556
<i>OK, Poppy. Indicate. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.</i>

590
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,636
- Indicate.
<i>- Signal, OK.</i>

591
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,875
- How am I doing?
- Foot down on the brake. Clutch.

592
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,595
You don't want to stall. OK, find your biting point
and peep and creep.

593
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,517
- First gear. Peep and creep.
- First gear.

594
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,915
- Peep and creep.
- Peeping and a-creeping.

595
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,996
- When you get to the end of the road...
- Ooh, he's nice.

596
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,112
When we get to the end of the road...
Can you please focus on the driving?

597
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,196
Enrahah, Enrahah.

598
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,435
- Enrahah. OK!
<i>- I... That's a bit weird.</i>

599
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,630
<i>Foot on the brake, clutch. You don't want to stall.</i>

600
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,478
<i>Find your bite.</i>
<i>Can you feel you're slightly on a hill?</i>

601
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,317
- No.
- OK, put the hand brake on.

602
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,796
Find your biting point.
OK, lock your door. Lock your door.

603
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,229
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Poppy, there's two of them.

604
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,157
<i>- Are you taking the piss?</i>
<i>- Lock your door.</i>

605
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,829
- OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
- I don't believe you just said that.

606
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,791
Let's go. On you go. On you go.

607
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,832
- Let's go that way.
- Poppy! Poppy, let's go!

608
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,714
- We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
- Blimey, O'Reilly.

609
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,877
Right, on you go. Keep to the left
of the centre of the road.

610
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,352
Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
You can check it if you like.

611
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,311
See you.

612
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,711
Cheerio.

613
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,431
All right, doggie?

614
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,077
ZOE: Here's another one.
POPPY: <i>Yeah.</i>

615
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,236
Circle, completely red.

616
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,793
What? Like a tomato?

617
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,798
For instance. White horizontal line.

618
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,398
Give us a clue, Zoe.

619
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,876
Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.

620
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,194
Thank you, Miss Marsh.

621
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,596
- You're welcome.
- So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.

622
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,153
- No.
- Right.

623
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,758
- What is it?
- Vertical.

624
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,155
- No, you muppet, the sign.
- That'd be "no entry".

625
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,509
- For what?
- For black boys on bicycles.

626
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,597
- Don't get me started on that again.
- It just popped out of his mouth.

627
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,428
- You can always get another instructor.
- Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?

628
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,040
- Ask me another.
- This is also a red circle.

629
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,275
- Yeah.
- Black car - this isn't a racist thing.

630
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,312
- Glad to hear it.
- Next to the black car is a red car.

631
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,954
That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.

632
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,150
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah to you.

633
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,919
- What is it?
- No overtaking.

634
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,428
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah-ha-ha!

635
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,789
- He sounds like a nutter.
- He is a nutter.

636
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,513
- How's your back?
- It's all right, actually. He sorted it.

637
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,994
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?

638
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,951
He was fit.

639
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,835
Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.

640
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,871
- Stop!
- All right, then.

641
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,831
(Closes book)

642
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,791
Who's going to blink first?

643
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,031
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

644
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,433
No, you have the lasagna tonight.
We can finish the chicken tomorrow.

645
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,119
Look, I can't talk now. See you later.

646
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,149
- Do you think we'll make it?
- Depends on the traffic.

647
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,715
Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!

648
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,477
Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.

649
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,398
<i>Do want to put your bags,</i>
<i>and there's a couple of places.</i>

650
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,668
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.

651
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,679
No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
Take your places. Then we can start.

652
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,631
Here.

653
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,357
I was just introducing myself
to the peoples what don't know me.

654
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,039
It's lovely to see you again
and lovely you bring a friend.

655
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,798
Welcome in my class.

656
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:23,073
So, my name is Rositta Santos
and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.

657
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,396
Or Seville, what you say here.

658
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,838
<i>What is famous for our bullfighting,</i>
<i>our beautiful oranges -

659
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,318
what your English peoples
turn into disgusting marmalade.

660
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,874
<i>Are you going to keep</i>
<i>those sunglasses on, then?</i>

661
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,835
And also is the birth home of flamenco.
(Stamps foot)

662
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,393
Sorry.

663
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,192
Then everybody is ready... I hope.

664
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,833
<i>So, feet in parallel. Hip distance apart.</i>

665
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,436
Pulling up from the waist.
Opening across the chest.

666
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,916
<i>Shoulder blades drawing down to the spine.</i>

667
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,871
Arms relaxed.

668
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,075
And taking the head over to your right.

669
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,394
<i>Feeling that lovely stretch at the neck.</i>

670
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,073
Then to the left.

671
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,751
Not very flamenco, is it?

672
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,797
<i>To the right.</i>

673
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,829
<i>Bringing the head back to the centre.</i>

674
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,551
<i>And relax. Lovely.</i>

675
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,353
So, guys. We're going to reverse the abs now.

676
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,470
Right foot in front.

677
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,357
<i>Lifting up from the elbows</i>
<i>like they got strings attached.</i>

678
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,913
<i>Like little Pinocchio.</i>

679
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,791
Lifting, lifting.

680
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,479
Keeping the shoulders down.
Arms above the head.

681
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,910
<i>Framing the face. Here I am...proud.</i>

682
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,435
Then bringing the arms down in front.
Pressing, pressing, pressing.

683
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,190
<i>Keeping the tension,</i>
<i>keeping the strength, but fluid as well.</i>

684
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,872
Then lifting up again from the elbows.
Like the eagle spreading his wings.

685
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,196
<i>Beautiful, angry, ferocious.</i>

686
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,791
And, guys, when you're lifting up
your eagle wings,

687
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,154
<i>remember that this dance comes from the pain,</i>
<i>from the suffering</i>

688
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,918
of los gitanos...

689
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,633
erm... what you say, "the gypsies".

690
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,956
I know this word not politically correct,

691
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,549
but these guys,
they been squashed down by society

692
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,990
<i>for centuries, centuries, and they say,</i>

693
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,112
"We don't need this. We got pride.

694
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,991
We got dignity.

695
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,998
We got heart. We got flamenco."
(Stamps foot)

696
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,958
They say, "This... my space."

697
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,036
<i>My space.</i>
(Stamps twice)

698
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,911
My space.
(Stamps again)

699
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,838
My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.

700
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,711
ALL: My space.
- (Stamping)

701
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,591
- And again.
- My space!

702
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,517
- Vamos! Vamos!
- My space!

703
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,437
- And again.
- My space!

704
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,630
<i>- Vamos, vamos.</i>
- My space!

705
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,511
- With meaning.
- My space!

706
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,675
But, guys.

707
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,789
My space!

708
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,149
- One more time.
- My space!

709
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,589
- With expression.
- My space!

710
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,676
- I don't believe it.
- My space!

711
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,473
<i>OK, guys. I'll give you two counts in.</i>

712
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,399
<i>Then we're going to stamp</i>
<i>and clap the compás, OK?</i>

713
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,668
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

714
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,631
(Stamping and clapping)

715
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,558
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

716
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,751
Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
Where is the blood?

717
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,153
This is flamenco.

718
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,158
That clapping, so polite.
It's like the end of the opera.

719
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,590
"Excuse me, how many sugar
you want in your tea?"

720
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,629
(Laughter)

721
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,309
This woman been spending
every Wednesday afternoon for a year

722
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,715
with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.

723
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,639
This guy been having an affair
for five years with your best friend.

724
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,839
Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
your spirit, for five years

725
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,591
betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
what is 22 years old.

726
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,599
You want to kill him.
You want to cut off his balls.

727
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,191
He's such a bastard! I hate him!

728
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,951
Are you all right?

729
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,389
(Door swings open, then closes)

730
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,875
Didn't bargain for that. That was something else.

731
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,399
I know, but all credit to her.

732
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,556
She picked herself up. She came straight back.

733
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,319
As if nothing had happened.
Like a little fireball, wasn't she?

734
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,113
- Not a grain of sentimentality.
- No, wipe the tears.

735
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,752
Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.

736
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,392
I don't think she'd appreciate that.

737
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,159
No! "This is my space, get off me!"

738
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,431
Leaves a nasty taste, though,
exploding her heart all over the floor.

739
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,436
- Then it was "put that away".
- Stick that in a box.

740
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,232
- Get it out another time.
- Perhaps never.

741
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,918
<i>- You'll be lucky.</i>
- I know.

742
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,474
She must be going through some shit,
though, mustn't she?

743
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,672
- She's actually a good teacher.
<i>- Oh, yeah, definitely.</i>

744
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,199
She's going to burn herself out.

745
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,277
I believed her when she said
she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't you?

746
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,629
I don't expect the guys will be back
next week, then?

747
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,955
No! Snip, snip.

748
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,110
- How's your love life?
- How is my love life?

749
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,639
<i>- Nothing doing?</i>
- Not a sausage.

750
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,955
- Are you OK with that?
- Oh, yeah.

751
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,274
<i>- Good for you.</i>
- Cheers.

752
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,117
Cheers.

753
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,314
- How's your Beth?
- Darren's dumped her.

754
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,429
Oh, no.

755
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,710
Just before her 18th birthday. "Thanks, Darren."

756
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,830
- Why do men always do that, eh?
<i>- I know.</i>

757
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,111
Christmas, Valentine's Day.
Boom! They're gone.

758
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,277
- I hope he won't turn up to the party.
- Name off the list.

759
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,198
I'm looking at her and thinking,
"Don't call him. Don't call him."

760
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,198
- "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it."
- You can't say anything, though.

761
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,869
- You've got to let them get on with it.
- You can't help being protective.

762
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,950
Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.

763
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,991
Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.

764
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,759
- Fantastic. What she want to do there?
- Sociology.

765
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,837
- Lovely.
- I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.

766
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,438
That's important, see the world.

767
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,631
- I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
- Nor me.

768
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,830
- You made up for it later, though.
- Didn't I just?

769
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,916
- Where were you?
<i>- All over the place.</i>

770
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,714
Taught in this school in Thailand, six months.
Me and Zoe.

771
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,469
Started off in Australia.
Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.

772
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,355
Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
Then Thailand.

773
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,118
Fabulous.

774
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,278
Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
Loved learning. 60 in a class.

775
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,548
- 60?
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

776
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,670
Fantastic. Great challenge.

777
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,551
- And for them.
<i>- Especially for them.</i>

778
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,589
Yeah.

779
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,833
- Do you want another one?
<i>- I'd love to but I'm driving, aren't I?</i>

780
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,678
Oh, of course you are.
Got to be good. Work tomorrow.

781
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,397
Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.

782
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,954
- I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
<i>- No, you're not good.</i>

783
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,355
You're smug. You're too easily distracted.

784
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,551
You're distracted by squirrels,
by dogs, by children in the park,

785
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,831
by old ladies in surgical stockings,
by half-naked men in their gardens.

786
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,190
- Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
- No, he wasn't fit, he had a paunch.

787
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,789
<i>- I didn't know you were checking it out.</i>
- Keep your eyes focused on the road.

788
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,276
This car is a lethal weapon.
Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.

789
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,151
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

790
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,909
Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
see a squirrel sending a text like that?

791
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,794
<i>- Left turn. Mirror, signal, Enrahah.</i>
- Sending a little text.

792
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,359
Enrahah!

793
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,275
I can't believe you're a teacher,
that you're in charge of 40 children.

794
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,436
It took me by surprise, to be honest. It's 30.

795
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,710
30. You have no respect for order.

796
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,718
You are arrogant, you are disruptive
and you celebrate chaos.

797
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,320
- I slipped through the net, didn't I?
<i>- No, you are the net.</i>

798
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,396
Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.

799
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,477
OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

800
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,399
- Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
- Oooh. Don't like this corner.

801
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,510
Get away from the bend.
Get away from the bend.

802
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,552
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?

803
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,669
<i>- Enrahah.</i>
- No.

804
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,756
Enrahah is the eye at the top of the pyramid.

805
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,358
I'm talking about the bottom of it.

806
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,551
Those at the bottom of the pyramid
are kept in total ignorance

807
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,353
of what those at the top of the pyramid
are achieving. Enrahah.

808
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,719
Where are you on the pyramid?

809
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,638
- I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
- Of course you are.

810
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,468
Where are you? That is more to the point.
Where are you and your children?

811
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,830
- Where are we all, eh?
<i>- The next left turn. Enrahah.</i>

812
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,077
- Did you like school, Scott?
- I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.

813
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,031
Oh, that's a shame.

814
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,434
Let me tell you something
about the education system.

815
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,836
- Oh, go on, then.
- It produces left brain prisoners.

816
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,472
- Do you know what that means?
- I do.

817
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,715
Well, I'll tell you. Our brain has two sides.

818
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,309
The left brain and the right brain.
The left brain... Keep going, keep going.

819
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,476
The left brain is information, data. It's dead.

820
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,557
The right brain is individuality.
It's where the soul lies.

821
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,479
And the education system, it works like this -
"I will give you a world view.

822
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,876
And if you repeat my world view,
if you reconfirm my world view,

823
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,708
you will pass your exams and you will
go higher and higher and higher

824
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,194
and you will become a policeman, a magistrate,

825
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,358
a lawyer, a general, a politician,
and you will be happy and you will succeed.

826
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,958
But if you think for yourself,

827
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,231
if you think outside of the box,
then you will be unhappy and you will fail."

828
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,479
That's how the education system works.
Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.

829
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,552
Were you bullied at school, Scott?

830
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,554
We're going to do the next left turn. Enrahah.

831
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,114
Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?

832
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,111
Nick!

833
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,230
Nick, what's going on? Eh?

834
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,191
- Are you all right, Charlie?
- (Mumbles)

835
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,276
Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?

836
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,273
(Stamping and clapping)

837
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,111
ROSITTA: <i>Venga, venga!</i>

838
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,632
<i>Don't bounce.</i>

839
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,398
<i>Keep pounding.</i>

840
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,918
<i>Facing front.</i>

841
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,031
<i>Look in front of us.</i>

842
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,954
<i>It's not salsa. Keep straight.</i>

843
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,469
<i>Venga, mátalo.</i>

844
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,829
<i>Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.</i>

845
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,032
<i>Face the front. Don't look at me.</i>
<i>Uno, dos, tres. Keep it pounding.</i>

846
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,195
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.

847
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,877
Bravo, everybody.

848
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,038
I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.

849
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,676
Much better than last week.
Though of course this is not difficult.

850
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,756
And still could improve.

851
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,870
<i>But...it will do.</i>

852
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,115
For now.

853
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,155
- (Chatter)
POPPY: <i>Be quiet. Get on with it.</i>

854
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,349
<i>What are you writing about? All about you?</i>

855
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,311
That's lovely, Savannah.

856
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,917
<i>Good girl. Married with a prince, yeah?</i>

857
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,157
There we are. You carry on
with your work, there's a good...

858
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,075
Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.

859
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,395
Hold on. What's going on?
Can you stop that, please?

860
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,115
What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?

861
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,949
Are you all right? He hurt you hard?

862
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,276
He hit you? Come here.
We do not hurt our friends.

863
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,914
You come and sit over here.
Get on with your work.

864
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,993
You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
That's not very nice.

865
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,951
That's not what we do to our friends.

866
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,268
- I can't do these.
- Yes, you can. You carry on with that.

867
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,959
- Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
- OK, Chelsea.

868
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,991
What's happening here, eh?

869
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,070
You can talk to me, you know?

870
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,996
<i>Anything you want to say.</i>

871
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,149
I'm here to help you.

872
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,672
Because I'm your mate, aren't I?

873
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,876
- (Softly) Yes.
- Yeah, that's right.

874
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,871
That's what mates do...

875
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,917
...isn't it?

876
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,076
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Yeah.

877
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,756
What's making you so angry?

878
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,751
I want to help sort this out.

879
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,671
Come on, chop chop.

880
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,951
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Poppy.

881
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,719
- Poppy.
- Have you got a minute?

882
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,671
- What's up?
- I think I might have a problem.

883
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,790
- Come in. Sit yourself down.
- Cheers.

884
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,511
It's Nick, really...

885
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,471
(Glass muffles conversation)
