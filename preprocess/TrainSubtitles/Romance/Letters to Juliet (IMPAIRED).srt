<i>but Victor and I aren't together anymore.</i>

1224
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:51,277
<i>- And I guess I came back hoping that...
- Wait, wait. You're not engaged?</i>

1225
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:54,171
No.

1226
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:57,177
<i>But it's too late.</i>

1227
01:35:58,119 --> 01:35:59,984
<i>It's clearly too late.</i>

1228
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:06,016
<i>And it really doesn't matter anymore
because, honestly,</i>

1229
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,095
I love you.

1230
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,027
<i>I can't believe I just said that.</i>

1231
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:20,096
<i>But I do, I love you. It doesn't...</i>

1232
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,539
<i>I mean, it shouldn't matter to you,</i>

1233
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:25,443
<i>- because you're here with Patricia.
- Patricia?</i>

1234
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:27,981
And you should be back with her right now.

1235
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:31,347
<i>Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin.</i>

1236
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,886
- How is that legal?
- No...

1237
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,354
Sophie... No.

1238
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:39,790
No, no, no. Let me explain!

1239
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,988
<i>Sophie, I'm so stupid. There's two Patricias.</i>

1240
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:44,992
<i>There's my cousin, who's here,</i>

1241
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:48,330
<i>and the one
that I've completely forgotten about.</i>

1242
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,235
<i>More importantly, there's only one Sophie.</i>

1243
01:36:52,773 --> 01:36:55,071
Now, would you please come down?

1244
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:59,342
Wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop.
What are you doing?

1245
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:03,213
Charlie, what are you doing?

1246
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:07,277
Listen to me.
Listen to me very, very carefully.

1247
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:13,319
I live in London, a gorgeous, vibrant,
historic city that I happen to love living in.

1248
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,629
You live in New York,
which is highly overrated.

1249
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,028
- Pardon me?
- (EXCLAIMS)

1250
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:21,963
But since the Atlantic Ocean
is a bit wide to cross every day,

1251
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:25,403
swimming, boating or flying,
I suggest we flip for it.

1252
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,071
What are you saying?

1253
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:31,668
And if those terms are unacceptable,

1254
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,344
leaving London will be a pleasure,

1255
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:37,851
<i>as long as you're waiting for me
on the other side.</i>

1256
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:40,684
<i>'Cause the truth is, Sophie,</i>

1257
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:47,053
I am madly, deeply, truly,
passionately in love with you.

1258
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:49,824
You are?

1259
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:52,290
I am.

1260
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:58,331
- Are you gonna kiss me?
- Yeah.

1261
01:37:58,873 --> 01:37:59,965
Yeah.

1262
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:03,304
(GASPS) Oh, my God!

1263
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,210
Charlie!

1264
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:09,876
<i>(CHUCKLING) I can't believe I just did that.</i>

1265
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:11,375
Hi.

1266
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,587
Are you okay?

1267
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,187
Please tell me no one saw that.

1268
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:22,251
Nobody saw it.

1269
01:38:24,665 --> 01:38:27,099
<i>Good. That's good.</i>

1270
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:32,605
Can you move?

1271
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:36,843
Only my lips.

1272
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:40,874
<i>(WHAT IF PLAYING)</i>

1273
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:47,684
<i>What if we were made for each other</i>

1274
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:51,691
<i>Born to become best friends and lovers</i>

1275
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,887
<i>I want to stay right here
in this moment with you</i>

<i>Over and over and over again</i>

1278

<i>A love, a love, yeah</i>

1279
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:10,405
<i>I don't know what to think</i>

1280
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:14,243
<i>Is this real or just a dream?</i>

1281
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:18,251
<i>In my heart is where you'll be</i>

1282

1292
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:05,629
<i>You, and you ask, "Will you marry me?"</i>

1293
01:40:07,868 --> 01:40:11,804
<i>Is it made up in my mind?</i>

1294
