1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,500
 I'M WISHING ON A STAR

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,000
 TO FOLLOW WHERE YOU ARE

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,800
 I'M WISHING ON A DREAM

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,000
 TO FOLLOW WHAT IT MEANS

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,700
 AND I WISH
ON ALL THE RAINBOWS 

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,900
 THAT I'VE SEEN

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,300
 I WISH ON ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO REALLY DREAM 

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,200
 I'M WISHING ON A STAR

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,500
 TO FOLLOW WHERE YOU ARE.

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,700
Girl:
MY NAME IS VIRGINIA AND I LIVE ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST.

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,100
( chuckling ):
WELL, KIND OF.

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,700
MY DAD'S A JANITOR.

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
THAT'S HOW WE GOT
TO HAVE AN APARTMENT

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
ON THE EDGE OF CENTRAL PARK.

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,600
AND YOU MIGHT THINK
THAT THE FACT

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
THAT I STILL LIVE WITH MY DAD
IS A BIT SAD AND...

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,400
WELL, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT...

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
OH!

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,200
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,
I'M ALL HE'S GOT, REALLY

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
AND I'M SORT OF PERMANENTLY

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100
BETWEEN BOYFRIENDS
AT THE MOMENT.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
SO, YOU KNOW...

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,500
I'M JUST A WAITRESS
AT THE GRILL ON THE PARK

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
BUT ONE DAY, I'M GOING
TO FIND A PARTNER

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,200
AND OPEN A RESTAURANT
OF MY OWN.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
ALL I NEED'S A GOOD MAN
WHO'S INTERESTED IN FOOD.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
DID YOU SEE THIS?

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,500
THIS HAS
BEEN CHEWED.

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
IT'S NOT MY JOB.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
THIS IS AN ELECTRICIAN'S JOB,
BUT WHO GETS TO DO IT?

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,100
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,800
TO WORK, DAD, LIKE
I DO EVERY DAY.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,100
OH. UH, ON THE WAY BACK...

34
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,700
USE THE STAIRS.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
JUST IN CASE.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
( cawing loudly )

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,200
WHO'S THERE?

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
SO, WHERE EXACTLY ARE WE GOING?

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
TO BEANTOWN, IN THE SOUTHWEST
CORNER OF YOUR KINGDOM, SIR.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
YOU'RE ACCEPTING

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
THE THRONE THAT
THE CRAFTSMAN THERE

42
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
HAVE MADE FOR
YOUR CORONATION.

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
WELL, IS IT MUCH FURTHER?

44
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,200
CAN'T WE STOP
AND GO HUNTING OR SOMETHING?

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,400
VERY SHORTLY,
SIR.

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
WE MUST MAKE A BRIEF STOP

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,300
AT THE SNOW WHITE
MEMORIAL PRISON.

48
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
( sighs )

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
I HATE THESE OUTER PROVINCES.

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,600
THE PEOPLE ARE SO COMMON.

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
YOUR STEPMOTHER
HAS APPLIED FOR PAROLE AGAIN

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
WHICH WE WILL, OF COURSE,
TURN DOWN.

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,800
OH...

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
IT'S SIMPLY A ROUTINE
COURTESY VISIT.

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
STOP IT!

56
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,200
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
CALL YOURSELVES TROLLS?

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,700
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
SORRY, DAD.

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
SORRY, DAD.

61
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,100
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I COME AND RESCUE YOU.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
DAD, TAKE OFF
THE MAGIC SHOES.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
I CAN HANDLE THEM.

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
( groaning )

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,700
Father:
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M STARTING TO THINK?

67
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
THAT THE ONLY KIND
OF PEOPLE

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,400
THEY WANT
IN THIS COUNTRY

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
ARE GUYS LIKE ME.

70
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,800
YOU KNOW, GUYS WHO WILL WORK
FOR SCRAPS, DO SIX JOBS...

71
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,600
BASICALLY,
BEND OVER AND TAKE IT.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,100
WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING, DARLING?

73
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,200
TEN, 15 YEARS TOPS

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
THIS COUNTRY IS FINISHED
AS A DEMOCRACY.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,300
AS A CARING SOCIETY, WHERE
PEOPLE DO THINGS FOR EACH OTHER

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
WE'RE DONE, WE'RE FINISHED

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
WE ARE OUT
OF HERE.

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
YOUR BARBECUE RIBS
ARE ON TOP OF THE MICROWAVE.

79
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
( bell dings )

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,900
TONY

81
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,700
I HAVE BEEN CALLING
THIS ELEVATOR FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR.

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,900
I THOUGHT YOU
FIXED IT.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
I DID, SIR,
BUT IT'S BROKEN AGAIN.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
DON'T TAKE
ALL NIGHT.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,900
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK
AT THAT BOILER.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
IT'S DRIVING
EVERYBODY CRAZY.

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
THERE'S AIR
IN THE PIPES.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
THE WHOLE SYSTEM'S GOT
TO BE DRAINED AND BLED.

89
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Tony:
YES, SIR.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,300
I JUST HAVE TO FIX
THE LEAK IN NUMBER NINE

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,400
AND THEN I'M ON IT.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
TONY, I AM ONLY GOING
TO TELL YOU THIS ONCE.

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
WHO WOULD
LOVE YOUR JOB--

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
AN AWFUL LOT
OF PEOPLE.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,300
YES, SIR.

97
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
DRAIN THE SYSTEM...

98
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,100
I'D LIKE TO DRAIN HIS SYSTEM.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,900
BYE, DADDY.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Tony:
OH, OH, OH, LISTEN.

101
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
DON'T GO THROUGH
THE PARK. PROMISE?

102
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
YUP.

103
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
YOU GOT A COAT?

104
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,400
YOU'RE GOING TO GET COLD.

105
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,300
OH, WHAT DID YOU
FIX ME FOR DINNER?!

106
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,200
Woman:
WAIT!

107
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,800
COME TO ME.

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
( snorting )

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,200
WELL, THIS IS MARVELOUS,
ISN'T IT?

110
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
NOT EXACTLY THE RED
CARPET TREATMENT.

111
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
I'M SURE THEY WON'T
HAVE FORGOTTEN

112
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
ABOUT OUR VISIT,
YOUR MAJESTY.

113
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,000
CHECK IT OUT!

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

115
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,000
"MAXIMUM SECURITY."

116
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,700
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HERE!

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,900
DAD, NO ONE'S
EVER ALLOWED IN THERE.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
THIS IS WHERE
THEY KEEP THE QUEEN.

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,600
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

120
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,400
NO, DAD, DAD, PLEASE.

121
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,700
THIS COULD BE A TRAP.

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,100
DAD, DON'T.

123
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,000
NO, DAD!

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Woman:
OPEN THE DOOR.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
OPEN THE DOOR

126
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,900
TO EVERYTHING YOU DESIRE.

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,900
GILES?

128
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,800
GILES?

129
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
HELLO?

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
GILES!

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,300
HELLO, PRINCEY!

132
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,700
( laughing )

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
DID THAT HURT?

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,700
I'D LIKE

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,900
YOU TO MEET
MY SISTER.

136
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
NOW, HE'S MINE.

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I GET THE FIRST SHOT.

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
YOU WERE FIRST
LAST TIME.

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,100
I ALWAYS GET THE FIRST...

140
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300
Woman:
ENOUGH!

141
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,200
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM YOUR CASTLE, WENDELL.

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
HAVE STAYED THERE.

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,900
MY SILLY
LITTLE STEPSON.

144
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
YOU... YOU...
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
ON THE CONTRARY.

146
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,400
I THINK THAT YOU WILL
BEG AT MY FEET FOR FOOD.

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,600
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

148
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,500
THIS IS A VERY
SPECIAL KIND OF DOG.

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
THIS IS A MAGICAL DOG.

150
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,900
I HOPE YOU LIKE
DOGS, WENDELL.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,500
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AS ONE.

152
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
( laughing )

153
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,500
( barking )

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,300
COME, COME, PRINCE WENDELL

155
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
YOU DON'T GREET PEOPLE
ON ALL FOURS

156
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
DO YOU?

157
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,800
( troll laughing )

158
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,800
Troll:
GET HIM!

159
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
BRING HIM BACK TO ME

160
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,100
ALIVE!

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,100
WE'LL GET HIM.

162
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,300
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

163
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
HE CAN'T ESCAPE.

164
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
WE'RE IN A PRISON.

165
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Queen:
WELL, YOUR HIGHNESS...

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
JUST WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

167
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,200
WH-WH-WH-WH...

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,900
WHERE'S MY TAIL GONE?

169
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Virginia:
I GUESS YOU GET TO A CERTAIN AGE

170
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
AND YOU REALIZE
THAT NOTHING EXCITING

171
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
IS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

172
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,400
MAYBE THAT'S
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

173
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
JUST HAVE QUIET LIVES.

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,100
( prisoners shouting )

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Man:
GIVE US SOME FOOD, SAY.

176
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,400
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY FOOD
SINCE YESTERDAY.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
LET US OUT.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
COME ON--
JUST GIVE US THE KEY.

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,800
LET US OUT.

180
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,300
YOU.

181
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
HELLO.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,700
WHAT ARE YOU?

183
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,000
ME?

184
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,500
A VERY, VERY FINE CHAP...

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,100
DO NOT MAKE ME ASK AGAIN.

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
I'M A...

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,700
SHH...

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,100
HALF-WOLF.

189
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,200
IF I GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
YOU MUST AGREE TO SERVE ME
WITHOUT QUESTION.

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,700
OH, BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER.

192
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
I AM YOUR WOLF.

193
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,600
"LOYALTY" IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,100
I'VE TURNED PRINCE WENDELL
INTO A DOG.

195
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,200
GOOD IDEA.

196
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,400
FIND HIM BEFORE THE TROLLS.

197
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,900
OH... TROLLS!

198
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,000
WAIT!

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
GIVE YOUR WILL TO ME.

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
BE MINE

201
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,000
TO SUMMON
AND CONTROL.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,400
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

203
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,100
YEAH.

204
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,900
( grunting )

205
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
( barks )

206
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Wolf:
HUFF... PUFF.

207
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,700
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

208
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
OH...! OH!

209
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,600
WOW!

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,900
Troll 1:
SUCK AN ELF!

211
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,300
WHERE ARE WE?

212
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,600
WOW.

213
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,600
WOW, GET A LOOK
AT THAT.

214
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,900
THIS ISN'T PART
OF THE NINE KINGDOMS.

215
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
THIS IS A MAGICAL PLACE.

216
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,100
LOOK AT ALL THOSE LIGHTS!

217
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Troll 2:
THEY MUST GO THROUGH A TON OF CANDLES!

218
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Troll 3:
MAYBE WE SHOULD CLAIM THIS KINGDOM!

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,700
THAT'S A SENSATIONAL IDEA.

220
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,300
LET'S GRAB IT
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES.

221
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
I HEREBY

222
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,400
CLAIM THIS LAND

223
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
AND ALL ITS
INHABITANTS

224
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
IN THE NAME
OF THE TROLL NATION.

225
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
HENCEFORTH,
IT SHALL BE KNOWN AS...

226
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,600
WHAT SHALL WE CALL IT?

227
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,600
( gasping )

228
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
THE TENTH KINGDOM!

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,900
AH.

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
All:
THE TENTH KINGDOM!

231
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,900
IN A MONTH, I WILL
HAVE CRUSHED THE HOUSE OF WHITE.

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,900
I WILL HAVE WENDELL'S CASTLE
AND HIS KINGDOM

233
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
AND FOR HELPING ME TO ESCAPE

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,200
YOU MAY HAVE HALF HIS KINGDOM
TO RULE.

235
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,000
HALF THE FOURTH KINGDOM--
BUT IT'S HUGE.

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

237
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
SIMPLY ALLOW ME THE USE
OF YOUR CHILDREN

239
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
UNTIL THEY'VE CAPTURED
THE PRINCE FOR ME.

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
THAT'S ALL?

241
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,900
TELL NO ONE WHAT
YOU'VE SEEN, OF COURSE.

242
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
DO I GET TO CHOOSE...

243
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,800
WHICH HALF OF THE KINGDOM
I WANT?

244
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,400
( moaning softly )

245
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
( moaning )

246
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,000
OH, MY GOD,
I'VE KILLED IT.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
ARE YOU OKAY?

248
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
OH, I'M SORRY.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
( whimpers )

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
WHERE'S YOUR MASTER?

251
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,400
HOW COME YOU
DON'T HAVE A COLLAR?

252
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
( trolls grumbling in distance )

253
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,100
COME ON, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

254
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
( grunts )

255
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,600
Troll 2:
AH...

257
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
HELLO.

261
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,700
OH, MY WALLET.

262
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
( sighs )

263
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
Troll 2:
LOOK AT THIS.

264
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,000
IT'S NOT EVEN LEATHER.

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,300
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
SHOES IN HERE?

266
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,200
WHAT'S THIS?

267
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,200
( groaning )

268
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,200
( grunts )

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,700
 ...Night fever, night fever

270
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,100
 We know how to do it...

271
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,200
MORE MAGIC.

272
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,700
( faintly ):
 Night fever, night fever...

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,400
( distant howling )

274
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400

( howling continuing )

276
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
NO.

277
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
VIRGINIA, JUST LEAVE.

278
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
GO.

THERE.

282
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT.

283
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,000
AHA!

284
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000

HI.

306
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,000
Woman:
OH, AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, HUH?

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,100
I'VE BEEN
COVERING FOR YOU.

308
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
THANK YOU.

309
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
YOUR HEAD...

310
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,200
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

311
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
I SMASHED MY BIKE
AND I LOST MY WALLET

312
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,200
AND I'VE PICKED UP
A NEW BOYFRIEND.

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,200
OH...

WELL, HELLO.

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
I HIT HIM WITH MY BIKE

317
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,700
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S HURT.

318
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
HE'S NOT BLEEDING
OR ANYTHING.

319
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

320
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,900
I DON'T KNOW. HE
DOESN'T HAVE A COLLAR.

321
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,400
UH-HUH...
COME ON, LET'S SEE, HUH?

322
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,900
YOU LOOK LIKE A PRINCE

BUT HUFF PUFF...

335
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
A WOLF'S GOT TO EAT,
HASN'T HE?

336
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
CAN'T WORK ON
AN EMPTY STOMACH.

337
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
HELLO.

338
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,000
( sniffing )

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
( gasping ):
I SMELL DOG!

340
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
WOULD YOU
BELIEVE IT?

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,400
WORK AND PLEASURE COMBINED.

342
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN STAY IN HERE

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
AND I'LL CHECK
ON YOU WHEN I CAN.

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,000
DON'T MAKE A NOISE
OR YOU'LL GET ME THE SACK.

345
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
( barks )

346
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
SHH!

347
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
( whispering ):
QUIET OR I'LL PUT YOU OUTSIDE.

348
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Woman:
SO, THE SPECIALS ARE

349
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,000
Wolf:
LAMB?! LAMB...

350
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,400
NEW SEASON'S LAMB, I
HOPE-- YOUNG AND JUICY

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
AND FROLICKING
PROVOCATIVELY

352
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,800
IN THE FIELDS,
BOUNCING UP AND DOWN

353
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,400
WITH SOFT, FLUFFY WOOL.

354
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
( gasps )

355
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,800
STOP IT.

356
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.

357
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,300
SOME SHEPHERDESS

358
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,100
NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION
TO THE FLOCK

359
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
PROBABLY ASLEEP,
IF I KNOW LITTLE GIRLS...

360
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,500
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO EAT HER.

361
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
( chuckles )

362
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,300
NOT IF THERE'S
A LAMB FILET

363
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
OR A NICE FAT
RACK OF CHOPS!

364
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,400
I'M NOT GREEDY!

365
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
WELL, I AM GREEDY.

366
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,900
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I JUST SAID THAT.

367
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,300
I HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL APPETITE.

368
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,300
BORN TO GORGE...

369
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
THAT'S ME.

370
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,700
( horn honking )

371
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,200
( yells )

372
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,300
SUCK AN ELF!

373
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
( horns honking )

374
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
( grunting )

375
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Troll 1:
ALL RIGHT.

376
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,300
( brakes squealing )

377
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100

378
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,900
( radiator hissing )

379
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
( yelling )

380
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
( hissing louder )

381
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
OUR CARRIAGE
IS HERE.

382
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
( laughing )

383
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,000
( music playing softly )

384
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,400
OKAY.

385
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Wolf:
NO, NO!

386
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,500
SORRY, WHAT
CAN I GET YOU?

387
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
RARE IMPLIES

388
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,600
DANGEROUSLY COOKED!

389
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
WHEN I SAY, "RARE"

390
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
I MEAN, JUST

391
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
LET IT LOOK AT THE OVEN
IN TERROR

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,500
THEN, BRING IT OUT TO ME!

393
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,900
NO FRIES, NO
VEGETABLES--

394
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
JUST MEAT!

395
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
RED...

396
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,800
AS A YOUNG GIRL'S FIRST BLUSH.

397
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
OH, I'M SORRY.

398
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,900
I MISSED THAT.
I'LL HAVE A JUG OF MARGARITA, A DIET COLA AND TWO BEERS, OKAY?

399
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,100
( Prince Wendell barking )

400
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,200
AND MY WIFE WILL HAVE...

401
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,600
I'M SORRY,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

402
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
SHE'LL HAVE
A DOUBLE, BIG...

403
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,800
( dishes clattering )

404
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
Man:
...COLD PLATES!

405
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,200
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT

406
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
I'M TAKING YOU OUTSIDE.

407
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
( sighs )

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
( chuckles )

409
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,900
OKAY, CANDY, VERY FUNNY.

410
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
YOU CAN COME OUT.

411
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,000
I SUPPOSE

412
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
YOU WROTE THAT, EH?

OKAY...

417
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,500
BARK TWICE.

418
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,700
( barks twice )

419
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,200
( shrieks )

420
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
OKAY, SO,
YOU GOT THE LAMB SPECIAL

421
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,700
AND SIX GLASSES OF WARM MILK?

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
YEAH.

423

UH... I'M LOOKING
FOR THIS LOVELY LADY

426
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,900
WHO, UH, FOUND MY DOGGIE.

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,700
OH, SO, IT'S YOURS.

428
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,000
OH...

429
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,300
I'LL TELL VIRGINIA.

430
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
SHE'S OUT BACK.

431
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
CAN YOU...

432
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,300
UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING I'M SAYING?

433
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,900
( barks )

434
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
S-STOP IT!

435
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
WELL, WHO'S IN DANGER?

436
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
BOTH OF US?

437
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
( barks )

438
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,900
WHOA.

439
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,800
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

440
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,800
OH, YOU CAN'T
COME IN HERE.

441
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
UH...

442
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
UM...

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,000
SHE MUST'VE GONE HOME,
YOU KNOW?

444
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,700
MAYBE SHE HURT HERSELF
WHEN SHE FELL.

445
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
OH... POOR LITTLE SAUSAGE.

446
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,300
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE SHE LIVES?

447
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
THAT WAY,
I CAN THANK HER.

448
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,400
UH... WELL, I...

449
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHERE SHE LIVES.

450
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
YOU KNOW, UM, I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

451
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,600
OH...

452
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
OH...

453
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,100
YOU CAN TELL ME.

454
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,300
( snarls )

455
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,000
( distant siren wailing )

456
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,300
THIS IS MY STOP.

457
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
YOU GOT TO GO NOW.

458
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,900
( sighs )

459
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
OKAY, YOU CAN
JUST STAY ONE NIGHT

460
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,400
AND, THEN,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

461
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,600
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

462
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,900
( barks )

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,300
I'VE GONE CRAZY.

464
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
HOW CAN I BE TALKING
TO A DOG?

465
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,400
( barking )

466
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
YES, I HAVE.

467
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
DON'T TRY AND REASSURE ME.

468

( snoring softly )

469
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,400
THAT'S MRS. GRAVES

( sighing incredulously )

474
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,900
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM?

475
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,300
( elevator bell dings )

476
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,100

477
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
WAIT HERE.

478
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700

SHH!

479
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,000
WAIT.

WAKE UP.

486
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
( door closes )

487
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Troll 1:

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,200
LOOK.

489
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600

THESE SHOES...

498
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
THEY'VE BEEN

499
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,300
VERY BADLY CARED FOR.

500
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,400
THEY'RE-THEY'RE SCUFFED,
AN-AND CRACKED

501
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,400
AND NEGLECTED.

( crashing )

503
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
YOU HAVE NICE SHOES

504
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,300
AND SO TINY.

505
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,800
WE HAVE HUNDREDS
OF PAIRS

506
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,100
AT HOME.

507
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
SO, WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,800
Virginia:
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE DONE

509
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,800
TO MY DAD?

510
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,900
AW, HE'S JUST SLEEPING.

511
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,100
HIT HIM WITH A BIT OF
TROLL DUST, THAT'S ALL.

512
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,200
"TROLL DUST"?

513
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,400
I AM BURLY THE TROLL

514
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,700
FEARED THROUGHOUT
THE NINE KINGDOMS.

515
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,000
Troll 3:
I AM

516
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,600
BLABBERWORT THE TROLL,
DREADED THROUGHOUT

517
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
THE NINE KINGDOMS.

518
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,700
Troll 2:
AND I AM

519
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
BLUEBELL THE TROLL

520
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,700
TERRIFIED
THROUGHOUT THE NINE KINGDOMS.

521
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,900
( yelling )

522
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,500
( gasps )

523
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,400
( crackling )

524
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,600
Burly:
SO...

525
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
WHERE IS HE?

526
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

527
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,000
Blabberwort:
PRINCE WENDELL.

528
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
WHO?

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THE DOG.

530
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
( yelling and gasping )

531
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
WE ARE GOING
TO COUNT TO THREE

532
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
AND, THEN,
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU

533
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,600
INTO A PAIR OF SHOES.

534
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,200
ONE...
I'LL CUT THE SHOES.

535
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
TWO...
I WILL SHAPE THE SHOES.

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,200
THREE...
I WILL STICK...

537
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,200
ALL RIGHT!

538
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,200
ALL RIGHT!

539
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,800
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE HE IS.

540
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,600
HE'S...

541
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,600
HERE.

542
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,000
HE-HE'S JUST,
UH... OUTSIDE.

543
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Burly:
SHOW US!

544
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,100
TAKE US TO HIM.

545
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,100
( groaning )

546
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500
GO THROUGH THE DOOR!

547
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,600
BE CAREFUL!

548
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,900
SHUT UP, BLUEBELL!

549
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
( elevator bell dings )

550
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
WHERE IS HE?

551
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,200
( bell dinging continuing )

552
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,100
HE'S HIDING...

553
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,500
UH... BEHIND THOSE DOORS.

554
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,900
( grunting )

555
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,200
( yelling )

556
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,700
( gasping )

557
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,900
Burly:
THAT ROOM WAS NOT THERE

558
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
A MOMENT AGO.

559
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,200
YOU ARE CRAFTY.

560
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,500
THERE'S NO ONE

561
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
IN HERE!
OH, YES, HE'S HERE.

562
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,100
I'M... I-I'M JUST GOING
TO OPERATE THE SECRET DOOR

563
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,100
AND SHOW YOU
WHERE HE'S HIDING.

564
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,200
NO!

565
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,800
( yelling )

566
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
IT'S A TRICK!

567
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,000
( screaming )

568
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,000
SUCK AN ELF!

569
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,700
( yelling )

570
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,900
OPEN UP!

571
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

572
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,200
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

573
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,600
DAD'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

574
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I THINK IT'S YOU THEY'RE AFTER.

575
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
( knocking )

576
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
( snoring )

577
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
( knocking continues )

578
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,900
OH, WHATEVER IT IS, GO AWAY.

579
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,500
GOOD EVENING!

580
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,700
TROLLS HAVE BEEN

581
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
TO VISIT YOU FIRST,
I SEE.

582
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,300
NO MATTER!

583
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,000
TONIGHT AND TONIGHT ONLY

584
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,600
I AM AUTHORIZED TO MAKE YOU
A UNIQUE OFFER.

585
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,700
NAMELY, THE END

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,600
TO ALL YOUR PERSONAL
AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

587
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
HEY, HOLD IT A SECOND.

588
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,500
TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
I'M CALLING THE COPS.

589
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.

590
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,900
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY

591
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,400
I AM, IN EXCHANGE
FOR INFORMATION

592
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,100
AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS
OF YOUR DAUGHTER

593
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,900
ABLE TO OFFER YOU
THIS MAGIC BEAN

594
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
WHICH, ONCE EATEN,
WILL GIVE YOU SIX

595
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,400
GLORIOUS WISHES.

596
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
( whooshing )

597
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
IS THIS HER?

598
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,400
THIS CAN'T BE HER.

599
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

600
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
OH, SHE'S SUCCULENT!

601
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,100
WHAT A DREAMY, CREAMY GIRL!

602
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,400
( whimpering )

603
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
( whimpering )

604
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,900
( howling )

605
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,600
( fiercely ):
TASTY, OR WHAT?

606
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,300
( all grunting rhythmically )

607
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,200
( all yelling )

608
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,800
( fierce yelling )

609
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
( exhausted sigh )

610
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
I'VE BEEN THINKING
BACK OVER THE YEARS

611
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,500
AND I FEEL THIS IS QUITE
THE WORST SPELL WE HAVE EVER BEEN PUT UNDER!

612
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,000
WE'VE HAD SOME STINKERS
BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.

613
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
SHE'S A POWERFUL LITTLE WITCH,
THAT ONE.

614
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,900
I THINK...
WE MIGHT BE IN HER POCKET.

615
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
HMM?

616
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
WHAT?

617
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,900
I THINK

618
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,700
SHE MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK US
AND PUT US IN A MATCHBOX

619
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,800
IN HER POCKET.

620
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,700
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

621
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,500
YOU'RE FALLING
TO PIECES.

622
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.

623
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
HOW CAN WE BE IN A MATCHBOX,
YOU IDIOT?

624
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,900
WHERE ARE ALL THE MATCHES?

625
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
( soft boinging )

626
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,300
WHAT THE HELL'S IT DOING?

627
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,900
SIX... BIG WISHES.

628
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
IMAGINE HAVING ANYTHING

629
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
YOU DESIRE.

630
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
AND FROM THE LOOK OF
YOUR MODEST SURROUNDINGS

631
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,100
I'M SURE THERE
ARE MANY THINGS THAT YOU'D LOVE TO CHANGE.

632
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,800
I... OH...

633
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,300
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULD...

634
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,200
UH... JUST GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY APARTMENT

635
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
ALL RIGHT?
( growls )

636
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,200
WELL...

637
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?
NO! NO...

638
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,900
IT'S A STANDARD
MULTIPLE-WISHES DEAL--

639
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,100
SIX WISHES; NO GOING BACK
ON WISHES ONCE MADE;

640
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,800
NO MAKING FIVE WISHES AND
WISHING FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND.

641
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
NOW, COME ON,
IS THAT A FAIR DEAL

642
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,900
OR WHAT?

643
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
NOW...

644
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,800
WHERE... IS YOUR...
LOVELY DAUGHTER?

645
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT HER FOR?

646
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,600
SIMPLY TO RECLAIM
MY LITTLE DOGGY

647
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,900
WHICH SHE FOUND EARLIER.

648
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
DOG?

649
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
THERE'S EVEN A REWARD INVOLVED

650
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,600
WHICH I INTEND
TO GIVE HER PERSONALLY.

651
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,800
( sighs )

652
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
IF SHE'S NOT AT WORK

653
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
SHE'LL BE
AT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S. OOH.

654
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,900
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO TURN VIRGINIA AGAINST ME.

655
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
DOES THIS MOTHER-IN-LAW
LIKE, UH, FLOWERS?

656
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
SHE LIKES MONEY.

657
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT IMPRESSES HER.

658
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,200
ADDRESS, PLEASE.

659
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,600
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

660
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,800
WAIT. HOLD
ON A SECOND.

661
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,300
HOW LONG DOES THIS
TAKE TO WORK?

662
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,000
OH, DON'T WORRY--
THE FIRST THREE HOURS...

663
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,800
ARE THE WORST.

664
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,200
( sighs )

665
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
ANYTHING I WANT, HUH?

666
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,400
( snorts )

667
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
OOH...

668
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,800
'KAY.

669
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,600
ALL RIGHT...

670
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,400
FOR MY FIRST WISH...

671
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,100
( stomach grumbling deeply )

672
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,300
FOR MY F...

673
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
FOR MY F...

674
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,300
( grumbling continues )

675
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,700
( groaning in pain )

676
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,100
Virginia:
HELLO?

677
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,900
Grandma:
WHO IS IT?

678
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,800
IT'S ONLY ME, GRANDMA.

679
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,100
HI.

680
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,900
( laughing ):
FOR A MOMENT THERE

681
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR MOTHER.

682
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,400
( laughs )

683
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,200
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

684
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,700
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I STAYED THE NIGHT TONIGHT?

685
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,900
YOU KNOW,
SHE'LL COME BACK ONE DAY.

686
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,200
SHE'LL JUST...
SWAN IN WITHOUT A WORD.

687
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,100
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE COULD BE IN ASPEN, DO YOU?

688
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
SHE ALWAYS
LOVED THE SNOW.

689
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,000
( laughing ):
WELL...

690
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,300
I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE
COME BACK BY NOW.

691
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,000
I DON'T KNOW, 14 YEARS
IS A LONG TIME FOR APRES-SKI.

692
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,100
DON'T BE CHEAP, DEAR.

693
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
( Prince barking )

694
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,100
( little dog barking )

695
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
GOD... WHAT'S THAT?

696
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
THIS IS A STRAY
I PICKED UP TODAY.

697
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,100
WELL, JUST KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM ROLAND.

698
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
HE'S PROBABLY GOT FLEAS.

699
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,800
AW, YOU DON'T
HAVE FLEAS.

700
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,100
DO YOU HAVE
FLEAS? NO. SHH.

701
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,400
SHH.

702
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,400
( Roland barking )

703
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
THANKS.
YOU KNOW

704
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,500
YOU COULD STILL BE SOMETHING
IN SOCIETY, VIRGINIA.

705
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
I HAVE CONNECTIONS, YOU KNOW.

706
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,200
YOUR MOTHER'S DEBUT
AT THE RITZ CARLTON

707
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,600
WAS... AH...

708
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,100
A CORONATION.

709
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,700
AT NINETEEN

710
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,800
SHE COULD HAVE HAD ANY BACHELOR
IN THE WHOLE OF NEW YORK...

711
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,900
AND WHAT DOES SHE END UP WITH?

712
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
DAD.

713
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
DAD.

714
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,100
DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE
THE WAY SHE DID, VIRGINIA.

715
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,300
I CAN SEE THE WHOLE THING
HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN.

716
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,900
YOU'RE A WAITRESS,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

717
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO MEET?

718
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,900
SOME... ELIGIBLE
SHORT-ORDER COOK?

719
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,400
( Virginia laughing )

720
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,000
NO.

721
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
( knocking on door )

722
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,700
( knocking louder )

723
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,500
UH... SO, OF COURSE

724
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,000
YOU NEVER FIXED THE PIPES
LIKE YOU PROMISED--

725
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,500
THAT I'VE COME TO EXPECT--

726
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,500
BUT THIS!

727
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,900
I CAN, UM... THIS...

728
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,000
I CAN EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS,
AND I'M GOING TO...

729
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,900
I'LL GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY,
MR. MURRAY. NO.

730
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
"I'M GOING TO GET ON IT"
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

731
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,800
I WANT YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER
OUT OF THIS APARTMENT TODAY!

732
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,600
YOU'RE FIRED!

733
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,700
FIRE... FIRED?
NO, PLEASE, MR. MURRAY...

734
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,100
WHAT, YOU BIG JERK?

735
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,500
I WISH
YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY

736
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,400
WOULD KISS MY ASS

737
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
AND BE MY SLAVES
FOREVER.

738
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,100
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

739
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,600
OH, MASTER.

740
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
( short laugh )

741
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Burly:
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS SPELL WILL LAST?

742
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
IT CAN'T LAST LONG.

743
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
100 YEARS?

744
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
AT MOST.

745
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
MAYBE ONLY 50.

746
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,800
WELL, WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO MAKE

747
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
THE MOST OF OUR IMPRISONMENT.

748
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
AND AGREE NOT TO EAT

749
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,100
EACH OTHER.

750
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.

751
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,800
WE'LL DO
THE HUNDRED YEARS

752
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,500
AND MAYBE IF WE'RE LUCKY

753
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,900
WE'LL ONLY HAVE TO DO
TWO-THIRDS OF THE SPELL

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
AND GET OUT EARLY.

755
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,600
( doorbell rings )

756
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
( gasps )

757
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,100
OH.

758
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I... THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

759
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,300
I DO APOLOGIZE.

760
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,100
I WAS LOOKING FOR
VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER.

761
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,900
I AM SHE.

762
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,700
THAT CANNOT BE.

763
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
HER YOUNG SISTER, PERHAPS.

764
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
HER MOTHER

765
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
PERHAPS.

766
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
BUT HER GRANDMOTHER?

767
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
PAH!

768
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,000
YOU ARE A...

769
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
DAZZLING BEAUTY.

770
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,700
OH.

771
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,600
WELL, I, I DON'T
HAVE MY MAKEUP ON

772
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
OR ANYTHING YET.

773
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
MAY I COME IN?

774
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,800
I HAVE FLOWERS.

775
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
YEAH, BUT WHO ARE YOU?

776
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,300
I AM VIRGINIA'S SUITOR.

777
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,700
HER BETROTHED.

778
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
BETROTHED?

779
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,900
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A FIANCE.

780
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
HOW LIKE HER.
HOW MODEST.

781
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,200
MOST GIRLS WOULD
BRAG AND BOAST

782
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
ABOUT DATING THE HEIR
TO AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE

783
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,300
BUT NOT VIRGINIA.

784
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,600
OH, WELL, DO COME IN.

785
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,800
I'LL, I'LL JUST GO
AND GET DRESSED.

786
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
OF COURSE.

787
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
GET DRESSED.

788
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,000
( humming )

789
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,100
OKAY, WISH MASTER, GIVE ME
A NEVER-ENDING SUPPLY OF BEER.

790
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
TWO?

791
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,900
YOU CALL THAT A WILD NIGHT
WHERE YOU COME FROM?

792
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
OH!

793
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,500
HEY, OH, MURRAY! MURRAY!

794
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,300
MURRAY! YOU GOT
TO SEE THIS.

795
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,000
THE REFRIGERATOR,
IT JUST KEEPS GO...

796
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

797
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,700
I'M WORRIED THAT THEY'RE
NOT CLEAN ENOUGH, MASTER.

798
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,400
SHALL I LICK YOUR SHOES AGAIN?

799
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE.

800
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
ALL RIGHT,
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

801
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER COMING
WITH THAT DOOR?

802
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,700
OH, UH... AL-ALMOST
DONE NOW, MASTER.

803
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
JUST HURRY...

804
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,000
STOP. NO, NO.

805
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,800
ONCE WAS ENOUGH.

806
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,900
HERE. OPEN THIS.

807
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,600
WHAT SHALL I WISH FOR

808
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
NEXT?

809
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
I WISH...

810
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,600
I WISH I HAD SOMETHING
THAT WOULD CLEAN THIS APARTMENT

811
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,400
ALL BY ITSELF, AND I WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO LIFT A FINGER.

812
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,900
( whirring )

813
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
OH, HERE WE GO.

814
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
( gasping )

815
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,900
( laughing )

816
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,000
HERE WE GO.
CLEAN, CLEAN

817
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,400
CLEAN, CLEAN,
CLEAN, CLEAN.

818
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
CLEAN.

819
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,500
AW, I GOT TO GET THIS CLEAN.

820
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,800
OH, OH, LOOK HERE.

821
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,500
OH, THERE'S DUST
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

822
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,100
PICK IT UP.
PICK IT UP. PICK IT UP.

823
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
OH, HERE'S SOME OVER HERE.

824
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
HERE'S SOME MORE. OH...!

825
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,600
( muffled shrieking )

826
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
I AM SO BAD.

827
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,900
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

828
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,500
OH, STILL...

829
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
I SUPPOSE YOU
WOULD LOOK BETTER

830
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,300
SURROUNDED BY POTATOES.

831
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,600
WHERE'S THE GARLIC?

832
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,100
THE ROSEMARY?

833
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,900
OH! WHAT DO I HAVE
TO WORK WITH HERE?!

834
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,200
THREE-YEAR-OLD DRIED HERBS?

835
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,400
( groaning )

836
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,900
AH! YOU'RE NOT GOING

837
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,100
TO FIT IN THE
OVEN, ARE YOU?

838
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,700
NOT IN ONE PIECE, ANYWAY.

839
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,700
 SHEPHERDESS

840
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,200
 MAKES GREATNESS

841
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,100
 THE LITTLE LAMBS ARE LONELY

842
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
 SHEPHERDESS...

843
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
( gasping )

844
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,400
OH, WHAT AM I DOING?

845
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,300
I SHOULD UNTIE YOU.

846
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
HMM.

847
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,500
OH, A POOR OLD LADY

848
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,100
FRIGHTENED OUT
OF HER WITS.

849
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,600
I SHOULD UNTIE YOU...

850
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,600
BUT FIRST I'LL PUT
A DOLLOP OF FAT

851
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,800
IN THE OVEN TRAY.

852
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,100
Virginia:
GRANDMOTHER?

853
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,100
OH! OH... GUESTS ARE UP.

854
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,400
BREAKFAST ISN'T READY.

855
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,900
GRANDMOTHER?

856
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,200
Falsetto voice:
IN HERE, DARLING.

857
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,800
( knocking )

858
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,300
GRANDMOTHER?

859
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,900
Falsetto voice:
IN HERE, DARLING.

860
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,900
GOOD MORNING.

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,900
DO YOU WANT SOME
COFFEE OR TOAST

862
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,300
OR SOMETHING?

863
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,000
HMM?

864
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,900
( whimpering )

865
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,300
WHAT'S WRONG?

866
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,900
YOU GOT A COLD?

867
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,200
( whimpering )

868
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
GRANDMA?

869
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,200
SURPRISE!

870
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,800
OH, BOY!

871
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,900
YOU'RE FANTASTIC.

872
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
YOUR PICTURE DOESN'T

873
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,900
DO YOU JUSTICE.

874
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
WOW!

875
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,100
OH, NO.

876
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,500
HOW DID THIS GET HERE?

877
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,900
NO. NO...

878
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,300
OH, NO.

879
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,600
BY THE WAY,
WHERE IS THE DOG?

880
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,700
SLEEPING IN
IF I KNOW ROYALTY.

881
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,100
OH, YOU SMELL GREAT.

882
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,900
I'VE HAD LITTLE TEASERS
OF YOUR SCENT BEFORE, VIRGINIA

883
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,700
BUT IN THE FLESH.... AH!

884
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,900
PERFUMES ARE NOT FOR ME, NO.

885
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,300
I RESPOND FAVORABLY

886
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,100
TO THE AUDACITY
OF A WOMAN

887
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,100
WHO FLAUNTS HER OWN AROMA,
AND YOU, VIRGINIA--

888
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,200
YOU SMELL LIKE SUNDAY LUNCH.

889
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,400
YOU KEEP AWAY FROM ME.

890
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,200
OH, BEAUTIFUL EYES,
BEAUTIFUL TEETH.

891
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,700
ALL THE RIGHT STUFF
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

892
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,700
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
I AM IN LOVE.

893
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
MMM...

894
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,000
LET ME PUT YOUR
MIND AT REST.

895
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,200
NOW THAT I'VE SEEN YOU

896
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,000
EATING YOU
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

897
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,400
NOT EVEN ON THE MENU.

898
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,900
OH, NOW, I KNOW THIS
IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THE BLUE

899
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,100
BUT HOW ABOUT A DATE?

900
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,100
WE'VE STARTED BADLY

901
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,300
BUT I TAKE
ALL THE BLAME FOR THAT.

902
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,400
COME ON,
GIVE US A CHANCE. PLEASE.

903
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,200
OOH!

904
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
OH, YOU ARE ONE DYNAMIC LADY.

905
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,300
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT...

906
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,900
( howling )

907
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,500
( sighing )

908
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,400
( faint shrieking )

909
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
( shrieking )

910
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,700
OH, MY GOD.

911
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,500
GRANDMOTHER!

912
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,000
OUT OF MY WAY.
OUT OF MY WAY.

913
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,100
WORK, WORK, WORK.

914
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,500
Tony:
NO, NO, NO, NO.

915
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,600
OKAY, OKAY, FINE.

916
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,700
THANK YOU.

917
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,200
THAT'S ENOUGH. GO.

918
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,100
THANK YOU.
GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

919
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,300
MM-MM-MM-MM...

920
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,700
NO. HEY, GET UP.
GET UP. GET UP.

921
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,900
LISTEN, YOU'VE ALREADY
KISSED ME THREE TIMES TODAY.

922
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,200
LET ME KISS YOU
AGAIN, MASTER.

923
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
NO! GO CLEAN SOMETHING.

924
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,800
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

925
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
MASTER, OH,
WONDERFUL MASTER

926
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,600
MY WIFE HAS
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

927
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
OH, REALLY?

928
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,300
WELL, I'LL
TAKE CARE OF HER.

929
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,800
YOU GO GET ME A BEER.

930
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
YES, MASTER.

931
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,400
IT'S MY HUSBAND'S
ROLEX OYSTER.

932
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,400
SOLID GOLD.

933
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,900
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT ONE

934
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,600
OF THOSE CHEAP IMITATIONS?

935
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
OH, NO, MASTER.

936
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,100
WHOA! OH!

937
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
( gasping )

938
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,700
I BOUGHT IT FOR MY
HUSBAND'S 40th BIRTHDAY

939
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
BUT YOU MUST HAVE IT.

940
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,600
ALL OUR POSSESSIONS
ARE YOURS NOW.

941
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,400
MURRAY, I'M GOING
TO TAKE YOUR WIFE OUT

942
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,100
AND BUY HER SOME UNDERWEAR.

943
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,300
OF COURSE, MASTER!

944
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,900
HELP YOURSELF!

945
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,600
Woman:
MASTER?

946
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,700
I, UM, I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
SOMEONE TRAPPED IN THE ELEVATOR.

947
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,400
I CAN HEAR VOICES
AND BANGING.

948
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,700
YES, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED

949
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,300
BUT I'M NO LONGER
MR. FIX-IT

950
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,000
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET
YOUR RICH BEHIND OUT THERE

951
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,200
AND FIX IT YOURSELF?

952
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,400
AT ONCE, MASTER!

953
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,600
I THINK WE NEED
SOME SPENDING MONEY.

954
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:45,200
UM, WISH MASTER,
HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS?

955
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,100
( doorbell rings )

956
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,200
( gasping excitedly )

957
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,400
( chuckles )

958
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,900
( laughing )

959
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,700
OH, YES, I'M RICH!

960
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,900
I'M RICH! I'M RICH!

961
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,200
SAY HELLO TO BENNY!

962
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,600
CAN I HELP YOU?

963
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,000
OH, I HOPE SO.

964
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,700
I'M VERY CONFUSED.

965
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,800
YOU MUST BE
PAUL'S REFERRAL.

966
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,000
HE SAID YOU'D DROP BY
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

967
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT I'M DOING HERE?

968
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,900
LET'S GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER A BIT

969
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,500
BEFORE WE TACKLE
THE BIG QUESTIONS, OKAY?

970
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,200
YEAH. BIG QUESTIONS.

971
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,000
NOW I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU A WORD

972
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,100
AND I WANT YOU
TO SAY THE FIRST WORD

973
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,900
THAT COMES
INTO YOUR MIND, OKAY?

974
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,800
GAME, YEAH.

975
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,000
HERE WE GO. "HOME."

976
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,600
COOKING.

977
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,700
"COWARD."

978
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
CHICKEN!

979
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
"WEDDING."

980
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,100
CAKE.

981
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,300
"DEAD."

982
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
MEAT!

983
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,700
"SEXUAL."

984
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,800
APPETITE.

985
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,400
"LOVE."

986
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,900
( gasps )

987
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,700
TO EAT ANYTHING FLUFFY!

988
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
( grunts )

989
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,100
SORRY. SORRY.

990
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,400
MORE THAN ONE WORD.

991
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
START AGAIN.

992
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,000
Tony:
YOU KNOW, MURRAY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

993
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,800
LISTEN, I WANT EVERYBODY
OUT OF HERE

994
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,800
EXCEPT YOUR WIFE.

995
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,700
I HAD NO IDEA YOU HAD
SO MANY RELATIVES.

996
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,700
OF COURSE, MASTER.

997
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,400
( vacuum cleaner munching )

998
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,400
YOU CAN GO.

999
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,900
BE WITH YOU IN
A MOMENT, MURRAY.

1000
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,600
JUST GOT TO PUCK UP

1004
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800

1010
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,200
STOP!

1011
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,600
STOP! STOP!

1012
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,400
( sirens wailing )

1013
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,900
( officers yelling )

1014
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Officer:
UPSTAIRS! MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

1015
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,000
I CAN'T STOP IT, MASTER!

1016
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,200
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU, MASTER!

1017
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,200

1018
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,500

1019
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,000

SPREAD 'EM!

1028
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
ALL RIGHT!
WHAT HAVE I DONE?!

1029
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,200
BINGO. LOOKIT HERE.

1030
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,700
THE MONEY FROM THE ROBBERY.

1031
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,600
NO! HOLD ON
A SECOND. NO, NO.

1032
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,700
THAT JUST APPEARED
IN FRONT OF MY DOOR.

1033
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,000
I'VE BEEN IN MY APARTMENT
ALL DAY.

1034
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,200
ALL THESE PEOPLE
CAN VOUCH FOR ME, RIGHT?

1035
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,800
All:
YES, O MASTER.

1036
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,200
I'VE BEEN HERE
ALL DAY JUST

1037
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,700
HAVING A BEER WITH FRIENDS.

1038
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,200
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU'RE STILL HOLDING BACK.

1039
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,300
WHAT IS
REALLY TROUBLING YOU?

1040
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,200
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

1041
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,000
DOC, I MET THIS
TERRIFIC GIRL

1042
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,300
AND I REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LIKE HER

1043
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,100
BUT THE THING IS THAT...

1044
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,000
GO ON, SAY IT.

1045
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
SAY IT!

1046
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,400
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER
I-I WANT TO LOVE HER

1047
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,800
OR EAT HER.

1048
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,100
( growls )

1049
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,700
OH, OH.

1050
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,500
OF COURSE,
I BLAME MY PARENTS.

1051
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,000
THEY WERE BOTH ENORMOUS.

1052
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,300
THEY COULDN'T STOP EATING.

1053
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,900
EVERY DAY I CAME HOME
FROM SCHOOL

1054
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,700
IT WAS, "EAT THIS. EAT THAT.
EAT HER!"

1055
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,300
YOU SHOULDN'T PUNISH YOURSELF.

1056
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,600
OH, I SHOULD. I SHOULD.

1057
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,700
I'M BAD. I'M SO BAD.

1058
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,300
I'VE DONE SO MANY BAD THINGS!

1059
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,700
BUT THAT WASN'T ME, YOU SEE?

1060
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,300
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS A WOLF.

1061
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,300
DOC, I WANT TO CHANGE!

1062
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,100
I WANT TO BE
A GOOD PERSON.

1063
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
OH, CAN'T THE LION
CUDDLE UP WITH THE LAMB?

1064
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,300
CAN'T THE LEOPARD
RUB OUT ALL ITS SPOTS?

1065
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,100
THIS IS THE EXACT SPOT
WHERE I FOUND YOU

1066
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,700
SO THIS IS REALLY
WHERE WE HAVE TO GO

1067
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,300
OUR SEPARATE WAYS, OKAY?

1068
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,300
( sighs )

1069
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,600
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ADVENTURE
TYPE, YOU KNOW?

1070
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,100
I MEAN, I'M A WAITRESS.

1071
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
THIS JUST REALLY...

1072
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
THIS ISN'T MY THING.

1073
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,800
WHOEVER THESE PEOPLE ARE
WHO WANT YOU

1074
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,300
THEY CAN HAVE YOU.

1075
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,400
NO, I GOT TO GO.

1076
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
GOOD-BYE. I GOT TO GO.

1077
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,600
( whines )

1078
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,200
HERE IS THE READING
LIST I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOW.

1079
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
OKAY.

1080
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,600
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
AND SEE ME NEXT WEEK?

1081
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,200
OH, BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1082
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,700
I WON'T BE HERE NEXT WEEK.

1083
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,900
UH, UH, UH, UH.

1084
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,100
YOU'RE NOT GOING

1085
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,400
TO INTIMIDATE ME
WITH SUICIDE.

1086
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,900
THAT'S BETTER.

1087
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
OKAY.

1088
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
Policeman:
IF YOU COOPERATE

1089
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,900
AND GIVE US
THE DEALER'S NAME

1090
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,800
MAYBE I'LL PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.

1091
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
"DEALER"? WHAT DEALER?
I'M NOT TAKING DRUGS.

1092
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,100
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER STEALING THE MONEY

1093
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,700
BECAUSE YOU WERE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE

1094
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,200
OF THESE MAGIC
MUSHROOMS, RIGHT?

1095
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
"MAGIC MUSHROOMS"?

1096
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
NO, I DIDN'T TAKE...

1097
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,900
WELL, I SWALLOWED
THE BEAN, BUT...

1098
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I ALMOST FIXED
THE ELEVATOR NOW, MASTER.

1099
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,100
WE WILL BREAK THE SPELL.
TRUST ME.

1100
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,600
I TRUST YOU.

1101
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,300
I TRUST YOU MORE.

1102
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,500
NO, I TRUST YOU MORE.

1103
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,500
YEAH!

1104
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,300
I TRUST HER MORE.

1105
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,200
I TRUST HER!

1106
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,800
I ALWAYS TRUSTED HER!

1107
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,200
SUCK AN ELF!

1109
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,600
Burly:
WE'RE MOVING.

1110
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,400
WE'RE GOING DOWN.

1111
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,400
IS THAT GOOD OR BAD?

1112
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,000
WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER
THE UNDERWORLD.

1113
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,500
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

1114
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,600
( bell dings )

1115

( all yelling )

1116
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,100
THIS ISN'T THE UNDERWORLD,
YOU IDIOT!

1117
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,600
THIS IS WHERE WE CAME IN.

1118
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,800
MAGIC, INDEED!

1119
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,500
HOW DID SHE DO THAT?!

1120
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,800
AH, SUCK AN ELF!

1121
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,100
( Wolf gasps )

1122
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,600
SHEEP! SOMETIMES I LIKE SHEEP.

1123
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,000
OOH!

1124
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,500
EXCUSE ME. I NEED

YOU MIGHT THINK IS USEFUL, PLEASE, MISS?

1126

1127
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,300
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1128

AND IF MY PLAN IS SUCCESSFUL

1129
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,400
I WILL CERTAINLY INVITE YOU
TO THE WEDDING.

1130
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,000
THAT'S MINE.
THAT'S MINE, TOO.

1131
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Tony:
HEY, HEY, COULDN'T WE COME TO SOME KIND OF DEAL?

1132
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1133
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,600
I CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING

ANYTHING WHATEVER.
I'M SERIOUS.

1135
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,800
A HOUSE IN THE HAMPTONS,
BOATS, CARS, WOMEN.

1136
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,000
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

1137
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,800
IT WON'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER
TRYING TO BRIBE US.

1138
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,400
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOSE?

1139
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,700
I WISH I COULD ESCAPE
FROM THIS POLICE CAR RIGHT NOW.

1140
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,700
( chuckling )

1141
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,200

1146
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,200
OH, MY GOD!

NO, WAIT!
YOU HAVEN'T PAID FOR THOSE!

1153
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,900
LOOK, I CANNOT TAKE YOU BACK
TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM

1154
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,200
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

1155
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,700
NO, LOOK, THIS
REALLY IS IT, OKAY?

1156

I DIDN'T DO IT!

1158
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,700
DAD?

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

1161
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,300
DON'T BET ON IT.

1162
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
COME ON!

1163
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,100
FAN OUT, YOU GUYS, FAN OUT!

1164
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,700
IS THAT THE DOG
THAT GUY WANTS?

1165
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,500
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE IT TO HIM?

1166
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,100
DAD, I DON'T THINK
HE IS A DOG.

1167
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,600
HE'S TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING

1168
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,800
TALK TO ME OR SOMETHING

1169
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,900
BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

1170
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
TRYING TO TALK?

1171
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,300
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

1172
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,900
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WATCH THIS.

1173
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,400
I WISH THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING THIS DOG IS SAYING.

1174
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
WHAT?

1175
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,200
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER.

1176
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
BOTH OF YOU.

1177
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,100
IT WORKED.
IT WORKED!

1178
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
IF YOU VALUE
YOUR LIFE

1179
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,400
YOU HAVE TO DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

1180
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
LISTEN! SHH. WHAT?

1181
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
WE HAVE TO FIND THE WAY BACK.

1182
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,100
HE'S TALKING.
CAN'T YOU HEAR HIM?

1183
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,100
NO.

1184
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,900
( police voices coming closer )

1185
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,900
COME HERE.
WHAT?!

1186
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,800
( all yelling )

1187
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,600
WHY ARE ALL THESE
COPS AFTER YOU?

1188
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,400
AND WHY ARE YOU
WEARING HANDCUFFS?

1189
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,900
THEY THINK I DID
A BANK JOB.

1190
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,900
WHAT?

1191
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,400
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

1192
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,300
STOP RABBITING
AND HELP ME FIND THE MIRROR.

1193
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,700
NOW, IT'S A MIRROR

1194
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,400
BUT IT MAY NOT
LOOK LIKE A MIRROR FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

1195
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,200
YOU HAVE TO LOOK
VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.

1196
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,900
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MAGIC MIRROR.

1197
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,600
YEAH, OF COURSE WE ARE.

1198
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,300
( Prince Wendell barking )

1199
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,600
JUST LOOK FOR A PIECE OF FOREST

1200
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,000
THAT DOESN'T FIT.

1201
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I'M SURE THIS IS WHERE...

1202
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,800
LOOK.

1203
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,000
THERE IT IS.

1204
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,700
Tony:
THAT'S WEIRD.

1205
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,800
Blabberwort:
THERE THEY ARE!

1206
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,300
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES,
FOLLOW ME.

1207
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
UH, UH... COME ON.

1208
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,000
( gasps )

1209
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,200
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?

1210
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
I DON'T KNOW

1211
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,400
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S NOT CENTRAL PARK.

1212
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,900
FOLLOW ME.

1213
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,100
THE DOG SAID FOLLOW HIM.

1214
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,900
HURRY UP!

1215
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY?

1216
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,700
WELL, THE
SAME THING

1217
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
THAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, OLD CHAP--

1218
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,400
TROLL DUST!

1219
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S STARTING TO WEAR OFF.

1220
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,800
IS THAT DOG
TALKING AGAIN?

1221
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,000
COME ON.
COME ON.

1222
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,800
SO, WHAT SHALL WE DO

1223
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
WHEN WE HAVE
OUR OWN KINGDOM?

1224
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
AH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

1225
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,500
WE'LL HAVE SERVANTS--

1226
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF SERVANTS

1227
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,600
TO POLISH OUR SHOES.

1228
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
DAD, LET'S GO HOME.

1229
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,700
NO, I CAN'T
GO BACK YET.

1230
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,700
POLICE ARE ALL
OVER CENTRAL PARK LOOKING FOR ME.

1231
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,900
WELL, WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

1232
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,800
SHH! I CAN SMELL THE TROLLS.

1233
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,000
HE SAYS HE CAN
SMELL TROLLS.

1234
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,900
WE'LL HAVE
FOOTWEAR PARTIES

1235
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,600
WHERE YOU HAVE
TO CHANGE SHOES

1236
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,800
SIX TIMES AN HOUR!

1237
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,900
AND ANYONE FOUND
HAVING DIRTY SHOES

1238
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,900
WILL HAVE THEIR FACE SEWN UP!

1239
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,700
( laughing )

1240
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,700
COME ALONG, THEN.
FOLLOW ME.

1241
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,800
WHOA. HOLD ON.

1242
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,100
I'M NOT GOING TO FOLLOW YOU.

1243
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,300
WHERE ARE WE?

1244
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,600
WE'RE IN THE SOUTHERNMOST PART
OF MY KINGDOM--

1245
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,800
WHERE I WAS ATTACKED
BY MY STEPMOTHER

1246
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,100
AND TURNED INTO A DOG.

1247
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,900
THIS IS THE SNOW WHITE
MEMORIAL PRISON, HOUSING

1248
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,600
THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINALS
IN ALL THE NINE KINGDOMS.

1249
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
ALL RIGHT, BACK UP.
THE NINE WHAT?

1250
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,000
KINGDOMS.

1251
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,500
I AM PRINCE WENDELL

1252
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,800
GRANDSON OF THE LATE SNOW WHITE

1253
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,000
AND SOON-TO-BE-CROWNED
KING

1254
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,100
OF THE FOURTH KINGDOM.

1255
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,500
AND WHO
MIGHT YOU BE?

1256
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,100
I'M TONY LEWIS, JANITOR.

1257
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,800
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW

1258
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,300
MY DAUGHTER
VIRGINIA.

1259
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,900
THE "TROLL KINGDOM."

1260
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,600
"RED RIDING HOOD FOREST." WOW!

1261
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,000
WAIT. HOLD ON A SECOND.

1262
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,400
SO WHAT IS THIS?

1263
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,000
IT'S CINDERELLA-SLEEPING BEAUTY
FAIRY TALE STUFF?

1264
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,500
WELL...

1265
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,900
THE GOLDEN AGE WAS
ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO

1266
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,900
WHEN THE LADIES
YOU REFER TO

1267
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,300
HAD THEIR GREAT MOMENTS
IN HISTORY.

1268
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,300
THINGS HAVE GONE DOWNHILL
A BIT SINCE THEN.

1269
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,700
"HAPPY EVER AFTER" DIDN'T LAST
AS LONG AS WE'D HOPED.

1270
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,300
ALL THE RULERS

1271
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,600
OF THE OTHER KINGDOMS ARE
DUE TO ATTEND MY CORONATION.

1272
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,900
SOME WILL HAVE
TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES.

1273
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,700
THE KINGDOMS ARE VAST.

1274
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,200
NO ONE CROSSES THE BORDERS
EXCEPT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

1275
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,700
WHO WAS THE STEPMOTHER
WHO TURNED YOU INTO A DOG?

1276
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,900
SHE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS
AND EVIL WOMAN ALIVE.

1277
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
SOUNDS LIKE MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

1278
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,800
LOOK, WE CAN'T

1279
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,500
SIT AROUND TALKING ALL DAY.

1280
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,700
WE MUST FIND
MY STEPMOTHER'S CELL.

1281
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,300
THIS WAY.

1282
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,000
VIRGINIA,
HE SAID FOLLOW HIM.

1283
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
COME ON. COME ON.

1284
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,500
LOOK!

1285
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,400
THERE'S A DOG BOWL DOWN HERE.

1286
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,200
THAT'S THE DOG
THAT'S GOT MY BODY!

1287
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,300
OH, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!

1288
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,700
WHAT DID SHE DO, THIS WOMAN?

1289
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,800
SHE POISONED
MY MOTHER AND FATHER.

1290
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,700
TRIED TO KILL ME, AS WELL.

1291
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,600
BASICALLY, POISONED
HIS MOM AND DAD

1292
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,100
AND TRIED TO
KILL HIM, TOO.

1293
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,300
VIRGINIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1294
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,400
I... I FEEL WEIRD BEING IN HERE.

1295
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,800
YOU OKAY?

1296
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,100
YEAH. I'M JUST GOING

1297
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,600
TO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE.

1298
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,800
THE TROLLS HAVE BEEN HERE.

1299
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
OKAY, JUST DON'T
GO TOO FAR, OKAY?

1300
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,300
STAY OUTSIDE
THE DOOR.

1301
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,300
VIRGINIA!

1302
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
PRINCE! PRINCE! PRINCE!

1303
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,800
I WASN'T SCARED.

1304
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,400
IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE MUSTN'T
SEE ME AS A DOG, ANTONY.

1305
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,200
IT'S DEEPLY, DEEPLY
EMBARRASSING.

1306
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,600
I COULD CARE LESS

1307
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,500
ABOUT YOU
BEING A DOG!

1308
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,000
VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA!

1309
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,700
WHERE ARE THEY?

1310
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,400
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
TRUSTED TROLLS TO DO ANYTHING.

1311
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,700
BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU SAY.

1312
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,900
I'M THE ONLY REASON

1313
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,200
YOU GOT OUT OF PRISON
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1314
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,600
OF COURSE,
YOUR MAJESTY

1315
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,700
AND FOR THAT I'M
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL

1316
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,600
BUT I CAN'T STAY
HERE ANY LONGER.

1317
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,700
NO ONE MUST SEE
THE PRINCE LIKE THIS.

1318
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,400
( barking )

1319
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,100
HAVE YOUR CHILDREN
BRING THE DOG TO ME

1320
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,700
WHEN THEY RETURN.

1321
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,400
I AM NOT
YOUR LACKEY!

1322
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,600
I AM RELISH
THE TROLL KING!

1323
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,000
YOU WILL DO WELL

1324
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,300
TO REMEMBER IT.

1325
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,700
OF COURSE, YOUR MAJESTY.

1326
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,300
AND I WILL
REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY

1327
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,800
WITH HALF
OF WENDELL'S KINGDOM

1328
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,200
AS I PROMISED.

1329
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,200
JUST EXACTLY WHEN

1330
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,100
DO I GET IT?

1331
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,400
SOON.

1332
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,700
BUT NOW I MUST GO.

1333
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,800
I HAVE STAYED
TOO LONG ALREADY.

1334
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,300
( panting )

1335
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
OH, GET IN
THE CARRIAGE!

1336
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1337
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,000
THERE'S NOWHERE YOU CAN HIDE.

1338
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,700
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
YOU'VE ESCAPED

1339
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,700
THERE WILL BE
ROADBLOCKS EVERYWHERE.

1340
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,700
THEY'LL SEARCH EVERY HOUSE
AND CARRIAGE IN THE KINGDOM.

1341
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,600
NOT EVERY CARRIAGE.

1342
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
SHOULDN'T WE GO
BACK FOR THE DOG?

1343
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,400
NO, WE CAN'T.

1344
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,500
THE TROLL DUST

1345
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
WILL BE WEARING OFF.

1346
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,700
( ringing )
WAIT A MINUTE!

1347
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,800
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

1348
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,200
THEY'RE ALL WAKING UP.

1349
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,600
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1350
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,700
OH, THE QUEEN
WILL BE VERY ANGRY.

1351
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,900
AW, THE QUEEN CAN SUCK AN ELF
FOR ALL I CARE!

1352
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,600
WE'VE CAPTURED
THE WITCH FROM THE TENTH KINGDOM!

1353
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,900
LET'S GO TELL DAD.

1354
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,500
WHAT ABOUT THE WITCH'S FATHER?

1355
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,100
PERHAPS HE'S A GREAT WARLOCK.

1356
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,600
OH, HE'S HANDCUFFED.

1357
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,400
A GREAT IDIOT,
MORE LIKELY.

1358
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,900
I WISH I COULD BE THERE

1359
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,000
WHEN THE GOVERNOR FINDS HIM
IN THE QUEEN'S CELL.

1360
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,300
( laughing )

1361
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,100
Tony:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1362
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,400
I CAN'T FIGHT.

1363
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,700
IT WAS SOME
KIND OF SPELL.

1364
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,100
ME AND THE LADS
BEEN LAID UP FOR OVER A DAY.

1365
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,800
I'VE SEARCHED
EVERY INCH OF THE PRISON

1366
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
BUT THE QUEEN'S
GONE, SIR.

1367
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
I HAVE BEEN
THE GOVERNOR

1368
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,500
OF THIS PRISON
FOR 12 YEARS.

1369
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,800
NO PRISONER
HAS EVER ESCAPED BEFORE.

1370
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,700
THAT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE RECORD.

1371
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,700
WHATEVER
YOU DO, ANTONY

1372
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,200
DON'T TELL HIM I'M A DOG.

1373
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,700
WHY NOT?

1374
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,000
SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO!

1375
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,200
BECAUSE
THE QUEEN HAS GOT

1376
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,600
SOME TERRIBLE PLAN.

1377
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,500
MY WHOLE KINGDOM
MAY BE IN JEOPARDY.

1378
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,100
NO ONE MUST KNOW
I'M HELPLESS.

1379
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,600
ALL RIGHT.

1380
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,200
WHERE IS THE QUEEN?

1381
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,200
I WISH I WAS HOME.

1382
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,400
I WISH VIRGINIA AND I

1383
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,000
WERE BACK IN
OUR APARTMENT

1384
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,500
IN NEW YORK NOW.

1385
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,300
WELL...

1386
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,000
IT SEEMS YOU'RE NOT.

1387
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,500
( coughing )

1388
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,000
( gagging )

1389
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,600
( gagging )

1390
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,300
OH, NO, ANTONY!

1391
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,900
YOU DIDN'T SWALLOW A DRAGON

1392
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,200
DUNG BEAN,
YOU MORON!

1393
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,800
I GUESS THAT MEANS I'VE HAD ALL

1394
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,800
MY WISHES, HUH?

1395
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,400
HOW DID THE QUEEN ESCAPE?

1396
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,600
I'M TELLING YOU, I HAVE NO IDEA!

1397
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,500
THEN WHY WERE YOU FOUND
LOCKED IN HER EMPTY CELL?

1398
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,800
I AM AN INNOCENT VICTIM.

1399
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,500
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH THE POLICE MY ENTIRE LIFE.

1400
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,100
THEN WHY ARE YOU
WEARING HANDCUFFS?

1401
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,200
WELL, BECAUSE I'M WANTED
FOR ARMED ROBBERY

1402
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
WHICH I DIDN'T

1403
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,700
HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH EITHER.

1404
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,700
OH, CARRY ON, ANTONY.

1405
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,000
YOU'RE DOING
SPECTACULARLY WELL

1406
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,400
SO FAR.

1407
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,900
I'M FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

1408
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
I CAME HERE
FROM A DIFFERENT DIMENSION

1409
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,300
LED BY THAT DOG,
WHO IS ACTUALLY PRINCE WENDELL.

1410
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,600
OH, I TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY THAT.

1411
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,900
PRINCE WENDELL?

1412
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,200
LOOK, I CAN MAKE YOU
BREAK ROCKS

1413
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,200
WITH YOUR TEETH

1414
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,800
FOR 100 YEARS.

1415
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,300
( clinking )

1416
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,300
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S THE TRUTH.

1417
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
THAT IS
THE QUEEN'S DOG.

1418
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,500
SHE HAS
BEEN PERMITTED

1419
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,500
TO KEEP HIM IN HER CELL
FOR THREE YEARS.

1420
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,800
DON'T INSULT

1421
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,100
MY INTELLIGENCE.

1422
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,500
I'M NOT. IT'S THE TRU...

1423
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,600
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PROVE IT.

1424
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,100
BARK ONCE
IF I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

1425
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,600
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF BARKING, ANTONY.

1426
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,700
HE IS BEING JUST STUBBORN.

1427
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,100
YOU HAVE TO
LET ME GO IMMEDIATELY.

1428
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,000
I THINK MY
DAUGHTER WAS ABDUCTED BY TROLLS.

1429
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,400
THAT'S ENOUGH!

1430
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,500
I'LL GET THE TRUTH
OUT OF YOU

1431
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,000
SOON ENOUGH.

1432
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
WARDER, REMOVE HIS HANDCUFFS.

1433
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,200
ISSUE HIM
WITH PRISON UNIFORM

1434
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,500
AND PUT HIM IN

1435
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,700
UH... YES!

1436
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,700
PUT HIM IN 103
WITH ACORN THE DWARF

1437
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,200
AND CLAY FACE

1438
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
THE GOBLIN.

1439
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,400
CLAY FACE THE GOBLIN?

1440
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,100
I DON'T WANT TO BE PUT
IN ANY ROOM WITH CLAY FACE...

1441
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,200
NO!

1442
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,400
WHERE'S
MY DAUGHTER?

1443
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
WHAT ABOUT
THE QUEEN'S DOG, SIR?

1444
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,900
GET THE FURNACE
GOING.

1445
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
I'LL SLIP
SOME RAT POISON

1446
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,600
IN HIS DINNER TONIGHT,
AND WE'LL CHUCK HIM

1447
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,700
IN THE INCINERATOR TOMORROW.

1448
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,200
Prince Wendell:
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

1449
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,200
ANTONY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

1450
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,700
YOU HAVE TO GET ME OUT.

1451
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,400
IT'S YOUR DUTY.

1452
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,700
GET HER IN THE BOAT.

1453
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,800
GET HER IN THERE.

1454
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,100
HEY, THAT'S MY BOAT.

1455
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,200
IT'S OURS NOW.

1456
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,000
NOW, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

1457
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,600
( trolls yelling )

1458
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,700
Blabberwort:
SIT DOWN AND STEER!

1459
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,500
( all yelling )

1460
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,600
MIDDLE BUNK.

1461
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,200
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU IN FOR?

1462
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,200
UM... ACTUALLY,
A PRETTY SERIOUS BANK ROBBERY.

1463
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,900
COUPLE OF PEOPLE GOT HURT

1464
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,600
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

1465
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,600
AND YOU?

1466
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,200
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

1467
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,300
I'VE VERY EASILY
AGGRAVATED.

1468
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,400
I'M ACORN.

1469
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,700
GOT ANY METAL
ON YOU?

1470
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,600
KNIVES? FORKS?

1471
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
COAT-HANGERS?

1472
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,600
SORRY.

1473
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,000
IF YOU GET
STABBED...

1474
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,000
SAVE THE KNIFE
FOR ME, WON'T YOU?

1475
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,800
OF COURSE.

1476
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,600
DO YOU LIKE
CARVING?

1477
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,700
WELL, NOT FLESH
OR ANYTHING.

1478
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,100
LOOK WHAT I'M DOING.

1479
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,400
AH.

1480
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,500
YOU'VE GOT REAL TALENT.

1481
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,200
MY NAME'S CLAY FACE,
THE GOBLIN.

1482
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,900
TONY.

1483
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,500
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

1484
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,300
CARVING.

1485
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,300
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?

1486
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,700
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT ENTAIL?

1487
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,200
Bluebell:
ROW!

1488
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,800
Blabberwort:
WHEN WE'RE HOME, I'M GOING TO LET YOU HAVE IT!

1489
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,800
KEEP ROWING.

1490
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
I'M ROWING.

1491
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,200
ANY MINUTE NOW...

1492
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,200
I'M SURE PRINCE WENDELL
WILL ARRIVE

1493
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
TO RECEIVE THE CORONATION THRONE

1494
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,900
WHICH OUR CRAFTSMEN

1495
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,200
HAVE TIRELESSLY SPENT
THE LAST TWO YEARS MAKING.

1496
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,700
HE'S NOT COMING,
IS HE?

1497
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,900
OF COURSE HE IS.

1498
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,900
HAVE NO WORRY.

1499
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,700
I'M SURE HE'S BEEN DELAYED
FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.

1500
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,900
HORRIBLE NEWS.

1501
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,100
THERE'S BEEN A BREAKOUT
FROM THE PRISON.

1502
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,300
THE QUEEN
HAS ESCAPED.

1503
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,400
THE QUEEN?

1504
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,600
THE QUEEN.

1505
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,300
PUT UP THE ROADBLOCKS.

1506
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,500
SHE MUST BE CAUGHT
OR WE'RE DOOMED.

1507
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,800
OH, WONDERFUL NEWS!

1508
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,000
WONDERFUL NEWS.

1509
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,200
PRINCE WENDELL
IS COMING.

1510
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,600
THANK GOODNESS.

1511
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1512
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,700
( townspeople cheering )

1513
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,600
WELCOME TO BEANTOWN

1514
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,400
YOUR MAJESTY...

1515
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,600
PSST. ANTONY.

1516
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,800
OVER HERE.

1517
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700
BEHIND THE
GOVERNOR'S DOOR.

1518
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,500
HOW DID YOU
KNOW IT WAS ME?

1519
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,900
YOU HAVE
A DISTINCTIVE UNWASHED SMELL.

1520
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

1521
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,300
I'M SCRUBBING THE FLOOR.

1522
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,900
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?

1523
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,800
HAVE YOU GOT A SOAP BAR?

1524
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,000
WELL, YES.

1525
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,200
WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME
TO WASH YOU?

1526
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,900
NO, JUST STAY THERE.
DON'T GO AWAY.

1527
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
PRINCE...

1528
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,800
THIS IS THE
GOVERNOR'S MASTER KEY.

1529
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,700
MAKE AN
IMPRESSION IN THE SOAP.

1530
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,700
HE'LL BE BACK
ANY MOMENT.

1531
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,400
HERE.

1532
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,200
VERY STUBBORN STAIN, SIR.

1533
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,900
Bluebell:
I THINK SHE'S WAKING UP.

1534
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,400
GOOD MORNING.

1535
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,500
( all laughing )

1536
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,100
GET SOMEONE OVER HERE.

1537
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,400
Prisoners:
WE PROMISE TO SERVE PRINCE WENDELL

1538
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,400
KIND AND BRAVE MONARCH
OF THE FOURTH KINGDOM

1539
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,200
AND PLEDGE TO MEND
OUR NAUGHTY WAYS

1540
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,400
SO THAT WE MAY ALL LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

1541
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,900
( all grumbling and muttering )

1542
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,600
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

1543
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,200
BAKED BEANSTALK.

1544
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,500
BAKED BEANS?

1545
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,800
BEANSTALK.

1546
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,000
( gags )

1547
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,400
MY GOD!

1548
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,400
I CAN'T EAT THAT.

1549
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,200
IT TASTES LIKE
AN OLD MATTRESS!

1550
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,100
NO, IT DOESN'T.

1551
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,500
OLD MATTRESS HAS
A SWEATY, MEATY TASTE.

1552
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,700
AND HOW OFTEN IS
THIS ON THE MENU?

1553
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,200
THREE TIMES A DAY.

1554
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,400
THAT'S BEANSTALK JUICE.

1555
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
TAKES A BIT
OF GETTING USED TO.

1556
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,900
( gags )

1557
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,000
LISTEN, UM...

1558
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,400
LET'S SAY I WANTED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY

1559
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,800
AND I WANTED TO GET
SOMETHING... MADE.

1560
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,200
FOR INSTANCE--
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT--

1561
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,700
A SMALL PIECE OF METAL.

1562
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,900
WHO WOULD I HAVE TO TALK TO?

1563
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,100
I MEAN, WHO'S MR. BIG
AROUND HERE?

1564
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,400
IF YOU WANT ANYTHING

1565
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,900
BOUGHT, SOLD, BORROWED
OR MADE IN HERE

1566
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,300
YOU HAVE TO SEE
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

1567
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,200
UH... THE WHO?

1568
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,500
THE PRISON DENTIST.

1569
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,000
AH.

1570
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,500
UH... AND HOW WOULD I GET
TO SEE HIM?

1571
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,100
OH, UM...
THAT'S EASY.

1572
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
OH, YEAH?

1573
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,200
( yells )

1574
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,900
( knocking )

1575
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,700
OH, OH...
THAT'S NO GOOD.

1576
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,100
THEY'LL ALL HAVE
TO COME OUT.

1577
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,800
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "COME OUT"?

1578
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

1579
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,100
LOOKED IN MY
MOUTH YET.

1580
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,300
SIT DOWN.

1581
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,400
I-I...

1582
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
COME ON.

1583
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,700
THERE. THAT'S IT.

1584
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,400
( chuckles )

1585
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,800
THERE.

1586
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,300
W-WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CANDY?

1587
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,600
WHAT? YOU'RE A DENTIST.

1588
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,800
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
GIVING PEOPLE CANDY.

1589
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,100
WHY NOT?

1590
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,601
WELL, BECAUSE
IT ROTS TEETH.

1591
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:35,902
AH, RUBBISH!

1592
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,103
WELL, OF COURSE
IT DOES!

1593
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,204
WELL, EXCUSE ME.

1594
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:40,005
WHO IS THE TOOTH
EXTRACTOR HERE, EH?

1595
01:14:40,006 --> 01:14:41,106
YOU OR ME?

1596
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:42,607
WELL, I-I...
I'M JUST GONNA...

1597
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:43,908
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1598
01:14:43,909 --> 01:14:45,509
I'M JUST PUTTING
THE STRAPS ON.

1599
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,310
STRAPS? WHAT DO WE NEED
STRAPS FOR?

1600
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:49,411
YEAH. THE STRAPS OF COMFORT.

1601
01:14:49,412 --> 01:14:52,112
TOOTH DECAY IS CAUSED
BY THREE THINGS.

1602
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,113
NUMBER ONE: POOR DIET;

1603
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,814
NUMBER TWO:
NOT BRUSHING PROPERLY;

1604
01:14:57,815 --> 01:14:59,115
AND NUMBER THREE...

1605
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:00,616
BAD FAIRIES.

1606
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:02,017
( groans softly )

1607
01:15:02,018 --> 01:15:03,318
( demented chuckle )

1608
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:05,119
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK
I COULD, UM...

1609
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,220
AH, JUST LET...

1610
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,321
AH!

1611
01:15:07,322 --> 01:15:09,022
DOES THAT...
DOES THAT HURT?

1612
01:15:09,023 --> 01:15:10,123
OW! AH! UH-HUH.

1613
01:15:10,124 --> 01:15:11,324
GOOD.

1614
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:14,125
HOW ABOUT THIS?

1615
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:15,626
WHOA! NO.
WAIT A MINUTE...

1616
01:15:15,627 --> 01:15:16,727
( sharp groan )

1617
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:18,228
NO, NO!

1618
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:19,629
AH... LOOSE TEETH.

1619
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,830
I THOUGHT SO.

1620
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:22,031
OH...!

1621
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:25,232
DON'T YOU WORRY.

1622
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:29,233
WE HAVE A BAG
OF MAGIC TEETH HERE.

1623
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:31,234
YOU CAN'T...!

1624
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,835
( whispering ):
I CAME TO YOU FOR HELP.

1625
01:15:33,836 --> 01:15:35,736
HELP?
YEAH. I...

1626
01:15:35,737 --> 01:15:41,137
I'VE GOT TO GET A...
A KEY MADE OUT OF THIS.

1627
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:43,538
WHAT'S IT WORTH?

1628
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,739
UH....

1629
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,940
OH, OH, LOOK, LOOK.

1630
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:46,941
SEE THAT?

1631
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,142
OH...

1632
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,943
OW! THIS...

1633
01:15:50,944 --> 01:15:52,844
IS A HAND-WORN...CLOCK.

1634
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:57,045
THE LITTLE HANDS GO AROUND,
AND IT TELLS THE TIME

1635
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:58,546
VERY INTRICATELY.

1636
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:00,547
I...

1637
01:16:00,548 --> 01:16:02,148
( loud ticking )

1638
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:05,549
WE CALL THEM WATCHES.

1639
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:07,950
AH, BUT THIS IS A ROLEX.

1640
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:09,151
SOLID GOLD.

1641
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:10,452
AH.

1642
01:16:10,453 --> 01:16:13,353
YEAH... WELL, AS
LONG AS IT'S NOT

1643
01:16:13,354 --> 01:16:15,954
ONE OF THOSE
CHEAP IMITATIONS.

1644
01:16:15,955 --> 01:16:17,655
OH...
AW, HEY!

1645
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,256
( men chatting )

1646
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:21,557
HEY! WHAT...?

1647
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:23,058
HEY, LOOK!

1648
01:16:23,059 --> 01:16:24,759
PRINCE WENDELL'S CARRIAGE!

1649
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,860
RAISE THE BARRIER!

1650
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:31,261
YOUR MAJESTY!

1651
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,800
( barking )

1652
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,700
Chancellor:
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE JUST DROVE RIGHT THROUGH BEANTOWN

1653
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
WITHOUT STOPPING?

1654
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,700
THAT WAS ON WEDNESDAY,
LORD CHANCELLOR

1655
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,200
AND HE HASN'T BEEN
SEEN SINCE.

1656
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,800
THE THRONE MAKERS
ARE FURIOUS.

1657
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,100
THEY'RE THREATENING
TO BOYCOTT THE CORONATION.

1658
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,400
IT'S SO UNLIKE
THE PRINCE

1659
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,200
NOT TO SEND WORD
OF WHERE HE IS.

1660
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,100
PERHAPS IT'S
JUST, UH...

1661
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,200
CORONATION NERVES.

1662
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,100
I'M SURE
HE'LL TURN UP SOON.

1663
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,300
LET US NOT FORGET

1664
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,900
THAT THE EVIL QUEEN
IS NOW AT LARGE.

1665
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,000
WHERE IS WENDELL?!

1666
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,800
WHERE IS HE IN HIS KINGDOM'S

1667
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,600
GREATEST HOUR OF NEED?

1668
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,500
THINGS LOOK VERY BAD INDEED.

1669
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,800
TERRIBLE.

1670
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,400
QUITE AWFUL!

1671
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,100
STILL...

1672
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,700
I EXPECT IT'LL
ALL TURN OUT

1673
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,900
HAPPY EVER AFTER.

1674
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,200
OH, YES.

1675
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,100
NOW, TO THE REAL CRISIS:

1676
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,600
THERE IS A SHORTAGE

1677
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,500
OF BLUEBELLS
THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM.

1678
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,700
MY COLOR SCHEME
FOR THE CORONATION BANQUET

1679
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,800
WILL HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY RETHOUGHT.

1680
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,100
Burly:
SHE'S AWAKE.

1681
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,100
STRIP HER.

1682
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,300
( moans softly )

1683
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,500
( yells )

1684
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,500
OH, MY GOD.

1685
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,600
YOU'RE A CAPTIVE
OF THE MERCILESS TROLLS NOW.

1686
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,700
THE MERCILESS!

1687
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,700
WITHOUT MERCY.

1688
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,700
AH!

1689
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,400
PRETTY LITTLE FEET.

1690
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
NICEY NICE.

1691
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,600
WHO RUNS YOUR KINGDOM?

1692
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,100
MY KINGDOM?

1693
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,600
WHO'S IN CHARGE?!

1694
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,800
AH! THE PRESIDENT!

1695
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,900
WENDELL WAS TRYING

1696
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,800
TO RALLY AN ARMY
FROM YOUR KINGDOM

1697
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,400
TO ATTACK US,
WASN'T HE?!

1698
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,800
WASN'T HE?!
NO!

1699
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,500
( Virginia yells )

1700
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,000
THIS COULD BE
A LONG TORTURE SESSION.

1701
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,500
I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

1702
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
TORTURE FIRST, THEN YOU TALK.

1703
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,900
IT'S BETTER THAT WAY.

1704
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,300
RUSH A TORTURE,
RUIN A TORTURE.

1705
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,800
( chuckling )

1706
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,500
( door creaking )

1707
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,600
( whispers ):
DAD'S HERE.

1708
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,300
Blabberwort:
DAD?

1709
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE OFF THE SHOES?

1710
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,300
Relish:
IN THESE SHOES

1711
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,500
I AM ALL POWERFUL.

1712
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,200
I CAN RULE THE WORLD.

1713
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,800
Burly:
COME ON, DAD.

1714
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,700
JUST SLIP 'EM OFF.

1715
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,600
Relish:
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1716
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,000
YOU'RE A DAY LATE!

1717
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,400
UH...
WELL...

1718
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,600
HE...                   HE...

1719
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,300
WHO'S THIS?

1720
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,500
SUPPOSED TO BRING BACK
THE DOG.

1721
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,200
OH, FORGET
THE DOG, DAD.

1722
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,400
WE'VE DISCOVERED
ANOTHER KINGDOM.

1723
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,900
THE MYTHICAL
TENTH KINGDOM.

1724
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,600
TALKED OF
ONLY IN MYTH.

1725
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,900
DON'T TALK
RUBBISH.

1726
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,600
THERE IS NO
TENTH KINGDOM.

1727
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,900
Bluebell:
OH, BUT THERE IS

1728
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,800
AND THIS WITCH PUT US
IN A BOX OF MATCHES.

1729
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
YOU WERE CAPTURED?

1730
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,800
BY THIS... GIRL?

1731
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,400
SHE'S A WITCH.

1732
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,000
HOW MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS
DID YOU KILL

1733
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,100
BEFORE YOU WERE CAPTURED?

1734
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,300
NONE.

1735
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,800
NONE SURVIVED.

1736
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,800
WHO WANTS TO BE WHIPPED FIRST?

1737
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,500
IT'S TRUE.

1738
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,200
LOOK AT THIS.

1739
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,000
 ...Gimme that night fever

1740
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,200
 We know how to show it...

1741
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,200
THEY ARE CALLED
THE BROTHERS GIBB.

1742
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,500
AND THE SONG--

1743
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,100
IT CONCERNS
A DEADLY FEVER

1744
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,300
THAT ONLY STRIKES
ON SATURDAYS.

1745
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,500
Relish:
THERE'S MORE TO ALL THIS...

1746
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,300
THAN THE QUEEN IS TELLING ME.

1747
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,600
( whispering ):
PRINCE

1748
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,800
I'VE GOT THE KEY!

1749
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,800
OH, BRILLIANT.

1750
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,000
THE GOVERNOR'S
IN THE KITCHEN

1751
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,400
MAKING ME ANOTHER
POISON DINNER.

1752
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,000
QUICK! USE IT NOW.

1753
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,500
OPEN THE DOOR.

1754
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,100
THERE ARE SPARE
UNIFORMS IN HERE.

1755
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,500
YOU CAN PUT ONE ON

1756
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,600
AND-AND JUST
MARCH ME OUT OF THE PRISON.

1757
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,300
OH, COME ON, HURRY UP!

1758
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,600
SHH! SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH THE KEY.

1759
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,300
IT'S NOT TURNING.

1760
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,200
MUST BE A...

1761
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,600
YOU MUST REALLY
LOVE PAIN.

1762
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,700
WHAT? OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1763
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,200
I-I WAS JUST COMING
DOWN THE HALL

1764
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
AND I TRIPPED
ON THE LOOSE BRICK, AND I FELL

1765
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,000
AND I FOUND MYSELF
IN FRONT OF YOUR DOOR

1766
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
AND I FOUND THIS.

1767
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
DID YOU LOSE ONE?

1768
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
TAKE HIM DOWNSTAIRS

1769
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,600
AND GIVE HIM 50
BEANSTALK LASHES.

1770
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,800
RIGHT NOW!

1771
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,400
NO, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

1772
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,900
I WAS COMING TO ASK YOU,
DO YOU HAVE A LAUNDRY HERE?

1773
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,200
OH, DEAR.

1774
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,800
SORRY ABOUT THAT, ANTONY.

1775
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,100
NO. LISTEN,
I DON'T...

1776
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,500
HERE, BOY.

1777
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,700
HERE, BOY.

1778
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,200
Tony:
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

1779
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,400
HERE YOU ARE, DOGGY.

1780
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,900
THERE.

1781
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,200
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU

1782
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,600
A NICE... LONG... SLEEP.

1783
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,500
( whip cracks )

1784
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,300
( scream )

1785
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,700
( whip cracks )

1786
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,100
( scream )

1787
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,300
( whip cracks )

1788
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,600
( scream )

1789
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,800
( whip cracks )

1790
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,000
( scream )

1791
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,100
( whip cracks )

1792
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,300
( echoing scream )

1793
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,500
( whip cracks )

1794
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,300
Tony:
OUCH!

1795
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,400
YOU WILL DANCE FOR ME

1796
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,400
AND WHEN YOU'VE
FINISHED DANCING

1797
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,900
YOU'LL TELL ME
HOW TO INVADE YOUR KINGDOM.

1798
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,500
UH, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT...

1799
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,400
I'M NOT MUCH
OF A DANCER, REALLY...

1800
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,400
ACTUALLY.

1801
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,700
YOU'LL DANCE
WHEN YOU WEAR THESE.

1802
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,400
( sizzling )

1803
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,700
WAKE ME
WHEN THEY TURN RED.

1804
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,700
( creaking )

1805
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,600
( sniffs )

1806
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,400
CONCEAL THE COACH

1807
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,900
THEN PREPARE A ROOM
FOR THE PRINCE.

1808
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,100
WELCOME HOME.

1809
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,500
WE HAVE MISSED YOU,
YOUR MAJESTY.

1810
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,200
( door closes )

1811
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,400
WHO'S THAT?

1812
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:27,000
SHE WAS THE STEPMOTHER
WHO POISONED SNOW WHITE

1813
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,500
WITH THE APPLE
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

1814
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,000
SHE WAS ONCE
THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN

1815
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
IN ALL THE NINE KINGDOMS

1816
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,700
AND THIS WAS BUT ONE
OF HER FIVE CASTLES.

1817
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,200
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER?

1818
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,400
WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT

1819
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,200
THEY HEATED A PAIR
OF IRON SLIPPERS

1820
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,000
OVER RED-HOT COALS

1821
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,200
AND MADE HER DANCE
AT SNOW WHITE'S WEDDING.

1822
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,700
SHE CRAWLED OUT INTO THE SNOW

1823
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,300
DRAGGING HER RAW,
BLISTERED, USELESS FEET

1824
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,000
INTO A SWAMP NEARBY.

1825
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,100
THIS BROKEN WOMAN

1826
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:10,200
WAS ONCE THE FAIREST
OF THEM ALL...

1827
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,400
BUT SHE KEPT
HER MAGIC MIRRORS

1828
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,400
AND SEARCHED
FOR A SUCCESSOR

1829
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
AND THAT, OF COURSE

1830
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,900
WAS ME.

1831
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,100
I WILL FINISH
HER WORK

1832
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,500
AND DESTROY THE HOUSE
OF WHITE FOREVER

1833
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:38,500
AND PITY THE FOOL
WHO TRIES TO STAND UP TO ME!

1834
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,400
Woman:
I AM DEAD

1835
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,500
BUT MY WORK IS UNFINISHED.

1836
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,000
THE HOUSE OF SNOW WHITE
SURVIVES.

1837
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,600
YOU MUST COMPLETE THAT WORK.

1838
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,200
IN THE RUIN OF MY CASTLE

1839
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:09,500
YOU WILL FIND THE SOURCE
OF MY POWER.

1840
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,100
THESE ARE MY GIFTS.

1841
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,500
THEY GIVE YOU MY POWER.

1842
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,700
MIRRORS TO TRAVEL.

1843
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
MIRRORS TO SPY.

1844
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,600
MIRRORS TO REMEMBER.

1845
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,600
MIRRORS TO FORGET.

1846
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,000
MIRRORS TO RULE THE WORLD.

1847
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,900
SO GOOD TO HAVE THE POWER BACK.

1848
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,100
FRYING TONIGHT.

1849
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,900
FRYING TONIGHT.

1850
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,100
KEEP AWAY FROM ME.

1851
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,300
FRYING TONIGHT.

1852
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,500
Virginia:
I MEAN IT!

1853
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,000
FRYING TONIGHT.

1854
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,500
Burly:
LISTEN TO THIS.

1855
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,800
"A PRESENT FOR THE STRONGEST,
BRAVEST TROLL."

1856
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,200
( trolls laughing )

1857
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,500
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT
IT SMELLS LIKE?

1858
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,200
( all sniffing )

1859
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,800
LEATHER!

1860
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,400
SHOES!

1861
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,700
IT COULD BE BOOKS.

1862
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,200
AND MY SIZE BY
THE LOOK OF THINGS.

1863
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,600
THEY'RE MINE!
IT'S A PRESENT FOR ME

1864
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,000
AND YOU KNOW IT.
THEY'RE MINE.

1865
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,600
MINE. LOOK.

1866
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:27,200
LET'S SPIN A COIN
TO DECIDE

1867
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,700
WHO GETS IT.

1868
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,500
HELLO.

1869
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,300
RESCUE IS AT HAND.

1870
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,700
DON'T COME ANY NEARER.

1871
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,700
DON'T WORRY.

1872
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,900
I'M NOT WHO I USED TO BE.

1873
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,300
I'VE HAD EXTENSIVE THERAPY.

1874
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,000
I REALIZE I HAVE BEEN
USING FOOD

1875
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,200
AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE

1876
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,900
AND I HAVE THE BOOKS
TO PROVE IT.

1877
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,300
BREAKING THE CYCLE.

1878
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,400
HEAL YOURSELF IN SEVEN DAYS.

1879
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,300
STOP BLAMING YOURSELF, PLEASE.

1880
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,600
AND HELP FOR
THE BEDWETTING CHILD

1881
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,100
BUT I'VE GOT THEM ALL!

1882
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,500
YOU COME AN INCH CLOSER

1883
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,700
AND I SWEAR I'LL
SHOUT MY HEAD OFF.

1884
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,800
OOH. THAT IS WHAT IS KNOWN
AS AN EMPTY THREAT.

1885
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,600
( sniffing )

1886
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,600
( whimpers )

1887
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,700
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME
SAYING THIS

1888
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,000
BUT I GET THE FEELING

1889
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,200
YOU STILL DON'T
COMPLETELY TRUST ME.

1890
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,700
I DON'T TRUST YOU AT ALL.

1891
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,700
YOU TRIED TO EAT MY GRANDMOTHER.

1892
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,700
OH, NO...

1893
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,100
I WAS JUST BEING PLAYFUL.

1894
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,500
SEE, WOLFIES

1895
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,100
JUST PRETEND
TO DO NAUGHTY THINGS.

1896
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,100
I WOULD HAVE NEVER
REALLY EATEN HER.

1897
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,300
SHE WAS A TOUGH OLD BIRD.

1898
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,400
I WOULDN'T HURT
A SAUSAGE.

1899
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,500
BUTTER WOULD NOT MELT
IN MY MOUTH.

1900
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,200
WELL, IT WOULD MELT.

1901
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,300
OF COURSE, IT WOULD MELT,
BUT VERY SLOWLY.

1902
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,500
OH... PUFF!

1903
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
I GIVE YOU

1904
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,300
MY SOLEMN WOLF WORD
YOU ARE SAFE WITH ME.

1905
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,900
YOU ARE AS
SAFE AS A...

1906
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,500
BRICK-BUILT PIG HOUSE.

1907
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,800
NOW, WAIT HERE A MOMENT
WHILE I PLAN OUR ESCAPE.

1908
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,600
WE ARE IN ROMANTICALLY
RECKLESS DANGER.

1909
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,700
HOW ARE YOU AT CLIMBING?

1910
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,500
I NEARLY FELL OFF
THREE TIMES COMING UP.

1911
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,800
Virginia:
THOSE INCREDIBLE SHOES.

1912
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,700
THEY MADE HIM INVISIBLE.

1913
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,000
YEAH, I KNOW.

1914
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,100
YEAH, BUT THEY MADE HIM
INVISIBLE.

1915
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,400
DON'T TOUCH THEM.

1916
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,100
THEY'LL MAKE YOU
WANT TO WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME.

1917
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,200
BALCONY OR CORRIDOR?

1918
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,100
THAT IS THE
QUESTION.

1919
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,900
I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH THEM.

1920
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,900
I JUST WANT TO SEE
HOW THEY WORK.

1921
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,200
THEY'RE WORKING
ON YOU EVEN NOW.

1922
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,600
JUST LEAVE THEM
WELL ALONE.

1923
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,100
CORRIDOR, I THINK.

1924
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,600
OOH! NO. BALCONY... QUICK.

1925
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,000
THERE'S SOMEONE COMING.

1926
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,500
EXCUSE ME...
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING, EXACTLY?

1927
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,600
GOING BACK TO PRISON...

1928
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,400
THAT WOULDN'T BE
MY FIRST CHOICE.

1929
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,700
I'M GOING TO FIND MY FATHER

1930
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,400
THEN I'M GOING TO GO
RIGHT BACK HOME.

1931
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,400
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

1932
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,400
BUT NOT THIS WAY.

1933
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,700
VIRGINIA, PLEASE LISTEN.

1934
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:36,600
YOU WON'T SURVIVE FIVE MINUTES
UNLESS YOU FOLLOW ME.

1935
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:40,500
NOW, WE MUST AVOID THIS ROAD.

1936
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,800
GO THIS WAY.

1937
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:45,800
( thunder rumbling )

1938
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,500
NO WAY AM I GOING IN THERE.

1939
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:54,500
( distant growling )

1940
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,100
"BRAVE JACK."

1941
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,100
JACK?

1942
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,700
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.

1943
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,500
FIRST MAYOR OF BEANTOWN.

1944
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,200
YOU KNOW, THIS USED TO BE
A VERY PROSPEROUS AREA

1945
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,700
BEFORE ALL THE BEANSTALKS
SPROUTED EVERYWHERE

1946
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,000
AND POLLUTED THE LAND.

1947
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,600
THE TROLLS WERE GIVEN IT
AS THEIR KINGDOM.

1948
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,300
THAT'S WHY THEY HATE
PRINCE WENDELL SO MUCH

1949
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,700
BECAUSE HE HAS
A JUICY, FERTILE KINGDOM

1950
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,400
AND THEY HAVE
A POLLUTED, DISGUSTING KINGDOM.

1951
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,100
VIRGINIA?

1952
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,000
( thunder cracking )

1953
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,100
VIRGINIA?

1954
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,200
VIRGINIA?

1955
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,300
VIRGINIA? VIRGINIA?

1956
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,600
VIRGINIA, PLEASE TELL ME

1957
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,000
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THE TROLL KING'S MAGIC SHOES.

1958
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,500
VIRGINIA? VIRGINIA?

1959
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,100
VIRGINIA?!

1960
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,600
IDIOTS!

1961
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,400
FOOLS!

1962
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,900
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
ALONE FOR A MINUTE.

1963
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,400
YOUR MOTHERS
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOU.

1964
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,800
NO, NO, NO, DAD,
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT.

1965
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,200
THE WITCH, SHE TRICKED US
WITH THIS MAGIC SHOE BOX.

1966
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,900
"BEST WISHES FROM WOLF."

1967
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:31,100
VIRGINIA...

1968
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,800
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE SAFE IN THOSE SHOES

1969
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,600
BUT NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

1970
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:40,100
ANYTHING A TROLL HAS IS BOUND
TO BE BAD AND DANGEROUS.

1971
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,300
VIRGINIA...

1972
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,800
 WHERE ARE YOU?

1973
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,900
OH, NO.

1974
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,700
Wolf:
HELLO AGAIN.

1975
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,000
( gasps )

1976
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,400
THEY'RE NOT
FULLY RECHARGED.

1977
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,800
YOU SEE?

1978
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,300
THEY DON'T STAY
INVISIBLE VERY LONG

1979
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,400
WITHOUT A PROPER BREAK.

1980
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,900
IT'S A DESIGN FAULT
IN THE SHOES--

1981
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:21,900
ONE OF MANY, IN FACT.

1982
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,300
YOU'RE NOT HAVING THEM.

1983
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,300
HAVING WHAT?

1984
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,000
THE SHOES--
THEY'RE MINE.

1985
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,900
IF YOU DON'T GET
RID OF THEM NOW

1986
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,900
YOU WON'T BE
ABLE TO LATER.

1987
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,800
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1988
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,700
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1989
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,900
OH, I DON'T WANT THEM.

1990
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,700
THEY MADE ME FEEL
SO STRANGE.

1991
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,100
GOD, I FELT SO POWERFUL.

1992
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,500
YOU KNOW, BEING INVISIBLE.

1993
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,600
JUST AMAZING!

1994
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,700
FANTASTIC!

1995
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,100
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I WAS?

1996
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,900
( sniffs )

1997
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,100
I COULD SMELL YOU.

1998
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,200
OH...

1999
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,200
FOLLOW ME.

2000
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,100
( distant growling )

2001
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:12,800
THERE ARE ABOUT
70 BEANSTALKS LEFT

2002
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,000
BUT NOT MANY ARE OCCUPIED
THESE DAYS.

2003
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,300
GIANTS DRINK SO MUCH.

2004
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,900
REALLY TOUGH TO REPRODUCE.

2005
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,800
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

2006
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,000
YEAH, OF COURSE.

2007
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,300
DO YOU THINK
I'M SEXY?

2008
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,800
YOU'RE THE KIND OF MAN

2009
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,400
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD
BE SCARED OF.

2010
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,700
OH, VIRGINIA, AS MUCH AS
I WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE

2011
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,300
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
TO ME RIGHT NOW

2012
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,300
I'M AFRAID IT'S THE SHOES
THAT ARE TALKING.

2013
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,200
YOU'D SAY ANYTHING
TO PUT THEM ON AGAIN.

2014
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,000
GIVE THEM BACK.

2015
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,200
COME ON, GIVE THEM BACK...

2016
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,400
OH, GOD.

2017
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,700
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.

2018
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,700
THAT WAS WEIRD.

2019
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,700
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

2020
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,900
OH, THEY BRING OUT

2021
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,100
VERY STRANGE THINGS,
THESE SHOES...

2022
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,900
WHATEVER YOU'RE
SUPPRESSING.

2023
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,400
I'M NOT SUPPRESSING ANYTHING.

2024
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,200
( sniffs )

2025
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,400
WHAT?

2026
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,100
TROLLS...
THEY FOUND US.

2027
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,300
OH, CRIPES, WE'RE
IN BIG, BIG TROUBLE NOW.

2028
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,400
THEY HAVE DOGS.

2029
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,500
THEY'RE GOING
TO SNIFF US OUT.

2030
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,700
RUN! RUN!

2031
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,500
Trolls:
OVER HERE!

2032
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,500
THEY FOUND A SCENT!

2033
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,100
I SEE THEM UP AHEAD!

2034
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,600
( thunder booming )

2035
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,700
THIS WAY!

2036
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,200
THE DOGS ARE ON THE SCENT!

2037
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE NOW.

2038
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,100
THEY CAN SMELL THEM.

2039
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,400
DON'T LET THEM ESCAPE AGAIN.

2040
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,500
BLUEBELL, COME HERE.

2041
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,200
BLABBERWORT,
GOT ANY MAGIC MUSHROOMS?

2042
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,200
NO.

2043
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,800
I'VE GOT SOME
DWARF MOSS.

2044
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,100
IT'LL REALLY BLOW
YOUR HEAD OFF, THOUGH.

2045
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,100
LOOK AT THIS.

2046
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,800
LAST TIME I TOOK IT

2047
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,200
I SAW FAIRIES
FOR THREE DAYS.

2048
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,200
NICEY-NICE.

2049
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,300
ROLL US A GIANT.

2050
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:08,300
THIS MAY BE A LONG NIGHT.

2051
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,900
( distant growling )

2052
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,500
Relish:
BLUEBELL...

2053
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,300
BURLY, BLABBERWORT

2054
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,100
WHERE ARE YOU?

2055
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,700
COMING, DAD.

2056
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,500
THE BEANSTALK
HAS A POTENT SMELL.

2057
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,600
IT PUTS OFF THE DOGS.

2058
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

2059
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,400
WE'LL STAY UP HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

2060
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,600
TILL IT'S SAFE.

2061
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,700
SO HOW DO DID YOU GET INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS ANYWAY?

2062
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:49,300
OH... I FOUND MYSELF
AT A LOOSE END AND...

2063
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,700
YOU WERE IN THAT PRISON,
WEREN'T YOU?

2064
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,000
WHAT WERE YOU IN FOR?

2065
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,300
WELL, NOTHING MUCH--

2066
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,300
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF SHEEP-WORRYING, THAT'S ALL.

2067
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,800
PUTTING A WOLF
INTO A PRISON CELL

2068
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,100
WITH NOWHERE TO BOUND

2069
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,700
ONLY ABLE TO STARE AT THE SKY
THROUGH BARS--

2070
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:04,900
NOW, THAT'S INHUMAN.

2071
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,700
SO, YOU THINK
MAYBE I SHOULD...

2072
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:12,300
YOU KNOW,
PUT THEM ON AGAIN?

2073
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,100
WHAT?
I MEAN, THE SHOES

2074
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,500
ARE PROBABLY
FULLY RECHARGED...

2075
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,500
NO... NO!

2076
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,600
WELL...

2077
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
WHAT IS THAT?

2078
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,700
IT'S JUST MY TAIL.

2079
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,100
YOUR TAIL?

2080
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,500
WHAT?

2081
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,000
IT'S NOT VERY BIG
AT THIS TIME OF MONTH.

2082
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,600
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BRUSH.

2083
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,500
YOU'VE GOT A TAIL?

2084
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,500
YEAH? SO? YOU HAVE
SUCCULENT BREASTS.

2085
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,500
I DON'T GO ON

2086
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,100
ABOUT THEM ALL
THE TIME, DO I?

2087
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:45,400
WHY DON'T YOU TOUCH IT?

2088
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,300
IT'S PERFECTLY
NORMAL.

2089
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:52,700
IF IT'S NORMAL, HOW COME YOU
KEEP IT HIDDEN ALL THE TIME?

2090
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,900
BECAUSE, IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WOLFS.

2091
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,500
COME ON. GIVE IT

2092
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,600
A STROKE.

2093
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,500
IT WON'T BITE.

2094
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,000
( gasping )

2095
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,100
WHAT? WHAT?

2096
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,800
WITH THE FUR--

2097
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,800
NOT AGAINST IT.

2098
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,000
SORRY.

2099
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,800
( sighing )

2100
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,500
I'VE GOT KEYS GOING MISSING;

2101
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:31,600
I'VE GOT TROLLS AND WOLVES
AND QUEENS MISSING...

2102
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,200
WHAT IN THE FAIRYING FOREST
HAS HAPPENED TO BASIC SECURITY

2103
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,400
IN THIS PRISON?

2104
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,200
SIR, WHILE WE WERE
SEARCHING THE PRISON

2105
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,800
WE FOUND THAT THE DOOR
TO THE CELLARS

2106
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,200
WAS UNLOCKED AT THE TIME
OF THE QUEEN'S... BREAKOUT.

2107
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,800
Governor:
"CELLAR?" DID HE JUST SAY "CELLAR"?

2108
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,900
IT IS POSSIBLE SHE
ESCAPED THAT WAY.

2109
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:49,900
WHAT'S DOWN THERE?

2110
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:50,900
YOU.

2111
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:53,500
IT'S JUST SOME OLD JUNK, SIR.

2112
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,800
IT'S BEEN THERE

2113
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:55,900
FOR HUNDREDS
OF YEARS--

2114
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,400
BEFORE THIS PLACE
WAS A PRISON.

2115
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,600
Governor:
THE MIRROR!

2116
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,500
TAKE THE WORK DETAIL
OFF THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

2117
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,500
HAVE THEM CLEAR OUT
THE WHOLE PLACE TOP TO BOTTOM.

2118
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,300
NOW, GET OUT.

2119
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:14,400
OH, NO! THAT'S THE MIRROR
TO THE OTHER WORLD!

2120
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,500
I'D BETTER PUT ANTONY'S NAME
ON THE WORK DETAIL.

2121
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,500
"TONY...

2122
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,900
LEWIS."

2123
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:41,600
Governor:
ALL RIGHT, NOW, PAY ATTENTION!

2124
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,700
EVERYTHING HERE
HAS TO BE CLEARED OUT

2125
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:46,400
SO FORM A HUMAN CHAIN

2126
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,500
AND CHUCK EVERYTHING
INTO THAT BOAT MOORED THERE.

2127
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,900
UH, EXCUSE ME?

2128
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,200
WHAT?

2129
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,800
WELL, WE'RE KIND OF
FAR AWAY FROM THE BOAT.

2130
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,500
AREN'T WE IN DANGER

2131
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,300
OF THE MORE
DELICATE OBJECTS BEING BROKEN?

2132
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,800
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS,
LEWIS--

2133
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,000
AN ELVES' UNDERWEAR PARTY?

2134
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,200
LOOK, THIS IS SCRAP.

2135
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,500
NOW, DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

2136
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,700
AND SHUT IT.

2137
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,400
HUFFITY-PUFFITY,
THERE IT IS!

2138
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,200
OH...

2139
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,500
OH, GOD,
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

2140
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,800
HE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF, RIGHT?

2141
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,000
I MEAN, HE CAN STAY
OUT OF TROUBLE

2142
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,600
FOR ONE DAY, AT LEAST...

2143
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:40,800
CAN'T HE?

2144
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:44,800
WELL, FROM WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR FATHER

2145
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:47,000
I VERY MUCH DOUBT IT.

2146
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,200
ALL RIGHT, MIRROR, ON.

2147
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,000
MIRROR! ON! ON!
MIRROR...

2148
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,200
LEWIS...

2149
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:14,200
WHAT IN THE FAIRYING FOREST
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

2150
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,100
IT'S NOT WORKING.

2151
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,400
LISTEN, LEWIS, YOU LITTLE
PRISON PRINCESS

2152
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,900
THROW THAT MIRROR
ON THAT BOAT NOW.

2153
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:25,700
UH... NO, I CAN'T.

2154
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,700
UM, I'M AFRAID IT'LL BREAK.

2155
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,100
AS YOU HAVE REFUSED
TO OBEY MY INSTRUCTIONS

2156
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,800
I AM GOING TO PUSH YOU

2157
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,700
INTO THE RIVER.

2158
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,300
AND AS YOU ARE CONNECTED
BY LEG IRONS

2159
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:41,900
TO EACH OF YOUR COMRADES,
THEY WILL ALSO, SADLY, DROWN.

2160
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,100
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

2161
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,500
OKAY, YOU WAIT HERE.

2162
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:13,900
I'LL PUT THE MAGIC SHOES ON

2163
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,400
AND I'LL GO BACK
INSIDE THE PRISON.

2164
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,800
NO WAY! YOU'LL
NEVER COME BACK!

2165
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,500
YOU JUST WANT THEM FOR YOURSELF.

2166
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,300
OH, NO, I DON'T!

2167
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,900
YOU DO!

2168
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,400
OH... YES, I DO, BUT...

2169
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,400
OH, I'M FIGHTING IT,
UNLIKE YOU.

2170
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,600
( growling )

2171
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,600
I HAVE AN IDEA--

2172
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,600
I'LL WEAR THEM,
YOU HOLD ONTO ME

2173
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,900
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE TOUCHING ME,
WE'LL BOTH BE INVISIBLE!

2174
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,500
NO! I WILL WEAR THEM...

2175
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:41,000
AND YOU WILL HANG ONTO ME!

2176
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,500
YOU ARE HOPELESSLY ADDICTED
TO THOSE SHOES.

2177
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,500
AND I'M NOT
TOO FAR BEHIND!

2178
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,100
CURSES!

2179
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,600
NOW WE'LL HAVE
TO KILL HIM.

2180
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:04,600
MMM.

2181
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:08,300
A TOMB!

2182
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,500
SHH!

2183
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,600
WE'VE BEEN DIGGING
FOR 31 YEARS.

2184
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,700
OH, PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU,
PLEASE!

2185
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,700
YOU CAN TRUST ME!
AT HOME, I'VE GOT

2186
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,300
ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ
ON VIDEO.

2187
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,300
I KNOW HOW
TO DO THIS!

2188
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,100
BEST WE SUFFOCATE HIM,
I THINK.

2189
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:27,000
NO...

2190
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,700
I TRUST HIM.

2191
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,200
WELL, THANKS.

2192
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,900
I WOULD GIVE YOU
MY WATCH, BUT, UH...

2193
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,300
IT ALREADY WENT
SOMEWHERE.

2194
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:54,000
Virginia:
TEN MONTHS JUST FOR BEING CHEEKY?

2195
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,000
WHAT ARE THEY GOING
TO DO WITH DAD?

2196
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,500
Wolf:
THEY'LL PROBABLY BRING YOUR DAD TO A PLACE LIKE THIS

2197
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,000
WHERE NEW PRISONERS USUALLY GO.

2198
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
LET'S GO THERE.

2199
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,100
Virginia:
PUPPY SLAYING?

2200
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,500
WHAT ABOUT PRINCE?

2201
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,800
( barking )

2202
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,100
LISTEN! LISTEN,
THAT MUST BE HIM.

2203
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,100
THAT'S PRINCE.

2204
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,900
VIRGINIA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

2205
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,600
WE CAN'T TAKE
HIM WITH US.

2206
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,400
HE'LL DRAIN ALL THE
POWER IN THE SHOES

2207
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,100
AND WE'LL BECOME
VISIBLE.

2208
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,900
VIRGINIA!

2209
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,600
( grumbling )

2210
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,900
( groaning )

2211
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,900
HEY, HEY... HEY, GUYS,
WAIT UP, HUH?

2212
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:46,300
SORRY, TONY, IT'S EVERY MAN
FOR HIMSELF.

2213
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,300
NEVER MIND, JUST GO
RIGHT AHEAD. GO, GO!

2214
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:53,700
I THINK HE'S LEADING US
TO DAD'S CELL.

2215
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,800
THIS IS IT!

2216
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,000
DAD? DAD, ARE YOU
IN HERE?

2217
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,700
OH...

2218
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,500
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

2219
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,900
I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

2220
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,600
( barking )

2221
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,900
LOOK!

2222
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:36,600
BOY, YOUR FATHER
SURE WORKS FAST.

2223
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,300
YES!

2224
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,600
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME WITH ME?

2225
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,300
A GOBLIN TRAVELS FASTEST ALONE.

2226
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
YES!

2227
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,900
( laughing )

2228
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,100
OW!

2229
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:49,900
THERE'S SOMETHING
BLOCKING THE TUNNEL!

2230
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,200
( sniffing ):
TONY, IS THAT YOU?

2231
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,200
WHO'S THAT?

2232
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
IT'S ME-- WOLF!

2233
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,700
I GAVE YOU THE MAGIC DRAGON
DUNG BEAN, REMEMBER ME?

2234
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,400
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME.

2235
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,700
WE'RE IN A TUNNEL TOGETHER.

2236
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,200
HOW CAN I DO THAT?

2237
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,400
I'M ALMOST OUT, TOO...
BUT I'M STUCK...

2238
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,700
LOOK, JUST GIVE
ME A PUSH.

2239
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:07,900
OKAY.

2240
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,000
( grunting )

2241
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:16,100
COME ON.

2242
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,700
( whimpering )

2243
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:21,000
OH, DAD...

2244
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,900
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2245
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

2246
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,500
TO GO BACK IN
AND GET THE MIRROR.

2247
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,800
WHAT? NO, NO, WE DON'T.

2248
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,300
I THREW IT ON A TRASH BARGE.

2249
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,900
I THINK IT'S ON THIS RIVER
RIGHT HERE!

2250
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,900
WHICH ONE?

2251
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,100
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

2252
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,900
WHERE?
THEY MOVED IT.

2253
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,800
I BET YOU
IT'S OVER HERE. WHERE?

2254
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,900
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

2255
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:39,900
LOOK, THEY TOOK IT.

2256
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,500
ACORN'S STOLEN IT.

2257
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,000
OH, NO!
HE'S GOT OUR MIRROR!

2258
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,900
MIRROR, WAKE FROM YOUR SLEEP.

2259
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,400
( glass shattering )

2260
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:21,800
SUMMON RELISH THE TROLL KING.

2261
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,400
TONY, GET THIS THING MOVING.

2262
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,800
LOOK, THERE THEY ARE.

2263
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,400
DON'T LET THEM
GET AWAY.

2264
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,700
OH, CRIPES!

2265
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:33,800
( yelling )

2266
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,700
DAD!

2267
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,500
LOOK.

2268
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,000
OH, MY GOD! LOOK OUT!

2269
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,800
GET THEM! HIT THEM!

2270
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,000
HIT THEM
WITH SOMETHING!

2271
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,900
HIT THEM!
HIT THEM!

2272
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,700
YOU DOG!

2273
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,000
IN YOUR DREAMS

2274
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,300
TROLL BOY.

2275
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,800
WHAT A PATHETIC DISPLAY.

2276
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,100
HOW DARE YOU CALL YOURSELVES
MY CHILDREN.

2277
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:13,400
YOU ARE THE MOST...

2278
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,100
( eerie whooshing )

2279
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,800
( yelling )

2280
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:23,300
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DAD?

2281
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,500
WHAT'S WRONG?

2282
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:30,300
MIRROR...

2283
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,300
FIND ME A MIRROR.

2284
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,900
OUT!

2285
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,100
GET OUT!

2286
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,300
SO GOOD OF YOU
TO JOIN ME.

2287
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,800
YOU DO THAT
AGAIN TO ME

2288
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,900
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

2289
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,300
WELL?

2290
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,600
WELL, WHAT?

2291
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:52,700
HAVE YOUR CHILDREN
CAUGHT THE DOG FOR ME?

2292
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:55,100
NOT EXACTLY.

2293
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,600
YOU DO SURPRISE ME,
YOUR MAJESTY.

2294
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:02,100
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY ESCAPE
YOUR TINY LITTLE GRASP?

2295
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,800
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

2296
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,500
HE MUST BE CAUGHT.

2297
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,300
SEND YOUR CHILDREN AFTER HIM.

2298
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:11,000
AND WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING IN WENDELL'S KINGDOM?

2299
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,500
RETURN TO YOUR PALACE
IMMEDIATELY.

2300
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,400
AWAIT MY FURTHER ORDERS.

2301
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,800
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU.

2302
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,400
( distant bird calls )

2303
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,700
VIRGINIA, WOULD YOU SAY

2304
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:03,000
THAT YOU WERE HUNGRY
FOR LOVE AND APPROVAL

2305
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,500
BUT DESTINED
FOR REJECTION?

2306
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,500
I'M QUITE HAPPY
AS I AM, THANK YOU.

2307
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,700
WAIT!

2308
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,700
NO! NO!

2309
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,900
NO!

2310
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,400
WHAT DID YOU DO
THAT FOR?!

2311
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,400
I HAD TO FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

2312
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,200
YOU THREW AWAY MY SHOES!

2313
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,400
YOU WERE ALREADY DREAMING

2314
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,100
OF WEARING THEM TONIGHT,
WEREN'T YOU?

2315
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,800
YES, I...
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

2316
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,400
MAGIC IS VERY NICE

2317
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:30,700
BUT IT'S VERY EASY
TO GET ADDICTED.

2318
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:34,800
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT THEM?

2319
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,500
HOW COME YOU WERE ABLE
TO RESIST THE SHOES

2320
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,800
AND I WASN'T?

2321
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,800
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SUCH A STRONG DESIRE

2322
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,500
TO BE INVISIBLE.

2323
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,900
ANTONY, I KNOW THAT
AS MY NEW MANSERVANT

2324
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,300
YOU WILL NEVER
LET ME DOWN.

2325
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,800
YOU WILL WILLINGLY GIVE
YOUR LIFE TO SAVE MINE.

2326
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,600
BUT I WONDER IF YOU'D
LIKE TO SWEAR

2327
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,100
A FORMAL OATH
OF ALLEGIANCE.

2328
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:09,600
DESTINY HAS BROUGHT
US TOGETHER--

2329
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,400
THAT MUCH
IS CLEAR.

2330
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,600
MY DESTINY

2331
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,500
IS TO RULE THE
FOURTH KINGDOM, OF COURSE

2332
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,800
BUT WHAT IS YOURS?

2333
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,100
SOMEONE AS LOWLY

2334
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,400
AND INCONSEQUENTIAL
AS YOURSELF

2335
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,700
MAY YET HAVE AN
IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY

2336
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,100
EVEN IF IT IS

2337
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,000
ONLY CATERING
TO MY EVERY WHIM

2338
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,300
WHILST I'M TRAPPED

2339
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:27,800
IN THE BODY OF A DO...

2340
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,200
WHAT WAS THAT?

2341
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,700
NOTHING.

2342
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:34,400
UH... A FISH,
I DON'T KNOW.

2343
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,900
( crowd shouting )

2344
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,500
I INSIST YOU LEAVE.

2345
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:51,100
TROLLS ARE NOT ALLOWED
IN THE FOURTH KINGDOM

2346
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,300
WITHOUT PROPER PERMITS.

2347
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,900
THIS IS A GROSS VIOLATION

2348
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,100
OF THE NINE
KINGDOMS TREATY.

2349
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,400
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

2350
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
UNLESS YOU LEAVE
THIS INSTANT

2351
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,100
I SHALL NOTIFY
PRINCE WENDELL

2352
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,000
AND SOLDIERS
WILL BE SENT.

2353
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,000
( crowd shouting )

2354
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:23,200
I AM DECLARING WAR
ON THE FOURTH KINGDOM.

2355
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:26,200
AND I CHALLENGE PRINCE WENDELL
TO COME AND FACE ME

2356
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,100
WITHIN SEVEN DAYS

2357
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:32,300
OR I WILL CLAIM HIS KINGDOM
AS MY OWN.

2358
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
RISE AND SHINE!

2359
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,000
WAKEY, WAKEY.

2360
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
( howling )

2361
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,300
IT'S ANOTHER
BEAUTIFUL DAY

2362
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,900
IN THE FOURTH KINGDOM.

2363
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,200
SLEEP WELL, VIRGINIA?

2364
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,400
ACTUALLY, NO.

2365
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,000
I JUST GOT TO SLEEP
AN HOUR AGO.

2366
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,300
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE

2367
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:55,500
JOINED ME ON DECK
SLEEPING UNDER THE STARS.

2368
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,600
IT WAS QUITE MAGNIFICENT.

2369
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:01,400
YOU'RE OUTSTANDINGLY
GORGEOUS IN THE MORNING.

2370
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,100
PERT FROM THE FRONT...

2371
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,300
AND A VISION FROM BEHIND.

2372
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,300
HEY, HEY, HEY.

2373
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,500
WHAT?

2374
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,200
DON'T LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER
LIKE THAT.

2375
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,800
WAS IT THIS LOOK, TONY?

2376
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,100
( panting )

2377
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,000
I CAN'T HELP IT.

2378
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,300
IT'S ANIMAL PASSION.

2379
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,500
OH, JUST...

2380
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,200
LOOK, JUST STAY AWAY FROM HER,
ALL RIGHT?

2381
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,500
YOU'VE GOT A CRIMINAL RECORD.

2382
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,400
WELL, HOW CAN I STAY
AWAY FROM HER?

2383
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,000
WE'RE ON A VERY SMALL BOAT.

2384
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I MAY BUMP INTO HER ACCIDENTALLY
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

2385
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,700
HEY, WILL YOU STOP
TALKING ABOUT ME

2386
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,900
AS IF I'M NOT HERE?

2387
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,500
MANSERVANT...

2388
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,400
WE NEED TO GO
UP ON DECK.

2389
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,500
BRING A BUCKET

2390
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:41,000
AND A SHOVEL.

2391
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,600
FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT
YOUR MANSERVANT.

2392
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,100
AND IF YOU THINK
I'M GOING... OW!

2393
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,700
WHAT THE...?

2394
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,800
CRIPES!

2395
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,000
WHAT IS THAT?

2396
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,900
WHOA.

2397
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,100
HUFFITY, PUFFITY.

2398
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,800
THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A FISH.

2399
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,100
GOLDEN RIVER GOLD FISH.

2400
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,300
YOU THINK
IT'S MAGIC?

2401
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,000
OH, GOODNESS
GRACIOUS, YES.

2402
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,300
THIS IS THE FAMOUS
ANYTHING-YOU-TOUCH-

2403
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,800
WILL-TURN-TO-GOLD FISH.

2404
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,000
WHAT'S THIS?

2405
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,100
"WARNING...

2406
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,300
...FINANCIAL EMERGENCY.

2407
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,700
Tony:
LOOK AT THAT.

2408
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,800
"STICK A FINGER
IN MY MOUTH

2409
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,000
"TURN AROUND
TILL YOU FACE SOUTH.

2410
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,700
"TOUCH A THING
THAT YOU WOULD PRIZE

2411
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,400
"AND YOU WILL NOT
BELIEVE YOUR EYES.

2412
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,600
"HERE IS MAGIC
TO BEHOLD

2413
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,500
ALL THAT GLITTERS
CAN BE GOLD."

2414
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,100
YOU REALLY THINK
IT TURNS WHATEVER YOU TOUCH INTO GOLD?

2415
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,400
I'M SURE IT DOES, BUT...

2416
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:35,000
WE DON'T NEED TO TURN
ANYTHING INTO GOLD, DO WE?

2417
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:37,200
WELL, NO, BUT I MEAN,
GOLD IS GOLD, RIGHT?

2418
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,400
THINK ABOUT THE GUY
THAT OWNED THIS BOAT.

2419
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,600
HE WAS NO FOOL.

2420
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,500
HE'S PROBABLY NOW LIVING
IN THE LAP OF LUXURY

2421
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,900
IN SOME NINE KINGDOMS
CONDOMINIUM

2422
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,700
WITH A MOUNTAIN OF GOLD
IN HIS BACKYARD

2423
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:47,200
AND EVERYTHING
HIS HEART DESIRES.

2424
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,400
BEST LEAVE IT
ALONE, TONY.

2425
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,800
BEST LEAVE
IT ALONE.

2426
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,000
YEAH...

2427
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,100
WELL, OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

2428
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,100
BEST LEAVE IT ALONE, TONY.

2429
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,300
BEST LEAVE IT...

2430
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,300
( clamoring and screaming )

2431
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:16,100
EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE PLAYING AT?

2432
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,600
WE HAD A BARGAIN.

2433
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:20,100
I WOULD GIVE YOU HALF
OF WENDELL'S KINGDOM

2434
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,100
IN RETURN FOR
YOUR COOPERATION.

2435
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,400
YOU'VE DONE QUITE WELL

2436
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,100
SINCE I BROKE YOU
OUT OF PRISON.

2437
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,900
IT IS ESSENTIAL
THAT THE CORONATION PROCEED

2438
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,100
ACCORDING TO MY PLAN.

2439
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,300
IF YOU REMAIN IN
WENDELL'S KINGDOM

2440
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,800
THEN YOU'LL RUIN
EVERYTHING.

2441
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:38,000
A CRISIS WILL INEVITABLY ENSUE.

2442
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,800
WHAT'S "ENSUE" MEAN?

2443
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:43,900
IT MEANS LEAVE BEANTOWN,
RETURN TO YOUR KINGDOM

2444
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,400
OR YOU'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.

2445
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,200
I MIGHT, I MIGHT NOT.

2446
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:54,100
BY THE WAY, HOW ARE
MY CHILDREN DOING?

2447
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:58,000
THEIR INTELLECT AND BRAVERY
QUITE TAKE MY BREATH AWAY.

2448
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,400
YEAH. WELL, YOU LOOK AFTER THEM.

2449
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,400
I WANT THEM BACK IN ONE PIECE.

2450
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,500
IF YOU'LL ONLY BE PATIENT,
YOUR MAJESTY

2451
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:09,100
I WILL GIVE YOU
WENDELL'S KINGDOM ON A PLATE.

2452
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:12,600
BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW.

2453
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,900
MORON!

2454
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,100
MIRROR, TALK TO ME.

2455
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:18,200
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
FOUND WENDELL YET?

2456
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,700
HE IS WITH OTHERS,
BUT I CANNOT SEE THEM.

2457
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:24,100
WHO?!

2458
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,500
THREE TRAVEL WITH WENDELL--

2459
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:30,600
ONE WHO CAN TALK WITH HIM,
AND ONE WHO CAN HURT YOU.

2460
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:33,100
THEY ARE TRAVELING
DOWN THE RIVER

2461
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,800
TOWARDS US, UNKNOWINGLY.

2462
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,300
SHOW ME.

2463
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,400
SHOW ME.

2464
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,500
I CANNOT.

2465
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,800
WOLF IS WITH THEM.

2466
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,300
WORK ON HIM.

2467
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,900
MAKE HIM TALK TO ME.

2468
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:54,600
( tape playing "Night Fever" )

2469
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,000
 ...WHEN YOU REACH OUT FOR ME

2470
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,600
 YEAH, AND THE FEELIN'
IS RIGHT 

2471
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:03,100
 I GET THE NIGHT FEVER,
NIGHT FEVER 

2472
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:05,900
 WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT

2473
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,800
 NIGHT AFTER NI-NI-NI-NIGHT

2474
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,300
 NIGHT FEVER, NIGHT FEVER

2475
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:14,400
 WE KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT

2476
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:18,000
 I'LL BE FOREVER MAKIN' MUSIC

2477
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,800
 HERE I AM

2478
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:23,100
( music slowing )
 PRAYIN' FOR THIS MOMENT TO LAST 

2479
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:28,000
 LIVIN' ON THE MUSIC SO FINE

2480
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,100
 BORNE ON THE WIND

2481
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,500
 MAKIN' IT MINE...

2482
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,400
AHH!

2483
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,700
AHH!

2484
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:41,800
THEIR MAGIC IS USELESS,
THE BROTHERS GIBB.

2485
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,200
ROW FASTER.

2486
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,400
SHUT UP, BLUEBELL.
I'VE ROWED ALL NIGHT.

2487
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,400
OH, SHUT UP, BURLY.

2488
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:52,300
OH, BLUEBELL, STOP EATING
YOUR HEAD LICE.

2489
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:53,500
I WASN'T CHEWING.

2490
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,300
I WAS JUST KEEPING IT
UNDER MY TONGUE.

2491
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,700
STOP TALKING.

2492
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:59,500
AND ROW FASTER,
BLABBERWORT, FASTER.

2493
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,900
OH, LOOKEE LOOK.

2494
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
LOOK THERE.

2495
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
( groaning )

2496
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,600
A BOOK.

2497
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,500
"WOMEN WHO LOVE MEN..."

2498
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,200
"...WHO HATE WOMEN."
NICEY-NICE.

2499
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,100
THAT'S NOT NICE.

2500
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,500
Tony:
WOLF! YOU DOING SOMETHING WITH DINNER OR NOT?!

2501
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:28,400
UH, YEAH. UH-HUH.

2502
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,300
UH... COME ON.

2503
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,500
I MUST LOOK BEAUTIFUL
FOR VIRGINIA.

2504
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:37,800
HELLO, WOLF.

2505
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:38,900
( gasping )

2506
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:41,300
OH... GO AWAY.

2507
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:42,500
LEAVE ME ALONE.

2508
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,800
YOU AGREED TO OBEY ME.

2509
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,800
NO.

2510
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:46,900
YES.

2511
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,800
I CONTROL YOU.

2512
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,000
NO.

2513
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,600
WHY CAN'T I SEE YOUR COMPANION?

2514
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,600
WHAT MAGIC
IS GOING ON HERE?

2515
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:57,100
MAGIC? WELL, UH...

2516
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,300
IS THERE FOOD,
OR ISN'T THERE FOOD?

2517
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:02,400
NO. I WASN'T TALKING TO ANYBODY.

2518
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,500
I WAS MAKING DINNER.

2519
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:07,100
WHERE IS IT?

2520
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,600
IT'S...

2521
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,200
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I...

2522
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,400
WHA...?

2523
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,700
HEY.

2524
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:54,700
FISHY, FISHY, FISHY?

2525
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:56,600
HEY.

2526
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,100
( tapping louder )

2527
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:02,600
( coughing loudly )

2528
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,300
"THERE IS MAGIC TO BEHOLD.

2529
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:17,500
ALL THAT GLITTERS CAN BE GOLD."

2530
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,700
HUH.

2531
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:25,500
( blowing )

2532
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,000
HELLO?

2533
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:48,700
OH, MY FINGER OF FORTUNE.

2534
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:49,700
Virginia:
DAD?

2535
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:51,000
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2536
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:53,100
I THOUGHT I HEARD A CRASH.

2537
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:56,100
OH, HI. JUST, UM, CLEANING UP
A LITTLE OF THIS ACCIDENTAL...

2538
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:58,200
GLASS BREAKAGE.

2539
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:04,100
DID YOU PUT YOUR FINGER
IN THAT FISH?

2540
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:06,700
UH, NO, WELL,
TECHNICALLY, UM...

2541
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:07,800
YES.

2542
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,800
( gasping )

2543
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

2544
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,500
WE'RE RICH NOW. WE'RE RICH.

2545
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,300
WE'RE OUR OWN BANK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

2546
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,600
I COULD TURN THIS
ENTIRE BOAT INTO GOLD.

2547
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,600
YES, AND THEN IT WOULD SINK
AND WE WOULD ALL DROWN.

2548
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,100
GOOD POINT. OKAY, I'LL WAIT.

2549
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:22,800
I'LL FIND THE
RIGHT THING

2550
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:25,900
AND THEN I'LL HAVE
THIS HUGE LUMP OF GOLD.

2551
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:27,300
YOU'LL BE THANKING ME.

2552
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:28,800
YOU WILL BE THANKING ME.

2553
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,200
OH, YES.

2554
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,800
( panting and sniffing )

2555
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,300
GET SOME BONES.

2556
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,200
JAWBONES.

2557
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:40,600
GNAW BONES.

2558
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,000
MUST FIND SOME BONES.

2559
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:46,700
( panting )

2560
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,400
MISTRESS WON'T GIVE ME
ANY BONES.

2561
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:58,200
STEAL SOME BONES.

2562
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,900
BURY THEM UNDER THE SHEETS...

2563
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,900
AND CHEW THEM
WHEN SHE'S GONE TO BED.

2564
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,500
OW!

2565
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,500
AHH...

2566
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,300
( panting and sniffing )

2567
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,900
NICE BONES...

2568
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,800
Queen:
STAND UP.

2569
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:44,100
STAND UP PROPERLY.

2570
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:45,900
I'M SCARED.

2571
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,400
OF WHAT?

2572
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,600
I'LL FALL OVER.

2573
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,100
IT'S SO HIGH UP HERE.

2574
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:59,300
CAN'T I GET ON ALL FOURS?

2575
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,800
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

2576
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,300
CAN I HAVE A BISCUIT?

2577
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,300
YOU ARE NOT A DOG.

2578
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,700
YOU ARE PRINCE WENDELL.

2579
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:10,800
YOU ARE RULER OF
THE FOURTH KINGDOM.

2580
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,200
PRINCE WENDELL
LOVES BISCUITS.

2581
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,200
GET DRESSED.

2582
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,300
YOU HAVE A WHOLE
LIFE TO LEARN.

2583
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:18,600
BEFORE YOU CAN
BE CROWNED KING

2584
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,900
YOU MUST BE SEEN
TO DEMONSTRATE

2585
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,300
BRAVERY, ROYALTY,
AND INTELLIGENCE.

2586
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:26,600
( panting )

2587
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,100
( barking )

2588
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:34,500
WHAT A CHALLENGE.

2589
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,200
OH, NO.

2590
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,600
WHAT'S WRONG?

2591
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,800
UH, NOTHING.

2592
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,100
JUST, JUST A FEELING.

2593
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,100
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

2594
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:55,100
IT'S ACORN'S BOAT.

2595
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,400
IT'S MOORED
RIGHT THERE. LOOK.

2596
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,400
WATCH THE FINGER.

2597
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,800
THERE. RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE.

2598
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,200
ANTONY, SOMETHING REALLY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING.

2599
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:13,100
I FEEL IT. I FEEL

2600
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,300
LIKE I'M TWO PEOPLE
AT THE SAME TIME.

2601
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:16,500
WHAT?

2602
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,100
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THAT CASTLE.

2603
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,700
W-WHAT, WHAT CAS...?

2604
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,100
IT'S AN OLD RUIN--
THAT CASTLE.

2605
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:22,200
WHY GO THERE?

2606
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,800
LET'S GO TO ONE
OF ACORN'S BOATS.

2607
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:26,100
NO. I'M SURE
MY HUMAN BODY IS THERE.

2608
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:28,500
WAIT!

2609
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,600
HEY!
OH, MY GOD.

2610
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:31,400
PRINCE, COME BACK!

2611
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:32,400
COME BACK.

2612
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,500
WHAT IS WRONG

2613
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,400
WITH HIM?

2614
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,700
PRINCE!

2615
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,900
WELL, WE CAN'T
GO AFTER HIM.

2616
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,900
BUT...

2617
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,900
LET'S JUST GO
FIND ACORN

2618
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,100
AND GET THE MIRROR
BACK, OKAY?

2619
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:44,600
GOOD IDEA.
LET HIM GO. LET HIM GO.

2620
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,100
LET HIM...?

2621
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,300
Burly:
FASTER!

2622
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:58,100
ROW FASTER!

2623
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,300
I CAN'T ROW
ANY FASTER.

2624
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,600
MY HANDS ARE BLEEDING.

2625
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:02,400
"MY HANDS ARE BLEEDING."

2626
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,200
OH, SUCK IT UP, BLUEBELL.

2627
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,600
BOTH OF YOU JUST SHUT UP.

2628
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,200
SHUT UP. LOOK.

2629
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,600
THERE'S
THE RUINED CASTLE.

2630
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,300
WE SHOULD REPORT
TO THE QUEEN.

2631
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:11,400
EXCELLENT IDEA.

2632
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,900
STEER US OVER
TO THE SHORE.

2633
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,500
ACORN'S BEEN HERE ALL MORNING.

2634
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:19,000
HE LEFT LESS
THAN A HALF HOUR AGO.

2635
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:21,300
WITH THE REST OF THE STUFF
THAT WAS ON THE BOAT?

2636
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,400
YEP.

2637
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,400
WHEN'S HE
COMING BACK?

2638
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:24,900
HE'S NOT.

2639
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,600
HE SWAPPED THIS LOVELY BOAT
FOR MY HORSE AND CART.

2640
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,700
I RECKON I GOT
A GREAT DEAL.

2641
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,700
WELL, WHICH WAY
DID HE GO?

2642
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:33,700
HE SAID HE'D USE THE ROAD
THROUGH THE FORREST.

2643
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,300
IF YOU HURRY,
YOU COULD CATCH HIM.

2644
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,800
OH, GOOD IDEA,
GOOD IDEA. LET'S GO.

2645
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,200
LET'S GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

2646
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,200
WHAT ABOUT PRINCE?

2647
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:41,300
WELL, HE'S OFF.

2648
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,600
HE WANTS TO BE
ON HIS OWN. SEE--

2649
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,400
MY HEART IS
BREAKING, BUT, UH...

2650
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,600
LET'S FOLLOW THE MIRROR.

2651
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:48,600
TON...
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF--

2652
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,500
HE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A NUISANCE.

2653
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,500
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I...

2654
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,100
LOOK, UH...

2655
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,400
IT FEELS WEIRD LEAVING HIM.

2656
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:56,900
HE MUST HAVE RUN OFF
FOR A REASON.

2657
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,000
YOU'RE GOING TO
LOSE THAT MIRROR. DAD.

2658
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,400
ALL RIGHT, NO. WAIT, WAIT.
LOOK. 15 MINUTES.

2659
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,300
DAD.

2660
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:03,600
ALL RIGHT, 15 MINUTES.

2661
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:07,800
WHILE YOU'RE
WAITING TO EAT

2662
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,200
TRY TO KEEP YOUR TONGUE
INSIDE YOUR MOUTH.

2663
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:11,400
IT'S SOMEWHAT VULGAR

2664
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,600
TO HAVE IT HANGING OUT
ALL THE TIME.

2665
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:18,600
I'M STARVING.

2666
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,900
WHERE'S MY BOWL?

2667
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:23,700
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LOVELY MEAL.

2668
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,200
OH.

2669
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:33,400
JUST AS SOON AS YOU'VE
LEARNT TO USE A FORK...

2670
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:35,100
AND A KNIFE.

2671
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,300
UNTIL THEN,
YOU WILL STARVE.

2672
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,200
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING
TO DRINK, YOUR MAJESTY?

2673
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,600
BOWL OF WATER.

2674
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:46,700
NO, A GLASS
OF WATER.

2675
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:51,200
A PRINCE NEVER
DRINKS FROM A BOWL.

2676
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,400
A GLASS OF
WATER, PLEASE.

2677
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,700
YES.

2678
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,800
IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE YOU REQUIRE?

2679
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:58,200
UH, MY WOOLLY BALL.

2680
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,700
NO, WE DON'T PLAY BALL
AT THE TABLE.

2681
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
MAJESTY,
THE THREE TROLLS HAVE RETURNED.

2682
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:07,500
YOU PRACTICE USING
YOUR FORK AND KNIFE

2683
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:11,000
AND I WILL RETURN
TO TEST YOU IN TEN MINUTES.

2684
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,500
FORK... KNIFE.

2685
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,600
Prince:
I'M SURE I'M HERE.

2686
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:31,800
IT MUST BE ME.

2687
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,600
I CAN SMELL ME.

2688
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,300
( Prince barking )

2689
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,600
( sniffing )

2690
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:44,800
( barks )

2691
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,000
( barking )

2692
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:54,500
YOU.

2693
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,600
IT'S ME.

2694
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:58,700
YOU...

2695
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,700
IT'S ME.

2696
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:01,700
IT'S ME... I'M YOU... OH.

2697
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:03,300
IT'S ME.

2698
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,100
IT'S YOU. IT'S ME...

2699
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,400
HELLO.

2700
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:11,300
YES, YES. GOOD DOGGIE.

2701
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,500
GOOD DOGGIE.

2702
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,500
FORELEGS, PLEASE.

2703
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,800
NOW, IF YOU CAN JUST

2704
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,000
REACH UP AND TOUCH ME,
WE CAN CHANGE BACK.

2705
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:19,400
OH, COME ON, YOU
DUMB DOG, REACH UP.

2706
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:21,200
I DEFINITELY CAN'T REACH YOU.

2707
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,200
WAIT HERE.

2708
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:23,300
YOU CAN'T HEAR ME

2709
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,200
BUT I'M GOING TO GO FOR HELP.

2710
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,500
NOW, DON'T WORRY,

2711
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,500
I'LL BE BACK
IN JUST A MINUTE. DON'T MOVE!

2712
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,800
WHERE IS PRINCE WENDELL?

2713
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,500
AH, YES.
PRINCE WENDELL.

2714
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:36,700
I SENT YOU

2715
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,700
TO GET HIM.

2716
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,900
A NOBLE MISSION
FOR ANY TROLL.

2717
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:41,000
SO WHERE IS HE?

2718
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,400
YOU IDIOTS!

2719
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:49,900
I'VE SPOKEN
WITH MY MIRROR.

2720
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,800
PRINCE WENDELL IS VERY NEAR.

2721
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:54,100
HE MAY EVEN BE
IN RIVERTOWN BY NOW.

2722
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,300
WOW. THAT'S A
STROKE OF LUCK.

2723
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,600
GO AND FIND HIM!

2724
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:00,500
IF YOU RETURN AGAIN
WITHOUT THE DOG

2725
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:04,000
I WILL MAKE YOU EAT
EACH OTHER'S HEARTS.

2726
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:14,900
WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO
TOO BADLY, CONSIDERING.

2727
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,100
HEY!

2728
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,200
PRINCE?!

2729
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:25,100
PRINCE!

2730
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,200
ANTONY!

2731
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,400
PRINCE.

2732
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,400
I FOUND MYSELF.

2733
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:30,800
LOOK OUT!

2734
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,100
LOOK OUT!

2735
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:46,900
OH! GET OFF MY ARM!

2736
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:49,000
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

2737
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,000
I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM.

2738
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,900
HE'S JUST A DOG, YOU COWARDS.

2739
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:03,900
ANTONY!

2740
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:05,200
DAD!

2741
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,500
TONY!

2742
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,500
TONY!

2743
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,500
HEY!

2744
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:10,700
DAD!

2745
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,400
OH, THANK GOD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

2746
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,500
DID YOU FIND PRINCE?

2747
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,700
UH...

2748
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:15,900
ARE YOU OKAY?

2749
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,200
I DEFEATED
THE TROLLS.

2750
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:18,900
THAT'S THE
GOOD NEWS.

2751
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:20,000
GOOD.

2752
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
IS THERE ANY

2753
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,400
BAD NEWS, TONY?

2754
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:25,100
DO YOU THINK THAT BOATMAN
MIGHT HAVE A CHISEL?

2755
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,400
DAD, WHAT EXACTLY IS
THE BAD NEWS?

2756
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:29,500
YEAH.

2757
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
WELL...

2758
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:41,900
I THINK HE'LL COME APART
FROM THE OTHERS PRETTY EASILY.

2759
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:57,100
HUNTSMAN...

2760
02:11:57,100 --> 02:12:00,300
YOU SUMMONED ME,
MY LADY?

2761
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:05,100
NEITHER WOLF NOR THE TROLLS
HAVE CAPTURED THE DOG YET.

2762
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,100
SOMEONE IS TESTING ME.

2763
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:08,800
COMPARED TO YOU...

2764
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,600
THEY'RE NOTHING.

2765
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:14,300
WHY CAN'T I SEE THEM
IN MY MIRRORS?

2766
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,800
SOMETHING'S CLOUDING
MY VISION...

2767
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:20,000
BUT THEY ARE NEAR.

2768
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,700
THEY HAVE LEFT
THE RIVER.

2769
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,300
THEY ARE ABOUT TO
ENTER YOUR FOREST.

2770
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,700
I WILL FIND THEM.

2771
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,700
NOTHING ESCAPES...

2772
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,400
THE HUNTSMAN.

2773
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:47,800
"EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE,
I AM GUIDED

2774
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:51,100
"TO MY HIGHEST HAPPINESS
AND FULFILLMENT.

2775
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:53,000
"EVERY DAY, IN EVERY WAY

2776
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,800
"I AM BECOMING A NEW
AND BETTER MAN.

2777
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:59,800
"I AM SENSITIVE
TO THE NEEDS OF WOMEN

2778
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:02,200
"I AM LISTENING TO MY EMOTIONS

2779
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,800
"AND I AM ONE WITH MYSELF

2781
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,200
( grunts )

2782
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,300
OKAY.

2783
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:11,700
RIGHT.

2784
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:16,000
"I AM FULL OF... PEACE
AND SERENITY

2785
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,300
"AND I HAVE CONTROL...

2786
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:19,700

2787
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:23,800
"OVER ALL OF MY DESIRES
AND...

02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,800
AND..."

2789
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:28,000
TONY, YOU'RE RUINING THE BACON!

2790
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,100
I CAN SMELL IT BURNING!

2791
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:31,800
( growling softly )

2792
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:32,900
TONY...

2793
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:33,900
( gasps )

2794
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,000
BACON.

2795
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
( chuckling )

2796
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,600
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
LOOK AT HIM.

2797
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:39,200
Wolf:
IT WAS A SIMPLE MAGIC FISH SPELL

2798
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,600
GOLD FINGER MISTAKE, TONY.

2799
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:42,100
IT WAS ALMOST PREDICTABLE.

2800
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,500
BUT I'VE KILLED HIM.

2801
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:45,800
( sighing ):
THINGS HAVE A WAY OF BOUNCING BACK HERE.

2802
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,800
I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM TOO MUCH.

2803
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:49,300
REALLY?

2804
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:50,600
YOU'RE NOT JUST
SAYING THAT?

2805
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,100
I'M AFRAID I AM
JUST SAYING THAT.

2806
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:53,500
WHAT...

2807
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:56,300
WATCH THIS SIMPLE
PRINCE-ALERTNESS TEST.

2808
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,400
COME ON.

2809
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,400
COME ON.

2810
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,700
COME ON.

2811
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,500
FETCH.

2812
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:01,400
FETCH.

2813
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,100
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

2814
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:05,100
IT COULD GET FUNNY
IF WE KEEP ON DOING IT.

2815
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,800
WHY ARE YOU TWO
STILL SITTING HERE?

2816
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,200
I TOLD YOU
TO GET PACKED UP.

2817
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,400
WE'RE MAKING
SANDWICHES.

2818
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:10,500
WE'RE MAKING SANDWICHES.

2819
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,900
THE MIRROR IS GETTING
FURTHER AWAY ALL THE TIME.

2820
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:15,000
IF WE LOSE THIS TRAIL NOW,
WE'RE NEVER GOING

2821
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,200
TO GET HOME.

2822
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,300
OH, BUT, VIRGINIA,
BREAKFAST IS BACON

2823
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:20,400
AND NOTHING SETS
MY NOSTRILS TWITCHING

2824
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:23,900
LIKE BACON IN THE MORNING--
LITTLE PIGS PARADING UP AND DOWN

2825
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,900
WITH THEIR CURLY
CORKSCREW TAILS...

2826
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,500
( gasping )

2827
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:30,700
BACON SIZZLING AWAY
ON AN IRON FRYING PAN.

2828
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:32,000
( gasping )

2829
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,300
BASTE IT, ROAST IT, TOAST IT

2830
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:35,400
NIBBLE IT, CHEW IT

2831
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:36,200
BITE RIGHT THROUGH IT

2832
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,000
WOBBLE IT, GOBBLE IT,
WRAP IT

2833
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:42,100
'ROUND A COUPLE OF CHICKENS
AND AM I RAVENOUS!

2834
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,500
( growling )

2835
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,900
LET'S FINISH THESE
ON THE MOVE.

2836
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:53,600
WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE, VIRGINIA.

2837
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,500
VIRGINIA, UH, WAIT.

2838
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,600
VIRGINIA... WAIT,
WAIT, VIRGINIA.

2839
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,600
UH, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

2840
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:01,700
UH...

2841
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,000
A LOT OF TREES?

2842
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,000
NO.

2843
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:05,200
YOU SEE NOTHING.

2844
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,600
LOOK AT EVERYTHING

2845
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:10,000
THAT HAPPENED HERE LAST
NIGHT WHILE YOU SLEPT.

2846
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,300
LIKE WHAT?

2847
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:13,900
YOU SEE THAT CLEARING?

2848
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:15,600
YEAH.
ABOUT MIDNIGHT...

2849
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:17,200
A BADGER TROTTED
ACROSS THERE

2850
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:20,300
AND, THEN, TWO HOURS LATER,
A MOTHER FOX TOOK THE PATH

2851
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:21,900
BUT OUR PRESENCE
SPOOKED HER.

2852
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:23,800
SO, SHE WENT BACK
INTO THE TREES.

2853
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,500
THEN, A HALF AN
HOUR AFTER THAT

2854
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:26,800
ANOTHER FOX APPEARED--

2855
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:29,000
MALE THIS TIME, YOUNG
AND OUT COURTING.

2856
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,600
I RECKON HE GOT
HIS PORRIDGE

2857
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,600
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE
HIM COME BACK...

2858
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:33,600
OR-OR OVER THERE.

2859
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:34,800
YOU SEE OVER THERE

2860
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:37,200
WHERE THE UNDERGROWTH
IS DISTURBED?

2861
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,400
A NOISY, LITTLE WILD BOAR
WAS SNUFFLING ABOUT.

2862
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,900
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DIDN'T WAKE YOU UP.

2863
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,400
OH, OH, OH,
AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU

2864
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,900
YOU SEE THE PASSAGE
OF THE MOLE?

2865
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,100
OR-OR OVER THERE

2866
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:49,200
A STAG AND A DOE

2867
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:50,600
WATCHED THE SUN COME UP
WITH ME.

2868
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:53,800
AND THAT'S NOT TO MENTION
THE ALL-NIGHT RABBIT PARTY

2869
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:55,700
OR THE WEASELS
OR THE PHEASANTS

2870
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:56,900
OR THAT-THAT OWL.

2871
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:58,200
OH...

2872
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:00,900
AND YOU SAW NOTHING.

2873
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:03,200
I STAND CORRECTED.

2874
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:05,600
YOU MOST CERTAINLY DO.

2875
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:06,700
( chuckles )

2876
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,100
GREAT.
CAN WE GO?

2877
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,000
OH, TONY?

2878
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:33,900
I AM BUT A POOR OLD LADY.

2879
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,900
SPARE ME SOME FOOD.

2880
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:36,300
SORRY, WE'RE DOWN

2881
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:39,000
TO OUR LAST SIX
BACON SANDWICHES.

2882
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:40,300
GOOD SIR...

2883
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:42,300
I ONLY GIVE
TO REGISTERED CHARITIES.

2884
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:44,600
YOUNG LADY...

2885
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:47,600
SPARE ME SOME FOOD, PLEASE.

2886
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:48,800
I'LL GIVE YOU
WHAT I HAVE.

2887
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,000
OH...

2888
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,700
WH... VIRGINIA...
YOU ARE SUCH A SOFT TOUCH.

2889
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:53,700
YEAH, "SOFT TOUCH."

2890
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:54,700
HEY.

2891
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:56,700
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN KIND

2892
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:58,800
I HAVE A LESSON

2893
02:16:58,900 --> 02:16:59,900
FOR ALL OF YOU.

2894
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,200
TAKE THIS STICK.

2895
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,300
BREAK IT.

2896
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:07,200
AND THIS ONE.

2897
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,200
( Virginia chuckles )

2898
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:12,500
PUT THESE THREE TOGETHER.

2899
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,500
NOW, TRY AND
BREAK THEM.

2900
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:15,800
OKAY.

2901
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:17,200
I CAN'T.

2902
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,200
( chuckles )

2903
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:19,500
THAT IS THE LESSON.

2904
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:20,700
( whispering ):
GOOD LESSON.

2905
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:22,000
OH, WOW.

2906
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:24,100
I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS
ONLY WORTH ONE SANDWICH.

2907
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:28,100
"WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE READY,
THE TEACHER APPEARS."

2908
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,600
YOU DIDN'T GO
TO MY SCHOOL.

2909
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:32,400
UM, EXCUSE ME, MISS,
DID YOU HAPPEN

2910
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:34,400
TO SEE A DWARF
DRIVING A CART?

2911
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:36,000
VERY EARLY
THIS MORNING.

2912
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,500
HE TOOK THE MAIN ROAD
THROUGH THE FOREST

2913
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,300
BUT YOU MUST NOT.

2914
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:42,800
YOU MUST LEAVE THE PATH.

2915
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,500
WAIT.

2916
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:45,700
THE ROAD'S
THE ONLY

2917
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:47,000
SAFE THING IN
THE WHOLE FOREST.

2918
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,300
NOT FOR YOU.

2919
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:50,200
SOMEONE IS FOLLOWING YOU.

2920
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:52,100
THEY INTEND TO KILL YOU.

2921
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:53,600
( gasps )
WHOA. WAIT.

2922
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,400
WAIT, WHAT IS
THIS INTENT TO KILL?

2923
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:57,000
( panting )

2924
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,100
OH, THERE'S A MAN WHO CONTROLS
THIS FOREST-- THE HUNTSMAN.

2925
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,100
I'VE HEARD
HE SERVES THE QUEEN

2926
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,500
BUT HE CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T EXPECT US

2927
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:09,200
TO LEAVE THE ONLY ROAD
AND GO INTO THE FOREST ITSELF.

2928
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,200
WHY NOT?

2929
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:15,200
BECAUSE ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO
INTO THE DISENCHANTED FOREST.

2930
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,200
WELL, LET'S NOT.

2931
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,700
OKAY, FROM NOW ON,
I WILL LEAD.

2932
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,400
YOU STEP WHERE I STEP.

2933
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,400
WAIT... I...

2934
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:28,800
( grumbles )

2935
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,700
( rustling )

2936
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:24,500
( barking echoing )

2937
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:11,500
( barking echoing )

2938
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,800
IS IT JUST ME OR DO
YOU HEAR MOANING?

2939
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:15,100
I HEAR MOANING.

2940
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:16,800
YOU'RE GOING
TO HEAR LOTS OF THINGS.

2941
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,300
THE FOREST IS...
IT'S MAGICAL.

2942
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:19,600
( moaning echoing )

2943
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:21,800
( gasps )

2944
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:24,100
Virginia:
CRIPES, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

2945
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:30,200
DO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

2946
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:32,600
I'M FOLLOWING MY NOSE.

2947
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:37,500
WHO IS THIS HUNTSMAN?

2948
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:41,100
( Tony grumbling )

2949
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,600
AW...

2950
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:00,200
WE CAN'T WALK
ALL NIGHT.

2951
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:01,700
YES, WE CAN.

2952
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:03,000
WHOA... SHH.

2953
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,100
DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

2954
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:07,100
( horse snorting )

2955
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:12,000
( owl hooting )

2956
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,700
( horse whinnying,
people chattering )

2957
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:18,000
Wolf:
GYPSIES.

2958
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:24,900
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

2959
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,300
UHH...

2960
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:28,000
JOIN US, OF COURSE.

2961
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,200
POACHERS.

2962
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,200
THEY'LL KILL US
IF THEY SO CHOOSE.

2963
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,400
DO NOT REFUSE
ANYTHING THEY OFFER

2964
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,800
BUT DO NOT CONSUME

2965
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:53,800
ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T
ALREADY SEEN THEM EAT FIRST.

2966
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:56,900
IT'S LIKE HAVING
DINNER AT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

2967
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,200
I THINK
WE SHOULD SIT DOWN.

2968
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,500
HOW ARE YOU?

2969
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:06,600
( festive music playing )

2970
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:26,200
WHEW, THIS IS
THE BEST HEDGEHOG

2971
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,900
I'VE HAD IN WEEKS.

2972
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:51,500
( cheering and applause )

2973
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,400
NOW IT'S YOUR
TURN, STRANGER.

2974
02:22:57,400 --> 02:22:59,500
Tony:
WELL, NO, I DON'T ACTUALLY PLAY.

2975
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,400
THEN SING US
A SONG.

2976
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:03,500
NOT A SINGER.

2977
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:05,000
TONY

2978
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
SING.

2979
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,700
LET'S NOT INSULT
OUR HOSTS.

2980
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:11,500
BUT... I CAN'T
THINK OF ANY SONGS.

2981
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,000
IS OUR HOSPITALITY NOT WORTH

2982
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:14,000
A SONG?

2983
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I DON'T. I CAN'T...

2984
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,300
SURE.

2985
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:19,900
I, UH...

2986
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:24,600
UH...

2987
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:29,200
UM...

2988
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,700
( haltingly ):
 PICKED UP A BOY JUST SOUTH OF MOBILE 

2989
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:35,500
 GAVE HIM A RIDE

2990
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:38,000
 FILLED HIM
WITH A HOT MEAL 

2991
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:42,300
 I WAS 16, HE WAS 21

2992
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:45,100
 GYPSIES, TRAMPS

2993
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:46,700
 AND THIEVES

2994
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:48,200
 WE HEARD IT
FROM THE PEOPLE 

2995
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,600
 IN THE TOWN

2996
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:53,000
 THEY CALLED US
GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES 

2997
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,500
 BUT EVERY NIGHT
THE MEN WOULD COME AROUND 

2998
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:58,700
 AND LAY THEIR MONEY DOWN.

2999
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,400
( clapping )

3000
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:03,400
Virginia:
THAT WAS GOOD.

3001
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,300
Tony:
WELL... HEY, I...

3002
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:11,000
( birds chirping )

3003
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:13,900
Bird:
SET ME FREE.

3004
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,600
SET US FREE.

3005
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:18,000
PLEASE,
SET US FREE.

3006
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:19,800
WE'RE JUST LITTLE VICTIMS.

3007
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:21,200
MAGIC BIRDS.

3008
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,200
VERY RARE,
VERY HARD TO CATCH.

3009
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,500
ONLY THE GYPSIES KNOW
HOW TO CATCH THEM.

3010
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,900
LITTLE VICTIMS.

3011
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,600
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, GIRLIE.

3012
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:29,800
LITTLE VICTIMS.

3013
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:31,900
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THEM?

3014
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:33,400
Wolf:
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR WINGS BROKEN.

3015
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:35,400
BE SOLD
TO RICH PEOPLE.

3016
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:37,400
WE WON'T, WILL WE?
THAT'S AWFUL.

3017
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:40,400
SEE, SOME PEOPLE,
THEY EAT THEM

3018
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:44,000
BELIEVING THAT THEY ABSORB
THEIR MAGIC.

3019
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,300
THEY DON'T,
DO THEY?

3020
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:46,700
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

3021
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:48,700
I HAVE SIX
LITTLE BABIES WAITING TO BE FED.

3022
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:51,200
THEY'RE STARVING
TO DEATH WITHOUT ME.

3023
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,500
THAT'S AWFUL.

3024
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:53,900
SET US FREE.

3025
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,400
PLEASE
SET US FREE.

3026
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:57,800
IS HE REAL GOLD?

3027
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,900
WHAT? NO, NO. OH, GOLD.
NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T.

3028
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,500
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST GOLD PAINT.

3029
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:02,800
I BOUGHT A COUPLE-- A PAIR--

3030
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:04,400
TO PUT AT THE END
OF MY DRIVEWAY.

3031
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:09,800
SET UP A TABLE.

3032
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:13,500
I SEE GREAT WEALTH
COMING TO YOU.

3033
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,500
YEAH! THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO HEAR.

3034
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:16,800
AND PASSING

3035
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,400
STRAIGHT THROUGH.

3036
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,900
OH, THAT WAS THE BEAN I HAD.

3037
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,300
AND WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?

3038
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:25,200
I FIND THE FOOL...

3039
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,300
UH-HUH.

3040
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:27,900
AND THAT CARD?
WHAT'S THAT CARD?

3041
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:30,300
THE FOOL'S FRIEND--
THE OAF.

3042
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:31,700
HE IS JOINED BY

3043
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:33,500
THE BUFFOON...

3044
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:36,400
AND THE VILLAGE IDIOT.

3045
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:37,600
WHAT? I...

3046
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:45,700
I WILL READ THE GIRL.

3047
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:47,100
OH, NO, THANKS.

3048
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:04,300
YOU ARE FULL OF ANGER.

3049
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:08,600
YOU CONCEAL MUCH
ABOUT YOURSELF.

3050
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:13,900
I NEED A LOCK
OF YOUR HAIR.

3051
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:33,400
YOU HAVE
A GREAT DESTINY

3052
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:37,100
WHICH STRETCHES
WAY BACK IN TIME.

3053
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:39,000
I'M JUST A WAITRESS

3054
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:43,200
SO I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY PRIZES SO FAR.

3055
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:46,300
YOU HAVE NEVER FORGIVEN
YOUR MOTHER FOR LEAVING YOU.

3056
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,500
AS I SAID

3057
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:53,600
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN HAVING MY FORTUNE READ.

3058
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,800
( panting )

3059
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:58,400
LOVE AND ROMANCE, PLEASE.

3060
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:00,900
MARRIAGE, CHILDREN,
HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE

3061
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:03,300
FOR THE CREAMY GIRL
OF MY DREAMS TO SAY YES--

3062
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,100
THAT SORT OF THING.

3063
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,300
I SEE DEATH.

3064
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:12,300
OOH!

3065
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,900
A YOUNG GIRL DEAD...

3066
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,300
TORN TO PIECES.

3067
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,800
NO!

3068
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:23,100
OH, NO. SEE, I WAS THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES

3069
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,800
OF THREE GIRLS AND TWO BOYS.

3070
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:26,600
I SEE A FIRE

3071
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:27,700
BEING BUILT.

3072
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:31,200
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE BURNED ON IT.

3073
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,200
NO!

3074
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:35,700
YOU ARE NOT
WHAT YOU SEEM.

3075
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:38,000
YOU ARE A WOLF.

3076
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,800
SO IS YOUR GRANDSON.

3077
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:55,900
YOU MUST STAY
WITH US TONIGHT.

3078
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,500
FRIENDS MUST
STAY TOGETHER

3079
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,900
IN THE DANGEROUS FOREST.

3080

02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,000
SET US FREE!

3097
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,400
PLEASE
SET US FREE!

3098
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,000
PLEASE
SET US FREE!

3099
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,900
PLEASE SET ME FREE!

3100
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:03,900
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING?

3101
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:07,600
VIRGINIA.

3102
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,800
VIRGINIA!

3103
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:11,400
PLEASE SET ME FREE!

3104
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:13,200
DON'T. DON'T.
COME ON.

3105
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:22,100
( buckets clatter )

3106
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:23,000
UH-OH!
OH!

3107
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:26,200
Tony:
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

3108
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:28,300
GO, GO! COME ON, GO!

3109
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:30,000
AFTER THEM!

3110
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:31,600
QUICK!

3111
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:32,800
VIRGINIA!

3112
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,300
I'LL GO
TO THE RIGHT.

3113
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:52,000
( men shouting )

3114
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,800
Gypsy Queen:
COME BACK!

3115
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,100
NO ONE IS THERE!

3116
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:23,100
COME BACK!

3117
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:28,500
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

3118
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:30,100
THE OLD WOMAN
CALLED OFF THE HUNT.

3119
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:31,500
MAYBE WE
JUST GOT LUCKY.

3120
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,800
LET'S JUST GET GOING.

3121
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:35,400
THE SOONER WE
GET OUT OF THIS FOREST, THE BETTER.

3122
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:37,500
HELP ME GET PRINCE
UP ON THE PATH.

3123
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,600
CAN'T WE
JUST BURY HIM?

3124
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:39,700
WE COULD
ALWAYS COME BACK

3125
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:40,700
SOMETIME
IN THE FUTURE.

3126
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,200
I'M NOT GOING
TO LEAVE HIM.

3127
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:44,300
I GOT HIM INTO THIS MESS;
I'M GOING TO GET HIM OUT.

3128
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,500
OH!

3129
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,500
I WISH I KNEW WHY
THEY GAVE UP SO EASILY.

3130
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:51,800
THAT'S NOT LIKE GYPSIES AT ALL.

3131
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:08,300
STRETCH IT, TWIST IT,
MAKE IT GROW

3132
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:11,000
LIKE A RIVER,
MAKE IT FLOW

3133
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,600
MAKE IT PULL
AND PINCH AND TWEAK

3134
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:17,900
MAKE IT GROW TILL SHE GROWS WEAK

3135
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,800
MAKE HER MOAN AND SCREAM AND CRY

3136
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:27,600
MAKE HER WISH
THAT SHE WOULD DIE!

3137
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:39,600
( horse whinnying )

3138
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,600
"ALL POACHERS

3139
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:49,200
"WILL BE KILLED

3140
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,700
BY ORDER OF THE HUNTSMAN."

3141
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:02,200
HE'S HERE.

3142
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,400
HE'S OVER THERE!

3143
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,400
I SAW SOMETHING MOVE!

3144
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,700
( screaming )

3145
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,800
( all yelling )

3146
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:45,600
( horse neighing )

3147
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:07,600
WHAT?

3148
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:09,400
WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT?

3149
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,300
UM... YOUR HAIR.

3150
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:13,400
IT LOOKS...
WELL, DIFFERENT.

3151
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,800
OH, YEAH.

3152
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:17,300
THAT'S BECAUSE I WENT
TO THE BEAUTICIAN LAST NIGHT.

3153
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:18,800
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

3154
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:21,100
IT'S, UM...

3155
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:23,300
WELL... IT'S GROWN.

3156
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:26,500
GROWN?

3157
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,000
SO IT HAS.

3158
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:29,200
MY GOD!

3159
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:33,900
OH, MY GOD, IT IS LONGER.

3160
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,100
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

3161
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:38,800
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

3162
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:40,000
THE GYPSIES!

3163
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:41,200
OF COURSE.

3164
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,800
THEY HAD SOME
OF YOUR HAIR.

3165
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:44,500
THE GYPSIES
HAVE CURSED YOU!

3166
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:45,700
CURSED ME?

3167
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:47,600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
CURSED?

3168
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:49,000
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

3169
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,100
UM... BRAID IT?

3170
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:01,500
OW!

3171
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:02,800
STOP IT!
YOU'RE JERKING IT!

3172
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,300
I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT THAT EASY--

3173
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,900
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF SPLIT ENDS.

3174
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:07,000
( groans )

3175
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:08,300
HOW LONG
IS IT NOW?

3176
02:35:08,300 --> 02:35:10,400
OH, DON'T ASK.

3177
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:12,500
UH, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

3178
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:21,800
( thunder crashing )

3179
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,900
OW!

3180
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:23,900
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

3181
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,000
THIS IS CRAZY!

3182
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,100
WE CAN'T KEEP GOING.

3183
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:27,300
WE'VE GOT TO STOP SOMEWHERE.

3184
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:28,800
WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO FIND SHELTER

3185
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:30,000
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FOREST?

3186
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,700
I DON'T KNOW!

3187
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:33,400
CRIPES! LOOK!

3188
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:35,100
( laughing ):
OH-HO-HO!

3189
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:37,200
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
COME ON!

3190
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:41,100
( banging )

3191
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,300
ANYONE HOME?

3192
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:56,500
Wolf:
IT'S OKAY-- NO ONE'S BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME.

3193
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:09,100
HEY... HEY, COME LOOK AT THIS.

3194
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:17,800
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

3195
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:19,200
THIS IS SNOW WHITE'S COTTAGE.

3196
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:21,200
GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME

3197
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:23,400
THIS IS THE SEVEN DWARFS' HOUSE!

3198
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:26,100
IT'S BEEN LOST
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

3199
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:27,300
THESE BEDS ARE SO TINY.

3200
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:28,700
SEE, THIS IS
A GREAT PIECE

3201
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,000
OF OUR HISTORY.

3202
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:32,000
IT'S A PITY PRINCE IS A STIFF.

3203
02:36:32,100 --> 02:36:34,600
THIS IS HIS GRANDMA'S COTTAGE.

3204
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:35,900
CRIPES!

3205
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:38,300
Wolf:
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE A FIRE

3206
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:40,100
IF SOMEONE'S
FOLLOWING US.

3207
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:43,600
I DON'T CARE-- I'M NOT GOING
TO BED WITH WET HAIR.

3208
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:47,600
YOU KNOW, HERE'S A QUESTION
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE ASKING:

3209
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:51,600
WHAT HAPPENED TO SNOW WHITE
AFTER SHE MARRIED THE PRINCE?

3210
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:54,000
SHE BECAME A GREAT QUEEN--

3211
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:56,900
ONE OF THE FIVE WOMEN
WHO CHANGED HISTORY.

3212
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:58,400
FIVE WOMEN?

3213
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:01,200
SNOW WHITE, CINDERELLA,
QUEEN RIDING HOOD

3214
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:03,700
GRETEL THE GREAT
AND THE LADY RAPUNZEL.

3215
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:05,100
THEY FORMED

3216
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:07,200
THE FIRST
FIVE KINGDOMS

3217
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:09,100
BROUGHT PEACE
TO ALL THE LANDS

3218
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:11,200
BUT THEY'RE
ALL DEAD NOW.

3219
02:37:11,300 --> 02:37:13,700
SOME SAY

3220
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:15,000
CINDERELLA'S
STILL ALIVE

3221
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,300
BUT NO ONE'S SEEN
HER IN PUBLIC

3222
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:19,100
IN NEARLY 40 YEARS.

3223
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:22,000
SHE WOULD BE
NEARLY 200 YEARS OLD.

3224
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,200
( heavy sigh )

3225
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:26,500
THE DAYS OF "HAPPY EVER AFTER"
ARE GONE.

3226
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:31,500
THESE ARE DARK TIMES.

3227
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:38,900
( crickets chirping,
birds squawking )

3228
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:41,600
( soft snoring )

3229
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:01,100
Virginia:
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO THAT BOY IN THE GYPSY CAMP?

3230
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,600
NOTHING MUCH; JUST WOLF STUFF.

3231
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:06,600
WHAT'S "WOLF STUFF"?

3232
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:09,200
OH, I DIDN'T NEED TO SAY
ANYTHING TO HIM--

3233
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:10,500
I WAS JUST WITH HIM.

3234
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:12,200
HE HAD NEVER SEEN
ANOTHER WOLF

3235
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:14,300
AND HE WAS SCARED.

3236
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:18,200
IT'S A LONELY PATH IN
LIFE TO BE DIFFERENT, AS YOU KNOW.

3237
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:24,200
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

3238
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:28,500
I HAVE NO IDEA.

3239
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:31,000
SHE WALKED OUT ON US
WHEN I WAS SEVEN.

3240
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,200
( groans )

3241
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:34,400
SAD TO BE LEFT
WHEN YOU'RE SO LITTLE.

3242
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:37,200
I VERY RARELY THINK ABOUT HER,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

3243
02:38:37,300 --> 02:38:39,500
SHE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN
A PART OF MY LIFE.

3244
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:42,200
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

3245
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:45,400
OH... SHE JUST LEFT HOME.

3246
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:48,000
WOULDN'T YOU IF YOU
WERE MARRIED TO MY DAD?

3247
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,600
WELL, THEY'RE JUST...
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

3248
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:54,200
YOU'VE MET MY GRANDMOTHER,
RIGHT?

3249
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:55,500
MY MOTHER WAS LIKE THAT.

3250
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:57,300
IT WAS A COMPLETE MISMATCH.

3251
02:38:57,300 --> 02:38:59,900
THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN MARRIED TO BEGIN WITH.

3252
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:01,300
ANYWAY...

3253
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:02,800
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

3254
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:06,900
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

3255
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:10,000
I HAVEN'T A CLUE

3256
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:13,700
AND I COULDN'T CARE LESS,
REALLY.

3257
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:18,000
DON'T YOU...
WONDER WHAT SHE'S LIKE?

3258
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN BACK IN
TOUCH WITH ME, BUT SHE DIDN'T

3259
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,400
AND THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW?

3260
02:39:23,400 --> 02:39:24,900
I MEAN, IF SHE DOESN'T WANT ME

3261
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,600
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY ENERGY
THINKING ABOUT HER.

3262
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:29,000
OH.

3263
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,200
"OH" WHAT?

3264
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:34,100
"OH." JUST "OH."

3265
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:38,900
"OH," AS IN AN ENCOURAGING,
NONCOMMITTAL NOISE.

3266
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:41,500
"TRY NOT TO COMMENT
AS YOU LISTEN"

3267
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:43,500
AS MY VERY GOOD SELF-HELP BOOKS
TAUGHT ME.

3268
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:44,800
( sneezes )

3269
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:56,200
YOU MUST DO SOMETHING
MAGNIFICENT WITH YOUR LIFE.

3270
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,300
( laughs )

3271
02:39:58,300 --> 02:40:01,200
OH, YEAH? WHY?

3272
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:03,500
BECAUSE YOUR HURT
IS VERY GREAT.

3273
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:05,300
THEY JUST SPLIT UP, OKAY?

3274
02:40:05,400 --> 02:40:08,700
GOD! DOESN'T THAT EVER HAPPEN
WHERE YOU COME FROM?

3275
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:10,100
OF COURSE NOT.

3276
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:12,300
WE EITHER
LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER

3277
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:14,900
OR WE GET KILLED
BY HORRIBLE CURSES.

3278
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,800
YOU DON'T TRUST NOBODY.

3279
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:22,600
I DON'T TRUST YOU, NO.

3280
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:26,900
WELL...

3281
02:40:26,900 --> 02:40:30,200
YOU MAY NOT GET HURT...

3282
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:34,400
BUT HUFF AND PUFF,
YOU WON'T GET LOVED, EITHER.

3283
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
( groaning sleepily )

3284
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:06,300
OH, MY GOD.

3285
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:09,700
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT?

3286
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:11,300
WHAT?
( whimpering )

3287
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:14,000
GOODNESS, ME! CRIPES!

3288
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,500
IT'S EVERYWHERE!

3289
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:18,500
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

3290
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,800
TONY? TONY!

3291
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:21,400
VIRGINIA,
IT'S... IT'S...

3292
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:24,000
IT'S GROWING
UP THE STAIRS!

3293
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:28,200
( labored grunting )

3294
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:32,200
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NO GOOD.

3295
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:34,300
NOTHING CUTS THROUGH THIS.

3296
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:39,200
WELL, WHAT IF IT
NEVER STOPS GROWING?

3297
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:40,900
WELL, I'M GOING TO DIE

3298
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,600
OF LONG HAIR!
NO.

3299
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,000
DON'T DESPAIR.

3300
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:48,500
BECAUSE YOU SAVED MY LIFE

3301
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,300
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW TO CUT YOUR HAIR.

3302
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:51,300
OH, PLEASE.

3303
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:52,500
DEEP IN THE FOREST

3304
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:55,000
THERE IS A WOODSMAN
WITH A MAGIC AX

3305
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,500
THAT, WHEN SWUNG

3306
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:58,300
NEVER FAILS TO CUT
WHATEVER IT HITS...

3307
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,800
AND IT WILL CUT YOUR HAIR
AND CURE THE CURSE.

3308
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:03,000
OKAY, WE BETTER
GET MOVING

3309
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:04,800
BEFORE VIRGINIA'S HAIR
GETS TOO LONG.

3310
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:07,500
OH, THESE APPLES
LOOK GOOD, THOUGH, HUH?

3311
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:09,300
TONY! NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

3312
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:10,600
DON'T EAT THAT APPLE!

3313
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:12,800
HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY! WHY NOT?

3314
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:16,500
THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE--
SNOW WHITE'S COTTAGE.

3315
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:17,800
YEAH?

3316
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:19,600
THAT APPLE TREE
HAS PROBABLY GROWN

3317
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:22,100
FROM THE PIPS OF THE APPLE
THAT POISONED HER.

3318
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,600
AW! IS NOTHING SAFE
AROUND THIS CRAZY PLACE?

3319
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:26,100
COME ALONG--
WE HAVE MUCH TO DO

3320
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:28,100
IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
UP WITH THE MIRROR.

3321
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:30,200
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT THE HAIR;
I GOT THE DOG.

3322
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:45,400
Tony:
BE CAREFUL... IT'S TRIPPING...

3323
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:46,500
NO KIDDING.

3324
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,700
"IT'S TRIPPING."

3325
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,200
Tony:
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T CURSE YOU.

3326
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,300
OH, OH, OH!
I GOT A SCENT. Tony:

3327
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:53,000
I'M SURE IT'S THE HUNTSMAN.

3328
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,800
HE'S NEAR-- WE
MUST MOVE FASTER.

3329
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:56,900
HELLO? I CAN'T GO
ANY FASTER.

3330
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:59,700
VIRGINIA, THIS MAN
IS GOING TO CATCH US WITHIN AN HOUR...

3331
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:01,400
ALL RIGHT!
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

3332
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:02,500
I'LL HIDE YOU.

3333
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:04,400
THIS HUNTSMAN
IS VERY GOOD

3334
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:05,500
BUT HE FOLLOWS TRACKS.

3335
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,100
HE CANNOT SMELL THINGS
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

3336
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,200
I'LL LEAD HIM IN A BIG CIRCLE
AND THEN COME BACK

3337
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:10,500
WHAT?
FOR YOU TOMORROW.

3338
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:12,100
NOW, HURRY!
LET'S START WITH PRINCE.

3339
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:16,000
OKAY.

3340
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:20,600
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

3341
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:22,500
ARE YOU OKAY?

3342
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,600
( gasping ):
OH, OH, OKAY.

3343
02:43:24,600 --> 02:43:27,600
NOW, DON'T BREATHE, OKAY?

3344
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:36,200
NOW, DON'T BREATHE AT ALL
UNTIL I RETURN, OKAY?

3345
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:39,300
AH. OKAY, GOOD. OKAY.

3346
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,100
( stifling sneeze )

3347
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,300
( stifling sneeze )

3348
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:03,700
( sneezes )

3349
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:08,900
GO! GO! RUN!

3350
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:10,800
RUN! RUN!

3351
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:11,900
HURRY!

3352
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:13,000
FOLLOW ME!

3353
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:15,400
RUN! RUN!

3354
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:18,300
( gasping )

3355
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:19,900
VIRGINIA!

3356
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:25,000
OW!

3357
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:40,100
( whispering ):
VIRGINIA... VIRGINIA!

3358
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:41,800
OW!

3359
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:46,100
STOP IT! YOU'RE HURTING ME!

3360
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:48,800
OW! LET GO!

3361
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:51,100
LET GO OF ME RIGHT NOW!

3362
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:54,200
OW... OW...

3363
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:05,800
( yells )

3364
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:07,300
WHAT HAPPENED?

3365
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:10,300
HE'S GOT VIRGINIA--
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

3366
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:11,500
NO!

3367
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:13,100
YES!

3368
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:14,600
WE'LL NEVER FIND HER!

3369
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:15,900
WHAT?
OH, NO!

3370
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:17,100
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

3371
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:18,700
OH, IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

3372
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:19,900
OH, HO...

3373
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,400
( howling )

3374
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:33,700
( groans in pain )

3375
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:36,600
SHH.

3376
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:55,100
( Virginia screaming )
