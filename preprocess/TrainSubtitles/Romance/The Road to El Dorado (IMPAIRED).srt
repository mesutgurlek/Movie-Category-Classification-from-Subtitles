A long piece ofiron
with a hooky thing at the end. Yeah?

- [ Clicking Sound ]
- Miguel! We've been caught.

469
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,964
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.

'' My onlywish is to serve the gods.''
Remember?

471
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,609
- How?
- Well, ifyou guys want the gold,

472
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,775
then you don't want
to get caught, right?

473
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:30,820
- You're going to need my help.
- [ Scoffs ] What makes you
thinkwe need your help?

474
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,091
- ''Ck-ck.'' Areyou serious?
- [ Whinnies ]

475
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,162
I-- What-- We--

476
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,061
Okay. So, uh, who areyou?

477
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,362
- Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
- [ Laughs ] No angle.

478
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,063
- I want in.
- In?

479
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,004
- On the scam.
- [ Chuckles ]

480
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,338
There's no scam!
Whywould you think there's a--

481
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,503
- Why?
- So I can get out.

482
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,774
I thought shejust said she wanted in?

483
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,214
She wants in so she can get out.

484
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,253
Aha! Got it.
[ Chuckles ]

485
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:07,313
- W-Why?
- Thinkyou're the only ones
who dream ofbetter things?

486
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,088
Ofadventure?
You've gotyour reasons,

487
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,095
and I've got mine.

488
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,631
Let's not make it personal, okay?

489
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,134
- It'sjust business.
- [ Both ] Oh.

490
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,263
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...

491
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,568
whereveryou came from,

492
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,008
- I'm going with you.
- [ Laughs ]

493
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,046
No!
Don't think so.

494
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,048
[ Coughs ]

495
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,311
-  [ Whistling ]
- All right. Fine.

496
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,319
After all, I'm sureyou know...

497
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,481
the proper rituals
for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar--

498
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,526
Oh, and ofcourseyou know
all about Xibalba.

499
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,688
[ Chuckles ]
Okay? Good luck.

500
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,735
- Seeyou at the execution.
- [ Gibberish ]

501
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,203
Wait!Ho--
Wouldyou-- Holdit.

502
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,441
- [ Chuckles ] Deal?
- Hmm.

503
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,278
- Deal.
- Notyet.
Let'sjust see how this works out.

504
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,650
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means
you'll want these back?

505
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,751
- How'd you get those?
- Where was she keeping them?

506
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,455
- Call me, Chel, your new partner.
- Uh,

507
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,464
- that's partner-in-training.
-  [ Humming ]

508
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,557
Now, put these on.

509
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,863
Your public's waiting.
[ Continues ]

510
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,198
- [ChelGiggling]
- Doyou mind?

511
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,207
No.

512
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,209
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[ Giggles ]

513
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,370
Right. Uh, excuse me.

514
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,677
- [ Grunting ]
- Bye.

515
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,720
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place ''Chel Dorado.''

516
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,848
[ Chuckles ]
She's whoo--

517
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,052
- Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
- What?

518
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,322
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?

519
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,490
Ju-Ju-Just for a second
imagine thatyou have one.

520
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,194
What would it be saying about Chel?

521
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,204
- [ Purrs ]
- No. No. Listen.

522
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,206
- We are partners.
- We are partners.

523
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,039
- We have a plan, remember?
- Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

524
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,309
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.

525
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,385
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

526
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,080
- Listen carefully.
- [ Gasps ]

527
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:23,525
- Chel is off-limits, hmm?
- Bravo! Chel is off-limits!

528
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,528
Shake on it.

529
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,428
- Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
- [ Both ] Mmmm.

530
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,865
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.

531
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,061
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.

532
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:39,007
- Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.
- Tulio, relax!

533
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,706
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

534
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,215
[ Gasps ]

535
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,746
[ Gasps ] Big smile.
Likeyou mean it.

536
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,845
A-one, two, three.

537
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,496
I hardly think I'm qualified

538
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,396
To come across all sanctified

539
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,369
I just don't cut it
with the cherubim

540

- [ Groaning ]
- Tulio, what areyou talking about?

541
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,166
There again they're on their knees

542
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,802
Being worshipped is a breeze

543
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,541
Which rather suits us in

544
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,710
- The interim
-  Interim, interim
It's me and him

Oh, myGod!
It's tough tobeagod

546
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:30,150
Tread where mortals have not trod

547
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:34,960
Be deifiedwhenreallyyou'reasham

548

Bean objectofdevotion

549
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,673
Be the subject ofpsalms

550
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,674
It's a rather touching notion

551
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,007
All those prayers and those salaams

552
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,378
And who am I to bridle

553
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,815
IfI'm forced to be an idol

554
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,184
Ifthey say that I'm a god

555
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,416
That's what I am

556
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,790
What's more ifwe don't comply

557
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,954
With the locals' wishes

558

- Orstuffed
- You have a point there.
Very good thinking.

560
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,468
-  So let's be gods
The perks are great
- Yeah!

00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,509
-  El Dorado on our plates
- Thankyou.

562
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,737
Local feelings should not

563
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,746
-  Be rebuffed
-  Never rebuffed

564
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,545
I never rebuffa local feeling
No, my friend

565
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,711
It's tough to be a god

566
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,221
But ifyou get the people's nod

567
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,884
Countyour blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet

568
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,690
- That's our advice
- It's great advice!

569
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,789
Be a symbol ofperfection

570
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,960
Be a legend
Be a cult

571
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,800
Take their praise
Take a collection

As themultitudes exalt

573
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,072
Don a supernatural habit

574
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,444
- We'd be crazy not to grab it
- You got it!

575
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,847
So sign on two new gods

576
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,614
For paradise

Thankyou.

This city has been granted
a great blessing.

And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

594
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,256
A meager celebration.

No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.

Uh, it'sjust that, uh--

The stars are not in position
for this tribute!
