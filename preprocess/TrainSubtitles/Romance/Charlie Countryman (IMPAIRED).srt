00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,339
<i>Not having a pussy.
You get what I mean?</i>

486
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,916
Right, right, right.

487
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,546
<i>You just get in today?</i>
Yes. Today.

488
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,095
Yeah? Where you come from?
Chicago.

489
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,140
Chicago?
Hey, Chi-ca-go!

490
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,013
That's my kind of town.
Is it?

491
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,515
Yeah, well,
I've never been.

492
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,441
You like ecstasy,
Charlie?

493
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:42,399
In answer to your silent question,
Charlie, this is why I love this guy.

494
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,697
<i>He's fucking crazy! He's a party animal!</i>
Yes.

495
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,996
<i>We should go and get a few beers
or something. You up for that?</i>

496
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,869
Beer? Yeah.
Yeah?

497
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,451
Great. Well, first round's on you.
Come, let's go!

498
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,331
Three beers for
the three queers.

499
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,458
Thank you, sir.

500
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,882
Did Carl tell you? He's auditioning
to become a porn star.

501
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,211
Porn star?
<i>Actor. You know.</i>

502
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,388
I have no aspirations to star.
I simply want to act.

503
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,386
That is funny.

504
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,092
Tell him what your <i>nom de
porn</i> is going to be.

505
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,927
Boris Pecker.

506
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,350
<i>Can you fucking--
There is no other name?</i>

507
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,684
Boris!
Boris Pecker.

508
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,519
<i>It could be nowhere else!</i>

509
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,104
<i>It's just like--</i>

510
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,939
I feel fucking weird
right now, man.

511
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,533
<i>Charlie, Charlie. I feel
fucked right now, man.</i>

512
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,155
How's your beer,
how's your beer?

513
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,114
I just feel fucked
right now. I mean...

514
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,575
Can I tell you my story?
Yeah.

515
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:37,003
So, this guy Victor, he died on my
fucking plane right next to me.

516
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,001
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

517
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,584
And he gives me a hat, and
it's a gift for his daughter.

518
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,339
Her name's Gabi. Gabriela.
Right.

519
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,173
And she plays the cello.

520
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,974
Cello!
<i>Yeah.</i>

521
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,929
When you hear her talk,
your fucking heart stops.

522
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,107
Fucking amazing. This
beer's weird as shit, but--

523
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,400
Having a good time?
'Cause it looks like

524
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,852
you're having a
motherfucking good time.

525
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,029
Amazing. I felt
like I love her.

526
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,232
I do, I do, I do!
I feel like I love her.

527
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,158
I have to make you aware,
Charlie.

528
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,364
Luke put Carpathian
ecstasy in your beer.

529
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,791
You did? Who did?
Yeah, yeah!

530
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,039
I did. Come on,
listen...

531
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,290
Well, fuck, man!

532
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,621
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

533
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,422
No, no,
it's fine, though!

534
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,295
<i>It's fine. Mine
and Carl's are laced too.</i>

535
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,469
We all have fucking
trolley's at the moment.

536
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,969
We're all in a zone
of mutuality.

537
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,595
We're all together,
rising sun.

538
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,267
<i>There's a naked girl!</i>

539
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,561
Listen, your experience
is your own, yeah?

540
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,765
But we vote on shared
hallucinations, okay?

541
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:43,319
Any hallucinations in the zone
of mutuality must be voted on.

542
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:50,243
Who here among us would like all the women
to be naked or semi-naked right now?

543
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,161
All right.

544
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,534
<i>There is. Oh, my God.
Having a good time?</i>

545
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,582
These women are naked.

546
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,500
This is my gift to you.
Merry Christmas.

547
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,499
Oh, my Go oh, my God!

548
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,999
<i>Hello, Charlie.</i>

549
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,892
Are you in the zone
of individuality also?

550
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,265
Sure.

551
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,470
Sure. Why not?

552
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,431
Okay.

553
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,860
Listen, I'm glad we bumped
into each other like this.

554
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:52,156
I want to apologize
for my behavior.

555
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,781
Charlie. The fucking love,
Charlie. The fucking love.

556
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:04,370
[LAUGHS WEAKLY]
Yeah, sure.

557
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,046
Turns me somewhat insane, if
I'm being honest with you.

558
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,623
Can I tell you that?

559
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,504
Be honest with me.

560
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,965
Regardless,
I do apologize.

561
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,811
But I didn't
wash my hands.

562
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,231
What's a little piss
among friends?

563
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,519
Oh, Charlie.

564
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,401
Enjoy your new mates
and your recreational drugs

565
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,074
and the rest of it
while you can.

566
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,325
God knows it can all turn into
blood in a blink of an eye.

567
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,746
Yes.

568
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,207
Your bag was
in my car, Charlie.

569
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,378
I left it at the
hostel for you, okay?

570
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,376
You're married?
What's up with that?

571
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,926
Walking with me? It
could get you killed.

572
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,845
Charlie! I'll just walk
across the street.

573
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,014
I'll walk right
here in the street.

574
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,575
I'm going to help you. It's good.
What are doing?

575
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,041
[BOTH SIGH]

576
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,571
You want to share
a cavalla?

577
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,033
Maybe on our
second date.

578
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,741
<i>You like it?</i>

579
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,917
It's my mother's
favorite song.

580
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,593
This was my father's
favorite restaurant.

581
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,348
I used to play cello right
here when I was young.

582
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:54,354
My father hated that he put me
in the place where I met Nigel.

583
00:48:54,432 --> 00:49:01,407
He once ran through here cursing and
throwing candles at the curtains.

584
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,945
It didn't work.
He was very drunk.

585
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,630
Good place to be drunk.

586
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:21,335
Good sober food. I mean,
these are great doughnuts.

587
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,385
The best.

588
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,925
Gabi, can I
say something?

589
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,354
I understand.

590
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,649
When you lose
someone who's

591
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,729
your home, you know, you're
only home in the world.

592
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,484
And when that happens,
you think,

593
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,692
"Oh, fuck, I should
have had a back-up home."

594
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:50,951
Another person, a place,
a thing, something

595
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,752
to make me feel safe,
and I don't have that.

596
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,578
And now I'm lost.

597
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,663
I am not lost.

598
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,749
<i>It's a process.</i>

599
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,761
I am angry.

600
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,020
That's why
I'm scared for you.

601
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,194
You know, for that
picture in your head.

602
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,192
Close your eyes.

603
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,864
Get rid of that one.
That one's gone.

604
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,747
That's gone.
Blank slate.

605
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,216
Pick a good one, a really good one.
One that's so good

606
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,714
it'll keep
the bad one unstuck.

607
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,328
See?

608
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,757
Thank you,
Charlie.

609
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,770
What are you doing?

610
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,567
I'm going to show you
all these that I know.

611
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,189
I know all
these positions.

612
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,271
<i>It's ballet.</i>

613
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,322
This is the motherfucker
right here.

614
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,650
This is
the one I know.

615
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,485
I'm not going to laugh.

616
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,866
Fucking, balance!

617
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,870
That's a fucker.
That's a motherfucker.

618
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,793
Time for goodbye,
Charlie.

619
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,716
No! We should
go walk some more.

620
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,886
Let's do it again. Let's just
do the whole path again.

621
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,635
It's a full moon! We get
bikes, we go ride around.

622
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,136
We can do anything.
We'll get pancakes.

623
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,638
No, I am sorry.
Why?

624
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,686
It's like they say, another
time, another place. Right?

625
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,231
Who's they? You got friends
that tell you what to do?

626
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,560
Fuck them, fuck they,
fuck all that.

627
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,111
'Cause this is,
this is important.

628
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,735
This. This, all this.
This is--

629
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,815
This is big to us.

630
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,242
To us?

631
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,740
Us. Two letters,
whole world.

632
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,540
Whole world like an oyster that you can
put the future and the past into, right?

633
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,834
And the middle is this
"us" thing.

634
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,004
Which is a pearl,
which is us.

635
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,170
Goodbye, Charlie.

636
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,843
Stay. Okay?

637
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,094
Yeah.

638
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,683
Charlie, please!

639
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:05,357
Yeah. I can't do that. I don't
