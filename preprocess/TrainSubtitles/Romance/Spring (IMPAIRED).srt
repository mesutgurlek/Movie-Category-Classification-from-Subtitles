1
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,943
( raspy breathing )

2
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,470
( humidifier beeps )

3
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,403
( water trickling )

4
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,577
- Evan.
- Hey.

5
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,332
You were out for a while.
Are you hungry

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,877
or thirsty or anything?

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,337
I love you.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,672
I love you, too, Mom.

9
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,846
How was work?

10
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,808
- It was all right.
- Oh.

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,686
Are you happy?

12
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,356
Yes.

13
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,445
Do you want to hear a joke?

14
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,863
Sure.

15
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,283
This shopkeeper

16
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,204
receives flowers
at the opening of his new store...

17
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,958
and the card says,
"Rest in peace."

18
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,627
Are you sure
you're not thirsty, Ma?

19
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:12,256
So he calls up the florist
angry and she says,

20
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,803
"Sir, at least you
weren't the one

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,389
who got flowers
at your wife's funeral

22
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,727
that said, "Congratulations
on the new location."

23
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,229
( chuckles )

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,484
( raspy breathing )

25
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,152
You need more morphine?

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,740
( groans )

27
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,745
Ma.

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
Do you want me
to call a priest?

29
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,215
( breathing stops )

30
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,061
I want you to know I...

31
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,605
think you two were amazing.

32
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,570
And I'm grateful
for everything you...

33
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
( hand thuds )

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,141
( sighs )

35
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,645
Man: Why don't you guys bury
these in your stomachs, huh?

36
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,523
That sucked, I'm sorry.
Look, I'm gonna...

37
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,983
I'm gonna have Shitty Carl
try to cover your shift.

38
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,359
I'm gonna call Carl.

39
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,403
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- Thanks, Mike.

40
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,286
( sighs ) You know, Ev,
that was a real small funeral.

41
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,914
I mean, you know,
it was intimate.

42
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,750
That's what I meant, it was good.
It was a good funeral.

43
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,294
Yeah, they really never had
any friends or family

44
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,379
or anything, so...

45
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,714
Nobody else?

46
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,344
They were only children.

47
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,763
I mean, their parents died young.
It was just the three of us.

48
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,265
You know, I'm really sorry about
the casket thing, too.

49
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,352
I mean, I think I saw I had some...
Some fish oil on my hands

50
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,563
- and it... the brass was slick.
- Funerals are for the living, Tom.

51
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,358
Why the fuck does this fucking
goddamn machine not work?!

52
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,525
- ( banging )
- Fuck!

53
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,818
The cigarette machine
is for decoration.

54
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,779
- There's no cigarettes there.
- Give me some of that drink!

55
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,489
Do you want a shot?
Let's have a shot.

56
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,575
- I got to work later.
- No, shots. Mike, shots, please.

57
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,327
Whiskey, whiskey.

58
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,495
I gotta take a piss.

59
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,705
Woman: ...some fruity faggot juice
just like you, you fuckin'...

60
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,749
Watch where the fuck
you're going, man.

61
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,357
- I'm sorry.
- Woman: Bite me, bitch.

62
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,629
Yeah, you're fucked up, huh?
You tryin' to roll on my bitch?!

63
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,089
- No.
- I fuckin' saw you, man.

64
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,591
- I wasn't.
- Tommy: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

65
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,843
Guy had a fuckin' rough day,
all right?

66
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,971
Why don't you just shut
your fuckin' cock holster,

67
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,265
have a drink with me?
Calm down, Jesus Christ.

68
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,939
Got a cigarette?

69
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,026
No, I roll my own. Sorry.

70
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,737
Hey, I got a fuckin' cigarette.
You want a cigarette? Here.

71
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,080
- Woman: Hey, hey, what the fuck?!
- Fuck!

72
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,582
Woman:
Hey! Hey!

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,919
Babe, get up! Get up!
Kick his fuckin' ass!

74
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,800
- ( thudding )
- ( groaning )

75
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,968
- Woman: Get him off him!
- Evan: Fuck!

76
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,970
- Evan, Evan, Evan!
- Mike: Fuck, that's enough, man.

77
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,723
- All right. I'm all right!
- Babe, babe, babe.

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,811
Tommy: Fuckin'... Evan,
Jesus Christ, brother.

79
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,148
I mean, you knocked that stupid fuckin'
gold thing right out of his face.

80
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,819
Are you guys fuckin' serious?

81
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,533
Ev, I just picked up, like, fuckin' four
teeth off the goddamn ground, man.

82
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,828
Holy shit.

83
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,789
I mean, holy fucking shit.

84
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,877
Here, put this on your shit.

85
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,254
The cops were here, guys.

86
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,464
Is he pressing charges?

87
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,841
The psychopath?
I don't know!

88
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,010
Maybe! You almost fuckin'
murdered the guy!

89
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,846
Will you... you're getting blood
all over your ice.

90
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,854
Will you put the gauze
on your goddamn knuckles

91
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,214
and then fuckin' put ice on it?

92
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,435
Tommy, seriously,
cock holster mouth?

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,978
- Tommy: Hey, what...
- Why would you say that?

94
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,564
- 'Cause he had a fuckin' cockmouth.
- Mike: For fuck's sake!

95
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,237
Look, man, you nee... you need
to change up your environment.

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,908
You have a lot of shit going on,
your whole family's dead,

97
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,911
and I think the best thing for you
would be to just shift gears

98
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,746
and do something completely
different with yourself.

99
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,247
Are you telling me
that I'm fired, Mike?

100
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,749
He's not saying that.
Mike, you wouldn't...

101
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,584
I'm not saying you're fired.
I'm not saying you're fired.

102
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,312
Tommy:
No, Mike, you're not saying that.

103
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,712
But the boss was here

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,757
and he said you can't work here
anymore, man. I'm sorry.

105
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,717
I really don't want to be
unemployed right now, Mike.

106
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,969
Look, I can bring you back.
I swear to God I can bring you back.

107
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,471
I brought Shitty Carl back.

108
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,306
He stabbed a goddamn
crippled guy in the leg with a fork.

109
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,810
Right, Shitty Carl! He's a fuckin' shit.
He's a piece of shit!

110
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,312
- Mike: I just need some time.
- Ah, fuck!

111
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,855
Mike: I just need
some fuckin' time, man.

112
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,274
Mike: You know how it is, man.
I mean, the fucking Yelp reviews.

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,694
- We're getting fucked here. I can't...
- What are you gonna do, brother?

114
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,196
- Where did you get this?
- Evan, wait...

115
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,281
All right, I don't need you
to fuckin' follow me home, Tom.

116
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,242
- Just hold up, man.
- ( car radio blaring )

117
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,785
Ev!

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,499
Tommy:
Fuck.

119
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,252
Dude, do you need any help
down at the boats?

120
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,212
Can I have one of those?

121
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,880
Yeah.

122
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,342
( stammering )
I'll ask around.

123
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,887
You should talk to Dale
about construction gigs.

124
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,389
Dale?

125
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,517
He's been unemployed
since June, man.

126
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,727
- ( Tom scoffs )
- Give me that lighter.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,190
You want to gut
fish for tourists?

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,735
I mean, I smelled like a tuna fish's
asshole for four years,

129
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,362
but it's good work.

130
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,770
- ( Evan exhales )
- Smell that.

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,421
- I don't... I don't know.
- Just smell it.

132
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,409
- I don't know.
- It's like it's on me forever.

133
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,120
I got some inheritance.
I can just use that.

134
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,582
Yo, where my fuckin'
cigarette at, bitch?

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,500
It's gonna get
real fuckin' boring

136
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,586
- following me around all night.
- I know where you live now, bitch.

137
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,880
Why don't you just go back to fuckin'
East County you fuckin' tweakers?

138
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,257
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers.
- Fuck you!

139
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,263
Thanks for staying, man.

140
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,725
Yeah, they'll file a police report,
they'll sue me,

141
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,436
then they'll come back here
with baseball bats.

142
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,479
You want me to stay?
Got an extra bed?

143
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,108
My mom's.

144
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,068
( deep inhale, exhale )

145
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,154
Fuck.
I mean, Ev, I love you, brother,

146
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,699
but I'm not drunk enough to sleep
in your mom's deathbed.

147
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,075
Yeah.

148
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,953
Why don't you just lock the doors?
I'll call you tomorrow.

149
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,413
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,081
- You gonna be all right?
- Yup.

151
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,709
Yeah, you gonna be all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

152
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,961
- ( fence clangs )
- Fuck!

153
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,630
These fuckin' things.

154
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,965
- Am I supposed to fuckin' jump it?
- Are you fuckin' retarded?

155
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,134
- There's a hinge, man.
- ( laughing )

156
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,761
Fuck you, man.

157
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,390
Hey, uh, why don't you...

158
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,976
Why don't you call up somebody
for a sympathy fuck?

159
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,187
No, I'm good, dude.

160
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,980
All right.

161
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm telling you, Evan,
your mom just died.

162
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,652
You're only gonna get
to use that one once.

163
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,654
I love you, brother!

164
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,864
- Evan: Love you, dude.
- Tommy: I love you.

165
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,075
( fence clangs )

166
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,671
( Evan moaning )

167
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,386
Mm, condom?

168
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,847
( Evan groans )
Okay.

169
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,309
( Evan groans )

170
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,565
( Evan groans )

171
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,446
- Mm. ( sniffs )
- Handsome picture.

172
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,908
I look like a hobo
with smallpox.

173
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,116
You know I'm only here
because I feel sorry for you,

174
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,913
but this is a very nice picture,
Evan Russell.

175
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,791
Thank you.

176
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,877
- You're sitting on the condom.
- Mm, why do you have this?

177
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,422
( laughs )
Are you fucking whores in TJ?

178
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,590
Oh.

179
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,884
( laughing )
What?

180
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,470
How did you even get to that?

181
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,223
My dad, he made me get one
'cause we were gonna go to Italy

182
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,310
after I got back from college,
but you know what happened.

183
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,229
How do you feel about me?

184
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,489
I just got sober all of a sudden.
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

185
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,747
Get out of town, Evan.

186
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,415
( sighs )
Right now?

187
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,418
Yeah. My brother's a fuckup, too,
and he took a break

188
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,920
and he went to India,
and he totally re-centered.

189
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,923
I just worked my way up
to sous chef, though.

190
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,593
You didn't go to Berkeley
to chop vegetables.

191
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,471
( laughs )
You sound like an elitist asshole.

192
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,766
Mm, I'm just not sober
enough for this conversation.

193
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:28,228
Then let's have sex.
( breathing deeply )

194
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,404
( groans )

195
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,243
( sighs )

196
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,495
( knocking on door )

197
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,496
( knocking on door )

198
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,043
( knocking continues )

199
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,669
Man:
Mr. Russell?

200
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,382
( knocking continues )

201
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,261
Dispatch, I've got no one
at the house.

202
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,807
( indistinct radio chatter )

203
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,809
Fuck.

204
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,519
( groans )

205
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,901
Evan: Hi, can I get
a flight somewhere?

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,694
Anywhere.

207
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm sorry, I'm really hungover.
( laughs )

208
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,617
Where would you go?
I don't know, like, uh,

209
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,370
Canada or Europe
or something?

210
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,289
( laughs )
White people love Italy?

211
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,999
Gotcha.

212
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,669
Book me on the next flight.
Or, when is the next flight?

213
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,879
Actually, hold on a second.
Should I go to Italy?

214
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,635
- What?
- ( exhales )

215
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,013
- ( music playing )
- Man in movie: What, a wizard?

216
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,473
( whispering )
You're a wizard, Harry.

217
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,142
You're a wizard.

218
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,452
( indistinct chatter )

219
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,837
( camera clicks )

220
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,614
British man: So I says to Mabel,
I says, you can't fucking put

221
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,115
the guy on the fence like that

222
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,076
'cause it's fucking getting
in the way of my apple trees.

223
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,537
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, mate. Yes, bruv, what?

224
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,945
Do you guys know where I can
find an Italian phrase book?

225
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,542
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a bundle
of them down there, actually, pal.

226
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,044
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

227
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,795
- Where are you from?
- California.

228
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,422
Oh, California.
What, Hollywood!

229
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,216
( laughing )

230
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,092
- Join us for a drink, pal.
- Yeah, come on, man.

231
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Come on. Sit down.
Have a drink with us.

232
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,554
Go off and get him
a drink, go on.

233
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,015
- I'm Tom. That's me pal, Sam.
- ( Sam whistles )

234
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,143
Sam's Welsh and he fucks sheep,
but don't worry, he's all right.

235
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,603
You know, he won't
come near your bum.

236
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,211
- I'm not Welsh.
- Tom: Listen, mate,

237
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,940
- you are gonna fucking love it here.
- Thanks.

238
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,443
All you do is eat,
fucking drink, smoke weed.

239
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,291
I lay off the scag personally, don't I?
But it's your holiday, mate.

240
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,114
You do what you fucking like.

241
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,409
( laughs ) Let's see if the Yank
can fucking keep up, eh?

242
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,953
- ( thuds )
- Sam: Boo!

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
- ( laughing )
- Sam: Look at that.

244
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,958
- Well done, bruv.
- ( bottle thuds )

245
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,212
Oh, my God, I wish I could
fucking talk Italian, you know?

246
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,798
Sam:
Bunch of sixes, bruv.

247
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,968
- Sixes?
- Evan: Ciao. Ciao.

248
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,136
Tom: Oh, he's a goddamn
American hero.

249
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,473
- ( speaking Italian )
- Sam: Oi, oi.

250
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,141
You like me? No?

251
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,311
No. Absolutely.

252
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,898
Sam: Go on.
Go on. Oh, my God.

253
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,234
No, what are you doing, mate?
No, fucking hell, mate.

254
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,682
No, you got to be
more aggressive

255
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,530
if you want to shag
an Italian bird like that, mate.

256
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,449
What are you talking about?
What are you telling him for?

257
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,702
At least he went up there,
but you didn't do nothing.

258
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,579
You just don't give
a little fucking...

259
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,498
- Sam: What?
- Tom: Fucking hell.

260
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,208
Thank you for the beer, man.

261
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,627
Ah, you're welcome. Oh...
( snaps fingers )

262
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,588
Where are you at?
We're gonna hire a car tomorrow,

263
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,298
go down the coast.

264
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,508
Do you want to chip in
with some petrol?

265
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,218
Uh...

266
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,137
- ( music playing )
- ( laughing )

267
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,180
Go on and get...
Get a hold of that. Go on.

268
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,016
- Sam: Come on, Evan!
- Tom: Get it fuckin' in ya!

269
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,268
I said, "Fuck you, you cunt."
Do you remember that?

270
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,563
I was like, "Fuck you, you cunt."
Proper cunt.

271
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,815
- ( laughing )
- I'm like, "Fuck you, you mug."

272
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,483
Next thing you know,
I got punched in the face, mate.

273
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,051
Woke up three days later
in hospital

274
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,612
the cunt had fuckin' done me.

275
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,363
He didn't help.
He didn't help.

276
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,407
He didn't help.

277
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,284
You ever seen "8 Mile"?
You seen that movie "8 Mile"?

278
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,911
- Evan: Yeah.
- Right? It's like that.

279
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,204
So, geezers just rapping.

280
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,750
And then, I swear to God, one geezer
goes... goes up on the mic, right?

281
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,918
And he goes,
"Who can fucking battle me, blud?"

282
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
All this fucking bollocks.
"Who gonna battle me?"

283
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,131
I said, "Do you know what,
fuck this cunt. I'll fuckin' have a go."

284
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,176
Never rapped in me life, bruv.
Never fucking rapped in my life.

285
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,346
Went up there, mate.
Proper smashed him, mate,

286
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,765
- with a bottle in the face.
- ( all laughing )

287
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,392
( insects chirping )

288
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,228
( music blaring )

289
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,889
( yawning )

290
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,688
Birds, eh?

291
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,398
Fuckin' birds.

292
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,070
I was, uh...
I was seeing this girl once.

293
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,447
She's the love of my fucking
life, pal, you know?

294
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,284
Known her since school,
first kiss, all that fucking shit. Yeah.

295
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,620
Talked about having kids together,
the whole lot.

296
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,543
And one day,

297
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,796
she's in this pub

298
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,675
and she meets this bloke
from Ibiza, DJ, something.

299
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,385
Got a flat out there.

300
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,930
She only fucking leaves me

301
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,015
and goes and lives
with this cunt in Ibiza.

302
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,102
Broke my fucking heart, mate.

303
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,814
Anyway, two years later,
I'm in me local supermarket

304
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,442
and I fucking see her there.

305
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,610
She was proper fat.

306
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,989
Sunburnt, skin like leather...

307
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,744
teeth like fucking doggins,
it was disgusting. I loved it.

308
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,083
You're lucky I'm here, pal.

309
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,004
'Cause most men don't share
their emotions like I do.

310
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,177
( seagulls cawing )

311
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,800
( bell tolling )

312
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,639
- Hey, mate, you got a Wi-Fi code?
- No, I ain't got a Wi-Fi code.

313
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,349
You do have the Wi-Fi code, mate.
Can I just...

314
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,837
I gave it to you last night, man.

315
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,936
What did you do with
that little piece of paper?

316
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,688
You fucking rolled,
didn't you?

317
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,356
You used it as a roach.

318
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,234
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- ( Tom groans )

319
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,112
Oh, bro, I fucking blazed
the fucking Wi-Fi code, mate.

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,404
( muffled music playing )

321
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,989
( muffled music playing )

322
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,283
( speaking Italian )

323
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,912
...because I hate all nations equally.
And I'll tell you something else,

324
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,915
- the problem with Yanks, right?
- Yeah, everyone hates Americans.

325
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,403
I get it.
I'm an evil imperialist.

326
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,210
You don't play rugby,
that's the problem.

327
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,630
Well, yeah, there's that, but it's
also 'cause you're fucking loud.

328
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,258
- You're loud. I played soccer.
- Whole nation is loud.

329
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,262
I played soccer in elementary school
and I drink... I drink well.

330
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,513
- No, you can't.
- ( Tom laughing )

331
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,641
You have... I've barely seen you
drink five of those.

332
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,394
- Evan: That's not enough for you?
- Sam: No, I'm afraid not.

333
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,980
Fucking embarrassing
is what you are, mate.

334
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,107
- All right.
- Sam: Oh, look at this.

335
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,402
- All right, I'll get the next round.
- Tom: Yeah, go on, mate. Nice one.

336
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,737
Sam:
Thanks, Evan.

337
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,997
We saw each other earlier
and if I stared any longer

338
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,209
without saying hi,
I'd be the creepy dude gawking.

339
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,924
Oh, shit. English?

340
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,259
I need a drink.

341
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,011
Well, come sit
with me and my friends.

342
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,387
Leave with me.

343
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,725
Yeah.

344
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,189
I have to get
this round first and...

345
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:18,526
I'd rather go home with you now,
but if you like boys more...

346
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,031
( laughs )
Really?

347
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,075
Come on.

348
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,328
- What are you doing?
- Trying to have fun.

349
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,039
Are you a prostitute?

350
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,792
You want me to be?

351
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,670
Are you gonna rob me?

352
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,254
No, you look poor.

353
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,508
Well, I'm not gonna carry drugs
up my ass for you or your boss.

354
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,387
- Go out with me tomorrow night.
- No.

355
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,223
- 'Cause you're a hooker.
- Because I don't date.

356
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,686
Well, this is a fucked-up
act you have,

357
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,439
but let's say
you go home with...

358
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,692
I'd still like to grab coffee
or something sometime

359
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,278
'cause I think you're the most
attractive person I've ever seen.

360
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,948
But that doesn't outweigh
that you might be a mental patient

361
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,867
and I gotta make sure you're
the kind of crazy I can deal with.

362
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,747
You made this so much more
complicated than it needs to be.

363
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,624
Bottle of wine tomorrow night.

364
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,252
No... no!

365
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,795
Maybe?

366
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,756
Right.

367
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,845
- ( Tom laughing )
- Sam: Oh, no.

368
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,597
Oh, no.
You fumbled.

369
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,099
But if you're looking
for someone to play

370
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,147
the fucking long game with
come over here, bruv.

371
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,270
Sam will help you out.
Sam will let you fuck him.

372
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,522
- ( Tom laughing )
- I hate these guys.

373
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,108
( bell tolling )

374
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,279
( faint scuttling )

375
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,492
( waves crashing )

376
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,869
- Tom: Oi!
- Sam: Hey!

377
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,289
- ( whistles )
- ( bags zipping )

378
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,177
Tom: You went pint
for pint last night, son.

379
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,876
- I'm fucking proud of you.
- Sam: Well done, son, well done.

380
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,669
- I did?
- Tom: Nope.

381
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,629
Sam: Oi, we're leaving, mate.

382
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,673
- Okay.
- Tom: Yeah, it's too expensive.

383
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,800
We're going to Amsterdam.

384
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,427
- All right.
- You want to come?

385
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,388
No.

386
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,224
Sam: All right. Good times, mate.
Good times. Good times.

387
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,060
Tom:
Yeah, take care of yourself, son.

388
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay.

389
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,074
( seagulls cawing )

390
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,618
( waves crashing )

391
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,847
( car door slams )

392
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,360
( dog panting )

393
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,072
( thudding )

394
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,199
Evan: Scusa.
- ( thudding continues )

395
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,205
Scusa?

396
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,666
Um, buongiorno.

397
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,837
Buongiorno.

398
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,174
Um, English?

399
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,425
A little.

400
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,886
Is this room still available?

401
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,433
- Have you ever work on farm?
- No.

402
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,563
- Okay.
- Okay?

403
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,609
Come on.

404
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,244
You see?

405
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,455
Hot and cold.

406
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,082
Got it, thanks.

407
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,252
- If not hot...
- ( clanging )

408
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,097
When cold,
we cover up the trees

409
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:20,643
and once a week we gather
for the olive press.

410
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,478
The rest, I tell you.

411
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,689
Easy, huh?

412
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,403
Is that your wife?

413
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,281
Yes.

414
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,533
Is she here?

415
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,077
Car accident.

416
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,166
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
- ( groans )

417
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,963
( speaking Italian )

418
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,843
Uh...

419
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,513
women,
Jews of the world.

420
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,058
- Jews?
- Jews.

421
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,355
Jews.

422
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,814
Jewels.

423
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,733
Jewels.

424
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,749
( cat yowling )

425
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,219
( woman coughing )

426
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,564
Buongiorno.

427
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,316
Hey.

428
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,527
Hey, I just moved here,
so I was wondering

429
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,696
if that date might fall into place.

430
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,948
- Do you remember my name?
- You never told me.

431
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,866
- Evan: Scusa.
- You're learning.

432
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,413
( speaking Italian )

433
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,082
And you're not afraid to embarrass
yourself, that's good.

434
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm Evan.

435
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,129
Louise. Did you just...
Did you just touch my boob?

436
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,381
( laughs )
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

437
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,175
- Wow.
- All right, one last time

438
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,428
and I'll let you go.
Will you go out with me?

439
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,179
I don't know.

440
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,352
That's a huge cock.

441
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,771
It's fertility imagery.

442
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,734
No, that's... that's Roman porn.

443
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,444
Are you an artist?

444
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,778
No, are you?

445
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,864
No, I was a cook,

446
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,657
now I'm a farmer.

447
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,743
A farmer.

448
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,202
I just started.

449
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,538
That was fast.

450
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,373
Are you impressed?

451
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,460
- ( bangs case )
- No. Don't... don't touch that.

452
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,589
It's hard to make a living
in a tourist town.

453
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,923
How do you do it?

454
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,426
I don't. I'm a student.

455
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,345
And how did you end up here?

456
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,430
I'm studying evolutionary genetics.

457
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,767
It's easier to isolate genes
in a homogeneous population.

458
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,188
( shelf rattles )

459
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,148
Um, I'm researching stuff here

460
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,901
'cause not many people
have left or emigrated.

461
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,319
I'm fucking up your job.

462
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,864
Yes, you are. So go back
to America, fascist.

463
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,115
Great scam you pulled

464
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,443
having the university pay for you
to live here, though.

465
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,245
I know, right?

466
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,832
What do you think of her?

467
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,794
She's hot.

468
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,338
You think so?

469
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,507
I need caffeine.

470
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,658
Louise: What... what happened
to your hand?

471
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,775
Um, I punched a guy.

472
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,236
Did it hurt?

473
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,154
No.

474
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,697
Yes.

475
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,826
Did you... did you feel better?

476
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,787
I know, I'm a child,
I'm immature...

477
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,498
I was just going to say
we're all human.

478
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,173
My family would vacation here
when I was little

479
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,677
and I would see
these old men sitting here.

480
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:26,222
Sometimes I wonder
if it's the same ones.

481
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,391
You don't sound Italian.

482
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,063
- Are you really from around here?
- Not far. I traveled a lot, though.

483
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,399
So I sound weird as fuck.

484
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,192
Did you learn
your English in England?

485
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,070
I did. But then I studied
in America for a while.

486
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,613
- Where?
- New York.

487
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,365
- I've never been there.
- You've never been to New York?

488
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,653
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

489
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,285
I thought all Americans
have been to New York.

490
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,953
- I've been to Southern California,
- Right.

491
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,707
- Mexico, and here.
- Oh, Mexico. I love Mexico.

492
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,876
I went there
with my ex on a boat.

493
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,461
What happened?

494
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,421
We had so much Mexican food.

495
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,132
- No, no, with the guy.
- Oh. Oh, he was awful.

496
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,384
Oh, he was... he always
had to conquer something.

497
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,136
Why did you date him, then?

498
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,389
( groans ) He wrote me
very romantic love letters

499
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,893
and he was so much fun
to drink wine with.

500
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,020
Let's get a bottle of wine.

501
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,816
Okay, but you have to
write me a letter first.

502
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,737
You can write it while I finish
my espresso.

503
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,157
( clears throat )

504
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,257
( Louise squeals )

505
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,774
( chuckles )

506
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,075
- I'm still jet-lagged.
- ( glass clinks )

507
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,368
Flipping my days for nights

508
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,828
is making everything feel
like I'm in a dream.

509
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,288
Thanks for the wine.

510
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,791
It's most of my paycheck
that I haven't gotten yet,

511
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,042
but you're worth it.

512
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,461
You shouldn't pay for things.

513
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,383
What if I told you I'm actually
a successful businessman

514
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,135
taking a break
from all my wealth?

515
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,804
Are you?

516
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,514
I'm not.

517
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,517
When I would sit at the bar
at the restaurant I worked at,

518
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,728
for every one woman I'd catch
combing the place

519
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,647
for a doctor or lawyer,

520
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,192
I'd see like 10 of them
with some bum like me.

521
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,778
Did you like being a cook?

522
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,947
No.

523
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,158
- It was fucking horrible.
- It can always be worse.

524
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,494
And here you are,
trying new stuff.

525
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,497
I mean, I could do something
really important, still.

526
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,959
- Like invent an app or something.
- Or get your own reality show.

527
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,336
- The dream. The dream.
- Oh.

528
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,382
At least you're living.

529
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,427
Yeah, I always used to
say that, too.

530
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,355
Right now if I really had
the choice, though,

531
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,015
I might take
professional success over living.

532
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,349
I've worked many jobs

533
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,769
and none of them... none...
Have been worth missing life.

534
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,399
That's very European and all,
but you know...

535
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,861
Know what?

536
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,031
Taking siestas and being
less competitive, that's really nice,

537
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,991
but your iPhone
was not invented in Europe.

538
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,201
Yeah, right.
You want to go somewhere?

539
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,370
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.

540
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,540
Um...

541
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,584
( coins clinking )

542
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:46,964
Fuck it.

543
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,759
( waves crashing )

544
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,639
We're going into that cave!

545
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,140
- ( Evan laughs ) No.
- Yeah!

546
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,851
I bet it's haunted
by dead sailors.

547
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,271
- I thought you were a scientist.
- I am a scientist.

548
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,941
What is this "dead sailor"
bullshit ghost story?

549
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,527
I bet you also think names
determine personality, right?

550
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,072
- Oh, they do. All Crystals are sluts.
- Oh.

551
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,909
- Yeah! ( yelling in Arabic )
- Oh.

552
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,788
And... and Evans are nice.

553
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,456
You do like me, then.

554
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,916
Maybe.

555
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,444
I know names don't determine shit.

556
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,169
But there are still lots
of mysteries out there.

557
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,546
Even I'm a mystery to myself.

558
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,049
I wish I could say I wasn't just
a simpleminded dude.

559
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,259
I understand
about half of myself.

560
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,928
- Then you're half magic.
- Mmm.

561
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,846
I'm half undiscovered science,

562
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,183
bunch of confusing
biochemistry,

563
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,353
and some crazy hormones.

564
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,733
She drowned a few months ago.

565
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,903
Evan:
That's horrible.

566
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,239
Yeah, the dams
up the mountain broke.

567
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,908
Her body was taken
out to the sea by the flude.

568
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,619
Flood?

569
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,163
And they found
her dead body in Sicily.

570
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,584
You know, I know it's cliché,
but all the people

571
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,255
that put that religious stuff up?
I mean, why do they think

572
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,424
God would do that
to a little girl like her?

573
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,434
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause everybody's gonna die

574
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,602
whether they believe
in God or not, right?

575
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,986
I have this buddy... um, great guy,
always wasted, though.

576
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,779
Not really perceptive.

577
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,532
He goes to a party
with his girlfriend,

578
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,534
and this other girl,

579
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,413
maybe about four feet tall,
walks up to him...

580
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,250
punches him in the face.
Knocks him out.

581
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,004
Turns out this girl was cheating
on him with his girlfriend.

582
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,714
So now everybody knows
Tommy was knocked out

583
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,216
by a lesbian named Tiny.

584
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,182
Mm, I love Tiny,
but what is your point?

585
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,019
Nothing.
It's just a funny story.

586
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,165
( breathing heavily )

587
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,356
No.

588
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,423
( gasps )

589
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,302
- ( thuds )
- ( cat yowling )

590
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,115
Angelo:
In winter, you put dirt here.

591
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,702
In spring, we just take off.

592
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,953
Done.

593
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,425
Perfect.

594
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,595
This is...
( speaking Italian )

595
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,142
Got it.

596
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,311
( speaking Italian )

597
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,149
Bene. Perfect.

598
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,984
You take out this...
( speaking Italian )

599
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,905
- All of them?
- Si.

600
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,497
( bird cawing )

601
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,008
( cat whimpering )

602
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,188
What's that, kitty?

603
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,149
What's that?
What's that?

604
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,036
( skin sizzling )

605
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,896
( man speaking Italian )

606
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,424
( wings fluttering )

607
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:10,514
- ( refrigerator humming )
- ( indistinct chatter )

608
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,934
- ( refrigerator humming )
- ( indistinct chatter )

609
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,103
Louise:
This...

610
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,276
Fuck, this town is small, huh?

611
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,237
Hi.

612
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,822
Hey.

613
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,616
You, uh, snuck out last night.

614
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,620
- I did?
- Yeah.

615
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,043
Mm. And who are you?

616
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,047
Uh, Evan, the guy you
slept with last night.

617
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,301
Sorry, I don't recall.

618
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,262
( scoffs )

619
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,978
( laughing )
Evan.

620
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,147
Oh, that's fucked up.

621
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,649
- Don't be so emotional.
- That's messed up.

622
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,110
This is the best place,
you should try it.

623
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,696
( speaking Italian )

624
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,247
Man, you eat a lot.

625
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't care if you call me fat.

626
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,252
I was starting to think you were
cooler than pulling this one.

627
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,088
I'm just saying I don't care.

628
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,674
If this was the 1700s,
you would think I'm too skinny.

629
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,551
You may not believe this,
but most men are not attracted

630
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,303
to women who look
like preteen boys.

631
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,846
Mm, some are.

632
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,141
That's true, but most men
just want a girl who's healthy.

633
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,103
Obesity and anorexia,
they're equally unattractive.

634
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,438
I think your opinion of men
is too high.

635
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,899
No, I know dudes.
All we ever think about is sex,

636
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,442
sometimes food, sad truth.

637
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,112
You shouldn't say that out loud.

638
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,155
Hey, do you mind
if we go in here?

639
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,116
- ( music playing inside )
- Sure.

640
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,160
- Do you smoke?
- Sometimes.

641
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,538
I smoke more than sometimes.

642
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,498
Louise:
Then don't.

643
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,208
I don't want to live forever.

644
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,751
How about this, you go out
with me tomorrow night,

645
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,753
I won't buy any cigarettes.

646
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,004
What?

647
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,674
Will you go out with me
if I quit smoking?

648
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,884
Don't quit for me.

649
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,888
You don't want to go out
with me again?

650
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,682
I don't know.

651
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,770
One, uh... una?

652
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,232
Si. Uh, those.

653
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,569
( speaking Italian )

654
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,825
Who are these guys?

655
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,285
Louise:
That's Bob and Sally.

656
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,580
I rescued them from a lab
that was done with them.

657
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,456
Would you like to adopt them?

658
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,333
- No, I'm good.
- Mm.

659
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,419
Are you sure they should be
in the same cage?

660
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,338
It's only until
I find them a home.

661
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,759
Yeah, but they're gonna fuck like...
You're gonna have a billion rabbits.

662
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,638
Do you mind if I put on
some music?

663
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,016
Sure, but don't judge me.

664
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,767
Are you allergic to anything?

665
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,855
Uh, no. These are in
a lot of different languages.

666
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,565
You said you wouldn't judge.

667
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,401
- I'm not, I'm just impressed.
- Good.

668
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,969
Do you speak
any of these languages?

669
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,031
Mm-hmm.
Do you like leeks?

670
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,366
Sure.
How many do you speak?

671
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,036
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't know?

672
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:23,415
Um... French, German, Italian,

673
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,085
Spanish, a few forms of Arabic,

674
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,839
Japanese, Latin, Greek...

675
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,717
I think that's it.

676
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:38,222
- You don't speak Sumerian?
- No, do you?

677
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,642
I don't speak dead languages.

678
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,311
( clears throat )
Do you mind?

679
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,271
The ashtray isn't decoration.

680
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,858
That's true.

681
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,159
You should quit smoking.

682
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,370
You are a hypocrite.

683
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,999
No, I'm not.

684
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,002
( flesh bubbling )

685
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,546
Uh, would you mind
watching the soup

686
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,424
while I use the restroom?

687
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,760
Evan:
Yeah, sure.

688
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,265
( waves crashing )

689
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,106
( bubbling )

690
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,203
( gasps )

691
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,582
- ( whimpers )
- ( fly buzzing )

692
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,729
- Soup's ready.
- Just a second.

693
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,692
Louise: Do you ever feel like
you have to shower immediately?

694
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,403
Uh, I think that's a girl thing.

695
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,280
Louise:
Showering is a girl thing?

696
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,741
I'm going to the beach
on Sunday.

697
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,702
You are waiting
to bathe in the sea?

698
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,246
Uh, yup.
You want to come?

699
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,123
Louise:
That's gross.

700
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,916
Seriously, do you
want to go with me?

701
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,503
I can't. I'm taking medication
that makes my skin sun-sensitive.

702
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,425
So, I only
get to see you at night?

703
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,511
You can meet my husband
and kids, if you want,

704
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,848
but our nights together
must remain a secret.

705
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,851
Mm. Yeah, we'd probably get
bored with each other anyway.

706
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,354
Louise:
Mm.

707
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,774
Not bad.
What's in it?

708
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,276
Leeks, saffron, and rabbit.

709
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,447
It's just a broth

710
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,825
with a bunch of spices
and vegetables.

711
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,161
Oh, Jesus,
you're a vegetarian?

712
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,248
I try to be,
but sometimes I crave meat.

713
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,708
( rabbits squeaking )

714
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,296
( birds chirping )

715
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,593
Evan:
I've got to go to work.

716
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,310
Louise: Thank you, be safe.
Blanket.

717
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,818
( toilet flushes )

718
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,332
- Evan: Is this bad?
- Angelo: It's a tree.

719
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,210
- Here.
- Why don't you just kill 'em?

720
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:58,797
They help to make fruit.

721
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,426
They kill the tree
so they can pollinate it?

722
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,636
Mother Nature is crazy,
Angelo.

723
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,849
What the hell is that?

724
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,893
Tumore della radice.

725
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,770
No capisco.

726
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,772
Rotten roots.

727
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,858
Root rot, huh?

728
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,697
I've been seeing this Italian girl.

729
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,991
She's really pretty.

730
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,034
But she acts kind of weird
sometimes

731
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,079
and I found something
that gives me some doubts.

732
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,915
- ( speaking Italian )
- I appreciate the Italian lessons,

733
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,376
really, I do, but, Angelo, I have
no idea what the hell you're saying.

734
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,753
Choose your poison.

735
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,922
That's your advice?

736
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,010
Italian women, the best.

737
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:48,638
That's wonderful advice, Angelo,
but have you been anywhere else?

738
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,931
In France.

739
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,976
So Italian women, you think they're
better than French women?

740
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,312
I get that.

741
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,440
Your wife was a goddess,
Angelo, but I got to tell you

742
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,526
there's a lot of really
beautiful women in the USA.

743
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,362
Italian women.

744
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,741
You realize in America there are
a lot of Italian immigrants, right?

745
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:14,289
Okay, what now? Is it... do we, like,
bury a virgin lamb skull

746
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,374
full of herbs to ward off
the infection?

747
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,834
Che cosa?

748
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,170
You know, the whole voodoo
biodynamic farming thing?

749
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,964
I worked at a restaurant in college.
They told me that Italian farmers...

750
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,133
That's how they do it.
You don't do that?

751
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,887
Fungus killer spray in shed.

752
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,764
Spray? Got it.

753
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,019
( snaps fingers )

754
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,452
( flies buzzing )

755
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,099
- Louise: Did you farm again today?
- Evan: Yes, I did.

756
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,561
It's amazing,
you're picking it up so quickly.

757
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,328
I don't make bad jokes
about what you do.

758
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,356
I can imagine it being this really
intense apprenticeship

759
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,859
where he shares all of his worldly
knowledge as you tend to the land.

760
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,696
No, it's nothing like that.

761
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,282
Um...

762
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,909
- Hey.
- What?

763
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,371
Can I ask you something?
Don't get mad.

764
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,748
Depends what it is.

765
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,236
This morning I found a used syringe
on your bathroom floor.

766
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,712
I know it's none of my business
and we just met, but...

767
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,548
Uh, okay, it's not drugs.
I have a medical condition

768
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:50,260
that comes and goes
and it's a very long story.

769
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,597
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
even bothered to...

770
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,475
I'm... I didn't think you were a junkie,
I just needed to know what it was.

771
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,270
Do you think I gave you AIDS?

772
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,398
- No.
- Oh, you did. You thought it!

773
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:04,858
- No, I didn't.
- Hep C?

774
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,236
- That would've been worth it.
- Oh, come on, I don't believe you.

775
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,864
Can I do something
really corny right now?

776
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,073
Again?

777
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,700
I've been carrying this thing
around for a week

778
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,703
and I haven't used it once,
but I'd really like a picture with you.

779
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,038
You haven't called anyone?

780
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,000
Uh, calling card's cheaper
and the only person I call is Tommy

781
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,419
and he's always drunk, so...

782
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,422
What about your family?

783
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,424
Um...

784
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,676
Well, tell me
about your family.

785
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,763
Well, they're great.

786
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,057
Scusa. Scusa!

787
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,644
( speaking Italian )

788
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,772
- Waiter: Sure.
- Evan: Grazie.

789
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,232
- Just one photo, please.
- All right.

790
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,303
- ( camera clicks )
- Waiter: Okay.

791
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,072
Grazie.

792
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,657
- You moved.
- Waiter: Un altro?

793
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,284
- No, no. Grazie, no.
- Waiter: Okay.

794
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,453
Evan:
Ugh.

795
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,626
Tell... tell me
about your family.

796
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,630
I really don't want to
do that right now.

797
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,966
Come on.

798
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,846
You're seriously mad because
I don't want to talk about something?

799
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,682
You just want to come here,
fuck a foreign girl,

800
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,558
and show your stupid friend
the picture.

801
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,686
That doesn't make any sense.

802
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,813
And when I ask you
something important about you

803
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,941
and you don't tell me,
that means you can't be intimate.

804
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,349
Evan:
I'm so confused right now.

805
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,113
Look, I went to
the fucking beach with you.

806
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,632
I'm sorry.

807
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,926
I think you're overreacting,
but I'm sorry.

808
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:59,514
And I think you're being annoying,
but maybe I was just being crazy.

809
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,458
Do you want to hear
about my family?

810
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,061
Yes, I do. Yes.

811
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,521
It's a fucked-up story.

812
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,190
So we're sleeping together
and I'm, like, making you meals,

813
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,598
but you can't tell me anything?

814
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,360
The only family I had
was my mom and dad.

815
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,738
My dad died suddenly
of a heart attack.

816
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,699
My mom was diagnosed with
cancer a few months after that.

817
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,826
I came home from college
a couple years ago

818
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,537
to take care of her
and she died last week.

819
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,168
Wow, I mean, that's horrible.

820
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,336
No shit.

821
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,215
Not exactly
great dinner conversation.

822
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,843
Are you okay?

823
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,640
Do I seem all right?

824
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,644
I like you.

825
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,188
Were you better before?

826
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,648
I think I'm all right.

827
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:55,278
You've got the same backstory
as Batman.

828
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,239
This is so cool.
( laughs )

829
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,327
Are you mad?

830
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:05,330
I mean, I've got nothing to avenge
if I become a masked vigilante...

831
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,791
Oh, shut up.
I mean how sometimes

832
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,044
even if you don't believe in a higher
power, you get mad at one.

833
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:17,467
Yeah, I'm mad at something
for doing that to them,

834
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,178
making me put my life on hold

835
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,597
while I worked
at the same shitty bar

836
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,850
I grew up thinking
I never want to end up at.

837
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,608
How do girls know to do that?

838
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,402
What is it
you would've done instead?

839
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,740
I don't know.

840
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,283
And I feel...

841
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:47,205
I feel guilty and selfish for...

842
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:51,960
Like a sociopath for worrying
about what I'm doing for work

843
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,128
when my whole family just died.

844
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,800
Your professional life is fine.

845
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,969
Do you feel
like an orphaned farmer?

846
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,515
No, but I feel like a grown-ass man
who misses his parents.

847
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,149
( sighs )
So...

848
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,737
you gonna tell me
something now?

849
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,284
Like what?

850
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,494
I don't know. But I just bared
my soul to you.

851
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,622
- That was baring your soul?
- Fuck off.

852
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,917
Okay, let's see, mm.

853
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,836
Not this one, no.

854
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:40,675
Um, did you know I have
two different color eyes?

855
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,677
What do you mean?

856
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,350
Holy shit.

857
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,019
Why do you wear the contact?

858
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,857
My ex-boyfriend
always made fun of it.

859
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,776
- What an asshole.
- I'm joking. I'm lying.

860
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,695
No one ever did that.

861
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,073
You probably lie a lot.

862
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,784
I've actually never lied to you.

863
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,204
Not once.

864
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,374
Your eyes are beautiful.

865
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,878
- And you're not very creative.
- ( Evan scoffs )

866
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,223
Hey, Angelo?

867
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,061
Angelo:
Si?

868
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,105
( speaking Italian )

869
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,484
Never seen a tree that has
two different fruits on it.

870
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,527
Lorange tree.

871
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,031
Got lemons and oranges,
so I call it a lorange tree.

872
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,533
Or are those limes?

873
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,373
You get it, loranges?

874
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,626
- That's it?
- ( Angelo speaking Italian )

875
00:54:56,794 --> 00:55:00,588
Old tree uses new tree.

876
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,215
The fruit looks good.

877
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:03,883
Oh, yes.

878
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,636
( speaking Italian )

879
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,263
- Vulcano.
- Volcano?

880
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,809
Yes, volcano make good soil.

881
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,478
- Is it active?
- Ha!

882
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,859
( fluorescent lights humming )

883
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,655
( speaking Italian )

884
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:35,540
( door closes )

885
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,625
( sniffing )

886
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,922
- ( flesh bubbling )
- Shit.

887
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,848
( sniffs )

888
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,350
( groans )

889
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,979
( panting )

890
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,481
( crows cawing )

891
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,111
( labored breathing )

892
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,118
( music playing )

893
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,381
Good job, Bob.

894
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,679
Sorry, Sally.

895
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,393
( music stops )

896
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,395
( whimpering )

897
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,003
( rabbit squeaking )

898
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,837
( knocks )

899
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,923
Louise:
Come in.

900
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,341
Evan:
Hey.

901
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,552
Long, bad day.

902
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,970
Let's stay in.

903
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,471
- Really?
- Yeah.

904
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,600
Sorry I'm being really boring.

905
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,436
- You feel all right?
- I think so.

906
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:44,979
Do I look all right?

907
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,480
You look beautiful.

908
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:50,359
I might be sick. You may not
want to get too close.

909
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,157
What are you doing?

910
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,243
Lift up your head.

911
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:03,831
I read that this is what you do
when a girl gets sick.

912
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,833
You don't have to.

913
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,711
Anything to eat?

914
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,381
There are some oranges
and yogurt in the fridge.

915
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,426
Here, find something
for us to watch.

916
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,180
What happened
to Bob and Sally?

917
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,390
I don't want to talk about it.

918
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,191
You want some?

919
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,860
Thanks.

920
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,154
My friend Tommy
said he was born with a tail.

921
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,699
I doubt your friend Tommy
is one of the 23 cases ever.

922
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,243
- No, he totally is.
- Mm, yeah.

923
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,703
We have lots of things
we don't use anymore.

924
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,456
I'm pretty sure they sell this
at Urban Ourfitters.

925
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,793
It's oversimplified and misleading,
but I like the pictures.

926
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,753
Want some water?

927
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,838
Vino.

928
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,840
- Vino?
- Wine.

929
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,425
I know.

930
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,390
Thank you.

931
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,067
Di piu?
How much more?

932
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,236
Basta finito.

933
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,406
- For the day?
- Si.

934
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,116
Well, let's go fishing
or something.

935
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,451
No. Sono stanco.

936
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,911
Come on, man.

937
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,163
My girlfriend's at work,
I got nothing to do.

938
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,418
Look, if you're stanco,
let me drive these down.

939
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,587
Have fun.

951
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,711
- Evan: Oh, my God.
- ( both laughing )

952
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,713
- What are you doing here?
- Walking home from work.

953
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,382
What are you doing here?

954
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,426
Um, here.

955
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,886
We're buying gifts now?

956
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:49,557
It has Roman porn in it.
Remember?

957
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,058
You didn't sign it, though.

958
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,936
( bell tolling )

959
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,149
( pen scratching )

960
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,445
( laughs )

961
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,911
- Hmm.
- ( laughs )

962
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,539
There are so many more
tourists here than usual.

963
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,499
This is the beginning.

964
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,919
Late spring is a madhouse.

965
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,442
- You want to go somewhere?
- Let's go.

966
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:26,510
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.
It's a secret.

967
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,555
Not Tommy, no girls.

968
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,183
- Anywhere away from tourists.
- You're a tourist.

969
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,435
We have to get my boat.
Come on.

970
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,604
You have a boat?

971
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,065
( Louise singing in German )

972
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,610
- Come on, faster, Evan! Faster!
- Can you swim if we sink?

973
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,653
Louise:
The lady gorilla won't sink.

974
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,489
Evan:
Seriously, can you swim?

975
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,282
Okay, so we're very close.

976
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,118
So paddle us as fast as you can,
then get down.

977
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,745
All right, have you
done this before?

978
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,498
( Louise singing in German )

979
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,672
Evan:
This looks like magic.

980
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,801
Louise: Looks like stuff from nature
we haven't figured out yet.

981
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,762
Evan:
Well, what makes this?

982
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,931
The glow?
It's from refracted sunlight

983
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,100
coming through
a big hole underwater.

984
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,644
How did you find it?

985
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,604
My friend showed it to me.

986
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:23,442
There are some others the tours
go to, but this one is a secret.

987
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:29,657
Some of the Roman statues from
the exhibit were found over there.

988
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,000
Louise:
Hormones and biochemistry.

989
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:43,837
Moment ruined and I think
we're taking on water.

990
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,173
Stop talking shit
about my boat, Evan.

991
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,028
Louise: Can I ask you
something awkward now?

992
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,863
Evan:
No.

993
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:14,076
Do you ever
change your clothes?

994
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,537
- Yes!
- Really?

995
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,914
All I brought is my backpack
and the only things they sell here

996
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,583
are, like,
"I heart Bologna" shirts.

997
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,294
Man:
Octopussy!

998
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,297
- We are not all like that.
- Man: Octopussy.

999
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,007
Man: You girls
old enough to drink?

1000
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,093
You know where
we can get some beer?

1001
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,886
Uh, Evan,
are you still hungry?

1002
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,179
No, I'm good.

1003
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,547
'Cause you know, the clinic
opens really early tomorrow.

1004
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,684
- Yeah, I have work tomorrow, too.
- I've got to go to bed.

1005
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,853
- Don't pay for me.
- No, you did all the rowing.

1006
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,148
- But thanks for a wonderful time.
- ( Evan growls )

1007
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,283
( moaning )

1008
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,619
( panting )

1009
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,974
What up?

1010
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,728
Hey, I have weed
in my hotel room.

1011
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,610
( laughing )
I don't speak French.

1012
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:31,820
Uh...

1013
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,074
how much
to suck my dick?

1014
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,956
Man:
Shh, shh.

1015
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,795
What the...?

1016
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,881
( snarling )

1017
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,801
( man screaming )

1018
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,521
( bell ringing )

1019
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:21,412
( indistinct TV chatter )

1020
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,331
( Angelo yelling in Italian )

1021
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,461
( door opens )

1022
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,382
Football bad?

1023
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,008
Si.

1024
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,593
Where are you
off to all dapper?

1025
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,220
Chiesa. Come.

1026
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:54,361
( Angelo speaking Italian )

1027
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,405
Grazie.

1028
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,458
Your Italian is going better.

1029
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:11,211
Yeah, I'm trying.
( laughs )

1030
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,089
Are there any
single donne at church?

1031
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,425
Si.

1032
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,552
You should ask one out.

1033
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:24,475
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

1034
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,435
My wife.

1035
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,983
Oh, well...

1036
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,736
if you ever feel ready,
then you should.

1037
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,820
( knocking on door )

1038
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,285
- Hey.
- Hey.

1039
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:26,912
Something wrong?

1040
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,623
No, it's...

1041
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,417
- Can I come in?
- No, it's not a good time right now.

1042
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,923
Um, well, I mean
if you really have to.

1043
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:53,522
Um, I didn't sleep
at all last night,

1044
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:57,150
so forgive me
if I stumble through this.

1045
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,778
I don't even know how much
you need me to tell you this,

1046
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,197
because it's been
barely a week,

1047
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,993
but things got intense
so fast and...

1048
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,038
Tell me what?

1049
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,166
We can't see
each other anymore.

1050
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,255
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1051
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,008
I don't think you're ready
for where this is going

1052
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,935
and I have some things
I need to work through

1053
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,845
without being
in a relationship.

1054
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:26,805
And, Evan, I'm...

1055
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,475
I'm really, really sorry
for leading you on like this.

1056
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,271
I can see how
you could feel like this has...

1057
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,982
This has all been going so fast.

1058
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,110
Like, if you're freaked out and you
need some space, that's fine.

1059
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,195
Evan, you've been through
a lot recently

1060
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,699
and maybe you're not
thinking clearly, but...

1061
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,662
I'm fine.

1062
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,707
- What's your problem?
- No, I...

1063
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:58,211
I'd really rather not explain
what's the problem.

1064
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,257
Um, again, I can't tell you
how sorry I am

1065
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,677
and that you're
a wonderful guy, but...

1066
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:09,765
What happened to intimacy
being talking about stuff?

1067
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:15,145
That's it?
So I leave here

1068
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,690
and it's like you and I
never happened?

1069
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:21,568
We never see each other again?

1070
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,034
Okay.

1071
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,002
I want you to know something...

1072
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,381
Take it or leave it...

1073
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,466
I think you could be
the love of my life,

1074
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,844
and I know that sounds stupid,
it's only been five days.

1075
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,097
But it's true.

1076
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,100
If you don't feel anything for me
and that's what this is really about,

1077
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,060
then I wish you the best
with everything in your life

1078
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,271
'cause I think you're
an amazing person.

1079
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,024
But if you do feel something,

1080
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:04,236
I think you should think
about this a little bit longer.

1081
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,954
All right.

1082
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,340
( people speaking Italian )

1083
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,639
( groans )

1084
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:43,900
I'm taking off, Angelo.

1085
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,902
( Angelo speaking Italian )

1086
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,449
Uh, donne problema.

1087
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,285
- ( Angelo scoffs )
- Oh, I didn't hit her.

1088
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:57,164
I hit a wall 'cause she
broke up with me.

1089
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,166
- ( car door slams )
- Stupido.

1090
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,126
( engine starts )

1091
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,961
"Donna Italiana," right?

1092
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,088
Ciao.

1093
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,385
Hey, Angelo?

1094
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,015
I wanted to say thank you.

1095
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,017
Uh, even with all this,
I'm living the fantasy

1096
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,352
of some rich
American housewife.

1097
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,357
I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna stay here,

1098
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,152
but I want you to know
that I appreciate all this.

1099
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,780
( speaking Italian )

1100
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:33,825
Policia?

1101
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,161
Immigrazione.

1102
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,538
Immigration?
Do I need to worry?

1103
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,916
- Si.
- Should I run?

1104
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,709
Si.

1105
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:58,183
- ( music playing on TV )
- ( clock ticking )

1106
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,245
So back in the US,
the cops are after me.

1107
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,039
Before that, I lost my job

1108
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,543
and lost my... my parents.

1109
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:29,714
Here, I lost my job,

1110
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:34,302
lost my girlfriend,
and the cops are after me.

1111
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,265
- ( sighs )
- ( dog barking )

1112
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,647
( knocks )

1113
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,774
( glass crashing )

1114
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,281
( gasping )

1115
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,052
( whimpering )

1116
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,473
( snarls )

1117
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,064
( gasping )

1118
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,384
( panting )

1119
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,779
Can you start...

1120
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:18,406
Can you start
the shower, please?

1121
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,161
( thudding )

1122
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,848
Are you a vampire, werewolf,

1123
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,394
zombie, witch, or alien?

1124
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,063
( Louise scoffs )
Human.

1125
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,734
Are you scared of me?

1126
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,113
Yeah,

1127
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,866
but explain it to me.

1128
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:08,081
Sorry, I...
( sniffles )

1129
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,419
Evan.

1130
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,421
Calm...

1131
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,715
Fuck.

1132
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,223
Evan, that is me.

1133
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,685
No, it's not.

1134
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,145
It is.

1135
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:33,440
I posed for that painting
almost 2,000 years ago.

1136
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,776
Ha! This is the crazy
I can't handle.

1137
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,613
My eyes are like this because
of hereditary heterochromia.

1138
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:41,990
Do you know what that means?

1139
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,478
I don't know. You, like, give it
to your kids or something?

1140
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,579
Correct, but I've been
giving it to myself.

1141
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:49,664
There are things I have found out
in the last two decades

1142
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,709
that I don't understand entirely
and you may find them upsetting.

1143
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,294
You're trying not to upset me?

1144
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:56,963
You dumped me
and became a monster.

1145
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,007
Okay, you win one argument.

1146
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:03,094
Um, do you know
what embryonic stem cells are?

1147
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,388
Cure stuff.
You abort babies to get 'em.

1148
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,932
Not necessarily, but you
kind of get the idea.

1149
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,393
They replicate for a long time
and can be used to heal

1150
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,145
- or maintain your whole body.
- So that's what you are?

1151
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,022
You're like "Newsweek" fountain
of youth cells or something?

1152
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,940
Sure, so my body uses the cells

1153
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,611
so I stay the same age
and heal very fast.

1154
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,489
But... embryonic cells?

1155
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,949
Are you fucking pregnant?

1156
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,911
Fuck!

1157
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,996
I conceive and about a week later

1158
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,999
I'm a healthy 20-year-old
with 50% new DNA.

1159
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:37,670
I stay the same age for about 20 years
and then I need new cells.

1160
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,198
And you dumped me
once you got 'em.

1161
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,383
You wouldn't have
recognized me anyway.

1162
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,595
I'll have to start a new life.
I always do, every 20 years.

1163
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,431
Why tonight?
Why even get to know me?

1164
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:49,974
I didn't want to hurt you.

1165
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,852
- Ha!
- God damn it, I mean physically.

1166
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,480
Before my body uses the cells,
it goes crazy.

1167
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,358
I rot, I turn into creatures
from our evolutionary past,

1168
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,444
- I fucking kill stuff!
- Fuck!

1169
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,071
( Evan groans )

1170
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,032
- Hey, we both have tempers, huh?
- Yeah, but mine's worse.

1171
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,160
And something is off.
And I thought I could control it, but...

1172
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,038
fuck, I got...

1173
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:15,041
I got desperate
and I tried occult books and...

1174
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,335
- Occult books?
- I ate my rabbit.

1175
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,046
- What?
- Okay, it's not magic, okay?

1176
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:24,384
There's adult stem cells in cat brains
and rabbit intestines, testicles.

1177
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:25,885
Well, use those!

1178
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:29,264
I do,
but they aren't as effective.

1179
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:33,143
Okay, well, whatever I saw
on your living room floor,

1180
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,687
that was not the physical laws
of the universe.

1181
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,313
- Okay, just...
- I need a second.

1182
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,399
Look, just because you haven't
seen something before, Evan,

1183
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,734
doesn't mean it's supernatural.

1184
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,653
( sighs )
Evan.

1185
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,113
Can you please stop
walking away?

1186
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,532
- Please?
- Give me a minute.

1187
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,033
( ringing )

1188
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,953
- Tommy: Hello?
- Hello? Tommy!

1189
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,413
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's Evan!

1190
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,081
- Ev!
- What's up, man?

1191
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,085
- How you doin', brother?
- I'm good, I'm good.

1192
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,214
- Yeah, I met a girl.
- What? Is she fucking hot?

1193
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:48,134
- Yeah, she's... she's really hot, yeah.
- ( Tommy laughing )

1194
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:51,804
- Um, do you have a sec?
- Uh, sure, man.

1195
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,306
- What's up?
- ( groans )

1196
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,185
I got this girl or, uh,
maybe monster pregnant

1197
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,978
and I don't know
if she's gonna, like,

1198
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,980
- give birth to herself or...
- What?

1199
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:04,192
- Hello? Tommy? Tommy?
- Hello? Ev?

1200
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,653
Ev, dude, I just smoked
a huge fucking bowl...

1201
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,696
- Smoked a huge bowl?
- Yeah, man.

1202
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,824
- Like, right before you called.
- Gotcha.

1203
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,712
Yeah, right before I got
on the phone? Okay.

1204
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,328
Yeah.

1205
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:19,332
Um, no, no. No problem, man,
no problem at all.

1206
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,126
Just, uh, I'll call you back
another time.

1207
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,711
Call me back, man.
Have a good time out there.

1208
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,506
Yeah. Yup, enjoy.

1209
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,478
( Angelo singing in Italian )

1210
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:06,713
( crying )

1211
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,149
( sighs )

1212
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,702
I know it's complicated,
obviously,

1213
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,414
but let's talk about this.

1214
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:48,338
That's me.

1215
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,757
It's something chemical.

1216
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,426
Pheromones.

1217
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,470
If I do this to a plant,
you have to wonder what it is

1218
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:57,388
you're actually feeling.

1219
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,435
I've seen what happens to you.

1220
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:06,606
I mean, I've seen this
at its worst, right?

1221
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:08,441
And I can deal with that part.

1222
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,445
No. You want to be with someone
that is basically going to be related

1223
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,740
to you and when you're 85
you'll look like an inbred pedophile?

1224
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,743
- Yes, probably.
- No.

1225
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,471
In a day
I'll be someone else and, Evan,

1226
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,289
you should get far
to keep all your stuff attached.

1227
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:26,626
Let's use the time we have.

1228
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:29,337
Why? Why?

1229
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,963
For just a little while longer,

1230
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:34,133
I'm a normal guy,
you're a normal girl.

1231
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,843
We're here.

1232
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,305
I'd regret it if we didn't
take this to its end.

1233
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:43,434
Evan, you know that I'm not
in love with you, right?

1234
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,651
You like being with me.

1235
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,861
You like the sex and all that?

1236
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:59,033
You smell good.

1237
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,536
And you're funny,

1238
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:04,664
and I like the closeness.

1239
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:07,583
Great.

1240
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,002
So...

1241
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,590
how different is your personality
gonna be when you use my cells?

1242
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,593
Well, with your impulsiveness
and some other personality stuff,

1243
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,220
about half of you.

1244
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,681
Keep my memories, that's nice.

1245
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:25,435
When you realize that you're
madly in love with me.

1246
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,186
That's the only way
this goes down?

1247
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,605
To live forever, yes.

1248
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,108
What about not forever?

1249
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:36,028
Evan, I really think you're great,
but I'm not giving up eternity

1250
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,613
- for a guy I just met a week ago.
- I know.

1251
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:41,951
I don't mean to sound like a selfish
dick, but is there a way?

1252
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,288
My adult stem cells, but they're weak
and they would give me one life.

1253
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:48,875
So you'd be choosing death?

1254
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,627
I don't choose.

1255
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:54,630
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

1256
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:58,426
Seven days from getting pregnant,
my body metabolizes the cells

1257
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,887
and that's in about a day.

1258
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,102
So spend it with me
on a road trip.

1259
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,562
No.

1260
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,524
The transformations are getting
way worse and I can't control them.

1261
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:17,570
Come on, 24-hour road trip,
or until you love me.

1262
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:19,822
Evan, maybe we should just
rip the Band-Aid off

1263
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:24,410
before a fucking scaly appendage
rips off your... head.

1264
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,496
You know,
you get until Earth dies,

1265
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,998
- I get one more day with you.
- ( car door slams )

1266
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,209
- Shit.
- What?

1267
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,976
Immigration.
They came to the farm today.

1268
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,421
- Fuck, we should get out of here.
- Why?

1269
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,965
- Um, Italian jail.
- What?

1270
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,133
Yes, they throw in illegal
immigrants all the time.

1271
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,969
Dude, they're gonna rape you.

1272
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:49,227
Evan:
Anybody ever driven off the cliff?

1273
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,395
Uh, I did once.

1274
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,273
Years ago.

1275
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,609
( scoffs )
You're not driving.

1276
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,861
( clears throat )

1277
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:06,327
All right,
where's our first hideout?

1278
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,912
Naples!

1279
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,956
- What's in Naples?
- ( laughs )

1280
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:14,335
Good restaurants and stores
for you to buy some clothes.

1281
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,213
You never told me
you had a car.

1282
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:20,007
It never came up.

1283
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,843
Pull over.

1284
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,386
What else do you have?

1285
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,847
You've seen my boat.

1286
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,434
Come on, in 2,000 years
you must've invested in something.

1287
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,813
Okay, I have
an apartment in Rome.

1288
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,190
In Paris.

1289
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,276
In Bali.

1290
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,653
So you're slummin' it
with me right now?

1291
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,989
It actually is
a fucking nightmare.

1292
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,200
I have to constantly come up
with new federal ID numbers,

1293
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:50,288
will stuff to myself...
it's a nightmare.

1294
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,874
- Right.
- Right.

1295
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,209
What's your original name?

1296
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:59,130
Uh, uh, I don't remember.

1297
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:01,007
Really?

1298
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,926
Well, do you remember the address
of your childhood home?

1299
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,345
- Yes, I do.
- ( sirens wailing )

1300
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,180
Fuck!
Oh, fuck! Evan!

1301
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:09,724
The olive farmer police!

1302
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,309
Just get down,
they won't see you.

1303
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:12,836
- ( laughing ) No!
- Just get down.

1304
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,770
Hold on. Hold on.

1305
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,483
- ( car departing )
- Louise: Are they gone?

1306
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:22,820
- Yeah. That was very European.
- ( Louise laughing )

1307
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,334
This is some hipster shit.

1308
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,464
We should get back on the road.

1309
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,717
What do you like more,
pool or the ocean?

1310
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:47,553
Um, ocean.

1311
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,722
No sharks in pools,
that's nice,

1312
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:53,225
but the ocean goes on
and on and on.

1313
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:54,852
It's mysterious.

1314
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,562
Put your feet
in the ocean, then.

1315
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,565
No, no, this pool
has enough mystery.

1316
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:03,194
I mean, it doesn't make any sense,
but it's nice.

1317
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,321
Like you.

1318
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,240
- I don't make any sense?
- No, not really.

1319
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,201
( Evan chuckles )

1320
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:15,206
Why go on the run
with me, then?

1321
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:19,710
First time we sat down
and talked, it was easy.

1322
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,546
And then it stayed easy.

1323
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,423
And that's it?

1324
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:27,551
You had a profound moment
I missed?

1325
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:33,099
First time we had sex.

1326
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,600
Really?

1327
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,853
Yeah.

1328
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,815
No, I mean, really, like,
you knew then

1329
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,943
you wanted graves
next to each other?

1330
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,947
No, I mean I... there wasn't
a moment when I knew.

1331
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,325
But I do know.

1332
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,456
I'm just saying if I felt we should
share all of our time together...

1333
01:28:57,624 --> 01:29:00,084
And I'm not saying I do...

1334
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:04,463
It's not because of something
that could be expressed.

1335
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:08,300
And also, like, you saw me
all fucked up and you're still here.

1336
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:12,513
Oh.

1337
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:15,224
I guess...

1338
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:19,729
your place is clean.
I like that.

1339
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,982
And your voice,
your voice keeps me around.

1340
01:29:25,152 --> 01:29:27,653
( Louise speaking French )

1341
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,243
Evan:
What?

1342
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:38,539
Louise:
Welcome to Naples!

1343
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,959
- Benvenuto!
- Are we looking for crack?

1344
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:45,254
We're on the run.
No police ever come here.

1345
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,339
You're trying to get me killed.

1346
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,175
- Hashish?
- How much?

1347
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,135
- No, grazie, grazie. Grazie.
- 20?

1348
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:53,512
- Can you change 50?
- Don't even make eye contact.

1349
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,348
Are you kidding me?

1350
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,517
Do you have a lighter?

1351
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,688
- ( Louise laughing )
- Evan: That's terrible.

1352
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:05,191
We should buy you
some clothes now.

1353
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:08,194
- Why do you hate my shirt?
- You don't listen.

1354
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,488
- Oh, I listen.
- No, you still don't.

1355
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,198
( laughing )
Oh, I listen.

1356
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,783
Uh, let's see,
I got you pregnant.

1357
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,410
You can use those embryo cells
to heal fast and live forever.

1358
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,098
When you do that,
you physically become

1359
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,789
half the man
who got you pregnant.

1360
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,556
Um, when you are pregnant, you turn
into a cross between creatures

1361
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,293
from our evolutionary past
and a corpse.

1362
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:26,212
You could choose
to use your adult cells,

1363
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:27,838
but then you'd die
someday, so...

1364
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:29,715
( stammering )
You know, honey,

1365
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:33,094
just because you listen to a few
things doesn't make you Oprah.

1366
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,012
- It does.
- ( laughs ) No, it doesn't.

1367
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,766
I find it amazing that I even
understood half of what you said.

1368
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,562
I've actually never been
in a church.

1369
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,898
Well, let's go in that one.

1370
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,775
- You wouldn't be bored?
- No, no.

1371
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,861
I haven't been to that one
since the grand opening.

1372
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,660
So do you know anything
about all this?

1373
01:30:57,828 --> 01:31:00,412
I've always been
a student of science,

1374
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,457
but it's pretty
and I like the rituals.

1375
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,836
No, I mean do you know
anything about, like...?

1376
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:11,090
No. The gods change so much,
I can't keep up.

1377
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:13,551
Hmm.

1378
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:17,221
All this time and all the things
you haven't been able to explain.

1379
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:20,891
Just seems like you'd know
more or something.

1380
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:24,395
Just because I can't explain
something about myself right now

1381
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,814
doesn't mean it's metaphysical.

1382
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,774
It means science
can't explain it yet.

1383
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,860
Hmm.

1384
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,737
You looked like a ghost
in that picture at the restaurant.

1385
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,489
You just saw me
look like stuff

1386
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,325
from stories you've read
or saw, that's it.

1387
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:43,956
Guess giant squid were myths
until one washed up on a beach.

1388
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:46,417
People used to think
people with rabies

1389
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:48,544
and porphyria were vampires,

1390
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,088
but that doesn't mean
vampires are real.

1391
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:53,966
It means science hadn't
caught up with the myth.

1392
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,636
And even if I knew I'm supernatural,
it doesn't prove anything about...

1393
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:04,435
Fear of the unknown makes a lot
of really pretty stuff, though.

1394
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,610
Um, Louise, did you
bring your shots?

1395
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,278
Yeah, there's one
in my purse.

1396
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:17,448
- You should use it.
- Why, do you see something?

1397
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,617
Yeah, a little something.

1398
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,118
Just do it here.

1399
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,954
- Don't get up.
- Okay.

1400
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:28,250
So, this time in Prussia,
1760-something,

1401
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,085
so I'm walking through
the cemetery

1402
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,754
and they're digging
up corpses,

1403
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:35,132
and the corpses would move
from escaping gases and whatnot.

1404
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,500
- And so they're, like, staking...
- Hey, hey, hey, shh.

1405
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,637
...dead people,
calling them vampires.

1406
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,972
Nerve-wracking.
So I left there.

1407
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,643
I'm in the New World and women
were hung for being witches

1408
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,811
for, like,
a lot less than my quirks.

1409
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,439
One colonial guy said
I was aging well.

1410
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:53,234
No joke, I was on the first ship
back to England.

1411
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,529
So, then I'm in France and they
were, like, burning women

1412
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,198
at the stake for having
a moody day.

1413
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:02,368
So I catch a train to Germany
in the 1930s, and, I mean, we all know

1414
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,620
- what happened there, right?
- Hey, Louise?

1415
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,665
Do you want to show me...
What's your favorite museum here?

1416
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,000
- We should go check it out.
- Oh, okay.

1417
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:13,504
- Can we get some pizza first?
- Of course, yeah.

1418
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,214
( speaking Italian )

1419
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:23,639
Evan: Really pouring on
the melodrama in this one.

1420
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:26,600
You look so different.

1421
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:31,855
Oh, yeah, my boyfriend before
was a very unattractive Ottoman.

1422
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,441
How many men
are you a mix of?

1423
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:35,859
You don't want to know.

1424
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,320
I don't?

1425
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:40,364
Are you jealous, Evan?

1426
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:41,699
No, but if every...

1427
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,367
You're 2,000 years old...
If every 20 years...

1428
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:47,204
Do you have a problem with how
many men I slept with and my age?

1429
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:51,041
Okay, just in the fresco
in the book I gave you.

1430
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,877
None. I'm actually 22 years old
in that painting.

1431
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,879
You're a virgin in that painting?

1432
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,216
Yes. Does that
make you happy?

1433
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,016
So you really hated
being martyred, huh?

1434
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,852
I was just a peasant
posing for the scene.

1435
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,021
After the Black Plague,
I think I was just happy

1436
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,731
I wasn't scrubbing
bodily fluids.

1437
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,733
I have just one question.

1438
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,529
Who the fuck is this guy?

1439
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,906
Where do you think I got
these fingers from?

1440
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,993
You're still really pretty
as an Ottoman peasant.

1441
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:29,496
Look at... look at this guy.
He's like... ( growling )

1442
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,750
Evan:
"Stop! Stop hitting me!"

1443
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,297
I wanted to show you something
even older than me.

1444
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,191
Evan: I saw this on
The Learning Channel.

1445
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:45,346
It was a bomb shelter
during World War II.

1446
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,308
Yeah, mention World War II and every
American becomes a historian.

1447
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:52,686
Oh, do they?
Well, we watch movies.

1448
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,022
Lots of them.

1449
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:02,613
So, um, what happens when...
When this goes down?

1450
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:05,449
This body dies

1451
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:07,618
and the cells recreate
a new one.

1452
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,330
And what if you use
your adult cells?

1453
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:13,791
Then...

1454
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,628
Then I'd look exactly the same,
just pregnant,

1455
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:20,089
and that would be horrifying.

1456
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,965
How much time
do you have left?

1457
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:25,969
Until the equinox.
Sunrise, probably.

1458
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,347
Your body knows
when winter ends?

1459
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,435
When I was little,
time was measured differently,

1460
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,727
so all that bullshit with sun gods
and whatever, it never...

1461
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,940
Cool, well,
if you stay with me...

1462
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:42,486
I'll give something up, too.

1463
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,530
Smoking.

1464
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:49,410
We'll both end up
like these guys.

1465
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:53,288
Yeah, in, like, 50 years!
Come on!

1466
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:57,000
So you would be giving up life
to become a father?

1467
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:00,379
I'm an illegal immigrant olive farmer.
New frontiers.

1468
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:03,173
So you want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

1469
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,969
Yeah.

1470
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:10,347
I think you're rushing dating

1471
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,766
and death and fatherhood.

1472
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,354
Well, how do you choose
to use your adult cells?

1473
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,357
- Or your embryonic...
- Oh, wow, look at this guy!

1474
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,943
Whoo!

1475
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,112
How do you choose?

1476
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,867
I don't.

1477
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,744
My... my body chooses.

1478
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,621
Well, how does
your body choose?

1479
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,418
Oxytocin.

1480
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:41,837
I'm totally lost again.

1481
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:48,635
It's the hormone that makes women
fall in love and get maternal.

1482
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:51,096
And if it were high enough,

1483
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:54,558
survival reaction blocks
the embryonic cells

1484
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:57,060
and defaults
into my adult stem cells.

1485
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:00,564
You know that?

1486
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:03,233
I mean I don't,
but I'm not sure.

1487
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:06,737
But I can show you
the origin of the theory.

1488
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,742
You're still
not in love with me?

1489
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,171
( snarls )

1490
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:27,257
( panting )

1491
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,267
Last syringe.

1492
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,102
You still want this?

1493
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:50,489
Okay.

1494
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:54,493
I... I want to show you
where I grew up.

1495
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,510
So if you love me,

1496
01:38:11,678 --> 01:38:15,305
then there's this hormone
and you'll stay the same?

1497
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,474
In theory, yeah.

1498
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:21,687
But neither of us
has much control over it

1499
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:25,440
and how would I even know?

1500
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:31,113
I know I'm in love with you.

1501
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:33,115
You know that?

1502
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:35,659
Yes.

1503
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:40,330
So it seems like you should
know if you love me or not.

1504
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:45,669
So you never lusted for someone
before and then it passed?

1505
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,713
( Evan sighs )

1506
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:02,019
So you've never
been in love before?

1507
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,980
I guess not.

1508
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:07,691
- Not in thousands of years?
- I am not a sociopath, okay?

1509
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:10,360
I just have really bad luck.

1510
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:17,701
- Bad luck.
- I got it.

1511
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:19,786
( Louise laughs )
Okay.

1512
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,207
( insects chirping )

1513
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,376
Louise: You probably
know the entire city

1514
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,212
was buried by the volcano
you see there in the distance.

1515
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,007
Buried in ash and pumice
perfectly preserved

1516
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:34,801
and was rediscovered
and dug up centuries later.

1517
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,969
And if you look to your left,
you'll see an example

1518
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:38,773
of one of the earliest
"Beware of Dog" signs.

1519
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,849
Are you sure there's
no security here?

1520
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:43,810
No, but, Evan, I feel like you
don't want to see my home town.

1521
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:47,773
- What the fuck?
- Yup.

1522
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,734
When excavators came across
chambers shaped like human...

1523
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,819
Ev... Evan, no!
( laughing )

1524
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,072
- No, come back.
- Was that a real dog?

1525
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,074
What are you doing?

1526
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,869
They injected plaster into them
and that's what you get.

1527
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:04,539
And here we have the whorehouse.
I've never been there.

1528
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:06,792
But I've been to the bakery
you see to your right

1529
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:09,586
and to the bar here
on the corner.

1530
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,588
And...

1531
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,340
Evan:
What?

1532
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:18,261
I want to show you
my family now.

1533
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:22,307
Okay, that's weird.

1534
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:25,560
I didn't know
their tombs were here, but...

1535
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,939
So this is my father,

1536
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:32,109
my mother,
and my little brother.

1537
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,655
How did you
get away in time?

1538
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:39,783
- I didn't.
- Then how did you get out?

1539
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:42,953
You really want to know?

1540
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,375
It's 2,000 years ago,
so I'm doing fine.

1541
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:51,503
My pain threshold is still
built for birthing,

1542
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:53,797
so lava is fine.

1543
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:58,343
My oxytocin case study?

1544
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,721
I got it from her.

1545
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,141
It's hereditary.

1546
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,269
She gave it all up
for me and my father.

1547
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,316
I don't want to die and I don't
want to watch anyone die.

1548
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:19,781
Well, at least you got the same
backstory as Harry Potter.

1549
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:22,159
- That's pretty cool.
- ( laughs )

1550
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:25,328
Can I say something
in absolute sincerity?

1551
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:29,750
I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

1552
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,502
Like, it's gonna
fucking hurt, bad.

1553
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:39,259
Your perfect male fantasy
just shattered.

1554
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,678
A younger wife
and a sugar mama.

1555
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:45,348
( laughs )

1556
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,852
Yeah, you forgot the incest part.
I mean, I'm an open-minded guy,

1557
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,730
but I probably wouldn't want that.

1558
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:54,274
That's the Temple
of Apollo sundial.

1559
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:56,193
- This?
- No, no, no.

1560
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,694
Mm-mm.

1561
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:59,905
After we borrowed him
from the ancient Greeks,

1562
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:01,823
he was replaced by Jesus,

1563
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:04,367
and now we don't know
who the old clock belongs to.

1564
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,915
Um, one last thing
you should know.

1565
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:17,339
Right before I transform,
if I transform...

1566
01:42:17,507 --> 01:42:19,716
that monster

1567
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:23,053
is gonna be the biggest
and sharpest.

1568
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,849
How big?

1569
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,976
Just run.

1570
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,062
Really fast.

1571
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,568
( sighs )
We never got my clothes.

1572
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:44,574
No. One of us says something
about journey and destination.

1573
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:49,913
Destinations are underrated?

1574
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:53,041
You ever wonder
what life is like in the finite?

1575
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:56,002
Terrifying all the time,
I'm sure.

1576
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,338
( laughs )
I don't think so.

1577
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:04,219
Even at my lowest, I'm still excited
to use the time the best I can.

1578
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,721
There's motivation to make
every second count.

1579
01:43:10,643 --> 01:43:12,185
You never got lonely?

1580
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:17,023
Not since I met you.

1581
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,818
Doesn't it scare you losing that?

1582
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:22,404
( flesh bubbling )

1583
01:43:32,999 --> 01:43:35,000
What are you doing?

1584
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,752
Begging.

1585
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,213
Go on, it's time.

1586
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:52,642
Tell me more
about the finite.

1587
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:01,026
Um...

1588
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:03,069
let's see, uh...

1589
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:07,574
When you're sick,
it makes you feel lucky

1590
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,784
for all the times
when you were healthy.

1591
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,206
Uh, sunrises and sunsets...

1592
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,961
some things
are just beautiful no matter what

1593
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:22,631
and a constant reminder
that you only get so many.

1594
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:27,677
So you better fucking enjoy 'em.

1595
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,559
Some pizza and a bottle of wine
with the right person

1596
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:37,854
that can make
the shittiest day better.

1597
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,690
- ( crackling )
- Coffee dates take up a pretty good

1598
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,860
chunk of your time,
but... but they're worth it.

1599
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:50,200
I don't know, you can choose
to work yourself to death,

1600
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:54,496
but you could also
throw all that work away

1601
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:57,207
without regrets
for the right person.

1602
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:02,420
Maybe that's chemical,
but it's also magic.

1603
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:09,928
Uh, love comes around
a couple times, if you're lucky.

1604
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:12,472
( crackling continues )

1605
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,475
Life probably seems short
no matter what, but...

1606
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:29,489
( exhales )

1607
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:45,422
( music playing )
