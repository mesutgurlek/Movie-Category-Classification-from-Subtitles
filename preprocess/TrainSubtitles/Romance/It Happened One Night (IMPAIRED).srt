At the rate he's going, he's probably

I didn't give him anything.
You were the bighearted gal.

taking me for a piggyback ride.

- Yes.

Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

WOMAN: They made me get
'em a rope and a blanket.

01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:39,549
On a night like this!
What do you reckon that's for?

1519
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:43,057
- Blamed if I know. I brung 'em a trumpet.
- A trumpet?

1520
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:45,847
One of them toy things.
They sent me to the store.

1521
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:48,499
What in the world do
they want a trumpet for?

1522
01:44:48,599 --> 01:44:50,393
Don't know.
