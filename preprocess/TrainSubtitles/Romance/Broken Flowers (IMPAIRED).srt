Dress conservative, a little classy.

And always, always bring flowers.
Pink flowers.

328
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,158
And look for clues about your son-
photographs, anything.

00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:34,933
Or hints, like pink stationery
and red ink.

Handwriting, if possible.
And find that typewriter.

Bring me that typewriter,

332

match the type...

00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:10,146
I'm a professional
closet organizer.

478
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:13,547
Come on.
No, I organize people's closets.

479
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,846
I even do their drawers.

480
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:21,255
I label everything.
I get them all organized.

481
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:23,623
I even color coordinate them.

482
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:27,186
Yeah.
And they pay her for that.
It's amazing.

00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:30,132

That's enough of that.

What?

490
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:59,059
So, Donny, I heard you made it big
in business a few years ago?

491
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:02,223
What are you into?

492
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,064
It was computers.
Oh, high-tech stuff.

493
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,238
More high tech
than pencils, I guess.

Yeah, my pants are fancy.
So what?

497
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:23,845
So I see you're having
a yard sale?

498
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:27,254
Uh, you got me.
It's something we do
on Saturdays.

499
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:30,488
Yeah, Larry had all this crap
in the garage, and-

500
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:33,962
And then I got this neighbor
to paint a sign for us.

501
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:35,965
It's fun.
[Giggles]

502
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:39,525
Are you gonna be selling
any old, uh, typewriters?

503
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:41,868
No.

504
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:44,430
Wh-
That's so 20th century.

505
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,476
Did you come all the way down here
to get a typewriter, Don?

506
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,079
What do you want a typewriter for?

507
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:58,478
An old friend asked me
if I would look around
for a typewriter.

508
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:02,219
So... I just remembered it.

Well-

510

I forgot to make dessert.

511
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:16,062

What are you doing here?

514
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:00,950
I was just looking
for a typewriter.

00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,333
I brought these flowers.

what brings you out here?

Well, I was kind of in the area,
so I thought I'd drop in.

I see.

How- How did you
track me down, exactly?

Uh, on the computer.

They can do anything.

Nice place you've got here.

Oh, thank you.
It's a nice example.

My husband and I
are in real estate.

No.

has been very good to us.

At first I had the idea
of going into bottled water.

587
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:56,852
I think in the near future,
water will be worth more
than oil or gold.

Yeah. You're dying of thirst,
you can't take a swig of oil.

Boy, you are certainly
right about that.

But for right now,

593
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:16,864
we decided that real estate
and quality prefab homes...

594

was the right way to go.

595

And it has been
quite lucrative.

And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

701
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:20,888
When we were together,
you were so passionate
about becoming a lawyer.

702
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,955
I mean, you were...

703
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,368
very passionate.

01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:30,202
Yeah, well,

I have a doctorate
in animal behavior.

But that was
sort of after the fact.

Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

710
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:53,361
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

711
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:56,125
except for my dog,
Winston.

Yes.

But then he died...

715
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,133
suddenly.

It was years ago.

01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:17,950
But my new ability was this gift.

719
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:21,480
This gift from Winston.

01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:42,104
All right,

Anyway,

722
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:52,352
after Winston died
I got this gift.

723
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,856
To-

724
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:57,222

No. I told you-

725

- No.
- I'm a communicator.

726
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:05,565
You see,
soon after Winston died...

727
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:10,398
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

728
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:15,035
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

729
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:17,272
And I don't
read animals' minds.

730
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:20,077
But when they want
to communicate,

731
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,743
I can hear them.

You know,
like you and I are talking.

733

But we don't
read each other's minds.

01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:35,763
Is he saying something?

735
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,831
He says
you have a hidden agenda.

736
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:51,506
He- He said that?

737
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,117
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

738
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,628
Animals can tell us
what they want,

739
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,689
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

01:35:26,134 --> 01:35:28,125
Yeah. Why?

964
01:35:33,908 --> 01:35:35,899
What happened to your eye?

965
01:35:37,712 --> 01:35:39,703
I, uh-

966
01:35:41,482 --> 01:35:43,916
I ran into somebody.

967
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:46,510
Somebody's fist.

968
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:51,258
You a gangster?

969
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:53,259
No. I wish.

970
01:35:53,327 --> 01:35:56,990
No, I was, uh-
I was in computers.

971
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:00,624
Computers and girls.

972
01:36:02,703 --> 01:36:04,637
What about you, chief?

973
01:36:04,705 --> 01:36:07,765
I'm interested
in, uh, philosophy.

974
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:12,002
Philosophy and girls.

975
01:36:16,084 --> 01:36:18,075
Sounds pretty good.

976
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:21,778
Think so?

977
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:30,420
So, uh,

978
01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:36,059
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

979
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:43,267
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

980
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:48,140
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

981
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,710
You asking me?

982
01:36:53,254 --> 01:36:55,245
Yeah.

983
01:36:56,324 --> 01:36:58,315
Well-

984
01:37:01,796 --> 01:37:04,560
The past is gone.

985
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,623
I know that.

986
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:10,665
The future...

987
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:12,831
isn't here yet,

988
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:14,898
whatever it's going to be.

989
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,344
So,

990
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:22,508
all there is is-
is this.

991
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:25,842
The present.

992
01:37:31,826 --> 01:37:33,817
That's it.

993
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:38,155
Are you a Buddhist?

994
01:37:40,201 --> 01:37:42,192
No. Are you?

995
01:37:43,704 --> 01:37:45,695
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

996
01:37:47,108 --> 01:37:51,545
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

997
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:53,603
No, I appreciate it.

998
01:37:54,749 --> 01:37:57,217
I like what you said.

999
01:37:58,419 --> 01:38:01,911
It's better than some, like,

1000
01:38:01,989 --> 01:38:04,150
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

1001
01:38:07,495 --> 01:38:09,429
Is that...

1002
01:38:09,497 --> 01:38:11,658
what your father's like?

1003
01:38:18,372 --> 01:38:21,808
Ah, that's not a good subject.

1004
01:38:21,876 --> 01:38:24,811
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

1005
01:38:24,879 --> 01:38:27,473
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

1006
01:38:27,548 --> 01:38:29,573
Hold on a second.
Wait.

1007
01:38:31,986 --> 01:38:35,615
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

1008
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:41,161
What?
Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

1009
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:43,527
Man, you're fucked up.

1010
01:38:43,598 --> 01:38:46,260
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!
