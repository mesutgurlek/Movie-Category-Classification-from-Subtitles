160

He can just lay low for a few
hours, and then keep moving.

That's true enough.

162
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,086
It's still not acceptable to place you
and your family here in jeopardy.

163

If someone were to come by, it would
need to look like I kidnapped you.

That's why I'm going
to have to tie you up.

165

- Only you.

Well, there's another aspect that your

they forget to mention

How did you escape?

197
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,047
I told the guard at the hospital if he
left, I was going to jump out the window.

198

He heard that and
went to have a smoke.

(STAMMERS) No. My mom tried, but...

I've got a stepbrother
and a half-sister.

203

My dad takes me out to
dinner with them on Sundays.

How does a fellow let a woman

We won't be needing
that any longer.

But if the day comes and you have to
say I tied you up, you won't be lying.

Barely tight enough to hold.

That's not like her.

Has she been following
the news, do you know?

Did she leave you here by yourself?

can't come to the door.

when all you've got to do is get
dirt underneath your fingernails.

318

All right. Put it in there.

That's it.

Now, don't over-handle.

You want it right on the verge
of crumbling at any moment.

There you go.

People buy all these fancy gadgets,

326
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,330
but sometimes the best tool is
attached right there to your own body.

327
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,566
Okay.

328
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,919
Scatter a little tapioca,
like salt over an icy road.

Make a little mountain out of it.

332
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,325
Perfect.

333
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,483
Okay, moment of truth.

334
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,490
Can't go too fast.

335

They won't come back
for a few hours.

had a little more time.

stop looking, Adele.

HENRY: They have dogs that
can smell your blood.

You should probably let
your stitches heal.

You don't want to wait

01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,559
<i>ADULT HENRY:
The next day, when I suggested</i>

1109
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,239
<i>I move back in with my mother
for the rest of senior year,</i>

1110
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,090
<i>he didn't argue.</i>

1111
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:58,279
<i>And it was there in my mom's
kitchen, my final summer at home,</i>

1112
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,165
<i>that I first tried
my hand at baking.</i>

1113
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,891
FRANK: Dear Henry.

1114
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,679
<i>I hope you will remember me.</i>

1115
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,479
<i>We once spent Labor
Day weekend together.</i>

1116
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,251
<i>Five of the best days of my life.</i>

1117
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,879
<i>I had always wondered who you would
become and what you would look like.</i>

1118
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,608
<i>And then one day, I came
across a familiar-looking pie.</i>

1119
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,568
<i>And there you were.</i>

1120
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,245
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

1121
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,079
<i>I will understand if you choose
not to respond to this letter.</i>

1122
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:42,409
<i>However, I am due to
be released shortly.</i>

1123
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:48,047
<i>I am no longer young, but I have
plenty of good health remaining.</i>

1124
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,319
<i>And I'd like to live much
the same way we discussed</i>

1125
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,649
<i>that weekend back when we
thought we'd be a family.</i>

1126
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,599
<i>Most likely, your mother
has remarried by now.</i>

1127
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,963
<i>But on the off chance
that she might be alone,</i>

1128
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,599
<i>I wanted to ask you whether
I might write her a letter.</i>

1129
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,959
<i>I promise you,</i>

1130
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:12,245
<i>I would sooner cut off my own hand
than bring any more grief to Adele.</i>

1131
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,359
<i>ADULT HENRY:
I wrote him back that day</i>

1132
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,769
<i>to say that it wouldn't be
difficult to locate my mother.</i>

1133
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,486
<i>She lived at the same address.</i>

1134
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,323
(SOBBING)

1135
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,639
<i>ADULT HENRY: I spent half of
my life worrying my mother</i>

1136
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,003
<i>wouldn't be able to go out
into the world on her own.</i>

1137
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,441
<i>But as it turned out,
she wouldn't have to.</i>
