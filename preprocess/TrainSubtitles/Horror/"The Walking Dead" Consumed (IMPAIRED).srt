<i>You okay?</i>

327
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:54,430
You okay?

328
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:56,766
I'm still here.

329
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:59,133
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

330
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,267
They're gonna come.
They probably heard the shot.

331
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:03,435
If they find me...

332
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:06,004
- Who?
- Them, people at the hospital.

333
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:08,508
Wait, wait, wait, just tell us--
is there a blonde girl there?

334
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,243
- You see a blonde girl?
- Beth?

335
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,811
<i>You know her?</i>

336
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,750
She helped me get out,
but she's still there.

337
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,186
They're coming.

338
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,456
We gotta go now. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

339
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:29,858
The building next door
has a basement.

340
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,363
It's clear.
We'll be safe.

341
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:34,131
Ah! Ah!

342
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,767
Daryl:
Go, I got him.

343
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,271
Come on, get up.

344
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:39,976
- <i> Get up.</i>
- <i> (groans) Okay.</i>

345
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:43,511
(tires screech)

346
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,450
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

347
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:49,252
- Let go of me!
- Wait! They can help her.

348
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,653
<i>They're the only ones who can.</i>

349
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:54,023
<i>They have medicine,</i>
<i>machines, a doctor.</i>

350
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:57,361
<i>You go out there,</i>
<i>you'll have to kill them, okay?</i>

351
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,997
<i>And then she can't get their help.
Is that what you want?</i>

352
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,669
(panting)

353
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,968
We can get her back.
We can get Beth back.

354
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,278
What's it gonna take?

355
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,145
A lot.

356
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:17,249
They got guns, people.

357
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,020
So do we.

358
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:25,895
(snarling)

359
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:42,024
