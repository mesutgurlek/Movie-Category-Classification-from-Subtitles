1
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,866
You OK, Tina?

2
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:36,902
Just a dream, Ma.

3
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,277
Some dream, judging from that.

4
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,365
You coming back
to the sack or what?

5
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,034
Hold your horses.

6
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,536
Tina, honey, you got
to cut your fingernails...

7
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,879
or you got to stop
that kind of dreaming.

8
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,927
One or the other.

9
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,324
One...two...

10
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,429
Freddy's coming for you.

11
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,507
Three...four...

12
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:17,450
Better lock your door.

13
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,379
Five...six...

14
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,162
Grab your crucifix.

15
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,887
Seven...eight...

16
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,740
Gonne stay up late.

17
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,661
Nine...ten...

18
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,287
Never sleep again...

19
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,405
It was so scary.

20
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,202
When I woke up...

21
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,027
it seemed like he was still
in the room with me.

22
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:36,208
Sounds like a real bogeyman.

23
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,581
"One...two...
Freddy's coming for you."

24
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:41,582
That's what it reminded me of--
that old jump rope song.

25
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,030
It was
the worst nightmare I ever had.

26
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,405
You wouldn't believe it.

27
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,895
As a matter of fact, I had
a bad dream last night myself.

28
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:49,587
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

29
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,184
Had your name
written all over it.

30
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,981
There's four letters
in my name, Rod.

31
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,366
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

32
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,028
Hey! Up yours
with a twirling lawnmower.

33
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,954
Rod says the sweetest things.

34
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,230
He's nuts about you.

35
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,121
Yeah, nuts. Anyway...

36
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,610
I couldn't go back
to sleep last night.

37
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,505
So, what did you dream?

38
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,946
Forget it, Tina.

39
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,020
The point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while.

40
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,237
It's no biggie.

41
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,933
Next time you're having one,
just tell yourself...

42
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,663
that's all it is
right while you're having it.

43
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,261
Once you do that,
you wake right up.

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,537
At least, it works for me.

45
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,235
Did you have a nightmare, too?

46
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:31,956
Maybe we're going
to have a big earthquake.

47
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,268
They say things get
really weird just before.

48
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,454
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

49
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,040
When my mom said she was taking
off for two days, I almost died.

50
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,179
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

51
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,533
I can't believe his mother's
letting him spend the night.

52
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:55,807
Right, well...she's not exactly.

53
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,545
See, I got this cousin
who lives near the airport.

54
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,863
It's OK for me
to stay with him.

55
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:03,200
And I got this
sound effects tape from Rod--

56
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,104
Hello, Mom?

57
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:08,002
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

58
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,024
Yeah, noisy as usual.

59
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,848
Glad we don't live here, huh?

60
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:16,794
Aunt Eunice says hello.

61
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:20,708
I'll call you in the morning.

62
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,235
Yeah, sure--

63
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,093
Just some kids drag racing
outside, I think, Mom.

64
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,760
Listen, Mom. I got to go.

65
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,620
I think there's been
an accident out front.

66
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,174
All right, I'll call the police.

67
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,656
I'll call the police!

68
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:45,063
Just some neighbours having
a fight, I guess.

69
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,176
I'm fine.

70
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:47,591
I'll call you in the morning.

71
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,547
It worked like a charm.

72
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,895
Smooth.

73
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,042
Jesus.

74
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,401
See? I told you
you'd be feeling better.

75
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,096
All day long I've been seeing
that guy's weird face...

76
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,343
and hearing those fingernails.

77
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,063
Fingernails?

78
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,824
That's amazing you saying that.

79
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,894
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

80
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,428
What did you dream?

81
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:23,266
I dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater.

82
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,300
What about the fingernails?

83
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,717
He scraped his fingernails
along things.

84
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,061
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives...

85
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,332
something he made himself.

86
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,735
But they made a horrible sound.

87
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,077
It was like...

88
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,257
You dreamed
about the same creep I did.

89
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,454
That's impossible.

90
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,423
What?

91
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,212
Nothing.

92
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,519
There's something out there,
isn't there?

93
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,147
I didn't hear anything.

94
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,358
I heard something.

95
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,726
I'm going to punch out
your lights, whoever you are.

96
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,710
Kitty, kitty.

97
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,024
Chow, chow, chow?

98
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,805
It's Rod Lane
bringing Lantz down...

99
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,113
just three yards
from the goal line!

100
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,733
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild!

101
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,048
What the hell
are you doing here?

102
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,986
Came to make up. No big deal.

103
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:08,977
Your mom home?

104
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,152
Of course. What's that?

105
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:13,334
Intense, huh?

106
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:19,676
What's going on here,
an orgy or something?

107
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,532
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

108
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,087
It's just
a sleep-over date, Rod.

109
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,996
Tina and me.
Glen was just leaving.

110
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:30,233
Did you see his face?

111
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,062
Your mom isn’t home, is she?

112
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,308
Me and Tina
got stuff to discuss.

113
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,560
We got her mother's bed.

114
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,154
You guys got the rest.

115
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,785
I think we should
get out of here.

116
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:53,469
You guys are going
to hang around, right?

117
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,442
Don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

118
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,588
Please, Nancy?

119
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,852
Glen, not now.

120
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:10,174
We're here for Tina now,
not ourselves.

121
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,095
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare anyway?

122
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:19,134
Because he was scary,
that's why!

123
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,751
Morality sucks.

124
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,573
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

125
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,469
You feel better now?

126
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,542
Jungle man fix Jane.

127
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,457
No more fights?

128
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:23,691
No more fights.

129
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,236
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

130
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,147
When did you have a nightmare?

131
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,295
Guys can have nightmares, too,
you know.

132
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,947
You isn’t got a corner
on the market.

133
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:17,719
Who do you think you are?

134
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,629
Whoever you are.

135
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,410
Somebody there?

136
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,130
Who the hell is that?

137
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:20,681
Shit.

138
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,044
Please, God--

139
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,253
This...

140
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,272
is God.

141
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,160
Watch this.

142
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:11,314
Nancy! Open the door!

143
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,398
Rod, help me!

144
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:32,756
Help me, Rod!

145
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,707
Who did this? I'll kill you!

146
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:24,727
Who did this?

147
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,071
You scared me!

148
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:44,508
What have you got?

149
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,817
Her name was Tina Gray.
It was her home.

150
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,478
Father abandoned, 10 years ago.

151
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,499
Mother's in Vegas
with a boyfriend.

152
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,588
We're trying to reach her now.

153
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,189
What's the coroner got?

154
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,596
Something like a razor
was the weapon...

155
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:56,735
but nothing was found
at the scene.

156
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,011
It looks like
the victim's boyfriend.

157
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,028
Lieutenant, where is she?

158
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,182
I put her in your office.

159
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:02,630
His name's Rod Lane.

160
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:04,124
He's a musician type.

161
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,884
He's been arrested for drugs,
brawling.

162
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,708
Terrific. What the hell was she
doing there?

163
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:09,671
She lived there.

164
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:13,534
I don't mean her.

165
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,681
I mean you.

166
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,917
What was she doing there?

167
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:21,124
Hello to you, too, Donald.

168
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,300
Marge. OK.

169
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,184
How you doing, baby?

170
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:34,147
I'm OK, Dad.

171
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,074
Look, I don't want to get
into this now.

172
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,514
God knows you need time.

173
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:38,955
But I sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing...

174
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:42,817
shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night...

175
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,064
especially a lunatic
delinquent like Lane.

176
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,751
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

177
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,611
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

178
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,316
Apparently,
he was crazy jealous.

179
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,553
Nancy said they'd had a fight.

180
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,281
It wasn't that serious.

181
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:00,904
Maybe you don't think
murder is serious.

182
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,626
How can you say I don't
take her death seriously?

183
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:08,079
Look, all I meant...

184
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,423
was that their fights
weren't that serious.

185
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,641
You know Tina dreamed
this was going to happen.

186
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,088
What?

187
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:29,898
She'd had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her.

188
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:33,801
That's why we were there, Mom.

189
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:35,370
She just didn't want
to sleep alone.

190
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,228
Police say the victim,
15-year-old Christina Gray...

191
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,815
had quarrelled earlier
with her boyfriend Rod Lane.

192
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,439
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

193
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:52,885
The murder weapon...

194
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,122
a straight razor or similar
sharp object, has not yet--

195
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,291
Where do you think you're going?

196
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,756
To school.

197
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,971
Honey, you were tossing and
turning all night last night.

198
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,113
You have no business
going to school today.

199
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:09,810
I've got to go to school,
Mother.

200
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:11,441
Otherwise, I'll sit up there
and go crazy.

201
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,204
Did you sleep?

202
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,267
I'll sleep in study hall.

203
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:20,208
I'd rather keep busy.

204
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:22,104
Right home after?

205
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,047
Right home after.

206
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,451
See you.

207
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,491
I'm not going to hurt you!

208
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:11,130
They're going
to kill me for sure.

209
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,111
Nobody's going to kill you.

210
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,600
Did you do it?

211
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,162
I never touched her.

212
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:21,439
You were screaming like crazy.

213
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:23,297
There was somebody else there.

214
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,600
The door was locked
from your side!

215
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,806
Don't look at me
like I'm some fucking fruitcake!

216
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:29,436
I'm warning you!

217
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:32,541
Just move away from her, son.

218
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:35,580
Real easy, like your ass
depended on it.

219
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,962
Hold it!

220
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,740
Jesus Christ!

221
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:49,280
Hold it right there!

222
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:50,944
Watch it!

223
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:51,910
I'm cool!

224
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:52,870
I got him.

225
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:53,830
On the ground! Now!

226
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:55,204
Come on! Get down!

227
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,963
Lieutenant, look at this!
A switchblade!

228
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,585
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her, Nancy!

229
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:00,998
Daddy?

230
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,974
You used me.

231
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,740
What the hell were you doing...

232
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,238
going to school today for
anyway?

233
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:14,022
Let go of my arm !

234
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,854
What is seen
is not always what is real.

235
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,390
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating...

236
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:27,301
in nature, perhaps inside human
nature itself, that was rotten.

237
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:30,688
"A canker," as he put it.

238
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,187
Of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

239
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:39,394
and to his mother's lies was to
continually probe and dig.

240
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:42,154
Just like the gravediggers...

241
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:45,386
always trying to get
beneath the surface.

242
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:46,829
The same is true
in a different way...

243
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:47,810
in Julius Caesar.

244
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,195
John, will you go ahead, please?

245
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,820
"In the most high
and palm state of Rome...

246
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:03,598
"A little ere
the mightiest Julius fell.

247
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,039
"The grave stood tenantless...

248
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:07,145
"and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber...

249
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,007
"in the Roman streets.

250
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,856
"As stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood...

251
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:14,159
"disaster's in the sun
and the moist air...

252
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,227
"upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands..."

253
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,283
"Oh, God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell...

254
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:36,075
"and count myself
a king of infinite space...

255
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:40,939
"were it not
that I have bad dreams."

256
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,960
Where's your pass?

257
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:29,273
Screw your pass.

258
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:34,517
Hey, Nancy!

259
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,786
No running in the hallway.

260
00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:56,893
Who are you?

261
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:44,359
Gonne get you.

262
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,349
It's only a dream !

263
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:56,872
Come to Freddy.

264
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,473
God damn you!

265
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,997
OK! OK! Thompson!

266
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,751
I'll call your mother.

267
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:14,892
Everything is all right now.

268
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:16,273
Come on. Sit down.

269
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:21,835
I'm OK.

270
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:22,804
I'm fine.

271
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,080
You sure?

272
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:26,964
I'll go straight home.

273
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,720
You'll need a hall pass.

274
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,292
Back to work.

275
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:26,874
And then what happened?

276
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:30,106
I told you.

277
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,793
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

278
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,205
under the covers with her.

279
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:36,824
How could somebody be under
the covers with you guys...

280
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,237
without you knowing about it?

281
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,692
How the fuck do I know?

282
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:43,550
I don't expect you
to believe me anyway.

283
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,742
What did he look like?

284
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:50,432
Did you get a look at him?

285
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,369
Then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

286
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:00,987
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

287
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:03,165
And you didn't get a look
at him?

288
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:06,105
I couldn't even see the fucker.

289
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:08,994
You could just see...

290
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,936
cuts happening...

291
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,092
all at once.

292
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:16,507
What do you mean all at once?

293
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:22,495
It was as if
there were four razors...

294
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:25,566
cutting her at the same time...

295
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:27,198
but invisible ones.

296
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:32,639
You know, I probably
could have saved her...

297
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:34,205
if I'd have moved sooner.

298
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:39,524
But I thought it was
just another nightmare...

299
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,047
Like the one I had
the night before.

300
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,263
There was this guy.

301
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,160
He had knives for fingers.

302
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,582
You think I did it?

303
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,575
One...two...

304
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:28,680
Freddy's coming for you.

305
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,409
Three...four...

306
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:33,927
Better lock your door.

307
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,942
Five...six...

308
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:39,628
Grab your crucifix.

309
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:40,591
Seven...eight...

310
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:46,855
Gonne stay up late.

311
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:48,872
Nine...ten...

312
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,321
Never sleep...again.

313
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:10,344
What, Mother?

314
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:12,395
Don't fall asleep in there.

315
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:13,646
You could drown, you know.

316
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,441
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

317
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:16,851
It happens all the time.

318
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:18,739
I've heated up
some warm milk for you, honey.

319
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,140
Warm milk?

320
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,121
Gross.

321
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,877
Help!

322
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,944
Hold on, baby!

323
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,475
Mom !

324
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:17,373
I'm OK.

325
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:20,275
-You're OK?
-I'm OK.

326
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,838
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

327
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:26,260
I just slipped getting out
of the tub, Mom.

328
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,612
But I told you...

329
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,851
hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

330
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,797
I know, but I'm OK, Mother.

331
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,497
I'm sorry for scaring you.

332
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,927
I'll turn down your bed.

333
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,782
I'll get my pyjamas on.

334
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,288
...the act of
bodily dismemberment.

335
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,871
I'm sorry.
I saw your light was on.

336
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,432
I thought I'd see how you were.

337
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,994
Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street.

338
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:50,244
Will you shut up and let me in?

339
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:52,901
Did you ever stand on a trellis
in your bare feet?

340
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:55,557
Get inside before
somebody sees you.

341
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,002
I hit my head.

342
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,977
Got to be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

343
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:04,640
If you don't mind.

344
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:15,369
So, I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

345
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:17,227
Yeah, I guess I did.

346
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:19,367
You haven't slept yet, have you?

347
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:21,315
Not really.

348
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,246
What did you do to your arm?

349
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,668
I burned it in English class.

350
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:33,412
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

351
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,562
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

352
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,063
Slept like a rock.

353
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,763
Do you believe that people...

354
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,841
can dream about
what's going to happen?

355
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:49,170
No.

356
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:50,763
Do you believe in the bogeyman?

357
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,363
No.

358
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:54,093
Rod killed Tina,
and you know that.

359
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:58,192
I've got a crazy favour
to ask you.

360
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:00,847
It's nothing hard or anything.

361
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:05,838
I'm going to go and look
for somebody...

362
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:10,100
and I want you to stand...
Like a sort of a guard, OK?

363
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,165
Now, you can't mess up.

364
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,693
A lot might depend on this.

365
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,490
I won't screw up.

366
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,152
Turn off the light.

367
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,160
Here's what we're going to do.

368
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,606
It's dark in here.

369
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,161
And it's not
what you're thinking.

370
00:36:24,895 --> 00:36:26,302
Are you still watching?

371
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,229
Yeah. So?

372
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm just checking.

373
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,009
Watch out!

374
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:18,340
Watch out!

375
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,658
Wake up!

376
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,010
Are you there?

377
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,604
I'm here.

378
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:26,512
Nancy, help me, please.

379
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,796
Save me from--

380
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,109
Freddy!

381
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:40,308
This is just a dream.

382
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:41,524
This isn't real.

383
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:42,992
This is just a dream.

384
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:44,758
He isn't real.

385
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:36,512
Glen, you bastard.

386
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:37,921
What did I do?

387
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:40,191
I just
asked you to do one thing...

388
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:42,299
just stay awake and watch me...

389
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,114
just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

390
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:47,457
and what did you do?

391
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:49,248
You shit.

392
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:50,593
You fell asleep.

393
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,017
Oh, shit.

394
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,686
Hurry.

395
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:58,308
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

396
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:04,573
Are you OK?

397
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:07,462
Yeah. It was just
a little dream, that's all.

398
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,699
I'm going right back to sleep.

399
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,840
Call me if you need anything.

400
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,327
You mind telling me
what's going on?

401
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,028
Just come on.

402
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:38,595
Garcia, I've got to see
Rod Lane again.

403
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:40,195
You know,
I took the night shift...

404
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:42,090
so I could get
some peace and quiet.

405
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:43,268
It's urgent!

406
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:01,097
We have reason to believe
that there might be...

407
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:02,857
something very strange
going on here.

408
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,421
Got no argument with that.

409
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:06,121
What are you doing here?

410
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,566
There's an unsolved murder...

411
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,192
and I don't like
unsolved murders...

412
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:11,337
especially ones that
my daughter's mixed up in.

413
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:12,685
What are you doing here?

414
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,378
At this hour,
you should be home in bed.

415
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,041
I just want to see if he's OK.

416
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,087
Nancy, take my word for it.

417
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:19,558
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

418
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:20,779
He's not going anywhere.

419
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,481
Just go down and look at him.

420
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:34,092
Please, Daddy.

421
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,232
All right.

422
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:39,471
Garcia, give me the keys.

423
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:40,937
Right.

424
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:44,273
Where the hell
did I put the keys?

425
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,797
Help! Help!

426
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,030
Jesus!

427
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:22,391
Cut him down.

428
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:25,240
Grab his legs.

429
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:27,030
I got him.

430
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,074
Grab his back, would you?

431
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:35,252
Lower him.

432
00:43:58,622 --> 00:43:59,964
Ashes to ashes...

433
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:01,373
Dust to dust.

434
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,828
May God be
with this young man's soul.

435
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,597
His life and his death...

436
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,706
attest to
the scriptures' warning...

437
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:15,094
that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

438
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:18,432
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

439
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:24,315
that we judge not,
lest we be judged.

440
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:27,169
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

441
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:34,110
Time to go, honey.

442
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:41,850
Hop in.

443
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:46,940
The killer's still loose,
you know?

444
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:50,298
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina?

445
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:51,324
Who?

446
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:54,683
I don't know who he is...

447
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:58,720
but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

448
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:03,232
and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

449
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,981
and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

450
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,804
You better keep her home
for a few days...

451
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,303
until she really gets
over the shock of this.

452
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,752
I've got something better.

453
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:18,152
I'm going to get her some help.

454
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:44,266
I don't see why you couldn't
just give me a pill...

455
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:45,511
to keep me from dreaming.

456
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:47,524
Everyone's got to dream,
young lady.

457
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:51,013
If you don't dream, you go.

458
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,166
All set.

459
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,292
Please, Nancy, trust us.

460
00:45:57,327 --> 00:46:00,360
It's not you I don't trust.
It's just...

461
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:10,918
Let's do it.

462
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:17,224
Thank you, nurse.

463
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,726
How long has this been going on?

464
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:37,969
Since the murders.

465
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,947
She was fine before that.

466
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:42,378
Now she thinks
her dreams are real.

467
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:45,935
There's no sign
of pathology in her EEG.

468
00:46:45,974 --> 00:46:48,527
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

469
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:50,737
who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

470
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,975
She's asleep now.

471
00:47:02,008 --> 00:47:04,015
Thank God.

472
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:09,938
What the hell are dreams anyway?

473
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,123
Mysteries.

474
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,398
Incredible body hocus-pocus.

475
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:16,117
The truth is we still
don't know what they are...

476
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:18,455
or where they come from.

477
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,858
She's going into deep sleep now.

478
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,496
Heart rate is a little high.

479
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:35,474
It's just due to anxiety.

480
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:37,622
Otherwise, she's nicely relaxed.

481
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:39,571
All signs are normal.

482
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,980
She could dream at any time now.

483
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,412
Beta waves are slowing.

484
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,749
She's into REMs now.

485
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,606
She's definitely dreaming now.

486
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,509
It's a good one, too.

487
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:01,495
Typical dream parameter.

488
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:06,555
A nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six.

489
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:09,724
She's about three.

490
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:17,761
Doctor, what's she doing now?

491
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:20,064
Is she asleep or awake?

492
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,466
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

493
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:24,572
What's she doing?

494
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:25,921
I don't know.

495
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:27,265
Is she dreaming?

496
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,469
Nancy, it's Mom !

497
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:42,364
What?

498
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,715
Her hair.

499
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,732
Excuse me.

500
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:45,985
This'll help you sleep.

501
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:50,175
Oh, my God, her arm !

502
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:51,262
Get something.

503
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,212
What happened, baby?

504
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:54,816
What happened?

505
00:48:58,184 --> 00:48:59,645
It's OK.

506
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:05,285
I brought something out
from my dream.

507
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:07,231
Where did you get that?

508
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:11,135
I grabbed it off his head.

509
00:49:24,748 --> 00:49:28,229
She said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream.

510
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:29,763
No, I'm not crazy.

511
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:32,358
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

512
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:34,666
I don't know where
she really found it.

513
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,131
I got to go.

514
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:50,441
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?

515
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:53,578
You know the doctor says
you have to sleep, or--

516
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,655
I'll go even crazier?

517
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:57,322
I don't think you're crazy.

518
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,782
And stop drinking
that damn coffee.

519
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:08,298
So, did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

520
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,851
I threw that filthy thing away.

521
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,320
I don't know
where you really found it...

522
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:14,410
or what you're trying to prove.

523
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,720
What I learned
in the dream clinic...

524
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:19,122
that's what I'm trying
to prove, Mother.

525
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:23,891
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

526
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,608
It's this guy.

527
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:29,580
He's after us in our dreams.

528
00:50:32,981 --> 00:50:35,883
That's just not reality, Nancy.

529
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:37,355
It's real, Mama.

530
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:38,860
Feel it.

531
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,528
Give me that damn thing.

532
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:42,508
It even has his name
written in it.

533
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,591
Fred Krueger, Mom.

534
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:49,552
Do you know who that is, Mother?

535
00:50:49,592 --> 00:50:51,086
Because if you do,
you better tell me...

536
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:52,589
because he's after me now.

537
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:56,145
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

538
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:58,421
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

539
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,115
Feel better?

540
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:02,390
You call this feeling better?

541
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:07,503
Or maybe I should grab that
bottle and veg out with you.

542
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:10,862
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

543
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:21,019
Fred Krueger
can't come after you, Nancy.

544
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:22,099
He's dead.

545
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,734
Believe me.

546
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:24,852
I know.

547
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:28,406
You knew about him
all this time...

548
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:32,242
and you've been acting like
it was something I made up?

549
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,555
Nancy, you're sick.

550
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:35,931
There's something wrong
with you.

551
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:38,421
You're imagining things.

552
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:39,957
You'll feel better
when you sleep.

553
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:42,454
It's just as simple as that.

554
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:43,673
Screw sleep!

555
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,927
It's just a nightmare.

556
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:54,335
That's enough.

557
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,013
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

558
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,898
And if you can't do that,
you sleep.

559
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:10,971
I used to.

560
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,254
Not anymore.

561
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:20,035
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

562
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:26,331
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

563
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:29,918
So if you have a nightmare,
for instance, like falling.

564
00:52:29,957 --> 00:52:31,004
Right.

565
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:35,105
Well, instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

566
00:52:35,142 --> 00:52:39,267
you say, "I'm going
to make up my mind...

567
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:40,830
"that I fall
into a magic world."

568
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:45,312
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

569
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:48,035
They get all their art
and literature from dreams.

570
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:49,054
Just wake up and write it down.

571
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:50,657
Dream skills.

572
00:52:50,696 --> 00:52:54,526
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

573
00:52:54,568 --> 00:52:56,030
They turn their back on it.

574
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,862
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.

575
00:52:57,898 --> 00:53:01,062
But what happens
if they don't do that?

576
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:05,026
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

577
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:06,212
Great.

578
00:53:09,995 --> 00:53:13,061
"Booby Traps & Improvised
Anti-Personnel Devices"?

579
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:16,361
What are you reading that for?

580
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:18,950
I'm into survival.

581
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:22,052
See ya.

582
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:24,362
You're starting to scare me.

583
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,298
Oh, gross.

584
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,443
Mother!

585
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:12,778
What's with the bars?

586
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,692
Security.

587
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:19,276
Security from what?

588
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:21,007
Not from what, from whom.

589
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:26,068
Come down to the cellar with me,
and I'll tell you.

590
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:49,585
You want to know
who Fred Krueger was?

591
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,211
He was
a filthy child murderer...

592
00:54:52,249 --> 00:54:55,217
who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighbourhood.

593
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,664
Kids we all knew.

594
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:00,434
Oh, Mom.

595
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:03,824
It drove us crazy when we
didn't know who it was...

596
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,413
but it was even worse
after they caught him.

597
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:16,730
Did they put him away?

598
00:55:16,765 --> 00:55:19,765
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

599
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:22,009
but somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant...

600
00:55:22,045 --> 00:55:23,093
in the right place...

601
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:24,760
and Krueger was free
just like that.

602
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:27,581
What did you do, Mother?

603
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:31,160
A bunch of us parents
tracked him down...

604
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:33,141
after they let him out.

605
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:35,998
We found him in
an old abandoned boiler room...

606
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,130
where he used to take his kids.

607
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,077
Go on.

608
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,088
We took gasoline...

609
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:48,024
We poured it
all around the place...

610
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:51,360
and made a trail of it
out the door...

611
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:54,361
then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

612
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:04,029
But he can't get you now.

613
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:07,329
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

614
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:12,476
I even took his knives.

615
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,747
So it's OK now.

616
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,416
You can sleep.

617
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:42,403
Oh, hi, how you doing?

618
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,368
Fine.

619
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,059
Stand by your window
so I can see you.

620
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:46,756
You sound a million miles away.

621
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:53,027
That's much better.

622
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:56,296
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

623
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,370
You look like the Prisoner
of Zenda or something.

624
00:56:58,411 --> 00:56:59,872
How long's it been
since you slept?

625
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:01,824
It's coming up
on the seventh day.

626
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,755
It's OK. I checked Guinness.

627
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:04,933
The record's 11.

628
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:08,550
Listen, Glen, I know who he is.

629
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:09,701
Who?

630
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,668
The killer.

631
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,227
-You do?
-Yes.

632
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:15,531
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

633
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,475
Why would anybody
want to kill me?

634
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,466
Don't ask.

635
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,997
Just give me some help
nailing the guy...

636
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,314
when I bring him out.

637
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,691
Bring him out of what?

638
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:25,253
My dream.

639
00:57:25,294 --> 00:57:27,782
How do you plan to do that?

640
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:29,284
Just like I did the hat.

641
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:31,694
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

642
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:34,029
Wait a minute.

643
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,657
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

644
00:57:35,696 --> 00:57:37,835
If I can't,
then you can all relax...

645
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,945
because it's just a case
of me being nuts.

646
00:57:39,984 --> 00:57:41,839
I can save you the trouble.

647
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:43,498
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

648
00:57:43,537 --> 00:57:44,617
I love you anyway.

649
00:57:44,657 --> 00:57:46,381
Good.

650
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,490
Then you won't mind
cold-cocking this guy...

651
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:49,773
when I bring him out.

652
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,758
What?

653
00:57:50,802 --> 00:57:51,947
You heard me.

654
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:53,579
I grab the guy in my dream.

655
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:55,561
You see me struggling,
so you wake me up.

656
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:58,669
We both come out, you whack
the fucker, and we got him.

657
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:00,398
Are you crazy?
Hit him with what?

658
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:01,646
You're the jock.

659
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:03,691
You have a baseball bat
or something.

660
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:07,758
Just meet me at my porch
at midnight.

661
00:58:07,796 --> 00:58:09,258
Oh, and meanwhile...

662
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,675
Meanwhile?

663
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:15,924
Whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.

664
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:20,910
Midnight?

665
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:31,601
Oh, man.

666
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:33,330
Midnight.

667
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:34,994
Baseball bats and bogeymen.

668
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:37,875
Beautiful.

669
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,260
Honey?

670
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,248
How can you listen
to television...

671
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:22,262
and hear your records
at the same time?

672
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:24,311
Oh, I wasn't listening
to the tube, Ma.

673
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:26,074
Just watching.

674
00:59:26,111 --> 00:59:28,446
Miss Nude America
is going to be on tonight.

675
00:59:28,479 --> 00:59:31,000
How can you hear
what she's going to say?

676
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,731
Who cares what she says?

677
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,354
Don't be such a smart guy.

678
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:37,084
I want you to go to bed.

679
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,422
It's almost midnight.

680
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:41,432
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with...

681
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:42,683
these last few days.

682
00:59:42,722 --> 00:59:43,670
I will, Mom.

683
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:44,728
You guys turning in?

684
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,330
Pretty soon.

685
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,831
Now get to bed.

686
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,871
It's over now, baby.

687
00:59:59,907 --> 01:00:02,013
The nightmare's over.

688
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:03,132
Please.

689
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,798
You shouldn't stare.

690
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:26,117
You know what I think?

691
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,510
I think that kid
is some kind of lunatic.

692
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:33,742
You shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

693
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,468
You mean those bars?

694
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:40,460
Marge is just being cautious
with her being all alone...

695
01:01:40,498 --> 01:01:44,459
and Nancy
acting so nervous lately.

696
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:46,474
I don't care what you say.

697
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:49,581
I don't want that kid hanging
around with our son anymore.

698
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:39,832
Glen, answer the phone.

699
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:47,961
Just a minute.

700
01:02:47,995 --> 01:02:50,995
It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

701
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:52,945
About what?

702
01:02:52,987 --> 01:02:55,224
What's this about, Nancy?

703
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:58,771
Just a minute.

704
01:02:58,813 --> 01:03:00,722
She says it's private.

705
01:03:00,764 --> 01:03:03,612
Very private and very important.

706
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:04,790
Give me that.

707
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:07,251
Glen's asleep. You'll have
to talk to him tomorrow.

708
01:03:07,294 --> 01:03:09,203
You've just got to be firm
with these kids.

709
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:10,229
Let's go.

710
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,863
As a matter of fact...

711
01:03:21,984 --> 01:03:23,294
Damn.

712
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:30,847
Don't fall asleep.

713
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:55,905
Oh, brilliant.

714
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:00,033
What if Glen tries to call?

715
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,003
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

716
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,576
My boyfriend.

717
01:04:55,628 --> 01:04:57,669
Mom !

718
01:04:57,709 --> 01:05:01,190
Locked, locked, locked, locked.

719
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,954
I locked it all up.

720
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,878
I had to.

721
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,278
Nancy, you are going
to get some sleep tonight...

722
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,652
if it kills me.

723
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:11,622
Give me the key, Mother.

724
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:15,493
I can't. I don't
even have it on me. See?

725
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,747
Damn it!

726
01:05:24,657 --> 01:05:26,959
It is now 12 midnight...

727
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:30,289
and this is station KRGR
leaving the air.

728
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:38,703
Help, Mom !

729
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:21,752
Come on, Frank.
I'll give you a hand.

730
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:25,720
You won't need
a stretcher up there.

731
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:27,183
You'll need a mop.

732
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,650
Don't tell me it's another one.

733
01:06:38,683 --> 01:06:40,756
Lieutenant Thompson,
I'm sorry to wake you...

734
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:43,578
but I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

735
01:06:43,612 --> 01:06:44,627
And I knew
this is your neighbourhood...

736
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,195
so I thought I'd better
call you right away.

737
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:49,204
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think that he's...

738
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:09,243
Oh, my God.

739
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:15,097
I'll get him right away.

740
01:07:15,136 --> 01:07:16,959
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

741
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,760
Hi, Daddy.

742
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:31,071
I know what happened.

743
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:34,369
I haven't been upstairs yet.

744
01:07:34,402 --> 01:07:36,672
But you know he's dead, right?

745
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:38,617
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

746
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:44,643
Listen, Daddy,
I've got a proposition for you.

747
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:46,684
Listen very carefully, please.

748
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,918
I'm going to go and get
the guy who did it...

749
01:07:49,957 --> 01:07:52,860
and I want you to be there
to arrest him...

750
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,145
when I bring him out, OK?

751
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:56,386
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

752
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:59,292
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy...

753
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:01,342
and only I can get him.

754
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:03,750
It's my nightmare he comes to.

755
01:08:03,783 --> 01:08:06,817
Just come here
and break the door down...

756
01:08:06,855 --> 01:08:09,277
in exactly 20 minutes.

757
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,433
Can you do that?

758
01:08:10,472 --> 01:08:12,033
Yeah, sure.

759
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:15,422
That'll be exactly
half past midnight.

760
01:08:17,449 --> 01:08:21,225
Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

761
01:08:21,257 --> 01:08:22,850
Honey, you just do that.

762
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,872
Get yourself some sleep.

763
01:08:23,914 --> 01:08:25,289
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

764
01:08:25,322 --> 01:08:26,784
But you'll be here to catch him?

765
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:28,834
Lieutenant, they're waiting
for you upstairs.

766
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,631
Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

767
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:32,576
You just get yourself
some rest...please?

768
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:33,796
Deal?

769
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,256
I love you, sweetheart.

770
01:08:40,076 --> 01:08:44,201
Go outside
and watch my daughter's house.

771
01:08:44,237 --> 01:08:45,993
If you see anything funny,
call me.

772
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:47,371
Anything funny, like what?

773
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:48,616
I don't know.

774
01:08:48,653 --> 01:08:51,653
One thing for sure, I don't
want her coming over here.

775
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,541
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

776
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:12,239
What the hell did that,
Lieutenant?

777
01:10:12,281 --> 01:10:13,590
I don't know.

778
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,633
What has the coroner got to say?

779
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:18,641
He's in the john puking
since he saw it.

780
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:26,422
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

781
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:28,347
Just get some sleep, Mom.

782
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:30,103
It's going to be OK.

783
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:32,955
I was just trying
to protect you.

784
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:35,573
I didn't see how much
you needed to know.

785
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:39,991
You face things.

786
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:42,811
That's your nature.

787
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:44,339
That's your gift...

788
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:48,855
but sometime you have to
turn away, too.

789
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,596
I love you.

790
01:11:05,536 --> 01:11:07,543
I love you, too, baby.

791
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:23,226
Night.

792
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:29,506
OK, Krueger.

793
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,213
We play on your court.

794
01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:50,274
And now I lay me down to sleep.

795
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,514
I pray
the Lord my soul to keep...

796
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:55,486
and if I die before I wake...

797
01:11:55,527 --> 01:11:58,823
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

798
01:12:02,377 --> 01:12:04,100
Countdown mode.

799
01:12:04,137 --> 01:12:06,276
Ten minutes and counting.

800
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:21,064
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

801
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:22,790
They turn their back on it.

802
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:24,769
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.

803
01:12:24,812 --> 01:12:26,535
What happens if they
don't do that?

804
01:12:26,572 --> 01:12:28,841
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

805
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:58,605
You dreamed about
the same creep I did.

806
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:01,104
Gonne get you.

807
01:15:02,689 --> 01:15:04,031
I'm here!

808
01:16:45,904 --> 01:16:49,614
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

809
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,070
Shit.

810
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:01,065
Come on, Krueger!

811
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:03,081
Follow me!

812
01:17:08,595 --> 01:17:11,465
Damn it!

813
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,995
Where are you?

814
01:17:14,035 --> 01:17:16,141
Where are you, Krueger?

815
01:17:17,459 --> 01:17:20,427
I know you're here.

816
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:23,535
Final 10 seconds.

817
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,612
Nine, eight, seven, six...

818
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:26,601
Bitch.

819
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,837
I got you now!

820
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,938
I'm crazy after all.

821
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,045
Come on, Krueger!

822
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:18,361
Take it down!

823
01:18:18,397 --> 01:18:20,023
Come and get me!

824
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:23,773
Help!

825
01:18:23,806 --> 01:18:25,082
I've got him ! Hey, Daddy!

826
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,125
I've got him trapped!

827
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,824
Help! Where are you?

828
01:18:28,861 --> 01:18:30,967
Everything's going to be all right!

829
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,697
Everything's under control!

830
01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:35,190
Get my dad, you asshole!

831
01:18:44,608 --> 01:18:45,950
Come on!

832
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:47,512
He's in here!

833
01:18:47,553 --> 01:18:49,375
Don't let him kill me, too!

834
01:19:03,395 --> 01:19:04,824
Come on, Freddy.

835
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:06,296
Can't you catch me?

836
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:11,327
I'm going to split you in two.

837
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,560
Daddy, help me, please!

838
01:19:22,597 --> 01:19:24,703
Maybe I better go
tell the Lieutenant.

839
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:37,092
I'll kill you slow.

840
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:41,823
Where are you?

841
01:20:14,796 --> 01:20:17,001
Daddy, I did it!

842
01:20:17,037 --> 01:20:18,150
Please hurry!

843
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:22,499
Where are you?

844
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:27,468
Parker, I need some help here!

845
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:28,877
OK, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

846
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:30,766
Let's go.
Al, Tim, get over here.

847
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,751
Get you out.

848
01:20:36,784 --> 01:20:38,344
Open this door!

849
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:40,358
Watch yourself. I got it.

850
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,774
It's Krueger!

851
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:43,216
Get out of the way.

852
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:50,407
This way, guys. Come down here.

853
01:20:53,586 --> 01:20:55,375
Oh, my God.

854
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,686
Nancy, what the hell
is going on?

855
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:58,827
Parker, get up here!

856
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:00,111
We got a fire up here, too.

857
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,050
We're on our way up.

858
01:21:06,035 --> 01:21:08,141
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

859
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,035
He's after Mother!

860
01:21:22,454 --> 01:21:24,341
Watch out! He's under there!

861
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,313
Now do you believe me?

862
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:55,703
They've got the fires out
downstairs.

863
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:57,594
Everything OK up here?

864
01:22:07,613 --> 01:22:09,435
I'm OK.

865
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,432
You go downstairs.

866
01:22:13,469 --> 01:22:15,891
I'll be there in a minute.

867
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:22,270
Lieutenant,
is everything all right?

868
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:23,764
I don't know.

869
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:56,961
I know you're there, Freddy.

870
01:23:00,964 --> 01:23:04,347
You think you was
going to get away from me?

871
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:06,755
I know you too well now,
Freddy.

872
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:11,364
Now you die.

873
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:14,463
It's too late, Krueger.

874
01:23:14,502 --> 01:23:17,950
I know the secret now.

875
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,063
This is just a dream.

876
01:23:20,102 --> 01:23:22,306
You're not alive.

877
01:23:22,343 --> 01:23:26,751
This whole thing
is just a dream.

878
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:30,786
I want
my mother and friends again.

879
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:32,679
You what?

880
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:37,896
I take back
every bit of energy I gave you.

881
01:23:37,928 --> 01:23:39,652
You're nothing.

882
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:43,651
You're shit.

883
01:23:58,795 --> 01:24:01,185
It's bright.

884
01:24:01,228 --> 01:24:05,603
It's going to burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

885
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:07,205
Feeling better?

886
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:09,579
Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

887
01:24:09,613 --> 01:24:10,725
They say you've bottomed out...

888
01:24:10,766 --> 01:24:13,384
when you can't remember
the night before.

889
01:24:13,422 --> 01:24:15,309
You know, baby,
I'm going to stop drinking.

890
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,441
I just don't feel like it
anymore.

891
01:24:18,478 --> 01:24:20,650
Did I keep you awake last night?

892
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:23,338
You look a little bit peaked.

893
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,785
I guess I just slept heavy.

894
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:31,657
I'll see you.

895
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:32,808
See you.

896
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:38,288
Hi, everybody.

897
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,565
You believe this fog?

898
01:24:39,601 --> 01:24:42,668
I believe anything is possible.

899
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:45,328
Looking good, girl.

900
01:24:47,058 --> 01:24:48,335
What happened?

901
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:51,500
What's going on?

902
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:54,027
Hey, I'm not doing this.

903
01:24:54,068 --> 01:24:54,995
Let us out!

904
01:24:55,028 --> 01:24:55,955
I'm not doing this.

905
01:24:55,988 --> 01:24:57,581
What's going on with the window?

906
01:24:57,619 --> 01:24:59,408
No! Mother!

907
01:25:04,244 --> 01:25:05,292
What's going on?

908
01:25:09,013 --> 01:25:10,802
One, two...

909
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:14,635
Freddy's coming for you.

910
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:21,039
Three, four...

911
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:24,625
Better lock your door.

912
01:25:25,623 --> 01:25:26,834
Five, six...

913
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:29,687
Grab your crucifix.

914
01:25:30,424 --> 01:25:31,635
Seven, eight...

915
01:25:31,672 --> 01:25:34,575
Gonne stay up late.

916
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:36,854
Nine, ten...

917
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:41,145
Never sleep again.
