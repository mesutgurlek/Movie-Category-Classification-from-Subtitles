Why do they
call him smiley?

51
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,955
Because he stitched
his eyes shut

52
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:04,225
And carved a smile
onto his face.

that your parents

Bought this house
for you.

And they can't sell it,
so might as well

of paying dorm fees, I guess.

Yeah, I really didn't
want to live in a dorm.

Mm, probably. But, um,

00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,355
It's not exactly
a college party, though.

138
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,723
It's just across campus.

139
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,959
Oh. Is it
some friends of yours?

140
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,460
Wait. Am I
too dressed up?

00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,295
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry.

00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,098
You're cool. I don't know all
these people either, so...

You don't?

the party or something?

we can get in?

Is it safe?
No!

147
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,506
Look,
I know them, okay?

148

met them in person.

210

often retarded.

The intersection of the
strange and retarded.

214
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,267

No, but, uh, really,
what I'm interested in

219
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,245
Is how people start believing
in things, you know?

220
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,614
Like, uh, bigfoot,
for example.

221
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,617
You know, there's no evidence
that bigfoot exists,

222
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,953
Yet lots of people
believe in bigfoot.

223
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,954
Chupacabra.
Sure.

224
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,422
Sure.
Or how 'bout God?

225
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,391
I mean, millions of
people go to church,

226
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,959
And there's more
evidence for chupacabra.

227
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:10,831
So is God strange
or retarded?

00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,268
Have a seat.

330
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,503
Make yourself
comfortable.

331
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,705
I'm gonna stay here.

332
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,440
Great.
As you guys know,

333
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,075
That this class
is a requirement.

334
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:28,081
Now, aside from my
brilliance and my charisma

335
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,318
And the, uh, school's
obvious huge budget...

336
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,652
Do you have a pencil?

337
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,354
And some of the
technical equipment...

338
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,422
Thanks.

339
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,756
Why do you think
this class is--

340
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,125
You smell better
than I do.

341
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,259
Excuse me. Excuse me.

342
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:42,295
What--what is your name?

343
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:43,430
Mark.
Mark.

344
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:45,632
Okay, mark,
could you please tell me

345
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:48,635
Why do you think this
class is a requirement?

346
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:52,606
Um, because we
have to take it?

347
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,640
[laughter]

348
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,142
Okay, all right,
all right.

349
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,676
Hold on a second.
Don't laugh at mark.

350
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,145
All right, now what
is going on here?

351
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:01,181
Now, why can't, "because
we have to take it,"

352
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,317
Be the reason that this class
is a requirement? Why?

353
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,556
Yes, my sweet latecomer.

354
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,926
Because they're just different
ways of saying the same thing.

355
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,427
Exactly.

356
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,531
They are what
we will learn to call

357
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,499
Equivalent statements.

358
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,469
Neither supports
nor follows the other.

359
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,937
Now, as you guys
get more comfortable

360
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,973
With the keys
of logic and reason,

361
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:30,777
You're gonna find that they'll
open up just about any box.

362
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,480
Open your books
to page, uh, 29.

363
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,348
29. No, that's just--

364
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,317
That's just
a picture of me.

365
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,089
Professor Clayton.

366
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,925
Oh, girl who was late.

367
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:46,259
I'm so sorry.
Ashley Brooks.

368
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,594
I promise
I will never--

369
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,462
No, just kidding.
Half the people in this class

370
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:50,797
Are gonna drop out
once they realize

371
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,831
That reading is involved.

372
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,466
Oh, well,
I was wondering

373
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,535
Whether I could get all the
semester's assignments early?

374
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:56,670
Why? You leaving town?
No.

375
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,805
I just like to be
really prepared.

376
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,477
Are you hitting on me?

377
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,512
What? No.

378
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:07,247
I wanted
to know about--

379
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,250
[both laugh]

380
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,585
You're joking.

381
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,987
Oh, no. No, that--

382
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:15,889
[both laugh]
ah, yeah.

383
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:17,390
Nothing gets past you,
Ms. Brooks.

384
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,492
Ah, you know what? All the
assignments on the website.

385
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:20,827
All right. Okay.
Okay. Thanks.

386
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,395
Do yourself a favor,
though, okay?

387
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,664
You don't have to do all
your homework in one night.

388
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,665
Just relax, okay?
It's college.

389
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,667
Have a good time, okay?

390
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,103
[laughs]

391
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,144
[door opens, closes]

392
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,814
Oh, what's up,
party monster?

393
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,649
Everything is
still spinning.

394
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:43,750
Is that normal?

395
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,485
I don't know
what got into you.

396
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:46,920
[sighs] oh, God.

397
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,855
Did I do something crazy?

398
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,890
Uh, well, if belting out
Taylor swift lyrics

399
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,892
At the top
of your lungs in front

400
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,062
Of a bunch of 4chan nerds
is crazy, then yes.

401
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,430
Oh, my God.
That's so embarrassing.

402
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:58,598
No, don't worry, okay?

403
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,433
No one's even
gonna remember that,

404
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,902
Because there's
a new video.

405
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,838
What?

406
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,379
Are those juicy
Booty shorts?

407
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,214
Oh, my God,
his forehead.

408
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:16,216
That is from last night.
What's that guy's name again?

409
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,418
I don't know. Is that
a mole on your face,

410
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,586
Or is that a herpes?

411
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,820
I don't know.
They put something

412
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,589
Right there on my face.
I don't know.

413
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,424
What--what's it say?

414
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:25,425
[Ashley screams]

415
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,828
Oh, my God.

416
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,297
There's no way, right?

417
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,465
No way it's real?
Or no way it's fake?

418
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,800
I don't know.

419
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,368
Can't you call somebody?

420
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,571
None of us even know
each other's real names,

421
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,408
But he hasn't
been online, so...

422
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,475
What do
other people think?

423
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:43,810
About half and half.

424
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,345
Well, did anyone
call the police?

425
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,714
And say what? That there's
some Internet video

426
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:49,282
Of some guy
getting killed?

427
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:50,517
Yes. If this is real,

428
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,319
Oh, my God,
this is so sick.

429
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:53,820
"hi. Police?

430
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,489
"yeah, there's an Internet video
of some guy getting killed.

431
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:57,490
"oh, no, sorry.

432
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:58,825
"I don't know his name,

433
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:01,094
"but, um, he plays pranks
on the Internet,

434
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:02,362
"and there's
this urban legend that says

435
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,297
"if you type
'I did it for the lulz'

436
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,999
"3 times in a chat,
this guy smiley

437
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,534
Appears behind
the other person and..."

438
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,669
Okay.

439
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,838
So it has
to be fake.

440
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:13,907
Duh.

441
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,376
How would smiley
know where you are?

442
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,746
Right?

443
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,381
Right. Yep.

444
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,917
I mean, they're all just waiting
to see who falls for it.

445
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,285
We're way too smart
for that.

446
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:26,353
Yeah, stupid trolls.

447
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,488
Heh. Oh, God,
I'm so glad you came home.

448
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,557
That was kind of
freaking me out.

449
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,294
Hey, you know, I know how
we could find out for real.

450
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,198
What?

451
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,268
Try to do it?

452
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:44,938
No way.
That's so spooky.

453
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,440
No, it's not.
Okay, we just do it.

454
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,377
Nothing happens, and
then we know it's fake.

455
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,478
Because that way,

456
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,247
We'll know it's fake
for sure, huh?

457
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,515
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

458
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,817
What are they
called again?

459
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,319
Lulz, l-u-l-z,

460
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,123
Like lols, like lolcats,
but lulz.

461
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,591
[laughs]

462
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:08,194
Mm. Ah, no.

463
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,463
Waah.

464
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:11,498
Mm...

465
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,899
Maybe.

466
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,901
Don't want to waste it.
Keep going. Keep going.

467
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:17,003
Mm.
Oh, he's kind of cute.

468
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,038
Mm, yeah, super cute.
Total babe.

469
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,373
Don't kill him.
Okay.

470
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,608
Enh, no.

471
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,943
Ahh! Penis!

472
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,845
Hi, tiny and kind of bent.

473
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,747
Hope you like
touching that thing,

474
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:29,015
'cause no one else
is gonna do it.

475
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:30,183
"next" him.
Wait, wait.

476
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,218
Wait, maybe should
we kill him instead.

477
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,020
Let me do it.
Maybe smiley

478
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,156
Will come out and
cut off his wiener.

479
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:36,956
"wiener"?

480
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,425
Heh. I think
you mean penis.

481
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:39,993
You can't joke around,
though, okay?

482
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,828
You have to really
want it to happen.

483
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,329
Yeah, okay, okay.
I want it to happen.

484
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:45,298
Picture it.
You have to picture it.

485
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,834
Okay.

486
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,574
Okay.

487
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:56,876
Give me the keyboard.

488
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,418
Right.

489
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:18,698
[both laugh]

490
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,533
Yeah, right.
As if.

491
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,662
[both scream]

492
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,867
He--he can see us!

493
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,002
"next" him!
"next" him! "next" him!

494
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,138
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?!

495
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,007
I don't know. Did we
just kill somebody?

496
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,342
Did I just
kill somebody?!

497
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,110
I don't know.
Where did he come from?

498
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,445
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

499
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,580
I thought college
was gonna be fun.

500
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:09,883
If that really just happened,
smiley can't know where we are.

501
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,284
But he saw us. I mean,
he looked right at us.

502
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:12,452
He doesn't know
where we are.

503
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,320
But he saw our faces,
and, oh, my God,

504
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:16,823
He waved at us.
And that doesn't matter.

505
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,024
He has no clue
where we are.

506
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,159
He can't find out
from the computer?

507
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,661
No, absolutely not, okay?

508
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,563
The hideandgochat servers
are completely anonymized.

509
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,064
That's the whole point.
They're set up

510
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,900
So not even your root
can find the IP.

511
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,034
I don't know
what that means.

512
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,636
Trust me. It's good.

513
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,170
Okay, okay.

514
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:32,472
So we report this,
tell the police

515
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:34,507
What we saw.
No, no, no, did. No, saw.

516
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:36,042
No.
Why not?!

517
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:37,677
Because if we report this,
there's gonna be press.

518
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,846
If it's real, it's gonna
lead him right to us.

519
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,347
He does know
what we look like.

520
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:44,584
What about the FBI
or something?

521
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,853
No. Ashley,
we can't do that, okay?

522
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,488
We can't tell anybody
about this.

523
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,057
This never happened.

524
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,859
[cellphone buzzing]

525
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:54,527
Oh. It's my dad.

526
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,095
Not a word.

527
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,736
Hi, daddy.

528
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,737
Hi, sweetheart.

529
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:06,839
How's college life?

530
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,541
It's fine.

531
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,578
I mean, it's okay.

532
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,012
It's good.

533
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm having fun.

534
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:17,617
[laughs] well, not too
much fun, I hope.

535
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,452
No.

536
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,554
You sound a little
funny, sweetheart.

537
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:22,488
Everything's fine.

538
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,424
I'm sorry
I haven't called.

539
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:25,425
I just...

540
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,264
I was just watching a
scary movie with proxy,

541
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:34,667
And I-I'm still trying to
get it out of my head.

542
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:35,935
Everything's good.

543
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,236
Is this a bad time?
I mean,

544
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:39,072
Do you want to get
back to your movie?

545
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,307
No! I mean...

546
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,476
No.

547
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,846
Now's a good time.
I'm out on the patio.

548
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:50,083
You still sound
kind of funny, hon.

549
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,152
Must be a bad connection.

550
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,089
Okay.

551
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:59,192
But I do want you to
know that if you just...

552
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:02,528
Feel like you're not ready
to be out on your own,

553
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,998
You know, you can
always come home.

554
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,566
Thanks, daddy.

555
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,574
I just miss mom.

556
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,543
Yeah.

557
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,946
Yeah, so do I, baby.

558
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:23,316
I wish we could just
call her up, you know,

559
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,685
Hear her voice
one more time.

560
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,153
Yeah.

561
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:31,491
Me, too.

562
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,060
It's just hard,
you know.

563
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,766
But I promise I'm fine
most of the time.

564
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:40,867
[chuckles]

565
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,468
Ohh! Um...

566
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,203
Proxy's ready
to keep watching,

567
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,507
So I'll call you
later, okay? Bye.

568
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,310
I didn't tell.
Good.

569
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,450
Now, who could
tell me what we mean

570
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:00,386
By "the scientific method"?

571
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,387
Mark.

572
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:06,392
It's like you make
a hypothesis...

573
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,960
No, that's true.
Please, mark,

574
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:09,328
Stop--stop being right
so often,

575
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,664
And give some of the
other students a chance.

576
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:12,632
Yes, it's true.

577
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,400
The first step
in the scientific method

578
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,135
Is forming a hypothesis.

579
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:17,770
So what's a hypothesis?

580
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:18,938
Maria.

581
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,907
It's like what
you think is true.

582
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,809
Yes. Now that we
have this notion

583
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:26,212
Of what we think is true,
what do we do next?

584
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:27,580
I test it, girl.

585
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:28,581
[laughter]

586
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,782
Exactly.

587
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,983
You test it.

588
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,453
This man is
a closet scientist.

589
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,722
All right, so what
do we do now? Ashley.

590
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,729
Um, what if you test your
hypothesis and it's wrong?

591
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,597
That's fine.
Happens all the time.

592
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,167
You add that result
to your observations.

593
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,635
You revise your hypothesis.

594
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:51,537
No. I mean...

595
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,940
What if you test
your hypothesis

596
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,142
And something
impossible happens?

597
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:59,612
Hmm. What do you mean,
impossible?

598
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,049
Nothing.
It's stupid.

599
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,284
I'm sure it's not.

600
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,919
Like supernatural?

601
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:09,288
Like ghosts?

602
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,691
[laughter, murmuring]

603
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:13,626
I don't think we're gonna
settle the ghost question,

604
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,863
But I want to talk about
how the curiosity

605
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:19,265
And skepticism embodied
in the scientific method

606
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,000
Have applications
beyond the laboratory

607
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:24,871
And their opposite,
ideology.

608
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:28,174
We can call ideology
the complete confidence

609
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,943
In what we think
we know, and as such,

610
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:33,679
It is the end
of critical thinking

611
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,747
And not in a good way.

612
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,449
The worst things
that happen in the world

613
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:40,820
Are done by people who are
sure that they are right.

614
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,790
Hitler, Stalin, mao,

615
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,758
Pol pot, bin laden,

616
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,362
These are people who believe that
they have some special knowledge

617
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,698
And that this gives them
license to do anything

618
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,768
Because they can.

619
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:59,906
Now, provided any of you
are still awake,

620
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:04,677
Would you please turn your books
to the bottom of page 256?

621
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:41,147
[both yell]

622
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,648
Oh, I'm so sorry.

623
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,649
Uh, sorry.

624
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:50,823
Binder, right?

625
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:51,791
Yeah.

626
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,026
We met at that,
uh, party last night.

627
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:55,027
Right.

628
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,163
Ashley.

629
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,998
I remember.

630
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:04,003
Can I talk to you
about something?

631
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:05,238
Me?

632
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,139
Uh, yeah, sure.

633
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:09,141
Guess I'm
the only one here.

634
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,376
What's up?

635
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,179
What do you know
about smiley?

636
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,513
You mean,
is he real?

637
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:16,949
Did they send you
here to mess with me?

638
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:18,584
What?

639
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,653
Well, smiley's part of the
reason they don't like me,

640
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,256
Like when I reported the child
porn they posted on /b/.

641
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,657
I don't know.
I just don't think

642
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,025
Stuff like that
is ever funny.

643
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:27,059
Because it's not.

644
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,929
But what about smiley?

645
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,099
Well, my theories on him
are kind of weird.

646
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,101
This whole thing
is pretty weird.

647
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,269
Yeah.

648
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,371
Well, I think
smiley's only real

649
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:40,439
When people
make him real.

650
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,408
Like tinker bell?

651
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,977
Heh. Yeah.

it become something.

I don't know
if smiley's real.

It's gonna be huge,

With smiley?

I don't know what
you're talking about,

Because that never
happened, remember?

00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:17,770
Oh. Right. Sorry.

Yeah. Okay,
go get ready, all right?

This'll make us
both forget, I promise.

We, uh--we met
the other night.

You wanted
to have sex with me,

into it.

Are you kidding me?

728
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:18,357

where he lives?

I don't know.

You just
come up with that?

00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,504
So you don't know
if he's alive.

is really real?

00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,761
Shouldn't be walking around
by yourself at night.

818
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:25,063
Proxy!
This actually happened!

819
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:28,567
I left the party,
and I was pretty buzzed.

820
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,835
I was super wasted.

821
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,336
I mean, how did
I get so wasted?

822
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:32,838
Mm, I don't know.
And then--

823
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
And then I went
across campus,

824
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,108
And he was there.

825
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,310
Well, are you sure
it was him?

826
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,914
Wasn't just
some creepy guy?

827
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,515
He had the fucking face,

828
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:45,083
And he had the knife,

829
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:47,920
And he said
my name, proxy.

830
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,955
He knows my name.

831
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:52,224
But you got away.

832
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:53,358
No.

833
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,495
But, like,
you're right here,

834
00:40:56,497 --> 00:41:01,467
So, um, news flash, this
didn't happen, Ashley.

835
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,303
Where did you find me?
I found you right here.

836
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:06,672
I came in your room, and
you were in your bed.

837
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:07,706
He was in here?!

838
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:10,275
No. [laughs] God.

839
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,543
It was just you.

840
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,245
He did this.

841
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,379
Okay.

842
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:18,884
I think that it was just
a really bad dream.

843
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:21,253
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

844
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,257
I'm really
freaked out, too.

845
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,558
[laughs]

846
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,861
Okay, what's the last
thing you remember?

847
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:32,030
Uh, he--

848
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,934
He was...

849
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,073
And I woke up.

850
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:47,112
Ashley, are you
on any psychiatric meds?

851
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,380
No.

852
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:52,551
Not anymore.

853
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,490
Have you ever been
on any medication?

854
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,959
Lithium for bipolar.

855
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:03,028
And when were
you diagnosed?

856
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,030
My senior year
of high school.

857
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:07,032
I kind of
had a breakdown

858
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,434
After my mom
committed suicide.

859
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,372
Had your mother been
diagnosed as bipolar?

860
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:18,210
No. Well, I mean,
afterwards.

861
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:20,312
And why'd you stop
taking the meds?

862
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,848
The lithium made me
so fat and stupid.

863
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,283
I couldn't
remember anything.

864
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:27,085
But I--I didn't just quit.
I came off it gradually.

865
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,987
Under your doctor's
supervision?

866
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,422
Mm-hmm.

867
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,558
I've been totally
off it for six months.

868
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,461
Okay. Well, what's up?

869
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,231
I'm really anxious.

870
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,767
It is your first week
of college.

871
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,502
Yeah, but...

872
00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:45,637
Really anxious,

873
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,906
Like terrified.

874
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:49,508
And I feel guilty.

875
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,777
I feel like I've done
something really bad,

876
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,211
But I don't think I have.

877
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,548
Well, in your
first week of school,

878
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,052
You haven't done
something really awful,

879
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:02,821
Like, say,
killed anyone.

880
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:05,457
Heh.

881
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,326
No.

882
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:12,431
But I'm having really
vivid nightmares.

883
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:14,666
You've been
through a trauma,

884
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,034
Adjusted to it,

885
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,503
And now you're
in a new environment.

886
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:19,504
It's stressful.

887
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:22,674
I don't seem crazy?

888
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:23,942
Crazy?

889
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:26,712
I'd have to say...

890
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:28,080
Not at all.

891
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:32,017
Even though the dreams,

892
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:35,754
They're really...

893
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,659
They're
really realistic.

894
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:44,062
Well, that's the nature
of dreams, isn't it?

895
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:45,664
They seem real
when we're having them.

896
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,333
Otherwise, they'd have
no power over us.

897
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,969
But it sounds like this
anxiety is debilitating.

898
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:53,105
Yeah.
And you don't want

899
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:54,840
To go back
on the lithium salts.

900
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,743
Have you ever tried anything
for situational anxiety,

901
00:43:57,745 --> 00:44:00,412
Rather than a sledgehammer
like lithium?

902
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,714
Like what?

903
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,885
I'm gonna write you
a short scrip for ativan.

904
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,787
That sound okay?

905
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,389
Hmm?

906
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:12,157
Yes.

907
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,760
I just remembered
something.

908
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,495
I'm not crazy.

909
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:17,429
Okay, good.

910
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:19,564
That's a good thing
to remember.

911
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:21,767
I'm gonna give you
this scrip,

912
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:23,301
And it's not for crazy.

913
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:24,369
It's for anxiety.

914
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,740
Okay.

915
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:33,478
Did you tell?

916
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,813
[gasps] no.

917
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:36,415
I just remembered.
At the party,

918
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:37,649
Zane knew-- yeah,
he just called me.

919
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:39,885
There's another one.
Another what?

920
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,153
Another dead person.

921
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:43,088
We gotta go
to Zane's.

922
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,395
Ashley.

923
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,199
Okay, what is going on?

924
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:56,101
I don't know.

925
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,235
What about you?

926
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,970
Huh? You know
what's going on?

927
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,672
Is that a gun?
Yes. Yes.

928
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:02,140
This--
this is a gun.

929
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:03,575
Why do you have that?

930
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,144
Because I am
a security professional.

931
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,679
But I thought
you went to college.

932
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:12,584
Do I really seem
that retarded to you?

933
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,187
What?
College is for retards.

934
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,689
I am a security
professional.

935
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:19,691
Oh.

936
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:20,959
Like at the mall?

937
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:23,562
Fucking fuck, no!
No, no, no!

938
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:26,064
Like at the mall?
Network security.

939
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,265
What's
network security?

940
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,434
He's a hacker,
okay, like lulzsec,

941
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,169
Like--like anonymous,
like wikileaks,

942
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,237
Like trolling
westboro--

943
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:33,672
Proxy, will you
shut up, please?

944
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:35,574
Will you watch the gun?
Please shut up.

945
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:37,442
She has to understand that to
know what you're talking about.

946
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:38,877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

947
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,878
He needs some money,

948
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,213
He hacks
a corporate network,

949
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:43,315
And then says, "hey,
pay me to fix your problem."

950
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:44,649
That's a network
security professional.

951
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:46,451
What you're talking
about would be

952
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,454
An illegal
protection racket.

953
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,724
I am one
of a hundred

954
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:56,728
Or 500 or a thousand
people in the whole world

955
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,064
Who can find out
anything about anyone,

956
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:02,467
Medical records,
how much money,

957
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,437
Chocolate or vanilla,
top or bottom.

958
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:09,341
I mean,
and honestly,

959
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:13,378
I have no idea
what's going on.

960
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,947
I mean,
who's doing this?

961
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:17,516
We don't know.

962
00:46:17,518 --> 00:46:21,820
Okay, well, why don't
you riddle me this?

963
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:22,821
Who is she?

964
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,089
Me?

965
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:25,624
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

966
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:27,726
"smiley's trying
to kill me. Ahh."

967
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:28,727
You're not dead.

968
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:29,861
You're not dead,

969
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:31,930
And other
people are.

970
00:46:31,932 --> 00:46:33,698
You want to see
the video

971
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,535
Of smiley slashing
crash's throat?

972
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:38,570
I could show it
to you if you want.

973
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,572
No.
Proxy?

974
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:44,442
This shit's
personal, okay?

975
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,113
If this isn't some Internet
hobgoblin fairy tale,

976
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,714
This is one
of our enemies.

977
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:52,851
Who are your enemies?

978
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,953
Who is not our enemies?

979
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:58,423
You don't get to be king
of the Internet assholes

980
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:01,092
Without making
a few enemies,

981
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:02,093
A shit-ton, in fact.

982
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,094
I mean, it could be--

983
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:04,696
Could be the--
the Chinese

984
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:07,098
Or those fucking--
those dicks in Holland.

985
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,266
Remember them?
Yeah.

986
00:47:08,268 --> 00:47:09,734
And, uh, the feds.

987
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:10,769
Could be the FBI.

988
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,505
I mean, but--
but if it was the FBI,

989
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:17,209
You know, they'd be--
just knock down the door.

990
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,978
[sighs] fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

991
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:24,783
What if smiley isn't
any of those things?

992
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,621
I mean, what if he's real?

993
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,256
He's definitely
fucking real.

994
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:32,958
I think we've established
that by now.

995
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,062
No, I mean, what if he's
something we can't understand?

996
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:40,966
What if he's just evil?

997
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:45,704
And that evil...

998
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:47,539
Is hunting us?

999
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:48,406
Yes.

1000
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:51,710
What if that evil
is hunting us?

1001
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:55,881
Well, then, I'd say that's
pretty fucking bad news.

1002
00:47:57,617 --> 00:47:58,950
Shit!

1003
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:02,454
I think I'm gonna go get
my prescription filled.

1004
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,422
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1005
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,758
What are
you getting?

1006
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,261
Oh, ativan.

1007
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:12,297
Ativan. Um, save me
some of that.

1008
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:14,499
I think we're
gonna need it.

1009
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,109
All right,
be careful, ladies.

1010
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:25,710
Yeah. You, too.

1011
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:26,745
Right.

1012
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:20,899
[gasping]

1013
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,840
[crickets chirping]

1014
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:47,058
[nail scratches]

1015
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,426
All righty.

1016
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,763
Who can tell me
about occam's razor? Yeah?

1017
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:56,735
Uh, "entities must not be
multiplied beyond necessity."

1018
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:59,004
You've done your reading.
That's very good.

1019
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:01,606
Okay, now give it to me
in the plain language, okay?

1020
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:04,142
What did William
of ockham mean? Hmm?

1021
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:05,276
Maria?

1022
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:08,380
Uh, the most likely
explanation

1023
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,715
Is usually
the right explanation.

1024
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,418
Now, is occam's razor
a rule

1025
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,686
Or more of a guideline?

1026
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:16,421
Well, it's a guideline,
because, I mean,

1027
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:20,725
Sometimes the unlikely explanation
is actually the right explanation.

1028
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:25,030
Right, and that brings
us back to something

1029
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:26,865
That, uh, Ashley...

1030
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:27,866
Was asking about

1031
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:30,068
At the end
of the last class.

1032
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,571
How do we account for things
that seem so unlikely

1033
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,273
As to be impossible?

1034
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:37,308
They do occur.

1035
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,810
Like supernatural?

1036
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:40,612
Ah, let me give you
something that's

1037
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,614
A little weirder than what
we call supernatural,

1038
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:44,182
Just to, uh,
blow your minds.

1039
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:47,085
Are your minds
ready to blown?

1040
00:50:48,354 --> 00:50:49,888
Okay.

1041
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,359
Now, we know
that the physical laws

1042
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:58,296
That govern the universe
are specific

1043
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:01,900
And that the tiniest,
most infinitesimal change

1044
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:05,403
In the weight of just one
type of subatomic particle,

1045
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:07,539
Any kind of particle,

1046
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:10,008
Would mean no universe,

1047
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,545
No stars, no planets,

1048
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:16,314
No life,
no consciousness,

1049
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:19,284
Us not even having
this conversation.

1050
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:23,755
Unless you believe in a God
whose only reason for being

1051
00:51:23,757 --> 00:51:27,125
Is the authorship of a
relatively small book of rules

1052
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:30,462
About the weight and
behavior of particles,

1053
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,964
Then we have
to acknowledge

1054
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,800
That those rules could have
been anything whatsoever.

1055
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,270
Now, what is the implication
of what I just said?

1056
00:51:39,272 --> 00:51:40,572
Yeah?

1057
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:42,574
It's almost like
everything that happened

1058
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:45,944
Happened so we could
know it happened.

1059
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:47,078
A-plus.

1060
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,381
And that idea is called
the anthropic principle,

1061
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:54,119
That everything happened just so
that we could know it happened,

1062
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:57,856
But there's a problem with the
anthropic principle. Ashley...

1063
00:51:57,858 --> 00:52:02,227
What could be wrong
with this idea?

1064
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:04,929
It assumes we're the end.

1065
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:06,297
Yes.

1066
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:08,133
It assumes
we're the reason,

1067
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:11,469
When really we could just
be amoebas or whatever.

1068
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:15,540
Simple forms of life were
necessary for us to develop.

1069
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,943
We might be
what's necessary

1070
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:22,147
For something else
to develop.

1071
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,719
And I think I'd like
to end it on that.

1072
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:31,055
Humanity may be nothing more
than an intermediate step

1073
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:32,624
In the development
of a consciousness

1074
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,792
A trillion times
greater.

1075
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:37,795
We already
built it a network,

1076
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,731
Millions of nodes
communicating with each other

1077
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:41,699
That is called
the Internet.

1078
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,536
And while each node
on its own

1079
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:46,771
Is nothing more
than a dumb computer,

1080
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:50,575
Please remember that each of
our individual brain cells

1081
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:53,378
Is capable
of far, far less.

1082
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,079
<i>Terminator,
like skynet.</i>

1083
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:57,582
<i>Or like the matrix,
like Neo.</i>

1084
00:52:57,584 --> 00:53:00,118
I think it's gonna be
a lot stranger

1085
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,820
Than anything we're
capable of imagining.

1086
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:05,957
Let's just hope that when
it becomes conscious...

1087
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:09,194
It's nice to us.

1088
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:14,666
Or it could all just be
a bunch of nonsense.

1089
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:16,134
All right,
get out of here.

1090
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:18,870
Have a good day.

1091
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,543
Could I speak to you
for a second?

1092
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:27,779
You know what?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

1093
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,681
Yeah, but it'll just
take one second.

1094
00:53:29,683 --> 00:53:31,716
No, just come during
office hours, okay?

1095
00:53:31,718 --> 00:53:33,017
But--
all right.

1096
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,354
Okay.

1097
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,704
...Baby-sitter Stacy

1098
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:57,675
Hasn't been answering
her calls.

1099
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:59,410
I'm really worried
about her,

1100
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:02,347
Of her getting
killed by smiley.

1101
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:07,785
And nobody believes me.

1102
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,771
[gasps]
[gasps]

1103
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:28,973
Binder.

1104
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,541
Scared the crap
out of me.

1105
00:54:30,543 --> 00:54:32,577
Don't sneak up
on people like that.

1106
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:33,578
Oh, sorry.

1107
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,179
What are you doing here?

1108
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:37,515
Oh, I, uh--

1109
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:38,549
I work here.

1110
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:40,084
Oh, in the library?
Yeah.

1111
00:54:40,086 --> 00:54:41,519
I manage the
networking databases.

1112
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:42,987
It's how I pay
for school.

1113
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,222
You're like
a computer genius.

1114
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:46,057
Uh, yeah, thank you.

1115
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:48,760
I prefer
the term nerd, but...

1116
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:51,095
What are you doing?

1117
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:54,399
You remember saying something
about evil being a force.

1118
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:56,134
Yeah.

1119
00:54:56,136 --> 00:54:58,936
Did you
mean that literally?

1120
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:05,143
We're talking about
smiley, right?

1121
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:07,111
Well, I've been
researching it,

1122
00:55:07,113 --> 00:55:09,647
And I haven't even had time
to get to this part yet--

1123
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:11,282
Smiley's real.

1124
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:13,918
What?
How do you know?

1125
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,487
I killed someone.

1126
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:19,924
[gasps] are you serious?
Ah, that's amazing.

1127
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:21,192
I mean, that's terrible,
obviously,

1128
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,394
But I tried to do it,
and nothing happened.

1129
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:24,896
Do you want them to die?

1130
00:55:24,898 --> 00:55:26,731
No. I mean,
I wanted to be right,

1131
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,366
But I didn't want
to kill anybody.

1132
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:29,834
You have
to really want it.

1133
00:55:29,836 --> 00:55:31,903
You have to really
want them to die.

1134
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,806
But then
he comes after you.

1135
00:55:34,808 --> 00:55:37,508
He tried to kill me.

1136
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,510
What did it feel like?

1137
00:55:39,512 --> 00:55:42,780
What do you mean?
It was horrible.

1138
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:45,783
Wow. Do you know
what this means?

1139
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:47,752
I mean, I thought
I was crazy, but--

1140
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:50,021
But if this is true,
if you're not lying,

1141
00:55:50,023 --> 00:55:51,723
Then that means something's
been awakened,

1142
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:53,024
Like something's
been born,

1143
00:55:53,026 --> 00:55:54,425
Like smiley could be
the next generation--

1144
00:55:54,427 --> 00:55:55,793
Are you not
listening to me?

1145
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:59,263
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

1146
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,033
You know...

1147
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,303
I thought maybe
you could help.

[gasps]

1149
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:34,058
What are you doing?! Huh?!

1150
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,661
What the--are you
trying to get us killed?!

1151
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,062
I just--
are you crazy?

1152
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:39,697
No, I just
want it to stop.

1153
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:41,132
Well, then stop
trying to find out

1154
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:42,834
What it is, okay?
You're bringing it to us.

1155
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,402
But he won't
leave me alone.

1156
00:57:44,404 --> 00:57:46,671
I don't care!
I don't care.

1157
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,539
You need to stop.

1158
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:52,043
Crazy bitch.

1159
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,890
[static]
hi, sweetheart.

1160
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:07,892
Daddy?

Proxy.
What are you, crazy?

1163
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,734
No. No, I'm not crazy. I really
didn't mean to. It was smiley.

1164
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:17,735
Shut up, Ashley.

1165
00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:18,803
He was on the phone.

1166
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:21,072
I swear he was
on the phone.

1167
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:25,343
I'm sorry.

1168
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,681
I'm sorry.

1169
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:34,018
[sobs]
I'm so sorry.

1170
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,054
I know I should have
mentioned something before,

1171
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,290
And I know I lied.
I'm just...

1172
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,861
I just don't want
to be crazy like my mom.

1173
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:45,029
[crying]

1174
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,265
I'm really happy
I can talk to you,

1175
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:51,002
Because I have
nobody else.

1176
00:58:51,004 --> 00:58:54,405
Do you think you're
a danger to yourself?

1177
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:55,706
No.

1178
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,744
I don't want to die.

1179
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,612
I don't want
anybody to die.

1180
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:05,583
I'm gonna need to see
you again tomorrow.

1181
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:08,519
Between now and then,
I want you to sleep.

1182
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:11,389
I can't sleep.

1183
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:13,925
Even the ativan
won't make me.

1184
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,626
I'm gonna give you
a serious tranquilizer.

1185
00:59:15,628 --> 00:59:17,328
I'm only gonna
prescribe one dose,

1186
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,364
And I don't want you to
mix it with the ativan.

1187
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:21,365
Got it?

1188
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:25,503
You're presenting
as rational,

1189
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:29,106
But what you're saying
makes me very concerned.

1190
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,374
The good news

1191
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,010
Is that you know
it doesn't make sense,

1192
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:35,246
And that's
why you're here.

1193
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,316
Tomorrow, we're
gonna talk about

1194
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:40,518
Checking you in
for another evaluation.

1195
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:44,221
But I--I don't want
to go for another--

1196
00:59:44,223 --> 00:59:45,957
We talk about it
tomorrow,

1197
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:48,593
Or we do it today.
Your call.

1198
00:59:51,863 --> 00:59:53,598
Okay.

1199
00:59:57,336 --> 00:59:59,670
Then I'll see you
tomorrow.

1200
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,408
Okay.

1201
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,368
[cellphone buzzes]

1202
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,756
Yeah.

1203
01:00:51,758 --> 01:00:53,224
Ah, Ms. Brooks.

1204
01:00:53,226 --> 01:00:54,458
You here to hand in

1205
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,960
Your next four months
of assignments?

1206
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:57,662
No. I...

1207
01:00:57,664 --> 01:01:00,498
[chuckles]
come on.

1208
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,533
So what's up?

1209
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:06,370
I wanted to know-- you were talking
about in class the other day

1210
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,638
About computers
being conscious.

1211
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,306
Do you think
that's really possible?

1212
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:11,709
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why not?

1213
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:14,545
I--frankly, I think
it's more likely

1214
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,747
That we'll all
just kill each other

1215
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:18,883
Before something that
interesting occurs, but yeah.

1216
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:20,551
You mean with
nuclear weapons?

1217
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,420
Or bioweapons
or nanomachines

1218
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:24,221
Or just plain old
resource depletion

1219
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:28,092
Until we finally achieve total
extinction of all complex life, yeah.

1220
01:01:28,094 --> 01:01:29,660
But why would we
want to do that?

1221
01:01:29,662 --> 01:01:30,594
Want to do it?

1222
01:01:30,596 --> 01:01:32,296
I don't think
we want to do it

1223
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:33,831
Any more than
a great white shark

1224
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,099
Wants to be
an apex predator.

1225
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:36,400
It just does
what it does.

1226
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:38,703
So you think that humans
are just evil?

1227
01:01:38,705 --> 01:01:40,738
[chuckles]

1228
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,640
Can you keep a secret?

1229
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:44,041
Yes.

1230
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:45,376
Okay.

1231
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:48,779
Hmm?

1232
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,614
No.

1233
01:01:50,616 --> 01:01:52,783
Okay.

1234
01:01:54,152 --> 01:01:55,853
What's the secret?

1235
01:01:58,156 --> 01:02:00,691
I keep whiskey
in the filing cabinet.

1236
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:02,760
Oh.

1237
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,729
Duh.

1238
01:02:06,164 --> 01:02:08,232
You know, usually students
come to my office,

1239
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,067
And they want to talk
about grades,

1240
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:11,569
But evil is
far more interesting,

1241
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:14,405
But I've gotta be honest
with you, Ms. Brooks.

1242
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,774
I'm not sure exactly
where this is going.

1243
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,411
Do you think evil
really exists?

1244
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:23,247
Yeah. Of course I do.

1245
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:24,915
Who would deny it?

1246
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:26,717
Evil is a byproduct
of humanity.

1247
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:28,886
You--you mean--
I don't understand.

1248
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:30,187
Like pollution?

1249
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:32,089
Heh heh. Sure.
Yeah, that's a--

1250
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:34,358
That's a good way
to put it.

1251
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,394
Think about people,
what they do.

1252
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:41,232
Eh, we're a perfect
planetary suicide machine.

1253
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:43,134
All we have to do is drive,

1254
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:46,103
Consume, start a family.

1255
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:48,739
There's nothing
more effective

1256
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:49,874
Than human reproduction

1257
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:52,510
If you want to accelerate
planetary extinction.

1258
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:55,012
You don't even have to do
anything spectacular

1259
01:02:55,014 --> 01:02:59,283
To play a meaningful role in the grand
human project of ending the world.

1260
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,987
And if you play your part
better than others

1261
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:05,956
By inventing
some new weapons system

1262
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:10,060
Or a more efficient way of
extracting resource material,

1263
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:14,999
Just so you can suck everything
out of the planet before we go--

1264
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:17,101
I don't know.

1265
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:20,671
Do you think
that that is evil?

1266
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,707
It's just doing
what we do.

1267
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:25,576
Isn't it?

1268
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:34,385
We're rats on a ship,

1269
01:03:34,387 --> 01:03:36,754
Ants on an ice-cream cone.

1270
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:40,925
We're just going along
for the ride.

1271
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:45,596
Everything's gonna end.

1272
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:49,333
I think
the real question is

1273
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,969
Is it gonna end
with a bang

1274
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:55,139
Or eliot's whimper?

1275
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:58,809
And, uh, in the meanwhile...

1276
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:08,285
It just doesn't matter.

1277
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:12,690
What is it
that the kids say?

1278
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:18,996
Uh, it's the perfect
expression of nihilism.

1279
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,534
Hmm?

1280
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:25,903
You know what
I'm talking about.

1281
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,339
No?

1282
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:31,542
What is it?

1283
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:33,477
"I did it for the..."

1284
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:38,315
"I did it for the lulz"?

1285
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:40,885
Yeah. That's it.

1286
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:44,355
"I did it for the lulz."

1287
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:47,291
It's got a nice sound,

1288
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:48,792
Doesn't it?

1289
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:52,029
Lulz.

1290
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:59,737
Is that why
you're here, Ashley?

1291
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:04,608
Do you want to do
something for the lulz?

1292
01:05:06,645 --> 01:05:08,312
I should go.

1293
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:10,381
Go. Stay.

1294
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,051
You know
my point of view.

First of all,
you have no victim.

have victims.

dead people,

who they are,

Except for some nicknames
that, uh, nobody can trace.

It is very difficult
to investigate a crime

that any crime has been done.

a single body?

all the time.

about this smiley character,

to have this talk.

1405

Now, you look like
a nice girl

would want to hurt,

the same thing

But how can you erase everything
over the whole Internet?

You can't.

Reason and ethics can

Every community
lives by a moral code,

1630
01:27:26,718 --> 01:27:28,918
And when that code
