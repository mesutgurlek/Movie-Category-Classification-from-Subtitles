You can't do anything,
you can't help me

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,604
I see a vibrant community here.

4
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:11,607
That's why I want
Maggie working with me.

5
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:14,443
Rick, his group,
they don't deserve this.

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:15,744
[gunshot]

7
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:18,947
She's on her way out,
we need to get her there.

8
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,250
I know what you did,
and it's not gonna happen again.

9
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,918
Are you threatening me?

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,871
Dammit, Rick, I said stop!

11
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,006
Or what?
You gonna kick me out?

12
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,758
Uh!

13

15
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,754
Looks good.

16
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,043
Hi.

17
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,215
Hello.

18
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,720

19
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,722
You can lower that.

20
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:21,570
What's the W for?

21
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,076
You know, the first
settlers here,

22
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:31,413
they put bounties
on wolves' heads.

23
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,249
Brought the natives into it.

24
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:37,085
Made them hunt them.

25
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:39,421
Didn't take them too long
to kill them all.

26
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,642
They're back now.

27
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,431
Thoughts?

28
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,236
Everything gets a return.

29
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,775
- Are you shitting me?
- No, I shit you not.

30
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:02,327
(both laughing)

31
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:06,114
I like this.

32
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:09,034
Just talking.

33
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,535
(laughs)

34
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:15,173
I don't get to meet
new people very often.

35
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,710
Maybe once every two weeks.

36
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:21,463
- That's a lot.
- Oh, I work at it.

37
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:24,049
We do.

38
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:28,603
Sometimes we find camps.
We run through them.

39
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:30,639
But we have traps, too.

40
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,691
It's different.

41
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:35,811
It's not like meeting like this.

42
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,364
As equals.

43
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,703
Little chats in front of
a fire with a stranger.

44
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:49,574
That's the closest thing
to movies now.

45
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,077
I miss the movies.

46
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,662
I used to--
put that down.

47
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,715
Why?

48
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:58,333
'Cause I want it.

49
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:03,221
I want everything you have.

50
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,257
Every last drop.

51
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,393
Can I keep a little of it?

52
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,845
Just to get me through
a day or two?

53
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,314
You know, just to keep me alive?

54
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,069
I'm taking you, too.

55
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:20,655
And you're not exactly
gonna be alive.

56
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:24,943
Okay.

57
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,534
<i>Some of the tribes around here,</i>

58
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:36,037
<i>they thought that</i>
<i>the first people were wolves</i>

60

<i>Everything gets a return, right?</i>

63
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,606
You can have my supplies.
You can have everything.

64

<i>Doesn't need to be any ugliness.</i>

No.

- To try.

you say you were worried

about someone being abused and no
one was doing anything about it.

<i>You say you took a gun</i>
<i>just to be sure</i>

<i>that Jessie was safe from a man
who wound up attacking you.</i>

125
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,402
You say you'll do
whatever you want them to.

126
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,822
Just tell them a story
that they want to hear.

127
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:52,025
It's what I've been doing
since I got here.

128
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,527
Why?

129
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,529
Because these people
are children

130
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,414
and children like stories.

131

What happens after
all the nice words

132
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,536
and they still try
to kick him out?

133
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,955
They're guarding the armory now.

134
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,873
We still have knives.

138
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:18,552
I whistle.

139
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,722
Carol grabs Deanna,
I take Spencer,

140
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:25,859
you grab Reg, Glenn and Abraham
cover us, watch the crowd.

141
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:29,363
- We can talk to them.
- Yeah, we will.

142
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,232
If we can't get through,
we take the three of them

143
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,318
and say we'll slit
their throats.

144
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,819
Like at Terminus?

145
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,538
No, we just tell 'em.

146
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,075
They give us the armory
and it's over.

147
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,296
Did you want this?

148
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,799
No.

149
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,417
I hit my limit.

150
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,337
I-- I screwed up.

151
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,557
And here we are.

152
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,396
Now, if you'll excuse me,

153
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,264
I'm just gonna sleep some more.

154
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,375
Reg:<i> Maggie, hey.</i>
<i>She's out on the porch.</i>

155
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,765
What do you need
to talk about, Maggie?

156
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,467
The meeting tonight.

157
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,968
Maggie, if we could talk--

158
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,470
I want to talk to everyone
about what happened

159
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,105
and what we need to do about it.

160
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,307
If it includes
sending Rick away,

161
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,809
it's not gonna work.

162
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,977
Tell me what that means.

163
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:54,114
You let Rick in.
You let all of us in.

164
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:58,652
You talked to us.
You decided.

165
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,121
And now you want
to put that decision

166
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,572
on a group of very
frightened people

167
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,125
who might not have
the whole story.

168
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,743
That's not leadership.

169
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,162
Tonight is just a forum.

170
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,164
It's just for people
to say their piece.

171
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,551
And I'll make the decision as
I've done since the beginning.

172
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,837
He was frustrated.

173
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,340
The things he's seen.
The things he's lost.

174
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,008
The things we have all lost.

175
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,844
The things you've lost?

176
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,982
We've lost so much more.

177
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,902
Rick took a gun and he
pointed it at people.

178
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,520
He didn't pull the trigger.

179
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,106
That's a metric? That he
didn't pull the trigger?

180
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,444
- Yes.
- Michonne stopped him, Deanna.

181
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,862
Michonne did.

182
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,584
I'm gonna do what
I have to do, Maggie.

183
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,041
Maggie.

184
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,712
Look, Maggie.

185
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,687
The cavemen,

186
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,890
they were all nomads.

187
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:13,727
And they all died.

188
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:17,113
Then we evolved into this
and we lived.

189
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,035
Civilization starts
when we stop running.

190
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,704
When we live together.

191
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,241
When we stop sending people away

192
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:31,077
from the world
and from each other.

193
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,550
That's what I'm going
to tell her.

194
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,585
That's what I'm going
to tell everyone.

195
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,504
Okay?

196
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:48,154
(sighs)

197
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,079
Somebody came through
here a while ago.

198
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,031
If we see them, we hang back,

199
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:35,035
set up the mike,
watch and listen.

200
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:36,703
For how long?

201
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,256
Until we know.

202
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,342
We have to know.

203
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,711
You've sent people away?

204
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,296
Yeah.

205
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,966
What happened?

206
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,470
It was early on.

207
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,272
It was three people.

208
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:58,141
Two men and a woman.

209
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,979
Davidson was their leader.

210
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,365
Smart as hell, strong.

211
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,568
I thought they'd work out.

212
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,153
They didn't.

213
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,124
I brought them in
and I had to see them out.

214
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,161
So me, Aiden, and Nicholas,

215
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,165
we drove them out far...

216
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,587
gave them a day's worth
of food and water

217
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,139
and left them.

218
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,927
They just went?

219
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,562
We had their guns.

220
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,265
We had all the guns.

221
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,653
I can't make
that kind of mistake again.

222
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:47,774
Wake up.

223
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,450
It's good what happened
last night.

224
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,371
We have more cover now.

225
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,624
All of them think you've been
found out, that it's over.

226
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:15,852
Why didn't you want to tell
them we had more guns?

227
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:20,273
Michonne stopped you.
She knocked you out.

228
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,525
Well, I deserved it.

229
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,527
Well, it was stupid.

230
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,864
She's with us.
Glenn is.

231
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,984
I didn't tell them
about the guns just in case.

232
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,655
(sighs)

233
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,744
I don't want to lie anymore.

234
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,632
You said you don't want
to take this place.

235
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,500
And you don't want to lie?

236
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:53,139
Oh, sunshine,
you don't get both.

237
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,210
Aaron:
<i>What's he doing?</i>

238
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,045
Daryl:
<i>Wild leeks.</i>

239
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,967
Son of a bitch knows about how
to keep mosquitos off of him.

240
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:20,387
Come on.

241
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:41,324
Hey, Tobin.

242
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,076
Hey, Rick.

243
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,948
- You met with her?
- <i> Yeah.</i>

244
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,000
So what is it?

245
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:26,169
It's what we thought.

246
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,921
I'm gonna talk to people.

247
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:31,124
I'll talk to everyone
I can right up until.

248
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:33,126
I'm gonna try to solve this.

249
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,297
What?

250
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:44,971
What?

251
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,308
I love you.

252
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,563
We're gonna work it out.

253
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:55,282
I know it.

254
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,986
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

255
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,049
<i>(metal rattling)</i>

256
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:27,564
Sure you don't want
a gun, Father?

257
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,316
I just want a quick walk.

258
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:34,571
The word of God is the
only protection I need.

259
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:44,698
Carl:
<i>Dad.</i>

260
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,117
Hey.

261
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,536
You okay?

262
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,204
Yeah.

263
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,256
Look, I'm sorry.

264
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:55,208
I heard about the meeting.

265
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,010
You're staying home.

266
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:59,346
That's what it is now, right?

267
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:01,014
Home?

268
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,306
Yeah.

269
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:11,725
They need us.

270
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,693
They'll die without us.

271
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,651
I might have to threaten
one of them.

272
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:24,905
I could have
to kill one of them.

273
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:27,123
- You won't.
- I might.

274
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,627
You have to tell them.

275
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,579
I told them last night.

276
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,915
You have to tell them
so they can hear you.

277
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:40,887
I don't know if they can.

278
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,976
Does that make you afraid?

279
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:49,145
Just for them.

280
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:51,097
You have to tell them.

281
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,654
(walkers snarling)

282
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:08,248
We checked the forest,
we checked the roads.

283
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:11,284
We can't find him.

284
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:14,421
Sometimes they slip away.
It happens.

285
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:17,123
But...

286
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,459
you don't come across something
like this every day.

287
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:26,967
We do this now,
it means we're giving up.

288
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,888
Home is 50 miles back.
It's time to go.

289
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,557
You saw it last night.
There's bad people out here.

290
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,527
That's why we ought to keep
looking for the good ones.

291
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:42,065
We need more people
and we'll find them.

292
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:45,952
But when we do,
we'll need to feed them.

293
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,409
All right.

294
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,661
(metal ringing)

295
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:57,163

Huh.

Whoa.

300
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:59,225
(chuckles)

301
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,277
Wasn't sure I'd ever
see one of these.

302
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:08,451
Hey, listen, I don't
like giving up either,

303
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:12,072
but the guy is in a red poncho.

304
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:14,541
You can see him
from a mile away.

305
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,628
We've gone a lot of miles here.

306
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,547
No sign of him.

307
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,552
But...

308
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:29,639
if we come away with
a trailer full of cans,

309
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,641
I'd say that's a good trip.

310
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,144
Here we go.

311
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:42,519

312
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,790
Over here!

313
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:07,127
Daryl:
Come on!

314
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,108
- No!
- Come on.

315

Come on!
Go!

316

Glass will hold
for a while, right?

317
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,487
Maybe.

318
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:21,834
Maybe we can make it
so they can't see us.

319
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,455
In a couple hours,
something will come by,

320
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,758
they'll follow it out.

321
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,677
There's got to be something in
here we can use to block the view.

322
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,296
We can cut up these seats.

You treated her. You're a surgeon.
You need to do that.

00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:34,190
I could.

333
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:36,859
I will.

334
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:40,780
And then who would
believe I did it

335
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,531
because I didn't like you?

336
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,533
No one.

337
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:52,091
They'd believe
you tried to hurt me.

338
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:53,709
Definitely believe that.

339
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,711
(gasps)

340
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,717
Come at me.

341
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:08,274
<i>No?</i>

342
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:11,527
<i>Yeah?</i>

343
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,531
No.

344
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:20,569
The way this has played out,
you have a chance.

345
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,325
You're here.

346
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,244
Your wife's there.

347
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:38,671
You're a small, weak nothing.

348
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,925
And with the world how it is,

349
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:44,760
you're even weaker.

350
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:49,432
Play your cards right,

351
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,400
maybe you don't have to die.

352
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,656
And I want my dish back
clean when you're done.

353
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:11,170
Pete:
<i>This isn't my house.</i>

354
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:14,006
<i>(furniture crashes)</i>

355
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,375
<i>This isn't my house!</i>

00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,955

357
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,825

358
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:10,012
(sighs)

359
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,232
You should go.

360
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,351
I just wanted to check on you.

361
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:22,491
Your eye.

362
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,443
He did it right when
it was happening.

363
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,028
It wasn't you.

364
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:32,368
People shouldn't see us
talking right now.

365
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm not sorry I did it.

366
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,428
No matter what happens

367
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,263
or what I have to do.

368
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,934
Don't turn around, Rick.

369
00:32:52,557 --> 00:32:54,356
You were right.

370
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:18,110
(chuckles)

371
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:22,397
What?

372
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:28,204
I came out here to...

373
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,323
not feel all closed up
back there.

374
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,745
Even now,

375
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,880
this still feels more like me...

376
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,051
than back in them houses.

377
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:44,837
That's pretty messed up, huh?

378
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,058
You were trying.

379
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,679
I had to.

380
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,849
No, you didn't.

381
00:33:56,851 --> 00:34:00,903
Listen, I saw you with your
group out there on the road.

382
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,690
Then you went off
on your own by the barn.

383
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,194
Storm hit

384
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:10,530
<i>and you led your people</i>
<i>to safety.</i>

385
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:15,034
That was it.

386
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:17,370
I knew I had to bring
you people back.

387
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,208
<i>You were right.</i>

388
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,044
We should have kept looking
for that guy in the poncho.

389
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,765
I shouldn't have given up.

390
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,217
You didn't.

391
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,892
I'll go.

392
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,230
I'll lead them out.
You make a break for the fence.

393
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:49,452
No, no, no.
This was my fault.

394
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,871
It wasn't a question.

395
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,573
And this ain't your decision.

396
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,960
It ain't nobody's fault.

397
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,163
Just let me finish
my smoke first.

398
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:07,470
No. You don't
draw them away.

399
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,057
We fight.

400
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:13,643
We go for the fence.
We do it together.

401
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,396
All right?
Whether we make it or not,

402
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:18,264
we do it together.

403
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,733
We have to.

404
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,994
All right.

405
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,282
- You ready?
- Yeah.

406
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,919
We'll go on three.

407
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,257
One, two--

408
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,696
Come on.
Come on, get in here.

409
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,129
That was--

410
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,831
oh--

411
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,165
thank you.

412
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:31,087
I'm Aaron, this is Daryl.

413
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,843
Morgan.

414
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,096
Why?

415
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,183
Why?

416
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,602
Because all life
is precious, Daryl.

417
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,242
Whoever set that trap,
they're coming.

418
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,862
But I have good news.
We do.

419
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:58,865
We have a community
not too far from here.

420
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,784
<i>Walls, electricity, it's safe.</i>

<i>to come join us--</i>

422
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,204
I thank you.

423
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,759
But I'm on my way somewhere.

424
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,211
Fact is, I'm lost, so...

425
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,381
if you could tell me
where we are.

426
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,982

I'm ready.

Oh.
I'll come by later.

439
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,341
He's asleep.

440
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,345
He's asleep.
Sit.

Whoops.

443
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:25,467
Good afternoon.

444
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,446
Eugene:
<i>She saved my life.</i>

445
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,317
She also cracked open my gourd

446
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,154
to considering
implications I hadn't.

447
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,456
I will remark about
those at this time.

448
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,077
You got us here.

449
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:57,916
All I did was craft
a top-shelf lie

450
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,969
to which a person with strength and
heroism could apply their talents.

451
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,971
My bet was you needed that.

452
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,177
I thank you.

453
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:13,148
I am sorry.

454
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,101
And I mean both emphatically
and in equal measure.

455
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,617
I'm...

456
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:35,754
sorry, too.

457
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,923
Utterly and completely
unnecessary.

458
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:40,008
I almost killed you.

459
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:44,630
Yes, there's that.

460
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,196
You're back.

461
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:03,482
Good, just wanted
to sneak off to the meeting.

462
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:11,657
You think we could find
some time to talk later?

463
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,826
About Aiden?

464
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:15,494
Just some things I need to say

465
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,996
and I'm not sure
who I can say them to.

466
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:21,333
I don't really have
anyone here right now,

467
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:22,968
if you know what I mean.

468
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,970
I'll see.

469
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:28,474
Cool.

470
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,509

471
00:42:30,511 --> 00:42:32,594
- Yeah.

Carol, Daryl,

483

and me...

484
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:25,540
we worked it out together.

485
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:32,347
Carol took three guns
from the armory.

486
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:34,967
I still have one,
she still has one.

487
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:42,858
We lied to you because I
wasn't sure how you'd take it,

488
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,610

00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:59,374
Well, you did hit me
over the head.

492

That was for you, not them.

493

I was afraid you'd
talk me out of it.

494

You could've.

495

We don't need them here.

00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,915
I'm still with you.

501
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,873
Something's gonna happen.

502
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:52,260
Just don't make
something happen.

503
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:08,026
Don't be too long.

504
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,743

find yourself in a place</i>

<i>And if you let too much go</i>

507
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,333
<i>that's not gonna work.</i>

00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:35,887
<i>'Cause you're gonna be back</i>

Rick's voice:
<i>This is the real world, Bob.</i>

510
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:42,844
Bob's voice:
<i>Nah, this is a nightmare.</i>

511
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:44,846
<i>And nightmares end.</i>

I don't know what to do.

515

I'm losing my head.

516
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,729
Can you help me?

517
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:41,033
No.

518
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,737
(people chatting quietly)

519
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,466
We're going to start.

520
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,418
Can we wait?

521
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,086
There's still people coming.

522
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,403
Glenn, Rick.

523
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,814
We're going to start.

524
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:07,483
It's already dark.

525
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:11,153
We're going to talk
about what happened.

526
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,740
Not the fight.
Not what precipitated it.

527
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,708
We're dealing with that.

528
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,628
We're going to talk about
one of our constables,

529
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,331
Rick Grimes.

530
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:26,668
We're going to talk about how he had
a pistol he stole from the armory,

531
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,754
about how he pointed it at people.

532
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:31,507
<i>And we're going to talk</i>
<i>about what he said.</i>

533
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:33,725
I was hoping he'd be here.

534
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,844
She said he's coming.

535
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:37,930
I'm sure he'll be here.

536
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:40,432
And I'm sure we can
work this all out.

537
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:04,815
<i>(distant dog barking)</i>

538
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:20,131
I think I want to die.

539
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,470
Why wouldn't you want to die?

540
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,008
You don't deserve to be here.

541
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:35,596
What you did
can never be undone.

542
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:38,432
The dead don't choose,
but the choices you made,

543
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:40,735
how you sacrificed
your own--

544
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:45,740
I know what you're doing.

545
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,196
Bob was mutilated.

546
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:56,117
Consumed.

547
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,753
Destroyed because of your sins.

548
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,087
Stop it.

549
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:02,123
Your brother felt
he was apart from it.

550
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,958
He was a part of it.

551
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,426
He didn't deserve to be here.

552
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:07,094
- You don't!
- Stop it!

553
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:08,546
Stop it!

554
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:13,718

00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:26,030
and then not being
how you were out there...

00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,567
it can drive you crazy.

560

over and over.

572
00:52:21,232 --> 00:52:24,422
There's terrifying people out there.

573
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:27,041
And he rescued me from them.

577
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:42,440
I know what happened
last night was scary.

578
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:46,310
And I'm sure
he's sorry for that.

579
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,648
But maybe we should listen

Rick is a father, too.

597

He's a man with a good heart

598

who feels the things he does,

599
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,772
the things he has to do.

600

<i>And all of us</i>

<i>we're family now.</i>

604
00:55:02,878 --> 00:55:05,312
Rick started that.

605
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:07,248
And you won't stop it.

606
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,584
You can't.

607

<i>that family...</i>

Before we hear
from anyone else, I--

612
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,777
I would like to share something
in the spirit of transparency.

613
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:44,251
Father Gabriel came to see me
the day before yesterday

614
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:47,754
and he said our new arrivals

615
00:55:47,756 --> 00:55:49,823
can't be trusted,

616
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:51,758
that they were dangerous,

617
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,494
that they would put themselves
before this community.

618
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:59,032
And not one day later,

619
00:55:59,034 --> 00:56:02,535
Rick seemed to demonstrate
all the things

620
00:56:02,537 --> 00:56:04,503
Father Gabriel said.

621
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:09,909
I had hoped Gabriel
would be here tonight.

622
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:12,478
I don't see him here, Deanna.

623
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,547
So you're just saying
what someone said.

624
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:18,651
Did you tape him?

625
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:21,187
- He's not here.
- Neither is Rick.

626
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:28,393
Excuse me.

00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:45,019
Go.

666
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:49,957
I didn't bring it in.

667
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:53,894
It got inside on its own.

668
00:59:55,697 --> 00:59:57,598
They always will--

669
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,634
the dead and the living,

670
00:59:59,636 --> 01:00:02,036
because we're in here.

671
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:05,806
And the ones out there...

672
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:10,810
<i>...they'll hunt us.</i>

673
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:17,584
<i>They'll find us.</i>

674
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:21,921
<i>They'll try to use us.</i>

675
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:28,528
They'll try to kill us.

676
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,723
<i>But we'll kill them.</i>

677
01:00:58,024 --> 01:01:00,726
We'll survive.
I'll show you how.

678
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:05,764
You know,
I was thinking--

679
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,938
I was thinking how many
of you do I have to kill

680
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,107
to save your lives?

681
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:23,814
But I'm not gonna do that.

682
01:01:25,884 --> 01:01:28,786
You're gonna change.

683
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,159
I'm not sorry for what
I said last night.

684
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:40,331
I'm sorry for not
saying it sooner.

685
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:43,601
You're not ready,

686
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:45,202
but you have to be.

687
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:48,105
Right now, you have to be.

688
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:53,010
Luck runs out.

689
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:57,248
(footsteps approaching)

690
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,084
You're not one of us.
You're not one of us!

691
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:01,652
Pete, you don't want to do this.

692
01:02:01,654 --> 01:02:03,287
- Get the hell away from me, Reg.
- Pete, just stop.

693
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:05,990
- <i>Get away from me.</i>
<i>- Deanna: Reg. Reg.</i>

694
01:02:05,992 --> 01:02:07,591
(whispers) Not now.

695
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,593
- Get away. Get away!
- Now, Pete, stop. Pete--

696
01:02:09,595 --> 01:02:11,628
(Deanna screams)

697
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:17,834
- No, no! Oh, no, no!
- (gurgling)

698
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:21,605
- This is him!
- Shut up!

699
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:24,441
- This is him!
- <i>(Deanna sobbing) Oh, God!</i>

700
01:02:24,443 --> 01:02:28,144
Oh, my love.
My love, my love.

701
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:31,214
(sobbing)
No, my love, no.

702
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:35,051
No, my love.

703
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:36,986
Pete:
<i>It's him!</i>

704
01:02:36,988 --> 01:02:39,222
This is him!

705
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,029
Rick...

706
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,001
...do it.

707
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,504
- (gunshot)
- <i>(women scream)</i>

708
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:00,876
Morgan:
<i>Rick?</i>

709
01:03:14,512 --> 01:03:24,772
