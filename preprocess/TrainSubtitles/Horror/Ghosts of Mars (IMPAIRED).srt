Do I get a lawyer, or don't police

Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, sergeant.

She figures if I want to make
captain, I'll have to pay the price.

The thing is, I don't give a

I know you think you're

You've had the best training,
you have the best gear.

112
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,610
You probably think this is
a routine prisoner transfer.

113
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,483
But that's what I want
to bang into your heads.

114
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,693

What time is departure? We'll need at least
a half an hour to secure our prisoner.

You'll get used to it.

MELANIE: You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower

136
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,965
and they don't tell you
a one-year contract here

137
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,805

A penal camp full of
