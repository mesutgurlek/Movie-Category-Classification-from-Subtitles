00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,935
      and it's only             
      while the trouble lasts.  

113
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,469
       (ROBERT CHUCKLING)       
     What are you laughing at?  

114
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:06,737
 Leave him be, Robert.          

115
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:07,939
 Can't you see he's in love?    

116
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,941
        Aye, I'm not            
        ashamed of it, either.  

117
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:13,311
 A toast, lads,                 
 to the lovely                  
 women of Suffolk.              

118
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,012
          And may they          
          keep their beds warm  

119
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,114
        for General Cromwell's  
        gallant men.            

120
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:18,649
       (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)      

121
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,621
    Come on, boy. Nearly home.  

122
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,307
                   Well!        

123
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,593
     Master Marshall, welcome.  

124
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,128
 I trust you're well, sir.      

125
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,665
 My body is as strong as ever,  

126
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,467
        but the war continues?  

127
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,703
 Aye, we still fight.           
                And why...      

128
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,004
 Well,                          
 my company's recruiting.       

129
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,605
 I have two days' leave.        

130
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,908
         Then you must eat      
         with us this evening.  
 I thank you, sir.              

131
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,462
       We still have good food  
       for all you soldiers     
       take it from us.         

132
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,281
    And ale. Come,              
    we shall drink together.    

133
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,142
       After your experience,   

134
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,011
         it is likely           
         our village has grown  

135
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,812
         a little smaller       
         for you, eh, Richard?  

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,065
 Not so much smaller            
 as lacking in promise,         
 perhaps.                       

137
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:21,038
      In Ipswich or Cambridge,  
      a man might find          
      better opportunities.     

138
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,074
   Richard,                     
   if you took Sara to wife...  

139
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,226
  You mean,                     
  you'd give us your blessing?  

140
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:27,995
          You would take her    
          away from here?       

141
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,297
 You honor me, sir,             

142
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,282
 but I only have a small farm   
 that belonged to my father     

143
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,549
 and my soldier's pay,          
 which is...                    

144
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:36,670
     I am little concerned      
     with your ill kept lands.  

145
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:40,541
  And still less                
  for the silver you get        
  for killing good Christians.  

146
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:46,730
      Well, forgive me.         
      That was unjust.          

147
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,500
   But there is trouble         
   coming to this village       

148
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,236
    and I want Sara far away    
    before it arrives.          

149
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:56,140
 Surely Suffolk should be free  
 from the King's armies.        

150
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,010
 It's not only                  
 the King's armies              
 which bring death this year.   

151
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,514
 A lack of order in the land    
 encourages strange ideas.      

152
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,649
      You mean more rebellion?  

153
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:08,051
  I'm sorry,                    
  you have worries              
  enough already.               

154
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,589
 But give me your word          
 that you will soon take Sara   
 away from here                 

155
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,991
     and you shall ask          
     her consent tonight.       

156
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,177
              You have my word  
              on that, sir.     

157
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,112
   Good, Richard. Good.         

158
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,568
     That's right, my dear.     

159
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,320
      Master Richard Marshall.  

160
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,172
        Farm boy into soldier.  

161
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,791
        Welcome back,           
        Master Marshall.        

162
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,344
      I'm glad to be back,      
      Mistress Sara.            

163
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,781
 By the way, Sara,              
 I expect the meal              
 at the usual time.             

164
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,483
       (CHUCKLING) Yes, Uncle.  

165
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,687
   Your uncle                   
   has agreed to our marriage.  

166
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,791
             Richard.           

167
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,527
          (RICHARD LAUGHING)    

168
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:59,303
 Oh, the army has taught you    
 rough manners.                 

169
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,617
   Sara, why is he frightened?  

170
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,721
 There have been threats to us  
 since you were last here.      

171
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,122
               Threats? Why?    

172
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,457
 We've been called              
 papists and idolaters,         

173
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,959
 and filth                      
 chalked up on the walls.       

174
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,562
 They say                       
 we're King's creatures         

175
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,129
 and should be                  
 pilloried and worse.           

176
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,298
        Who says these things?  

177
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,133
 We've become outcasts          
 in our own village.            

178
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:35,306
                    Rest easy.  

179
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,042
   Now, no one shall harm you.  

180
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,645
        I put my oath to that.  

181
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,087
     Have you arranged a day    
     for the wedding, Richard?  

182
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,288
  No, sir.                      

183
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,657
 Much depends                   
 on how the armies move.        

184
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,626
    Remember, it must be soon.  

185
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,729
 But how certain                
 are your fears                 
 of this danger?                

186
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,866
       Perhaps just             
       an old man's bad dream,  

187
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,919
       and being an old man,    
       I must early to my bed.  

188
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:06,987
         Good night, my dear.   

189
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:08,622
       Good night, Uncle.       

190
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,193
 Oh, and Sara, remember to see  
 the doors are well bolted.     

191
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,594
                   Yes, Uncle.  

192
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,398
      And Richard,              
      don't keep Mistress Sara  
      up too late.              

193
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,866
        Country women           
        need full eight hours   
        in their beds           

194
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,703
     if they're to be           
     proper wives and mothers.  

195
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,038
       Goodnight, Cornet.       

196
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:26,407
 Goodnight, sir.                

197
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,285
   And will you                 
   make a proper wife           
   and mother, Sara?            

198
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,721
       I still have             
       much to learn, Richard.  

199
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,623
    I'll teach you.             

200
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,427
 Now,                           
 didn't your uncle just say     
 you must early to bed?         

201
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,495
                   He did.      

202
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,297
 And isn't he a wise man?       
                   He is.       

203
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,465
           Right.               

204
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,882
    How much further, Matthew?  

205
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,017
 You will not call me Matthew.  

206
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,220
 I'm not one of                 
 your drinking cronies,         

207
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,322
 carousing                      
 and wenching in the taverns.   

208
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,523
    Aye, you're not that, sir.  

209
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,409
       Remember, John Stearne,  
       you ride with me         

210
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,210
     only because               
     you help me in my work.    

211
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:11,895
     Oh, you call it work?      

212
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,581
     It's the Lord's work,      
     a noble thing...           

213
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,015
         And a profitable one.  

214
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,601
        The Good Lord           
        paying in silver        
        for every hanging.      

215
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,703
  That is blasphemy, Stearne.   
  Hold your tongue.             

216
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,706
    I'm merely an honest man    
    who helps you get           
    your confessions.           

217
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,792
    The law                     
    has prescribed due methods  
    of interrogation.           

218
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,028
       And I have been          
       blessed with the skills  
       to carry them out.       

219
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:31,064
     Oh, stop your gabbling.    
     We have work to do         
     in Brandeston.             

220
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,315
      Who is it this time?      

221
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,852
      The message               
      tells of a priest.        
             A priest?

   I love you very much.

 Shepherd, I seek two men.

 they call themselves.

 to be headed this way.

   Aye.                         

568
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:31,193
             I've heard         
             they're in Hoxne,  

569
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,563
      about four miles yonder,  
      but I can't be sure.      

570
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,164
 Thank you, Shepherd.

          give us a kiss.

          where he is, friend?

      what have you done?       
      Who was that?

00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,460
 Richard Marshall.              
                     Who?       

604
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:17,829
 He's married to the girl,      
 Sara.                          

605
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,263
          How did he find you?  

606
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:20,632
 He was looking for you.        

607
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:21,900
 He found out                   
 about Brandeston.              

608
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,134
   We're going to               
   have to separate.            

609
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,302
         I won't run from him.  

610
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:26,538
 We have work to do down south  
 in Lavenham.                   

611
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,506
 Not me. He's after our blood.  

612
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:31,175
  Seems to me he's already had  
  some of yours.                

613
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:33,144
 Well, he's not                 
 going to have any more,        
 you understand?                

614
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:34,512
 You're forgetting our powers.  

615
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,780
          He could be a witch.  

616
00:55:35,848 --> 00:55:38,149
  He's a man who's out          
  to kill both of us.           

617
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:43,020
    Then it appears to me       
    that we should take steps   
    to see to his death first.  

618
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,222
  Come. We travel to Lavenham.

        your feelings, Cornet,

00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,474
       but you're

       a soldier,               

621
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,976
       and desertion            
       is punishable by death.  

622
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,128
        However, in this case,  
        there are two factors   

623
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:28,432
      which will stay me        
      from subjecting you       
      to a full court-martial.  

624
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:31,369
 One,                           
 we are grouped here at Naseby  

625
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:34,372
       in preparation           
       for a major assault      
       on the Royalist armies.  

626
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:36,774
 We need every man we can get.  

627
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:39,878
        And you're              
        a pretty good soldier,  
        most of the time.       

628
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:41,963
    Thank you, sir.             

629
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,883
   Secondly, I would sleep ill  
   if I had to                  
   send to the gallows          

630
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:47,868
  a man who had saved my life.  

631
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:50,788
   But, Cornet, remember this.  

632
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:54,492
           If you should leave  
           your command again,  

633
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,130
 I will have no alternative     
 but to throw the whole weight  
 of military law against you.   

634
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,398
                   Understand?  

635
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:01,433
       Yes, sir.                

636
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:03,985
            Dismissed, Cornet.  

637
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:12,443
          And may God help you  
          in your search,       
          Cornet Marshall.      

638
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:31,929
                Robert, hello.  

639
00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:33,732
 Richard, you're back.          
                         Aye.   

640
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:35,183
             What happened      
             with the Captain?  

641
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,535
                  Nothing.      

642
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,304
 I heard about Brandeston,      
 Richard.                       

643
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:42,089
   Hopkins and Stearne.         

644
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:43,925
     I'll find them somewhere.  

645
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:45,393
 But what can you do?           

646
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:47,729
    What proof have you         
    that they                   
    committed any crime?        

647
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,364
   I've got Sara's word on it.  

648
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,115
    Is that enough              
    for the magistrates?        

649
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:52,917
         There'll be no         
         magistrates involved.  

650
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:54,619
      What do you mean?         

651
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,308
   We'll talk more later,       
   Richard.                     

652
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,844
        We must be on our way.  

653
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:05,246
            We're after horses  
            for this skirmish   
            that's coming up.   

654
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:06,347
                    All right.  

655
00:58:06,414 --> 00:58:08,415
            Hup. Come on. Hup.  

656
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:26,467
  Parliament men,               
  comrades of friend Marshall.  

657
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:28,986
 There's some good ones         
 coming now, look.              

658
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:30,505
                 Hey!           

659
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,840
 Let's make a run for it,       
 shall we, while we can.        
                   Be calm.     

660
00:58:32,908 --> 00:58:34,242
 Yeah, but if they find out     
 who we are, they'll...         

661
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,143
          They won't. Come on.  

662
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,093
     That's a fine horse        
     you've got there, friend.  

663
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,162
 ROBERT: The army needs mounts  
 of such caliber.               

664
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,346
        I am not selling.       

665
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:57,214
   But you will get your money  
   when the war's over.         

666
00:58:57,282 --> 00:59:00,268
        You don't appear        
        to understand.          
        I am not selling.       

667
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,287
  Oh,                           
  but you are selling, friend.  

668
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:04,205
        And we'll take          
        that one, there, too.   

669
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:07,125
        So you filthy soldiers  
        can butcher my mare?    

670
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:10,328
        Sergeant, he thinks     
        we're filthy soldiers.

 is a little army discipline.   

674

           I really can't say.

                  Of course.

           manage without him,  

732
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:25,225
    but I intend to instigate   
    a new method of execution,  

733
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:30,831
         and you, Master Webb,

   Now,                         
   fetch that young pair here.  

739
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,844
    Sir.                        

740
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,010
 An excellent meal, gentlemen.  

741
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,699
          There is little       
          I find so satisfying  

742
01:05:05,767 --> 01:05:08,134
  as good food                  
  after a well-earned victory.  

743
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:10,070
           Wouldn't you agree?  
            Entirely, General.  

744
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:13,356
The conflict at Naseby,         
sir, will go down               
as a triumph of your strategy.  

745
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:14,691
                Perhaps.        

746
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:16,459
             I would rather     
             that it went down  

747
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:18,579
            as a triumph        
            for the forces      
            of true godliness.  

748
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:21,781
      Nevertheless,             
      your name will symbolize  
      the victory, sir.         

749
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:23,867
          Whether I like it     
          or not, eh, Captain?  

750
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:37,381
      That cornet you so        
      highly recommended        
      to me, is he to join us?  

751
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:38,782
             He's coming now,   
             General Cromwell.  

752
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:40,149
                       Good.    

753
01:05:40,217 --> 01:05:43,987
        Amongst the most        
        pleasurable aspects     
        of victory, gentlemen,  

754
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:47,156
 is the opportunity it affords  
 to reward valor.               

755
01:05:47,224 --> 01:05:49,476
               It ranks almost  
               with good food.  

756
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:51,878

757
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:54,614
               Mmm. All right.  
               Rest, Cornet.    

758
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,606
     Your captain               
     has told me about you.     

759
01:06:02,673 --> 01:06:04,240
     He says you're             
     a good soldier.            

760
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,476
 Thank you, sir.                

761
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:09,012
      He recommends             
      that I promote you        
      to captain.               

762
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:10,597
 I thank you, sir.              

763
01:06:10,664 --> 01:06:14,234
     I have a special           
     mission for you, Captain.  

764
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:17,403
      Take three men            
      and ride back             
      into East Anglia.         

765
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,005

766
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,941
    and is rumoredto be making  
    for the Norfolk coast.      

767
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:24,411
        If that is the case,    
        find and apprehend him  

768
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:26,529
       before he can escape     
       to the continent.        

769
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:27,630
 It's an honor, sir.            

770
01:06:27,698 --> 01:06:30,267
 Pick your men. Start at once.  

771
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:34,587
     If you find the King,      
     you will escort him then   
     to Norwich.                

772
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,790
  If not, join us in the west.  

773
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:39,042
       Good luck, Captain.      

774
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:51,771
 Shall we rest up               
 for the night, Richard?        

775
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,574
        We've got a job to do.  
        We'll go on             
        till we've done it.     

776
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,743
 Do you mean                    
 looking for the King?          

777
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:59,245
 Or finding                     
 Hopkins and Stearne?           

778
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:01,081
             Both.              

779
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:03,450
 Richard, you can't go off      
 and desert again.              

780
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,218
    I don't plan to desert!     

781
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:08,088
 But supposing you do find out  
 where they are?                

782
01:07:08,155 --> 01:07:09,756
      Then I shall take         
      temporary leave again.    

783
01:07:09,824 --> 01:07:12,375
    For God's sake, Richard,    
    I know how you feel,        

784
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:16,413
 but to risk court-martial      
 to kill                        
 Parliament's own appointees,   

785
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,914
 you'll be hanged yourself.     

786
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:22,218
   Robert! I've taken an oath.  
   I won't break it!            

787
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:23,503
      It's madness!             

788
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:24,671
         It's justice!          

789
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:27,707
      It's my justice.          

790
01:07:32,046 --> 01:07:33,680
  HORSE SELLER: And what about  
  one of them, sir?             

791
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:35,982
      You won't find            
      better horseflesh         
      in the whole of Suffolk.  

792
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,936
 So, how much you going to try  
 to drag out of me              
 if I take that one?            

793
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:41,604
 He's yours                     
 for a couple of guineas, sir.  

794
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:42,806
    A guinea.                   

795
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:44,274
           A guinea and a half  

796
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:45,541
  for getting me                
  out of bed                    
  at this hour of the morning.  

797
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:46,709
  One guinea.                   

798
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:47,844
              And a quarter?    

799
01:07:47,912 --> 01:07:49,312
  I'll quarter you.             

800
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,914
          You drive             
          a hard bargain, sir.  

801
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:52,149
     Yeah.                      

802
01:07:52,216 --> 01:07:53,650
              And where would   
              you be heading    

803
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:55,118
         that you need a horse  
         in such a hurry?       

804
01:07:55,186 --> 01:07:57,687
 To find my partner.            
             Your partner, eh?  

805
01:07:57,755 --> 01:08:00,023
     And what line of business  
     might you be in?           

806
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:02,092
    God's business,             
    witch-finding.              

807
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,227
              Witch-finding.    
              Oh, that's nice.  

808
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:05,728
             That's very nice.  

809
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:09,465
 You wouldn't make it a guinea  
 and a quarter, would you?      

810
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:12,302
       Do you know a man        
       called Matthew Hopkins?  

811
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:14,304
 You know where he is?          

812
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:16,873
     I heard tell               
     of such a man down south.  

813
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:18,175
          Lavenham, I believe.  

814
01:08:18,242 --> 01:08:20,110
  What's he doing in Lavenham?  

815
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:22,578
       Extracting confessions,  
       I don't doubt.           

816
01:08:22,646 --> 01:08:25,615
 You let me have                
 that four-legged cripple now!  

817
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,652
 This happened three days ago.  
 Why didn't you report it       
 to the militia then?           

818
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,787
      How should we know        
      it was the King himself?  

819
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:49,489
 A stranger,                    
 obviously a townsman,          

820
01:08:49,557 --> 01:08:51,458
 tries to hire a boat           
 to cross to France             

821
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:52,726
 and you suspect nothing?       

822
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,477
       When the country's       
       torn by civil war?       

823
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:55,879
            I didn't know       
            there was a war on  

824
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:57,563
         till you               
         gentlemen told me so.  

825
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,266
 Oh, come on, Richard.          
 We'd better go back.           

826
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,185
 Aye, I suppose so.             
 I want to pass through         
 Lavenham and see how Sara is.  

827
01:09:02,253 --> 01:09:04,721
              Lavenham?         
 Aye, how far is it from here?  

828
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:06,272
          About two days ride,  
          I reckon.             

829
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,941
         They got more          
         excitement over there  

830
01:09:08,008 --> 01:09:09,609
           than any of your     
           city folk's wars.    

831
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,562
     What do you mean?          
        They're burning         
        witches there, I hear.  

832
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,830
          Some such rigmarole.  

833
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,482
      They're in Lavenham!      

834
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,700
        (RICHARD URGING HORSE)  

835
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:18,401
              Oy! Richard!

          (SCREAMING)           

837
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:02,028
         Elizabeth! Elizabeth!  

838
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:04,498
            Oh, God!            

839
01:10:06,617 --> 01:10:08,284
 All is ready, Master Hopkins?  

840
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:09,819
                  Aye.          

841
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,271
 Proceed with the executions,   
 then.                          

842
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:17,811
  Bring forth Elizabeth Clark.  

843
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,897
 (WOMAN SCREAMING)              
       Right.                   
       Siegel, fetch the rope.  

844
01:10:28,272 --> 01:10:29,772
          MAN 1: Get the rope.  

845
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,891

 come on, you little bitch!     

846
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:44,237
              No! Help!         

847
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:46,472
                No!             

848

                 (SCREAMING)    

849
01:11:31,035 --> 01:11:32,068
                 No!            

850
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:05,151
        Lower away.             

851
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:06,619
 Slowly, now. Keep her slow.    

852
01:12:32,163 --> 01:12:34,130
             Elizabeth!         

853
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:51,697
 Master Hopkins,                
 there are two more             
 to be burned.                  

854
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:55,618
      Yes, Magistrate.          
      Master Webb, the others!  

855
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:27,767
     Here you are,              
     12 guineas in silver.      

856
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:30,403
    To be spent in the service  
    of our Lord, Magistrate.    

857
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,872
    We must thank you           
    for your good work,         
    Master Witchfinder.         

858
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,474
        Thank you, Magistrate,  
        for your aid.           

859
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:46,035
    Witchfinder!                

860
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:47,053
           Greetings, Stearne.  

861
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,421
 Is that all                    
 you've got to say              

862
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:49,923
 after leaving me there         
 with Cromwell's men?           

863
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:52,425
      Well, I provided us both  
      with the opportunity      
      to escape.                

864
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:54,277
 Only you did                   
 and I was captured.            

865
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:57,414
     Fortunes of war, Stearne.  

866
01:13:57,481 --> 01:14:01,701
You know me well enough         
to know that I wouldn't         
hesitate to fire and kill you.  

867
01:14:01,768 --> 01:14:03,469
 Aye, you would that.           

868
01:14:03,537 --> 01:14:08,040
 I hold all human life dearly,  
 Stearne, especially my own.    

869
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,442
 Oh, come now.                  

870
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,511
 You've escaped                 
 and all is well.               

871
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:13,146
                      Maybe.    

872
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:15,414
     I even saved               
     your share of the pay      

873
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,617
    even though I did           
    all of the work myself.     

874
01:14:17,684 --> 01:14:20,854
 Now,                           
 are you going to be sensible   
 or do I kill you?              

875
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,107
 By the way, do you know        
 what they call me now?         

876
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:26,476
                         What?  

877
01:14:26,544 --> 01:14:28,478
      Witchfinder General.      

878
01:14:28,546 --> 01:14:29,912
 There are those who think      

879
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,315
      that I should be          
      appointed such            
      for all of England,       

880
01:14:32,383 --> 01:14:34,350
  appointed by Parliament.      

881
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:36,919
                   Here! Look.  

882
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:40,206
 Sara. She's here.              

883
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:41,491
       Very nice, eh, Matthew?  

884
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:42,575
    No, you fool.               

885
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:44,610
 Don't you realize              
 that if she's here,            

886
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:46,612
 that trooper                   
 must be around, too?           

887
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,148
       But he's away fighting.  

888
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:50,716
    Suppose he got leave        
    after Naseby.               

889
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:52,852
  Where do you think he'd go?   
  To see her, of course.        

890
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,387
          We better move along  
          then, eh?             
               No.              

891
01:14:54,454 --> 01:14:56,989
    That man, Marshall,         
    is not going to give up.    

892
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:59,091
         He's proved            
         that to us already.    

893
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:00,710
