00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,003
You got a hell of
an infection there.

165
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,938
You could die from
blood poisoning.

166
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,074
[Laughing]

167
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,843
Oh, man.

168
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,644
Wouldn't that be the way?

169
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,779
World gone to hell...

170
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:57,581
The dead risen up
to eat the living...

171
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,686
And Theodore Douglas gets
done in by a cut on his arm.

172
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,055
Yeah, that would
be-that would be stupid.

173
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,090
I-I've been saying
since yesterday,

174
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:09,626
we gotta-we gotta get you
some antibiotics.

175
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,828
We've been ransacking
these cars the whole time.

176
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:14,164
I can't believe that we have
not found some ampicillin,

177
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:17,267
or-or something
in the-in the whole place.

178
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,070
Can you?
Seems like there would be.

179
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:23,006
Well, that's what I think.

180
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,775
Well...

181
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,511
We, uh, we haven't
been thorough enough.

182
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:31,681
So, let's look some more.

183
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,829
Why'd I let him come with us?

184
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,998
I should've sent him with Lori.

185
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,467
You know, you start that,

186
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,069
you never get that monkey
off your back.

187
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,709
Little girl goes missing,
you look for her.

188
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,778
Simple.

189
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,547
You said, "call it--
Head back."

190
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,315
Doesn't matter what I said.

191
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,216
Carl got shot because
I wouldn't cut bait.

192
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,017
It should be me in there.

193
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,321
[Chuckling]

194
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:54,859
You've been there,
partner, right?

195
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,028
And you pulled through--
So will he.

196
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,597
Is that why I got
outta that hospital?

197
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,032
Found my family for it
to end here, like this?

198
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,469
This kind of
s-sick joke?

199
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:07,871
You stop it.

200
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,440
Just stop.

201
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,878
A little girl goes missing...

202
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:20,449
You look for her--
It's plain and simple.

203
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:26,656
[Door opens] Rick...

204
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,858
He needs blood.
[Carl crying]

205
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,927
You, hold him down.

206
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:35,229
- Dad!
- I got him.

207
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,134
[Screams]

208
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,236
Almost there.

209
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,972
[Screams]
Stop-- You're killin' him!

210
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:47,141
Rick, do you want him to live?

211
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,476
[Crying]

212
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:52,379
- He needs blood.
- Do it now!

213
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,886
[Grunting]

214
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:05,191
[Crying stops]

215
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,962
- Wait-wait, hey.

216
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,432
He just passed out.

217
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:26,745
One down...

218
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,547
Five to go.

219
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,651
[Air pumping]

220
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,424
[Air hissing]

221
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,497
Pressure's stable.

222
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,101
Lori needs to be here.

223
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,836
She doesn't even know
what's goin' on.

224
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,704
I got-I gotta go find her,
bring her back.

225
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,273
- You can't do that.
- She's his mother!

226
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,208
She needs to know
what's happened.

227
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,111
Her son's lying here, shot.

228
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,747
And he's going to
need more blood.

229
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,615
He can't go more than
50 feet from this bed.

230
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,622
Hey, hey.

231
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:18,058
Come on.
I'm all right.

232
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm all right--
I got him.

233
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,305
He's stable, for now.

234
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:38,911
Lori has to be here, Shane--
She has to know.

235
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,646
Okay, I get that.

236
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,882
I'm gonna handle it...

237
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,151
But you've gotta
handle your end.

238
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,752
- My-my end?

239
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,289
Your end is being here,
for your son.

240
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,726
Even if he didn't need
your blood to suRVive,

241
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,394
there is no way I'd ever
let you walk out that door.

242
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,798
Man, I-I'd break your legs
if you tried.

243
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:03,033
I mean, you know that, right?

244
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,505
If something happened to him
and you weren't here...

245
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:17,914
If-if he slipped away
while you were gone,

246
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:20,382
you would never forgive
yourself for that,

247
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,819
and neither would Lori, man.

248
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,561
You're right.

249
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:36,131
When was I ever wrong?

250
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,633
[Laughs]

251
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:46,406
You know, when...

252
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,610
When you were in that hospital,

253
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:53,714
the one you were never
supposed to leave, man...

254
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,250
You should've seen Lori.

255
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,989
She was like--

256
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,325
The strength of that woman...

257
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:09,629
You can't imagine it.

258
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:13,166
See-see, that's what
you gotta have now.

259
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:16,635
I mean, Carl,
he needs that from you.

260
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:19,204
So, you wire yourself
tight, my friend.

261
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:22,141
- Hmm?
- You hear?

262
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,876
You've got the hard part.

263
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,511
You just leave the
rest to me, okay?

264
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,680
- All right.
- All right.

265
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,983
[Door opens]

266
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,821
He's out of danger
for the moment,

267
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,157
but I need to remove those
remaining fragments.

268
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,658
How?

269
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,026
You saw how he was.

270
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,828
I know, and that was
the shallowest one.

271
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,497
I need to go deeper
to get the others.

272
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:48,666
- Oh, man <i>.</i>
<i>- There's more.</i>

273
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,501
Tell me.

274
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,903
His belly's distended,
his pressure's dropping,

275
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,839
which means there's
internal bleeding.

276
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:58,676
A fragment must have nicked
one of the blood vessels.

277
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:05,214
I have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

278
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,383
And he can't move
while I'm in there.

279
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,118
I mean, at all.

280
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,821
If he reacts
the same as before,

281
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:14,557
I'll sever an artery
and he'll be dead in minutes.

282
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,729
To even try this,
I have to put him under.

283
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,064
But if I do,

284
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,034
he won't be able
to breathe on his own.

285
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,203
Same bad results.

286
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,342
- What'll it take?
- You need a respirator.

287
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,211
What else?
The tube that goes with it,

288
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,447
extra surgical supplies,
drapes, sutures.

289
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:42,083
If you had all that,
you could save him?

290
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,185
If I had all that, I could try.

291
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,022
Nearest hospital went up
in flames a month ago.

292
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,658
The high school.
That's what I was thinkin'.

293
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,861
They set up
a FEMA shelter there.

294
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,795
They would have
everything we need.

295
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,464
Place was overrun
last time I saw it.

296
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:59,099
You couldn't get near it--
Maybe it's better now.

297
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,605
I said, leave the rest to me.

298
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,007
Is it too late
to take that back?

299
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,543
- I hate you goin' alone.
- Come on.

300
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:14,013
Doc, why don't you do me
a list, draw me a map.

301
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,718
You won't need a map--
I'll take you there.

302
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,521
- Ain't but five miles.
- Otis, no.

303
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,390
Honey, we don't have
time for guesswork

304
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,358
and I'm responsible.

305
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,725
I ain't gonna sit here
while this fella

306
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,928
takes this on alone.

307
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,098
I'll be all right.
Are you sure about this?

308
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,700
Do you even know
what any of the stuff

309
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,368
he's talking about looks like?

310
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,737
- Come to think, no.
- I've been a volunteer EMT.

311
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,406
I do.

312
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,306
Now, we can talk about this
'till next Sunday,

313
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,108
or we could just
go do it real quick.

314
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,976
I'll take right quick.

315
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,945
I should thank you.

316
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,914
Wait 'till that boy of
yours is up and around,

317
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,816
then we'll talk.

318
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,118
I'll gather some things.

319
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,121
Where is she--
Your wife?

320
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,365
We'll lose the light
before too long.

321
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,669
I think we should call it.
Let's head back.

322
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,369
We'll pick it up

00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,485
Ma'am, it was an accident.

490
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,886
I'll take that under
advisement later.

491
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:25,988
For now, he's the idiot
who shot our son.

492
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,690
Lori, they're doing
everything they can

493
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:28,691
to make it right.

494
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,058
Okay, as soon as they get back

495
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:31,994
you can perform this surgery?

496
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,196
I'll certainly do my best.

497
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:37,231
Okay... I mean, you've
done this procedure before?

498
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,934
Well, yes, in a sense.

499
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,969
In a sense?

500
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,137
Honey, we don't have the luxury

501
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,872
of shopping for a surgeon.

502
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,441
No, I understand that.

But, I mean, you're
a doctor, right?

504
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,213
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

517
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:09,318
across the way?

518
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:14,456
That's where we gotta get to?

519
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:16,792
Yeah.

520
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:20,996
I won't do it.

We can't just leave.

522
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,799
Carol, the group is split.

523
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,268
We're scattered and weak.

524
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,905
What if she comes back
and we're not here?

525
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,606
It could happen.

526
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,942
If Sophia found her way
back and we were gone,

527
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,043
that would be awful.

528
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:38,445
Okay.

529
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,547
We gotta plan for this.

530
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:43,083
I say tomorrow morning is
soon enough to pull up stakes.

531
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,352
Give us a chance
to rig a big sign,

532
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,788
leave her some supplies.

533
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,024

staying then I'm--

You're going.

Why is it always me?

543
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,143
You have to find this farm,
reconnect with our people

544
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,978
and see what's going on--
But most important,

545
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,846
you have to get
t-dog there.

546
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,781
This is not an option.

547
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,117
That cut has gone
from bad to worse.

548
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:22,020
He has a very serious
blood infection.

549
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:23,854
Get him to that farm.

550
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,423
See if they have
any antibiotics.

551
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,960
Because if not,
t-dog will die, no joke.
