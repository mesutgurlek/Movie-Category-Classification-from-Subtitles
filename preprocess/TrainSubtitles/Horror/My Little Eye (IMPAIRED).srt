1
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:38,000
(Dialling tone)

2
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:42,085
(Modem dialling)

3
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:46,642
(lnternet data transfer noises)

4
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,159
(Beep)

5
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,758
Hi, I'm Emma and I'm 23 years old

6
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,526
and, er, I want to come live in your house.

7
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,795
Hi, I'm Matt.

8
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:32,803
Uh, hi, my name is Danny.

9
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:36,522
Charlie. Just Charlie. Like Madonna.

10
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:38,526
Rex.

11
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:41,479
Um, I'd like to be on the show because...

12
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:43,438
I wanna get famous.

13
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:46,445
- The prize is still a million dollars?
- The challenge.

14
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,047
For the experience, to learn about myself.

15
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,043
Grow as a person and all that bullshit.

16
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,557
- Why should you pick me?
- You should pick me cos...

17
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,643
Um...

18
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,917
I'm a fucking people-person.

19
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,286
Um...

20
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,318
Why should you choose me?

21
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:05,803
- I'm a team player.
- What do I think about the rules?

22
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,439
Nightly curfew?

23
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:11,685
If it's a house in the middle of nowhere,
why the need to break the curfew?

24
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:17,324
Stay indoors when we're sleeping
and go out during the day. It's not hard.

25
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:23,044
Well, er, usually I don't like rules but,
you know, these ones don't bother me.

26
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:27,080
I think I could stick to the rules
for a million dollars, yeah.

27
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,486
(Rex) Hey, check it out.

28
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:39,280
I think we're being watched.

29
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:48,807
(Matt) Fantastic.
(Charlie) Get up!

30
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,204
Good morning.

31
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,602
This'll be of interest to some of you.

32
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:02,525
(Playful shouting)

33
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:06,838
(Emma) Morning, Matt.

34
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,078
You guys definitely waste food.

35
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:13,595
(Charlie) I miss fresh fruit.

36
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,883
Are you gonna eat those?

37
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:19,487
Go nuts.

38
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,238
You know what I miss?

39
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,679
The ocean.

40
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:27,287
I'm missing June - my social worker.

41
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,717
June, if you're watching this, I miss you.

42
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,758
(Charlie) I miss shops.

43
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,275
When we get out, we'll look so yesterday.

44
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,399
Next week,
we'll have plenty of money for new stuff.

45
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,358
Hear, hear.

46
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:44,322
What do you miss, Emma?

47
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,881
Intelligent conversation.

48
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:50,759
(Charlie) Amen, sister.
(Danny) I miss my grandpa.

49
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,558
Oh, grandpa!

50
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:57,998
What? I'm gonna take him
on vacation when we get back.

51
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,720
And I've missed my friends.

52
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:04,521
Although I'd like to think
I've made some new ones.

53
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,841
Ayy!

54
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,117
(Danny) Probably just a coyote.

55
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,556
(Rex) Yeah, it's always a damn coyote.

56
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,838
I hate this house.
Fucking creepy-ass house.

57
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,198
What is it? You see anything?

58
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,556
No. Nothing, as usual.

59
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,645
(Camera lens whirring)

60
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,038
(Animal howling)

61
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,878
(Snoring)

62
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,438
(Whispering)

63
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,717
(Charlie) You do think he's cute, right?

64
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,359
(Emma) He's cute.

65
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:15,398
(Charlie) So?

66
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,398
(Emma) So?

67
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:23,319
So I'd prefer my intimate moments
to be intimate moments.

68
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:26,955
It's not a porn site.

69
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:30,443
You could always do it
under the covers or in the den.

70
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,921
- The freezer!
- (Laughs)

71
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,436
I don't know, there's just...

72
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,478
There's something.

73
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,120
He's just so intense all the time.

74
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,405
Oh, yeah.

75
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:50,156
He's a guy, and it's been six months
that he's been here,

76
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,756
he's really fucking horny,
he'd fuck a hole in the wall!

77
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:55,684
Shh!

78
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,602
(Alarm siren)

79
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,319
(Alarm stops)

80
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:22,802
(Rex) OK. Let's take a look.

81
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,725
(Emma) It's definitely cold in the house.

82
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,122
(Rex) Nobody brought the flashlight, huh?

83
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,762
- What do I do with the clicker thingy?
- I'm fine.

84
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:35,595
- (Click)
- (Rex) You motherfuckers.

85
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:40,437
This is deliberate, they're putting
the squeeze on us. Look at this.

86
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:44,719
Everything has to have an angle with you.
Maybe it just broke down.

87
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,406
- So what do we do?
- (Rex) I don't know.

88
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:51,884
- Start a fire.
- Yeah, there's no dried firewood outside.

89
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:56,045
No, but there's plenty of dry shit in the attic.
We can chop some of that up.

90
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,078
Go to work, boys.

91
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,957
Oh, God! Smells like piss in here.

92
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,798
(Coughs)

93
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:17,726
Looks like mommy and daddy
liked to keep the kiddies in the cupboard.

94
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,758
What parent would do that?

95
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,004
They must have been
talking to my stepfather.

96
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:27,404
- (Doll) Take cover!
- I always wanted a talking one.

97
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,836
Oh, Emma. Yes, Matt?

98
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,878
Oh, Emma. Matt?

99
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,566
Emma. Matt. Emma. Emma! Emma!

100
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:37,724
Oh, Emma! Oh, Matt! Oh, Emma! Oh, Matt!

101
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,327
Matt, wait! Wait! What? What? Matt! What?

102
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,358
That's my ass.

103
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:46,719
- I know, Emma. I know.
- Grow up, Rex.

104
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,919
Don't give me that nice-guy bullshit.
You don't wanna fuck?

105
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,958
Oh, Matt... Matt...

106
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,596
you don't have a dick!

107
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,923
Why don't you... You don't have a dick?

108
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,437
- You wanna talk small dicks?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:05,284
Charlie talked to Emma.

110
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,238
Take cover!

111
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,482
- Yeah.
- (Sniggers)

112
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,802
What the fuck are you laughing at?

113
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,078
(Camera lens whirring)

114
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,482
(Camera whirring)

115
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:47,917
(Camera whirring)

116
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,960
Today's the first day of
the rest of your life as a nonsmoker.

117
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,478
(Owls hooting)

118
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:59,156
Jesus, I have never heard
so many fucking owls.

119
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:02,085
You think they have a tape out there?

120
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,836
So, I'm thinking,

121
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:09,878
when we get back,

122
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,203
are we gonna get mobbed or what?

123
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:17,396
- Have to go into hiding?
- (Charlie) Have a stalker?

124
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,642
- Hmm?
- Ooh, yeah.

125
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:23,236
You knowthe number one cause
of most stalkings?

126
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:26,120
- Forgetfulness.
- Forgetfulness?

127
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,765
People forgetting to close their curtains.

128
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,843
Their curtains?

129
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:37,166
I read about this one lady who used to walk around
inside her house at night,

130
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:40,199
buck naked, lights on, curtains wide open.

131
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:45,638
She was always forgetting to close them
because her property overlooked woods.

132
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,837
No one out there, right?

133
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,398
Only there was.

134
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:53,722
This stalker guy.

135
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:57,965
Just watching those bright,
welcoming windows every night.

136
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:04,283
He started to think she didn't shut them
because she wanted him to see in,

137
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,887
that she was inviting him into her life.

138
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:10,044
So he started
this fantasy relationship with her,

139
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,726
all built out of little things like,

140
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:16,760
when she'd hang her laundry out -
that was like a love token,

141
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,438
an offering.

142
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,036
So he'd steal her panties.

143
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:27,319
And getting more and more intimate,
this love affair in his head.

144
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,437
Finally, one night he breaks in.

145
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:34,800
Only when he meets her, he meets a stranger.

146
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,442
An upset stranger freaking out,
wanting him to get out.

147
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:41,126
He thinks she's just playing hard to get

148
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,761
so he asserts himself.

149
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:45,798
Rapes her.

150
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:49,919
Strangles her to keep her from screaming.

151
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,476
Thanks, Matt.

152
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,518
(Charlie) Yeah, thanks.

153
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,161
Now I suddenly feel all on display.

154
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,040
How can you suddenly feel all on display?

155
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:04,124
It's like hello? Hello? Hello?

156
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:09,599
On the web is one thing,
outside my window is another.

157
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:13,845
Don't worry. Statistically,
strangers rarely kill strangers.

158
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:18,436
You're much more likely to be killed
by somebody you know.

159
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,242
A kid I was at school with killed his parents.

160
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,278
(Rex) No shit!

161
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,318
What happened there?

162
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,442
He used a hammer.

163
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,717
He beat them to death.

164
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,956
(Charlie) Jesus. That's a little harsh.

165
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,077
Who was he? Did you know him?

166
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,562
(Rex) Give it up, Emma.

167
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,885
I can't really remember,
I moved away before it happened.

168
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,238
What was his name?

169
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,959
- (Bang)
- Fuck.

170
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,518
(Matt) Probably just the wind.

171
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,078
(Banging)

172
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,441
(Lens whirring, door banging)

173
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,722
(Wind whistling)

174
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,278
(Clunk)

175
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,117
(Fluttering)

176
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,398
(Door creaks)

177
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,716
(Birds calling)

178
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:04,919
(Static, scratching and crackling)

179
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,678
(Echoing tapping)

180
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,006
(Clattering and rustling)

181
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,925
(Static buzzing)

182
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,836
- (Clunking)
- What is that?

183
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,245
(Buzzes)

184
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,438
(Camera whirring)

185
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,559
Matt. Matt.

186
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,245
- (Crash)
- Aah!

187
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,164
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm sorry.

188
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:39,120
Danny, there's someone upstairs. In the attic.

189
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,920
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,003
All right.

191
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,359
Let's go.

192
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,796
(Heavy breathing)

193
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,124
(Crackling)

194
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:59,477
- It's coming from up there.
- (Clattering)

195
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,558
(Crackling)

196
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,002
- (Squawking)
- (Girls screaming)

197
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,117
(Squawking, loud flapping)

198
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:51,477
Jesus!

199
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,558
(Cawing)

200
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,438
It's OK.

201
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,838
It's just scared.

202
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:14,045
Crows can scent death, it's kind of a bad omen
to have them flying around your house.

203
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,078
(Fluttering)

204
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,606
(Emma) Whoa.

205
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,638
(Breathes heavily)

206
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,117
- (Crash)
- (Charlie) Oh.

207
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,397
I think it's hurt. Hold that.

208
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,317
There we go, I got him.

209
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,758
I got him.

210
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,558
It's got a broken wing.

211
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,758
- (Crunch)
- (Emma) Oh!

212
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,237
It was the kindest thing to do.

213
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,767
I'll take it out at daybreak.

214
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:53,085
(All) Aaah!

215
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,640
(Matt) Oh, God, Rex.

216
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,406
What the fuck are you guys doing up here?

217
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,438
(Charlie) I'm going to bed.

218
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,678
We had a visitor.

219
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,718
- What?
- Yeah.

220
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,321
It must have thought it was trapped.

221
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,766
Oh.

222
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:14,963
Yeah, I can relate.

223
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,998
This fucking house.

224
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,358
(TV) 'What would I do for a million bucks?

225
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:01,841
'I guess I'd do as little as I had to.'

226
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,242
(Charlie) Would you drive to school naked?

227
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:08,360
- (Sniggering)
- 'Do I have to get out of the car?'

228
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,244
(Matt) Hey, guys - package.

229
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,847
- (Rex) A package!
- (Emma) Nice find, Danny.

230
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,878
I found it by the pool.

231
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,043
Come on, food, food, food, food!

232
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,078
(Charlie) Cigarettes, cigarettes.

233
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,118
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

234
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,163
(Charlie) Bricks?

235
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,402
(Rex) Bricks?
(Charlie) And a letter.

236
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,759
(Matt) This isn't funny. We need supplies.
(Rex) They're tightening the screws.

237
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,798
It's addressed to you.

238
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,717
(Charlie) I want a letter.

239
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,518
(Rex) What is it, man?

240
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,121
(Emma) Danny? Hey.

241
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:09,603
(Rex) So, the letter said that
the funeral takes place in two days

242
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:11,638
in Florida.

243
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,678
(Matt) Florida?
(Rex) Yeah.

244
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,799
So obviously he wouldn't
make it back for the curfew.

245
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:20,765
- (Emma) We can't stop him if he wants to go.
- No.

246
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:24,959
We just have to persuade him that
it's in his best interests to stay here.

247
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:29,922
- (Emma) His best interests?
- We don't even know if this letter's real.

248
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:34,245
(Emma) Only a twisted mind would think of that.
(Rex) Yes, and they are twisted.

249
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,278
What, bricks instead of food?

250
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:40,115
You don't think
this could be part of their game?

251
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,556
Could you build a creepier house?

252
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,883
What if they're fucking with us?

253
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,839
Think about it - no heat, no food, nowthis.

254
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,956
Danny's the weakest link,
they wanna break us.

255
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,556
- Come on.
- No, think about it. Really think about it.

256
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:02,601
We are this close to a million dollars, guys,
we are this close.

257
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:07,196
They don't want to pay us,
they don't want us to make it.

258
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,641
Or maybe they're spicing it up for the viewers.

259
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:12,678
Or maybe his grandfather is dead!

260
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:16,163
If his grandfather's dead, he's dead. I'm sorry.

261
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:21,156
His grandfather practically raised him.
Do you have no feelings at all?

262
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,802
Cut the crap, I'm here for the money, OK?
So are you.

263
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:30,365
Dress it up however you want - exposure,
slumming it, finding yourself - I don't know.

264
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:34,002
The only person not here for the money
is the one who needs it the most

265
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,038
but, no, Danny's here to make friends.

266
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:42,435
Fine, let's be friends to the guy,
let's give him some long-term, practical help.

267
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:47,241
Well, we can't hold a gun to his head.

268
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,038
No.

269
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:58,081
OK. We'll tell him we'll have
an alternative memorial service in the yard.

270
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,358
(Rex) Emma, tell him.

271
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,398
You tell him.

272
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,246
(Rex) We all know he likes you best,
just ask him nicely.

273
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,278
You would do it best.

274
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:30,162
Maybe we should just let him go.
Some things are more important than money.

275
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,324
- Yeah, what, like pussy?
- Hey, man, fuck you.

276
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,403
Doesn't family mean anything to you?

277
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,757
You don't miss what you've never had, man.

278

(* Choral music)

281
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,878
Take cover!

282
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:56,725
- 'Let's go.'

(Computer game sound effects)

285
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,958
(Emma) Look!

286
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,358
What?

287
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:51,438
What the hell...?

288
00:21:54,567 --> 00:22:00,244
Jesus. It must have been
one of the guys fucking around.

289
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:05,486
No. Charlie, I think it's someone else.

290
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,521
Who?

291
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,041
(Charlie, whispering)
I think we're out of shot. Shoot.

292
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:35,286
You know I told you all about that kid
at my school who killed his parents?

293
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,363
His name was John Riley.

294
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:43,125
Well, he wasn't just a kid at my school,
he was a kid on my street.

295
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,727
We used to play together after school.

296
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,204
We had this one favourite game, Scaredy-cat,

297
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,762
where we'd see
who could spook each other the most.

298
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:57,641
And it started out, you know,

299
00:22:57,687 --> 00:23:01,043
like jumping out from behind trees shouting, ''Boo!''

300
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:03,282
That kind of thing.

301
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,557
But then it got more serious.

302
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:10,122
John had a kitten, which he adored.

303
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,285
He'd sneak it into school in his knapsack.

304
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,238
(Camera whirring)

305
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,278
One time...

306
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,442
I swapped the kitten for a brick

307
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,759
and I tossed the knapsack into the school pool.

308
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,966
He was so scared, he peed his pants.

309
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,803
Right in front of everyone.

310
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:37,005
When I showed him the kitten was fine,

311
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,758
he just gave me this look,

312
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,281
this black look.

313
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:49,964
Like, ''Never turn your back

314
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:54,726
''because one day
I'm going to get you back for this.''

315
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,156
But he wouldn't surrender the game.

316
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:03,595
He just kept screaming,

317
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:08,322
''You sick bitch.''

318
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:14,641
First the bricks in the package,

319
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,678
now someone writes this.

320
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:21,446
It feels so personal.
I mean, why am I being singled out?

321
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,402
Charlie...

322
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:29,045
- You don't think that...
- Emma, I...

323
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:33,205
I just think that we've been in this house
way too fucking long.

324
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,523
Like Rex says, it's all a game.
I bet it's the company...

325
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:39,286
But how would they know all that?

326
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,477
I don't know.

327
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,643
Research, I guess.

328
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:48,241
Let's just go back to bed, OK?

329
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,278
Come on, it'll be OK.

330
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,758
Come and keep me warm.

331
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:01,646
(Alarm siren)

332
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,002
(Water splashing)

333
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:44,478
(Breathing heavily)

334
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:47,325
(Camera whirring)

335
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:55,958
(Camera whirring)

336
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,883
Guys, a package.

337
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:06,885
(Giggling excitedly)

338
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,077
(Matt) Better be food this time.

339
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,525
Oh.

340
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:19,799
(Charlie) Sweet. Champagne.
They do still love us.

341
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,158
Five.

342
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:37,362
- (Rex) You motherfuckers.
- One for each, I guess.

343
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:44,959
I know what this...
You cocksuckers, I know what this means.

344
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,998
Fuck you.

345
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:50,964
Do your fucking research,
cos him doing that to himself

346
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,522
was the best thing
that ever fucking happened to me.

347
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,603
What?

348
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,482
I say we put this out of harm's way.

349
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,800
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

350
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:10,635
- They think they can fuck with me now?
- His dad, right?

351
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,481
(Camera whirring)

352
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,118
(Knock on door)

353
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,958
(Footsteps)

354
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,242
You're here to check up on me.

355
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,835
It's not a front, Matt, I just don't care.

356
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:00,604
I wish I did but I don't.

357
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:06,242
Anyways, I brought my own coping mechanism.

358
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,557
Sit down.

359
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,198
Hand me that book.

360
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:20,682
You want to worry about somebody,
worry about Bundy.

361
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:24,925
I don't know whether to feel sorry for him
or be afraid of him.

362
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,397
Why did they pick you, Matt?

363
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,961
What are the skeletons in your closet?

364
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:40,318
Like I'm gonna spill it now?
Give them some ammo to shoot me with?

365
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,361
That's good. Yeah, that's good.

366
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:50,920
But if there are any, they got 'em already.
Question is, do you have any?

367
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,322
Or are you just sliced white bread?

368
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,038
(Strikes match)

369
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,719
(Wind whistling quietly)

370
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,758
(Low creaking)

371
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:16,919
(Gasps)

372
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,318
Is someone out there?

373
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,358
(Electricity humming, crackling)

374
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,999
(Matt) Emma?

375
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:32,596
- You OK?
- The security lights just popped

376
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:36,845
and I would swear there's someone
on the edge of the forest.

377
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,921
Look, you're just freaked out.

378
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,686
Charlie told us what happened last night.

379
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,317
Emma, you can't think
this has anything to do with...

380
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:54,598
To do with what?

381
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,598
When you were a kid, you know?

382
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,198
Yeah.

383
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,522
I guess that would be ridiculous.

384
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:10,447
- I know.
- Yeah.

385
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,121
(Alarm siren)

386
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,966
Aaah!

387
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,998
(Screams echoing)

388
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,044
- Emma! What...?
- What's wrong?

389
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:12,839
What is that?

390
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,003
(Emma sobbing)

391
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,878
Oh, my God.

392
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:19,725
- (Rex) Oh, shit.
- (Charlie) Is that some kind of joke?

393
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:23,885
- Rex, did you put that in there?
- Fuck off, Charlie.

394
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,157
Just don't touch it! Put it down!

395
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:29,517
(Charlie) What the fuck?
(Danny) I didn't put it there!

396
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:33,958
Did you hear anybody?
There's people, like, walking round the house?

397
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:36,601
Calm the fuck down, please. For two seconds.

398
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:41,562
Emma, there's nobody here.
Guys, this is the company all over again.

399
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:46,362
They've raised the stakes but they're playing
the same fucked-up game, so calm down.

400
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,762
They're coming inside now?

401
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,318
Game over.

402
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:56,445
- I can't take this.
- What are you doing?

403
00:31:56,487 --> 00:32:01,003
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna radio them. They can pick me up.

404
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,038
No, no, no, no. I mean, no.

405
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,238
Listen. Wait, stay. Emma? Emma, Emma.

406
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:09,279
Look, it was me. OK?

407
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,557
It was me. I'm sorry.

408
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:14,201
It was a stupid joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

409
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,966
- Wait.
- What's your problem?

410
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:20,841
What's your problem?
You're always picking on people.

411
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:26,757
(Charlie) Stop it! Stop it!
(Matt) Come on. Danny! It's not worth it.

412
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,320
(Matt) You OK?

413
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,561
(Crows cawing outside)

414
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,078
I'm here for the money.

415
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:50,598
What's your excuse?

416
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:54,881
What, you've got no life of your own?

417
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,963
It's not real enough for you?

418
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,797
No family? What is it?

419
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:07,038
I pity you.

420
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,078
You sad fuck.

421
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,086
(Door opens)

422
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,118
(Charlie) Rex.

423
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:22,243
I just wanted to say that, even for you,
that was really fucked up.

424
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,278
Why would you do that?

425
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,758
I didn't put it there, OK?

426
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:38,084
I didn't put it there,
I just said I did so Emma wouldn't leave.

427
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:43,964
I need that fucking prize money
and I wasn't gonna let her leave.

428
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:49,640
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God, don't do that.

429
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:52,918
I still think it's the company, all right?

430
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:56,438
It's the company.

431
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:59,202
But how would they get it in there?

432
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,923
They control all this shit, right?
It's part of their game.

433
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:07,596
They wanted to spice things up
so this is what they do.

434
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,955
Plus, I think...

435
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,998
You know, maybe they're...

436
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:20,445
pissed off there hasn't been
any action or whatever.

437
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,523
Well, not recently.

438
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,637
Anyways...

439
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,281
You think they're punishing us?

440
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:29,716
Yeah. I don't know, maybe.

441
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:33,482
Maybe we've been...

442
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,677
punishing ourselves, you know?

443
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,197
God, I wish I had a smoke.

444
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,238
Charlie, wait.

445
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,399
Charlie, Charlie, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

446
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:58,478
OK.

447
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,358
You want a cigarette?

448
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,521
Don't say I never did nothing for you.

449
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:14,077
One pack of cigarettes. For you.

450
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:18,367
Oh, my God.

451
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,479
What the fuck is this?

452
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:26,123
- It's just some...
- You hoarding little bastard!

453
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,806
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, my God. Guys!

454
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:32,237
- Guys!
- Charlie, shut the fuck up.

455
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:34,278
Fuck you, you little prick.

456
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,318
I'll spli...

457
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,076
Great.

458
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:51,483
Why'd he take cigarettes?
He doesn't even smoke.

459
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,518
To fuck with me.

460
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:57,082
He's a snake.
He'd sell his own grandmother.

461
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,796
He says my grandpa's not dead.

462
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:05,317
That the letter's fake
and it's all part of the game.

463
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,758
Do you think it's true?

464
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,996
(Rex) You got to give me some of that.

465
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,277
You are such a selfish bastard.

466
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,682
Oh, fuck you.

467
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:23,926
Fuck you, you are so fucking self-righteous.
You're so fucking self-important.

468
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:29,681
All this John Riley bullshit, do you really think
he gives a fuck about you now?

469
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,962
Jesus, Emma, you must
really fucking rate yourself.

470
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,646
- Knock it off, Rex.
- Go fuck yourself, Matt,

471
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,917
cos she's not going to.

472
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:47,637
You know, if I was a psycho killer,

473
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:49,837
I wouldn't be hanging out there.

474
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:54,285
I'd have my sights set right on this house.

475
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,598
That's enough, Rex.

476
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,918
Don't kid yourself, she's not into you either.

477
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,078
Asshole.

478
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:11,476
(Rex) Ahem!

479
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:15,838
(Rex) Hey, psycho!

480
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:19,846
Oh, my God. Don't be a fucking prick, Rex!

481
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:24,199
- Psycho killer, come on in!
- (Matt) Rex.

482
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:26,238
It's nice in here!

483
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,085
We got food, we got liquor,

484
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,118
- we got women!
- Just stop.

485
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:35,558
One in particular you might be interested in.
Come on in.

486
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:40,080
- (Door slams)
- Fuck, there is somebody out there.

487
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,118
Shit. The lights.

488
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,801
- There is someone there.
- (Emma) Aah!

489
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,315
Shit. He's heading this way.

490
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:54,558
- It's cold out there, maybe he needs help.
- Would you recognise him?

491
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,441
We'll only open the door
if you're 100%%% certain it's not him.

492
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,923
- Is it John?
- (Emma) I don't know!

493
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:05,958
Please open up the door.

494
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,275
- (Emma) No! Danny, no!
- It's all right.

495
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:14,078
- (Rex) What's wrong with you?
- Hey!

496
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,197
(Charlie) Get his ID.
(Matt) Wait.

497
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,442
(Matt) Come on, some ID.
(Man) What?

498
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:22,082
Some ID. Some identification of who you are.

499
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:25,563
All right. Travis Patterson.
It's nice to meet you.

500
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,842
(Matt) Come on, come on.

501
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:35,478
(Rex) Gimme the light. Yeah, you could fake this.

502
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,882
Oh, come on.

503
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:41,397
- Do I look like I'm under 21?
- (Charlie) What's your star sign?

504
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,961
Cancer. What's yours?

505
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:47,556
- I'm a Gemini.
- You see anyone else out there?

506
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:50,842
Just the Reaper.

507
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:56,275
I swear, a few more hours out there
and I'd be as dead as...

508
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:01,040
- I'd be as dead as the battery on this GPS.
- (Rex) Let me see that.

509
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,647
- It's a locator?
- Yeah.

510
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:08,044
- So you know where we are?
- Yeah. You guys don't?

511
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,078
(Rex) No, we don't.

512
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:15,324
Uh, I don't mean to be rude,

513
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:19,042
obviously you're very
concerned about security,

514
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:21,885
but who the fuck are you guys?

515
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,918
You don't recognise us?

516
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,316
Should I?

517
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:31,326
- Are you on the internet?
- All the time, I'm a programmer.

518
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:35,360
- And you don't know who we are?
- I'm sorry.

519
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,046
I'm tired, am I missing a joke here?

520
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:42,800
We're part of an internet webcast.
Like a human aquarium.

521
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:47,523
See, there's webcams all over the place,
even in the bathroom.

522
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,764
- They run 24/7. People subscribe to us.
- What's the site?

523
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:54,197
- We weren't told.
- You weren't... You weren't told?

524
00:39:56,487 --> 00:40:01,766
The company that set this up
didn't start advertising till we got here.

525
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:06,517
Well, they didn't do such a hot job
because I never heard of you.

526
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,558
And I live online.

527
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:12,441
- Maybe you live in the wrong area.
- Well, it's the internet.

528
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:15,718
- It's the worldwide web.
- There's a lot of sites.

529
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah. So why would I watch you guys?
What's your hook?

530
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:23,117
(Rex) She takes her clothes off.

531
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,158
Shut up. Jerk.

532
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:30,396
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Travis. Sorry my hands are cold.

533
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:36,083
- You're sure you've never seen me before?
- No. I'd definitely remember.

534
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,476
(Travis) Uh, we're here.

535
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:44,406
- (Laughs) Thanks.

536
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,438
(Rex) What's the scale of this map?

537
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,997
On this map, what's the scale?

538
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,835
- 1:50,000.
- (Rex) Oh, fuck! We're in the middle of nowhere.

539
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,596
(Travis) Yeah, pretty much.
(Rex) What's the nearest town?

540
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:02,719
Uh, Wilmington is.

541
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,758
- (Rex) Where's that?
- That's...

542
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:07,878
That's right over there.

543
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:11,720
So where'd you ski from?

544
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:14,759
- From my truck.
- (Matt) So where's your truck?

545
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,718
Where I left it, I guess.

546
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,156
- (Charlie) Does anybody wanna dance?
- Yeah.

547
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:22,641
- (Coughing)
- Yeah.

548
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:35,242
(Emma) Do you believe his story
about skiing out here?

549
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:40,645
(Matt) I don't know. Maybe I'm being paranoid
but it seems too convenient.

550
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:44,282
You know, he didn't seem
fazed at all by the cameras.

551
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:49,240
Remember howfreaked out
we were when we moved in?

552
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,926
(Matt) Were?
(Rex) Are you gonna pass that?

553
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:57,159
(Matt) I only hope Charlie knows
what she's getting herself into.

554
00:41:57,207 --> 00:42:01,086
Emma, um, do you want...do you want to dance?

555
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:07,083
No, Danny. Thank you.

556
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:09,118
I'm gonna go to bed.

557

(Danny) Rex, do you want to dance?

559
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,080
Asshole.

560
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,118
Ooh. OK!

Mmm.

(Charlie) You wanna go upstairs?

565
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:41,563
- Yeah.

00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:37,684
(Kung fu computer game sound effects)

640
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:40,638
(Engine rewing outside)

641
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,845
(Danny) Matt! Guys, get in here!

642
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,598
Delivery?

643
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:49,638
(Computer) 'Time out.'

644
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,996
I found it by the snare. It's Travis's backpack.

645
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:57,800
- (Matt) Was it a grizzly?
- Oh, my God!

646
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:02,045
No, there are no animal tracks, no footprints either.

647
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:04,965
- We have to radio for help.
- For who?

648
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:11,003
- For Travis?
- It's not real, it's part of the game. Relax.

649
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,686
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

650
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:17,003
- There's blood, he could be hurt.
- He's not.

651
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:22,121
- (Charlie) Looks real to me.
- (Rex) He's not. If he was, where's the body?

652
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:26,445
They want us to call for help, guys.
That's what they want.

653
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:32,517
If we do, you think some cop is gonna care
about our curfew when he sees my rap sheet?

654
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:37,561
- All you can think about is the curfew.
- If we call the cops, we lose.

655
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:42,078
That's what they want.
That's what they want!

656
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,402
Oh, Christ! Fine. Fine, you know what?

657
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:50,838
If you're that worried, talk to them.
They can get help, right?

658
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:55,324
- Yeah, somebody...
- Guys! You've seen what's happened here.

659
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:58,643
- You know where we are. Send help.
- Oh, yeah.

660
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:05,081
And Travis, if that is your real name,
go fuck yourself.

661
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:08,563
You're not gonna scare me
out of my money. OK, buddy?

662
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:12,646
(Rex) Don't give them the pleasure, guys.

663
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:17,078
They've laughed enough at our expense
as it is, especially at you, Charlie.

664
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,118
- What?
- Especially at you.

665
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,560
- Fuck you!
- You knowthat whole thing was a setup, right?

666
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:27,599
That's why he picked the easy target.

667
00:51:27,647 --> 00:51:31,481
You noticed he wasn't
too afraid of the cameras, right?

668
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:47,561
Travis, Travis, Travis. Where are you now,
you son of a bitch?

669
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,398
- Emma.
- Danny.

670
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,556
I didn't take your clothes.

671
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:07,683
It was them. They're messing with us.
It's just part of a game.

672
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:11,242
- Danny, please, don't...
- Look, I made this for you.

673
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,476
- Take it.
- Danny, I can't take that.

674
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,715
I made it for you.

675
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:24,718
OK.

676
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:43,838
(Emma) Charlie.

677
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:53,036
From Danny.

678
00:52:53,847 --> 00:52:56,839
Oh, I get it. It's your pussy.

679
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:02,638
- Hi, Emma's pussy. Scratch and sniff.
- Don't.

680
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:09,084
Give him a break. He spent hours down there,
bashing away with his little thingy.

681
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,039
(lmitates Psycho theme) Em-ma! Em...

682
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:18,720
- Emma's creepy pussy.
- It's horrible.

683
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:20,564
(Charlie laughs)

684
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,562
(Alarm siren)

685
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:50,961
(Screaming)

686
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:56,081
Guys! (Gasps and sobs)

687
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,917
(Rope creaking)

688
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:18,358
- Danny.
- Matt.

689
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:21,558
Matt, don't. Don't. Don't! He's dead. He's dead.

690
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:26,203
- (Charlie) Emma. Oh, my God.
- I can't look.

691
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:39,885
(Water running)

692
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,439
- I'm fine.
- It's OK.

693
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,206
- I'll get it.
- It's OK.

694
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:52,125
It's not OK. It's not OK!

695
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,681
It's so not OK.

696
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:02,366
(Charlie) What are we gonna do?
(Matt) We wait for the helicopter.

697
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,043
Game's over, right? Can't go on now.

698
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:17,399
- What about...?
- It's not our responsibility. It's their fucking game.

699
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,564
We've played everything fair up till here, guys.

700
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:24,520
This is not our fault.
We've done nothing wrong here.

701
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:28,640
We can't. We can't leave him there.

702
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:33,966
You're not supposed to move him.
I saw it on TV. We can't move him.

703
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,964
(Matt) We should cover him. We should cover him.

704
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,283
Or we could take him outside.

705
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,404
(Matt) Outside?

706
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:49,237
Yeah, well, you want... Where else?

707
00:55:54,327 --> 00:55:56,716
OK.

708
00:55:56,767 --> 00:56:00,840
You guys take him outside,
and we're gonna try the radio.

709
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:05,596
(Charlie) Please.

710
00:56:11,927 --> 00:56:14,316
- That's good.
- (Radio static)

711
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,835
Hello, can anybody hear me?

712
00:56:17,847 --> 00:56:20,884
Please, somebody's dead. Please help.

713
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,599
(Radio static)

714
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,402
(Coughing)

715
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:43,887
(Radio static)

716
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:47,237
- Please, we need help.
- Nobody's there.

717
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:57,477
(Rex) I just fucking can't believe that he...

718
00:56:57,527 --> 00:57:02,203
- (Matt) This isn't what we signed up for.
- No, it's not.

719
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,444
What kind of a sick fuck would subscribe to this?

720
00:57:12,327 --> 00:57:15,558
Hold on a minute. Hold on a fucking minute.

721
00:57:51,447 --> 00:57:53,438
(Radio static)

722
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,158
OK.

723
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:09,596
(Computer beeps)

724
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:13,845
- Sorry the way things have turned out for us.
- It's OK.

725
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,518
Come here.

726
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:29,915
- Emma, I...
- (Rex) Guys! Guys!

727
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:33,757
You've got to fucking see this.
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

728
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,557
(Rex) Ever wonder
howthe company plans on paying us?

729
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:46,680
Or howthey pay for the house,
the food and the helicopter?

730
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:49,719
(Emma) Advertising.
(Matt) Subscriptions.

731
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:55,125
(Rex) You don't get one without the other.
If nobody subscribes, the revenues dry up.

732
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:58,716
(Rex) And I've been thinking, this guy Travis,

733
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,759
he was a fucking programmer, a web-head.

734
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:07,803
He should spend his entire life on the internet,
so how had he never seen a single ad?

735
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:11,237
- There's tons of shit on the internet.
- Right.

736
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:15,200
- That's why I went on the internet.
- (Emma) How?

737
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:18,603
- The satellite uplink still works.
- Where did you learn that?

738
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:21,286
Computer club. I've been looking for our site.

739
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:26,447
I have put our names through
every single fucking search engine I can think of

740
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:28,682
and I have got nothing, guys.

741
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:31,195
And I mean nothing at all.

742
00:59:31,247 --> 00:59:36,321
Not even an advertisement.
Nothing, not a single fucking ad.

743
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:38,722
- It's a big place.
- Yeah.

744
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:42,646
But why are they making it
so difficult to find the site?

745
00:59:42,687 --> 00:59:47,522
If they want people to go to it,
why are they making it so tough?

746
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:51,401
Well, I did find it. It was hard as hell, but I found it.

747
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:56,202
But it's fucked.
It doesn't have a name, it's a beta site.

748
00:59:56,247 --> 01:00:00,877
I tripped over it,
I was tipped off on a hacker newsgroup.

749
01:00:00,927 --> 01:00:04,124
- What's a beta site?
- A beta site is a...

750
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:09,366
like a password name, like a mess of letters
and numbers instead of a real name.

751
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:11,967
It's fucked. Take a look.

752
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,597
- This is our site?
- I don't know.

753
01:00:15,647 --> 01:00:22,598
I'm trying to subscribe, I've been using
Travis's credit card. This has a limit of $50,000.

754
01:00:22,647 --> 01:00:25,559
- How do you know?
- You learn a lot at computer club.

755
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:31,443
- You can buy a house with that.
- But it doesn't get you to the keyhole on this.

756
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:36,038
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it either. I don't get it either!

757
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:42,356
This place doesn't fucking advertise.
It doesn't even have a real address,

758
01:00:42,407 --> 01:00:46,400
so all I can come up with
is that it doesn't want to attract attention.

759
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:51,837
But why? And the security...
the security is fucking insane.

760
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:55,118
I threw every hacker file I have at this,

761
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,239
we're talking serious back door fuckers,

762
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,879
and I still can't bypass the encryption.

763
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:05,556
- So what's your point?
- My point, guys...

764
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:13,241
simply put, is why the fuck
would people pay so much money to watch us?

765
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:17,005
I wanna know, is this thing legit?

766
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:20,483
- (Rex) Is it fucking legit? Is it legal?
- Like a porn site?

767
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:24,520
Yeah, but except for her escapades
it's hardly porn.

768
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:27,877
So, what is it then? What?

769
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:34,445
Am I the only person thinking this here?
Is it only clear to me?

770
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:41,960
Nobody's ever heard of a snuff movie before?
A snuff site? Danny's dead already!

771
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:46,125
- No, Danny killed himself.
- How do we knowthat?

772
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:51,639
- Jesus!
- You explain this, it seems fucked up right now.

773
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:55,077
Am I wrong? This is seeming kinda fucked up!

774
01:01:55,127 --> 01:01:56,799
(Beeping)

775
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:00,796
What the fuck...?

776
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:04,402
(Beeping, whirring, silence)

777
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:09,518
(Rex) Oh, shit.

778
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:15,119
(Charlie) Why are there numbers
against our names?

779
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:18,000
(Rex) They're betting odds.

780
01:02:18,047 --> 01:02:21,278
(Charlie) Oh, my God!
(Rex) They're fucking betting odds!

781
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:26,724
(Garbled) 'Oh, my God!'
(Garbled) 'They're fucking betting odds!'

782
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:28,519
(Garbled conversations)

783
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:35,843
(Garbled shouting)

784
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,078
(Emma sobbing)

785
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:56,956
You sons of bitches!

786
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,924
(Slowed) You sons of bitches!

787
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:07,037
(Clunk)

788
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:09,521
- I can email for help.
- Relax.

789
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,802
I'm gonna email somebody...
Come on, you son of a bitch.

790
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:17,999
- They've cut me off! These fuckers...
- (Matt) No, the signal just died.

791
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:21,357
- Wait, Rex. Calm down!
- (Girls screaming)

792
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:26,322
(Rex) There's no prize money,
and they're gonna fucking kill us!

793
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:29,040
(Matt) Rex, this is not a snuff website.

794
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:33,482
Think about it.
Who are they gonna kill, the four of us?

795
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:38,356
You're the one who keeps saying
this is just one of their games.

796
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:43,363
That's all this is, another game.
They're just fucking with us.

797
01:03:44,807 --> 01:03:49,722
Come on. We're almost out of here.
Tomorrow we leave.

798
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:53,601
- Tomorrow we get our money...
- What do we do tonight?

799
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:58,801
If you're that worried,
I'll get the gun and stand guard till morning.

800
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:04,560
(Camera whirring)

801
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,842
(Rattling)

802
01:04:11,887 --> 01:04:13,878
(Camera whirring)

803
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:48,361
(Banging)

804
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,318
(Alarm siren)

805
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,562
(Wind whistling)

806
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:07,998
They're still playing.

807
01:05:12,527 --> 01:05:15,439
(Charlie) It's dark out there, I can't see anything.

808
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:20,640
(Matt) Security lights would trigger
if anyone was out there.

809
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:24,885
- (Emma) What are you looking for, Rex?
- I saw it in here somewhere.

810
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:28,317
- What?
- Come on, you son of a bitch. Bingo!

811
01:05:29,807 --> 01:05:34,437
I knew Travis kept an emergency flare.
We can set this off.

812
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:38,321
- (Matt) But you'd have to go outside to shoot it.
- I know.

813
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,916
- You could shoot it from the roof.
- Yeah, OK.

814
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:47,880
I just don't want to go out there by myself. So...

815
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:55,635
I'll go with you.

816
01:05:58,007 --> 01:05:59,998
OK.

817
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:02,402
OK, good, good.

818
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:11,398
(Sighs)

819
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:17,361
(Rex, garbled) Don't worry, OK?
Don't worry, this is gonna work.

820
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:23,039
This is gonna work, somebody's gonna see it
and somebody's gonna call the cops.

821
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:26,284
(Emma) What, some good citizen?

822
01:06:26,327 --> 01:06:29,364
They do exist, Emma. We knew one.

823
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:34,797
You should have this. It's Danny's penknife.

824
01:06:34,847 --> 01:06:36,599
OK.

825
01:06:36,647 --> 01:06:38,638
Rex.

826
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:44,725
- I never even gave him a chance.
- He didn't have a chance, Emma.

827
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,601
- They didn't want him to have a chance.
- They?

828
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:53,321
Emma, this isn't about your past.

829
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:57,676
They just want you to think that.

830
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:02,998
- They just want you to think that.
- That's why they picked me?

831
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:13,004
At first light, we head out. Together, OK?

832
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:17,402
OK? And they can fuck their money.

833
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:43,158
(Camera whirring)

834
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,238
(Wind whistling)

835
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,926
(Heavy, fast breathing)

836
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:17,802
(Breathing quietens and slows)

837
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,998
(Fire crackling)

838
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:30,683
When I get out of here,
maybe I'll give LA another try. You know?

839
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:35,799
I was really hoping this would be successful.

840
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,564
You're on prime time now.

841
01:08:40,607 --> 01:08:44,156
- You think?
- The internet's global.

842
01:08:45,527 --> 01:08:48,087
You're always prime time somewhere.

843
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,397
Huge in Japan.

844
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:55,804
And you know howto be yourself
in front of the camera, howto relax.

845
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:02,525
- That's half the battle, right?
- I guess.

846
01:09:03,487 --> 01:09:05,876
I don't feel very relaxed right now.

847
01:09:09,047 --> 01:09:11,038
Come over here.

848
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:21,681
I'll help you relax.

849
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,998
(Chuckling)

850
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:35,083
(Sighs)

851
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:41,721
- Mmm...
- Oh, yeah. I can feel it.

852
01:09:42,727 --> 01:09:45,287
It's like a big knot.

853
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:47,318
Mmm, yeah.

854
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:50,717
Mmm.

855
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,598
Mm-hm.

856
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:05,516
(Whispers) Lean forward.

857
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,364
Matt...

858
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:30,246
You've got everything.
Why did you sign up for this?

859
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:33,720
Curiosity.

860
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:36,361
- See how it'd feel.
- Mmm.

861
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:41,199
- What, the isolation?
- The fear.

862
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:46,801
- The fear?
- Yeah.

863
01:10:47,887 --> 01:10:50,037
It feels good.

864
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:54,804
- Should I kill her now?
- (Loud buzzing)

865
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:58,726
- (Screaming)
- It's why you're watching, isn't it?

866
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,917
(Whimpering)

867
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:06,925
(Gasping shrieks)

868
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,807

01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:24,485
(Silence)

870

(Camera whirring)

872
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:57,397
Was that OK?

873
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:02,238
(Rex coughing)

874
01:12:13,607 --> 01:12:15,598
Shit.

875
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:39,721

(* Suspenseful computer game music)

879
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:51,918
(Man) 'Press the frigging start button, would you?'

880
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:55,636
Matt?

881
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:57,678
Guys?

882
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:08,764
(* Computer music continues)

883
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:14,325
'Hello? Press the button.'

'Come on. Today. Let's go.'

like nothing ever happened.

Boy, was I wrong.'

(Bang)

889
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:25,126
He's fucking here. He's just come for us.
We gotta go upstairs. Let's go.

890
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:27,362
Go. Go.

891
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:45,239
Do you hear anything? Can you hear him?

892
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:48,359
- Did you see him?
- I saw him get Charlie.

893
01:16:49,607 --> 01:16:51,643
Charlie...

894
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:53,678
What about Rex?

895
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:58,123
- Not yet.
- Matt?

896
01:16:58,167 --> 01:17:02,046
- Emma, I'm most worried about you now.
- What are you doing?

897
01:17:02,087 --> 01:17:06,160
- It's just us now. We've got to stick together.
- The door!

898
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:08,801
- We belong together. We do.
- No!

899
01:17:19,687 --> 01:17:25,557
- Do you hear? He's out there. John!
- No!

900
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,916
- John, are you out there?
- No!

901
01:17:34,927 --> 01:17:36,918
Why are you turning the light on?

902
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:40,846
Because I want them to see
what I'm going to do to you.

903
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:47,317
All that John Riley shit in your journal.

904
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,284
You actually believe you triggered his psychosis.

905
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:57,762
After all this time,
he'd battle through a frozen wasteland

906
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,957
just to win a childhood bet?

907
01:18:02,567 --> 01:18:05,001
Rex was right.

908
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,161
That's some fucking ego, Emma.

909
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:15,204
Get on the bed.

910
01:18:15,247 --> 01:18:17,238
Get on the bed, Emma.

911

930

- Help me!
- Calm down. What's going on here?

931
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:04,119
- In there!
- If you want me to help, you'll have to calm down.

932
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:07,921
(Slowed) He killed everyone. He's after me!

933
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:13,166
- (Slowed) Calm down. I have to follow procedure.
- Help me!

934
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:17,086
Deep breaths. There you go. Inside the car.

935
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:21,040
- I'll take care of it. Don't worry.
- He killed everyone!

936
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:26,681
Are you the one that set off the flare? Huh?

937
01:21:26,727 --> 01:21:29,480
Yes? And there's somebody in there?

938
01:21:29,527 --> 01:21:32,121
- Yes.
- Is he armed?

939
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:34,761
- He has an axe.
- An axe. OK.

940
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:39,358
- Don't leave me!
- Stay calm, miss. I'll be right back, OK?

You've gotta let me do it.
I was in this house six fucking months.

946
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:46,765
(Man) What do you think I've been doing
for the past six months?

947
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,604
No!

948
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,527
(Matt) Just give me the fucking keys, man.

949
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:57,927
(Screaming) No!

950
01:23:57,967 --> 01:24:02,597
- What are you gonna do, bleed on her?
- (Screams)

951
01:24:02,647 --> 01:24:04,126
I can do it!

952
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:09,842
Give me the fucking keys. I can do it!

953
01:24:10,527 --> 01:24:12,518
No! No!

954
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,239
No!

955
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:16,198
- (Car beeps)
- No!

956
01:24:17,847 --> 01:24:20,566
(Chokes and coughs)

957
01:24:20,607 --> 01:24:23,201
No.

958
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:26,403
(Matt coughs and sobs)

959
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:31,562
(Matt, screaming) No!

960
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:44,836
- (Cork pops)
- Whoo.

961
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,282
(Grunts)

962
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:55,201
Time to celebrate.

963
01:24:59,607 --> 01:25:02,326
- To the company.
- The company.

964
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:07,275
Think they'll be pleased?

965
01:25:07,327 --> 01:25:11,286
- You'll probably get a promotion.
- You think so?

966
01:25:11,327 --> 01:25:16,765
- Yeah. Your own parking space.
- Parking space?

967
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:21,164
Who do you think we are?
You think we have an office?

968
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:23,801
Business cards, a brochure?

969
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:26,358
Huh?

970
01:25:27,007 --> 01:25:31,922
There is no ''they'', Matt. ''They'' is us.

971
01:25:31,967 --> 01:25:35,357
Just me, Travis and some very rich clients.

972
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:38,841
Low overhead, maximum profit.

973
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:44,683
As for product, well...

974
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:49,357
There's always plenty of low-hanging fruit,
ripe to be picked.

975
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:53,961
- Always five suckers.
- You mean four.

976
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:57,879
She's a little wriggler.

977
01:25:58,807 --> 01:26:01,401
(Gasping)

978
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:05,884
- You getting this, Travis?
- (On radio) 'Yeah, looking good from here.'

979
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:09,242
Let me see.

980
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:11,526
(Emma gasping and choking)

981
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:13,558
(Gunshot)

982
01:26:28,207 --> 01:26:31,199
(Screaming, slowed)

983
01:26:35,007 --> 01:26:39,239
(Slowed) Help me!

984
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:48,399
(Squeaking)

985
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:56,677
'Uh, hi, my name is Danny.'

986
01:26:56,727 --> 01:27:00,322
(* Bikini Atoll: Desolation Highway)

987
01:27:09,687 --> 01:27:13,236
- 'Charlie, just Charlie. Like Madonna.'
- * What was unknown

988
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:16,199
* Became known to me

989
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:20,120
* Kinda cold heat

990
01:27:21,607 --> 01:27:24,360
* Swept over me

991
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:29,046
- * A valediction from a

992
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:32,124
* Terminal heart

993
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:39,845
* Your misfortune was my work of art

994
01:27:41,567 --> 01:27:45,719
- * There's a cavalcade
- 'Hi, I'm Emma, I'm 23 years old'

995
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:51,444
- * On desolation highway
- 'and, er, I wanna come live in your house.'

996
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:57,124
* In my veins

997
01:27:57,167 --> 01:28:00,239
* Like a cold parade

998
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:07,242
- 'Hi, I'm Matt.'
- * On desolation highway

999
01:28:09,887 --> 01:28:13,800
* Coursing through my veins

1000
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:34,483
* A force unstoppable nowthe stone has cracked

1001
01:28:37,047 --> 01:28:42,326
* Another false dawn, well, sunset came too fast

1002
01:28:44,567 --> 01:28:50,563
* Just in time for those wild staring eyes

1003
01:28:52,887 --> 01:28:58,598
* You know I never blinked
and nowthey're frozen dry
