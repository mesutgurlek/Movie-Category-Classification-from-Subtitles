There is no brain damage
that we've detected.

205
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,941
Technically,
yes, he's in a coma.

206
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,143
He doesn't react to stimuli.
He has no sleep-wake cycle.

207
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,450
But there's no brain trauma or
infection. His scans are all normal.

208
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,315
To be honest, I've never
seen anything like it.

209
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,824
But he can't just
not wake up. I mean...

something.

ADELE: Okay, so what
I've done here is

220
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,199
I've inserted
a nasogastric feeding tube.

221
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,242
To get the length of the
tube that I'm gonna need,

222
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,873
I measure from the tip
of the nose to the earlobe

223
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,072
and down to the xiphoid
process, which is here.

224
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,485
Then I usually mark
that off with some tape.

225
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,783
And then you need to
lubricate the end of the tube

226
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,654
that I'm going
insert about 4 inches.

227
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,120
And then I just
slide it in like that.

228
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,721
I have to make sure
the end of the tube

229
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,789
is curved and that
his head is a little bent,

230
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,165
a little bent back.

231
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,869
And then we usually hold it in
place with some surgical tape.

232
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,431
And that's it.

233

this is what I believe,

and it may contradict a previous
medical diagnosis, but...

579
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,186
You called me here,
and I'm taking that

580
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,755
as an acceptance
of my readings. Yes?

581
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,101
Yes, go on.

Falling off a ladder
had nothing to do with this.

584
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,707
His physical body's here.

585
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,675
But his spiritual body is not.

586
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,982

they followed you
to a new home,

is because it's not

Yes. It's out of body

594
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,513
I like to call them travelers.

595
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:26,148
You see, these are people with the
ability to leave their physical body

596
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,751
and to travel to different
places in astral form.

597
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,926
Now, Dalton,

598
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:36,491
he is a very accomplished
astral projector.

599
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,027
He's been doing it in
his sleep for a long time.

600
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,169
He has been since
he was very young.

601
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,077
And he's unafraid because
he thinks they're dreams.

602
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,873
And it's that
very lack of fear

603
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,211
that has led him
to travel too far.

604
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,175
And to become lost.

605
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,112
Lost?

606
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,255
Lost where?

607
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,851
In a place that
I call the Further.

608
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,089
What? What does that mean?

609
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,763
The Further is a world
far beyond our own,

610
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,133
yet it's all around us,

611
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,998
a place without time
as we know it.

612
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,237
It's a dark realm filled with
the tortured souls of the dead,

613
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,041
a place not
meant for the living.

614
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,417
That's where Dalton is.

615
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,555
And the problem is that
with his astral body gone,

616
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:37,150
he's just left us with a
physical body, an empty vessel.

617
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,091
And there are entities that know
this because they can smell it.

618
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,260
That's why they're
gathered around him.

619
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,825
Are these the things
that I've been seeing?

620
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,809
They're all trying to get
inside of his physical body

621
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,574
simply because they...

622
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,239
They crave life,

623
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,243
the chance to live again.

624
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,848
But there are other entities

625
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,048
who are malevolent

626
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,056
and have a more
insidious agenda.

627
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,589
And then, there's this.

628
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:20,632
A demon who seeks Dalton's
body for one reason:

629
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,696
to cause pain to others.

630
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,671
He is so desperate
to possess Dalton,

631
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,714
and he's the closest of all the
entities to getting inside of him.

632
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,442
What do you mean
the closest?

633
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:37,213
Because these entities, they can't
just walk into the bodies of the living

634
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,584
anytime they please.

635
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,520
To cross over
from their realm,

636
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,353
it takes time.
It takes energy.

637
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,622
But the longer that
Dalton's astral body

638
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:50,126
is kept away from his physical
body, the weaker the link gets.

639
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,059
The easier it is
to possess him.

640
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:58,038
Is there anything we can do
to bring Dalton back?

641
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,610
There's something
we could try.

What? No, please, Josh. You
said you would give her a chance.

646
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,526
I have given her
a chance, honey,

647
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,358
but I can't have somebody
coming into our home

648
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,295
and telling us the reason
our son is in a coma

649
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,390
is because his soul
has floated off

650
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,559
somewhere
in another dimension.

651
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,364
We're gonna bring her
all the way here

652
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,302
and not even consider
what she's saying?

653
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:33,703
I did this to make sure you could
feel at ease. And if it helped, great.

show. I have seen the drawings.

But to bring
Dalton into it, no.

656
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,244
But why is our son
still in a coma?

657
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,582
Why can't the doctors tell us
what is wrong with him?

658
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,384

become the bad guy here?

want to believe. Anybody would.

of a seriously ill child,

the reason I know her so well,

804
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,658
Finally, I was so
frightened, I found Elise.

805
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,159
Do you remember
any of this, honey, do you?

806
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,527
No. I don't.

807
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,832
Suppressing your memory and
your ability to astral project

808
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:02,206
was the only way to stop her
from getting into you.

809
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,646
But in the back
of your mind,

810
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,411
you're still afraid to have
your picture taken, aren't you?

811
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,447
I kept those photos
hidden from you ever since.

812
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,122
I advised Lorraine
to hide them,

813
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:20,320
to stop taking your picture,
to just let you forget.

814

Who is she?

815
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,693
A parasite.

816
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,401
She befriended
your astral body

817
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,599
and then drew you out
into the Further,

818
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:34,767
just as Dalton
has been drawn out.

819

I'm so sorry, Josh.

820
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,775
I didn't want to make you
remember all this.

821

the sake of your son.

And with what
we saw tonight,

I'm not scared of you.

967
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,160
I'm not scared
of you anymore.

968
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,231
You can get away from me.

969
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:06,232
Get the hell away from me!
Get away from me!

970
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:09,332
Get away from me!

971
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:11,103
Leave me alone!

972
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,212
Please, please, please!

973
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:15,075
<i>Come back to us!</i>
<i>Follow my voice!</i>

974
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:17,147
Follow my voice!
Please, honey!

975
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:18,879
Josh, come back!
Come back to us!

976
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:20,386
Get the hell away from me!

977
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:24,816
Please, Josh, please,
come back to us, please!

978
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:27,656
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Please!

979
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:32,232
<i>Josh, please!</i>
<i>Come back, please!</i>

980
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,899
Leave me alone!

981
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:37,426
(GASPING)

982
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,085
I've got Dalton.
He's awake!

983
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:32,318
Oh, my boy!

984
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,053
He's okay! He's okay!

985
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,257
JOSH: We did it, buddy.

986
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:47,436
You're back. You're back.

987
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,985
Dude, I got some
amazing shots.

988
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:03,615
You're gonna write a book,

989
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:06,990
and my photos are gonna be
the main selling point.

990
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:10,328
Not the main selling point, but
they'll definitely be important.

991
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:11,694
They will be important.

992
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,294
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

993
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:17,337
Yeah, but words are worth
a thousand words, too.

994
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:22,471
You're really hungry,
aren't you?

995
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:24,736
And I'm tired, too.

996
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:27,837
You're tired?
No, you can't be tired.

997
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:29,041
Yes, I can.

998
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,243
No, you've been asleep for far
too long. And you know what?

999
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:32,580
I'm never letting you
go to sleep again.

1000
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:36,716
You showed me a new world.

1001
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,124
No, I didn't.

1002
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:42,088
You've been there
before, remember?

1003
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,592
Well, let's hope
I forget again.

1004
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:52,238
Guess I don't need
these anymore.

1005
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:00,139
What?

1006
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:01,776
Nothing.

1007
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,542
I'm gonna
get rid of these.

1008
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,210
All right. (SIGHS)

1009
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:22,664
Why did you do that?

1010
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:27,170
Why would you do that to me when
you know how I feel about that?

1011
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:29,004
Why? Why?

1012
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,438
Why? Why?

1013
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,480
Why? Why? Why?

1014
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:34,941
No, you're not tired.

1015
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,313
In fact, you're never going to
sleep again. You have to stay awake

1016
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:38,715
...for the rest of your life, with me.
- No.

1017
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,146
(CHOKING)

1018
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,984
Why? Why? Why?

1019
01:37:49,296 --> 01:37:50,627
You bitch!

1020
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:57,263
Can you watch him,
Lorraine?

1021
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:58,430
Sure.

1022
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:03,871
Elise.

01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:14,980
Josh! Josh!

1025
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:20,258
Josh, where are you? Josh!

1026
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:24,494
Honey, please... Josh!

1027
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:30,398
Josh?

1028
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:34,997
Oh, Jesus.

1029
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:03,159
JOSH: Renai,

1030
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:04,761
I'm right here.
