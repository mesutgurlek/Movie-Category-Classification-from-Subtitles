Come on, Jess.

316
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,006
LAURA: Please!

317
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:31,360
Help me! Jess!

318
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:34,083
But, Bob, what about Laura?

319
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,283
Never mind about Laura. Come on.

320
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,200
- We can't just leave her behind.
- Joe, Greg!

321
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:41,164
Wait, Jessica!

322
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:45,516
- Bob!
- I can't find the place we got in.

323
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,480
[Laura screaming]

324
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,080
Jess, come on.

325
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,319
Come on, Jess!

326
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:11,916
Master.

327
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,115
I did it.

328
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,286
I summoned you!

329
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:21,806
It was my will.

330
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,236
No.

331
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,122
Jess.

332
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:00,724
- Okay, so Johnny went too far.
- Too far?

333
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,806
- It was revolting.
- Well, Laura was smashed.

334
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,082
You know what happens
when she touches that stuff.

335
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:09,204
- She can't handle it.
- Bob, she was not that smashed.

336
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,075
Okay, so we'll go to the Cavern tomorrow.
Usual time.

337
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,996
Laura will be there.
A bit drained, but she'll be there...

338
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,406
and I'll have a few words to say to Johnny.

339
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,799
We should have gone back for Laura.

340
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,003
No, we shouldn't have gone there at all.

341
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,317
I did phone up Bob's pad.
He and Jess made it okay...

342
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,125
but he doesn't know
what happened to Laura.

343
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:48,560
Maybe we ought to do something.

344
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,478
What? Call the fuzz?
No, we can't do that...

345
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,639
- 'cause they'll ask me personal questions.
- So you've got secrets?

346
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:56,685
Look, don't you think we're pushing
the panic button for no reason?

347
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,758
Johnny gets his kicks
out of scaring people.

348
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:01,361
Just for the record, with me,
he succeeded.

349
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:04,245
- Who knows where he lives?
- He never did say.

350
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:07,319
- You're a sight for sore eyes, man.
- Is Laura with you?

351
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,602
No. I thought she was here with you.

352
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:11,678
- No one's seen her.
- Or Johnny.

353
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:12,836
Maybe they've eloped.

354
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:14,963
No, Johnny never fancied Laura that much.

355
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:16,958
If he'd planned on
skipping with some bird...

356
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:18,321
it would have been with Jessica.

357
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:19,806
No, it wouldn't.

358
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,165
Well, I'll tell you this for nothing.

359
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:25,284
Nobody is getting me back
in that bloody churchyard in a hurry.

360
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,437
It was sick, man.
I mean, the whole thing was...

361
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:29,836
Look, let's drop the subject, shall we?

362
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:32,760
Yeah, right. I want to forget about it,
just forget about it.

363
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,280
[Drilling]

364
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,436
Come on, quick.

365
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:24,080
- Hi, folks.
- Hi, man.

366
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,998
- You finally made it.
- And where have you been?

367
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,122
Railway station.

368
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,242
- Railway station?
- Well, sure.

369
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,966
- What for, Johnny?
- Took Laura to meet the Ramsgate train.

370
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:32,400
Ramsgate?

371
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:34,762
The 10:40 from Victoria.
Don't you remember?

372
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:37,441
She goes down to Ramsgate every month.

373
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:39,995
She cons her parents
for the rent and the allowance.

374
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,805
- Don't you remember?
- I don't.

375
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:44,765
I seem to remember
she lives someplace like Watford.

376
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:47,361
- That's what I thought.
- Ramsgate.

377
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,400
What are you all on about?

378
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:52,923
Look, about last night,
you've got some explaining to do, mate.

379
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:58,721
Hysterical, wasn't it?
Boy, you were all flying high.

380
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:02,605
- Let's do it again sometime.
- You just have to be kidding.

381
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,757
JOE: No, Anna, I don't think he is.

382
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,003
Got you all going, didn't I?

383
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:12,686
Why, you should have seen your faces.
You were really living it.

384
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,639
Then when the blood started to flow...

385
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:18,036
Yes. Tell us about the blood, Johnny.

386
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:20,436
That was the clincher. Got you worried?

387
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,116
Simple.

388
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,476
The secret lies right there.

389
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,562
Used on the TV and the movies.

390
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:36,083
It's called a blood capsule.

391
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,479
- Bloody hell.
- Wow.

392
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:41,726
That's it.

393
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:44,924
- It's all a load of hokum.
- That's very clever, but what about Laura?

394
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:47,316
- She was in on the act right from the start.
- Yeah?

395
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:48,920
It looked like real blood to me.

396
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,805
- And it was revolting.
- Was it really a gag, Johnny?

397
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,525
- What else?
- Thank God for that.

398
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:54,642
You believe him?

399
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,922
I mean, it was too way out to be real.
Wasn't it?

400
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,486
It still looked like real blood.

401
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:02,037
- And all that weird noise, Johnny?
- Sound effects on a tape recorder.

402
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:03,606
You saw Joe turn it on.

403
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,485
Yeah, it could have been the way he said.

404
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,762
No. I'm not convinced.

405
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,964
You're about the most gullible bunch
I ever set my eyes on.

406
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,402
You left your clothes behind.
I can't believe it.

407
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:17,240
You really thought
I was spooking up old Beelzebub?

408
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,963
Wait till Laura hears about it.

409
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:21,361
[Drilling]

410
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,319
Right. I'm going for a drink.

411
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,962
- I'll settle the bill.
- Do I owe you for that?

412
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,083
- No. It's on me, Joe.
- Thanks, mate.

413
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,759
Bye-bye.

414
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,838
See you, baby. Tata.

415
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:40,520
Okay, so I'm forgiven.

416
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:43,405
Look, I had some really rough nightmares
because of you.

417
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:46,763
In Technicolor?
You ought to lay off that stuff.

418
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:51,085
Okay, so I'm sorry. Am I forgiven, Jess?

419
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,396
Sure.

420
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:56,119
Look, just to show I'm sorry,
I've got two tickets...

421
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,004
for the Jazz Spectacular at the Albert Hall.

422
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,681
You can't buy them for love nor money.
They're like gold dust.

423
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:04,555
Lucky bitch.
I'd sell my soul to get my hands on those.

424
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:09,565
No one has to sell their souls. Not just yet.

425
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,756
How about it, Jess? Open invitation.

426
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:15,839
Drop it, Johnny.
I'm taking Jess to the pictures.

427
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:19,036
That's how we're playing it tonight, mate.

428
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:20,401
See you.

429
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,719
- Okay, angel, you can come.
- Wow.

430
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:33,803
Happened sometime last night.

431
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:36,165
Cause of death?

432
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,966
Difficult to say without a postmortem...

433
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,397
but the whole body's
been shockingly mutilated.

434
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:44,797
Work of a maniac, I'd say.
Must have gone completely berserk.

435
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:46,600
Sexually assaulted?

436
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:49,804
Until I've made a proper examination,
that's anyone's guess.

437
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,482
It seems as if someone's tried
to drain the whole body of blood.

438
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:58,239
It's a grim setting. Body mightn't have
been discovered for weeks.

439
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:00,238
Crude attempt to bury it.

440
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:03,161
Lonely place,
yet right in the heart of London.

441
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:06,047
- Could be a cult murder.
- I beg your pardon?

442
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:08,925
Cult murder. Had a spate of them
in the States some time back.

443
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,204
Yes, but as I recall,
there wasn't this sort of mutilation.

444
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:15,317
Sergeant, I want an ident
on this as quickly as possible.

445
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:16,442
Righto, sir.

446
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:18,404
Your boys have been saved
some trouble, anyway.

447
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:21,365
- What?
- She was already wearing a shroud.

448
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,202
So you fancy going
to the pictures tonight?

449
00:44:26,287 --> 00:44:28,676
- What do you want to go and see?
- I don't mind, darling.

450
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,837
There's a good one on at the Essoldo.

451
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:33,805
Laura doesn't come from Ramsgate.
I'm sure of it, Bob.

452
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,400
Look, will you just forget it, Jess?

453
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,796
You know, Gaynor was right.
She comes from Watford.

454
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:40,879
Just forget it, will you? And...

455
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:51,079
That ident on the victim, sir.
Easier than we thought.

456
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:54,879
- We've got her prints on record.
- She had some form?

457
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,401
Illegal possession of drugs
about four months ago.

458
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,559
- "Laura Jane Bellows."
- Chelsea bird.

459
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:03,996
She lived off the King's Road,
Moore Street.

460
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:07,875
Right. Let's have a comprehensive list
of her friends and associates. Her circle.

461
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,403
Let's get a complete picture
of her movements up until last night.

462
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,997
Came from Hatfield originally.

463
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,319
Someone better inform her parents.

464
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:20,717
According to Chelsea,
she moved around in a pretty tight group.

465
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:24,238
Sort of fringe people. All fairly young.

466
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:25,396
Names?

467
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,519
There's a list there.

468
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:32,160
This is a note of some of the people
she was involved with...

469
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:34,602

Van Helsing?

Her grandfather's Professor Lorrimer
Van Helsing, London University.

Yes. That extortion mob.
Money by blackmail.

Something to do with witchcraft,
some cult or other.

480

Yeah, he's a bit of a specialist
in that sort of thing.

Yes? Murray here.

Well, I'm sorry,
the press will just have to wait.

486
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:16,602
No, nothing yet.

487
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:20,157
No, I'll issue a statement
just as soon as I have more information.

488

Gruesome bastards.

and talk to Professor Van Helsing...

00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:31,559
and his granddaughter.

492
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,963
Is this your place, Johnny?

493
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:45,685
Come in for a bite.

494
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:49,560
Poor place, but it's mine.

495
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:51,797
It's really fantastic.

496
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,082
Like it?

497
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,158
Yeah. You've even got taste.

498
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,356
Sit down and make yourself comfortable.

499

They were all zonked
when they recorded this.

Aren't they always?

It just seemed that this might
be a starting point, sir.

507
00:47:46,007 --> 00:47:48,646
You've helped us in the past,
and there are aspects of this case...

508
00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:50,399
that might interest you professionally.

509
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:54,196
From what you've told me, Inspector, all
this seems to be a little outside my scope.

510
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,279
This particular sort of ghastliness
is not really in my line at all.

511
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:00,916
The mutilation of the girl's body
was very thorough. Almost ritualistic.

512
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:02,998
Rather puts one in mind
of those cult murders...

513
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:05,237
they had in America some time back.

514
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:07,283
You remember?
They referred to them as demonic.

515
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:10,006
- Demonic?
- Well, that's how the press put it.

516
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,523
Yes. Some youngsters. I remember.

517
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,485
- You think this could be a cult killing?
- Could it?

518
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:19,445
Is there some cult that goes about
slaughtering its victims in this way?

519
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:20,562
You're the authority.

520
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,798
Well, mutilation could be the work
of some homicidal pervert.

521
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:26,765
The cults we're plagued with
in this country are far less violent.

- No, thank you, sir.

524
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,242
Of course, there was that
business on Hampstead Heath...

525
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:35,160
but then that was a case
of sadomasochism, as I recall.

My sphere of interest concerns the occult.

Psychophenomena as related to history.

00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:43,646
I don't see how this business
fits in with that.

The postmortem findings
were rather interesting.

530

There are signs which indicate
that as the girl was dying...

531
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:54,365
her body was drained of blood,
and that's the part that really worries me.

532
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,884
Why would anyone do that?

533
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,401
Unless it was some sort of ritual...

534
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:02,126
some bloody ceremonial rite.

535
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:06,004
You see, sir,
that's one of the reasons I started here.

538

London's a very cosmopolitan city.

No, not people.

00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,206
Mostly.

- Does that mean something?
- It could.

547
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,881
- Could indicate.
- What?

548
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:26,516
That the killer was trying to obliterate
the real cause of death:

549
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:28,281
Vampirism.

550

You're joking.

551
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,803
You dismiss the possibility?

The most terrible,
the most dangerous vampire of all time.

557
00:50:57,727 --> 00:51:01,003
But before that, he collected proof.
Positive proof.

Of course.

Otherwise we wouldn't need
a police force, would we?

567
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:30,916
Exactly.

568
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:37,159

to hear when I came here today.

No.

No, I don't.

573
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,763
So what was the other reason
you came here for?

574

I beg your pardon?

575
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:52,125
You wanted information from me.
You've got that.

576
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:55,883
Earlier, you said it was only one
of the reasons why you came to see me.

Your granddaughter. Jessica Van Helsing.

580
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:04,641
- But why?
- To ask a few questions.

581
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:07,524
In heaven's name, about this?

582
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,565
Yes, sir.

583
00:52:09,647 --> 00:52:11,478
- But she's not involved.
- Vaguely.

584
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,000
What do you mean "vaguely"?

585

00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,643
No, it's all right.

592
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:34,286
Watch what you say.

593
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:36,642
Be careful. You know what I mean?

594
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:38,718
Of course I know what you mean.

595
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:42,038
Maybe I better come in with you
just to see what they want.

596
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,316
No.

597
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,962
Good night.

598
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,878
I'll be at Joe Mitcham's place
if you need me.

599
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:49,002
Okay.

600

Jessica, will you come in here, please?

601
00:53:06,047 --> 00:53:08,117
- I'm very tired.
- It's important.

602

Jessica, this is Inspector Murray, police.

603
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,519
Grandfather, what have you
been up to now?

604
00:53:19,607 --> 00:53:21,757
- He wants to talk to you.
- About what?

605
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,997
About last night, Miss Van Helsing.

606
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:26,602
Specifically, about your movements
last night.

Who you were with, what you were doing.

608
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:32,277
- Is something wrong?
- Just answer the questions, please.

609
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,846
I don't know.
Tooled around with the group.

610
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,156
The group?

611
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:38,882
Names?

612
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,323
- What is this?
- Please.

613
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:46,520
- The usual crowd.
- Jessica, please.

614

616

Laura Bellows?

617
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:00,322
Yes, as I recall,
she was with us for a while.

618
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:02,645
Where did you go?

619
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:06,404
I don't know. Just around, I suppose.

620
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:08,480
Specifically.

621
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,836
I wish somebody would tell me
what this is all about.

622
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,280
Murder, Jessica.

623
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:17,758
That's what all this is about.
A ghastly, horrible, obscene murder.

624
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,366
You mean Laura?

625
00:54:19,447 --> 00:54:21,915
Yes, Miss Van Helsing. Laura Bellows.

626
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,764
Jessica, where were you?

627
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:33,197
Down by the embankment.
An old empty church.

628
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,319
Unhallowed ground.

629
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:37,880
And what happened there?

- Yes.

- Inspector...
- But she was alive then.

No. Most of them will probably be

All right, Miss Van Helsing.

You should give her a sleeping pill

Yes.

In the meantime, it might be best
if you kept her home for a while.

01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,717
I do not believe that
my granddaughter's friends...

790
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:16,719
were chosen by the monster
by pure coincidence.

791
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,236
There is a pattern here...

792
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:21,205
and the key to that pattern
is this boy you're still searching for...

793
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,640
Johnny Alucard.

794
01:07:23,047 --> 01:07:26,517
Incidentally, if you write
his name backwards it spells Dracula.

795
01:07:26,687 --> 01:07:28,678
Silver bullets and cloves of garlic.

796
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:32,840
Silver bullets are impractical,
and garlic is not 100% reliable...

797
01:07:33,687 --> 01:07:36,759
but it is true to say
that the monster abhors silver...

798
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:40,920
silver of any kind, especially, for instance,
a silver-bladed knife.

799
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,838
There is also a theory...

800
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:47,556
that a vampire may be destroyed
by being immersed in clear running water.

801
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,797
- Clear running water?
- Yes.

802
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:52,363
Fortunately, some things do work.

803
01:07:53,127 --> 01:07:55,083
A vampire attacks for two basic reasons.

804
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:58,443
Now, firstly, it needs human blood
to nourish itself.

805
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:02,122
Secondly, it will attack
to curse its victim...

806
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:05,483
to make him or her like itself,
the living dead.

807
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:09,324
This monster is strong again.
It has drunk blood.

808
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:13,606
Now it will infect others.
May have infected others already.

809
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:19,401
Unless it is stopped,
it will continue to infect others.

810
01:08:20,727 --> 01:08:23,036
Please, let me help.

811
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:30,676
Professor, if any of my superiors
had been listening...

812
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:33,520
to what you've just said,
they'd have you certified.

813
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:37,640
If they thought I was going to take
any notice of it, they'd have me certified.

814
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:40,195
Are you going to take any notice,
Inspector?

815
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,439
Let me put it this way...

816
01:08:42,527 --> 01:08:44,483
I don't know who killed
those three women...

817
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:48,242
but officially, I'm putting it down
to the work of a criminally insane killer.

818
01:08:48,327 --> 01:08:49,885
And unofficially?

819
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,483
What do you want me to do?

820
01:08:55,607 --> 01:08:59,156
For a start,
take the police guard off St. Bartolph's.

821
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,680
Is that wise?

822
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:02,758
It may be the site of Dracula's grave.

823
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,041
If it is...

824
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:07,085
he'll need to return to it
instinctively each night...

825
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:08,759
just before the dawn.

826
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:11,078
I think he was trying
to get there last night.

827
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:12,839
At least we know he was
near Falstaff Road.

828
01:09:12,927 --> 01:09:13,962
All right.

829
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:16,607
And let me know the moment
you find Johnny Alucard.

830
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,166
Don't let your men arrest him.

831
01:09:18,247 --> 01:09:21,159
Have him followed,
and let me know immediately.

832
01:09:21,527 --> 01:09:23,802
- Now that coffee bar.
- I'm sorry, Professor.

833
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:25,957
The Cavern coffee bar
will have to be closed down.

834
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:27,241
The drug squad will insist.

835
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:30,842
They have evidence that it's being used
as a distribution center for pot and LSD.

836
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:34,237
That's a pity. It may have been
a good starting-off point.

837
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,041
Never mind.

838
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:38,403
Let's just hope I'm right
about St. Bartolph's.

839
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:41,797
I just hope you're wrong
about this entire business, Professor.

840
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:44,358
I wish I was, Inspector.

841
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:46,799
I wish to God I was.

842
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:17,119
BOB: You there, Johnny?

843
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,683
JOHNNY: Hi, Bob. I've been waiting for you.

844
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,156
[Doorbell rings]

845
01:11:42,287 --> 01:11:44,005
Is Jess Van Helsing in, please?

846
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:45,805
- Who wants to know?
- Bob?

847
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:48,321
It's all right, Mrs. Donnelly.
Bob's a friend of mine.

848
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:50,443
But how should I know?
Your grandfather said...

849
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,280
It's all right. Bob, what's been happening?

850
01:11:55,087 --> 01:11:56,998
Thank you, Mrs. Donnelly.

851
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,279
Jess, all hell's busted loose.

852
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:01,846
You heard about Laura.

853
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:04,725
Now they found Gaynor
the same way, very dead.

854
01:12:06,247 --> 01:12:07,282
Where's Johnny?

855
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,722
I mean, that guy must have
blown his cool but good.

856
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:11,286
Anyway, they've got him now.

857
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:13,005
- Where?
- Down at the Cavern.

858
01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:16,523
Crazy gook just walked in there
as if nothing had happened.

859
01:12:16,847 --> 01:12:18,644
He must be around the twist.

860
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:20,963
Anyway, the other kids
are down there now...

861
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:22,765
going over statements and things...

862
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:24,963
and they thought you ought
to go down there, too...

863
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:26,400
so they sent me around for you.

864
01:12:26,487 --> 01:12:29,445
- To go there now?
- Yeah. I've got the car outside.

865
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,365
Just a moment, young lady.

866
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:35,836
It's cool, really. I'll be back very soon.

867
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,440
Why don't we go in the front way?

868
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:10,597
It's full of geeks and newspapermen.

869
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,205
There's no one here.

870
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:36,400
What's going on?

871
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:40,682
Bob.

872
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:44,202
No.

873
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,319
No!

874
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,441

No!

No, Bob!

877
01:14:08,647 --> 01:14:11,286
No! Wait! She's not for us.

878
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,763
She belongs to the Master.

879
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:15,520
He commands.

880
01:14:20,487 --> 01:14:22,603

- Hello, Mrs. Donnelly.

881
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:24,644
This is Professor Van Helsing.

882
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:27,799
Everything all right?
Can I speak to my granddaughter?

883
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,243
<i>She's not here, Professor.</i>
<i>She went out some time ago.</i>

884
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:35,242
<i>A young fellow came to call for her.</i>
<i>Said he was a friend.</i>

885
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,445
Went out?
Did they say where they were going?

886
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,720
<i>I did just happen to overhear.</i>
<i>They said something about a cavern.</i>

887
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,478
<i>Professor, are you still there?</i>

888
01:15:34,247 --> 01:15:35,396
Jessica?

889
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:54,918
Oh, my God. Jessica.

890
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,846
I'm sorry. I was...

891
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:15,406
Professor Van Helsing!

892
01:16:16,527 --> 01:16:18,245
I've been looking for you everywhere.

893
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,239
- Who are you?
- Anna Bryant. I'm a friend of Jessica's.

894
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,557
I phoned you just now
and your housekeeper said...

895
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:26,525
neither of you were there and then
she said something about the Cavern.

896
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:27,801
Do you know where Jessica is?

897
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:29,843
Your housekeeper said
she'd gone to the Cavern.

898
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:30,996
No, she's not there.

899
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,726
I drove round there, then I spotted you
running away from the place.

900
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:36,480
- What is it you want?
- Is Jessica missing now?

901
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:38,717
- Yes. Now, if you please...
- if she's in any danger...

902
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,480
I believe she's in the gravest danger,
and I'm wasting time.

903
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,797
She could be with Johnny Alucard.

904
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:46,885
She could be,
but no one knows where he lives.

905
01:16:47,287 --> 01:16:49,164
- I do, Professor.
- What?

906
01:16:49,247 --> 01:16:52,045
- But the police said none of you knew.
- Yes, I know. I didn't tell them.

907
01:16:52,127 --> 01:16:55,403
I didn't tell anyone,
but I went there once, for kicks.

908
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:57,685
He was so weird.

909

Yes, I know where he lives.

You better leave me alone, man.

You had better tell me what these are for.

into the creature he is.

947
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,966
By making her into one of the living dead.

948
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:34,481
A vampire.

949
01:21:36,887 --> 01:21:38,957
You said
he'll make for St. Bartolph's, eventually.

950
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,515
In the name of heaven, Inspector,
keep away from that place.

951
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:43,325
- We must do something.
- It's daylight now.

952
01:21:43,407 --> 01:21:45,045
You wouldn't find anything there.

953
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:47,163
- Hold tight, sir.
- And tonight?

954
01:21:48,567 --> 01:21:50,683
Give me one hour there, alone.

955
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:54,324
Just one hour, as the sun sets.

956
01:21:55,047 --> 01:21:57,845
Keep clear of the place for that one hour.

957
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:01,682
I should get this looked at
at St. Stephens, sir...

958
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:04,042
- before you do anything else.
- Yes, of course.

959
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,322
There. Put your hand there. That's it.

960
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:12,766
Apart from your theory,
there isn't any reason for me to go there.

961
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:15,441
There are other leads I could follow.

962
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:16,921
Thank you.

963
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:20,325
But we'll be looking in there
later on, Professor.

964
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:21,960
As you wish.

965
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:24,676
Thank you.

966
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:39,636
Jessica.

967
01:23:43,047 --> 01:23:44,446
Dear Jessica.

968
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:54,641
Thank God.

969
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:57,681
Jessica?

970
01:24:00,567 --> 01:24:03,877
Jessica, darling,
I can't wake you from this.

971
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:07,046
Nobody can, except him.

972
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:19,445
I have to leave you for a little while,
but it won't be for long.

973
01:24:24,367 --> 01:24:25,766
Not for long.

Count Dracula!

977
01:26:20,447 --> 01:26:22,165
Look on me, Dracula.

978
01:26:24,367 --> 01:26:25,766
Look on me...

979
01:26:27,047 --> 01:26:28,446
and remember.

980
01:27:02,487 --> 01:27:05,081
You would play your brains against mine?

981
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,635
Against me, who has commanded nations?

Jessica, don't go near him!

985
01:28:22,087 --> 01:28:24,317
In God's name, don't touch him!

986
01:29:01,647 --> 01:29:05,606
In the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost!

Grandfather, I'm sorry.

989

Put this around your shoulders.

990
01:30:40,767 --> 01:30:43,759
All right, Jessica. Come on.

991
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:48,282
There.

992
01:30:49,007 --> 01:30:50,918
That's all right, Jessica.
