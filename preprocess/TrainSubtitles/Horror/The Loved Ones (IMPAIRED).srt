335
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,701
this is the song we're gonna dance to
at my wedding.

336
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:19,405
# I live, I breathe

337
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,705
# I let it rain on me

338
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,868
# I see... #

339
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,117
But you're not him.

340
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,992
You're just another FROG!

341
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,615
(Song continues)

342
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,197
# I crave, I love

343
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:39,246
# I've waited long enough...

344
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,873
Dance with me, Daddy.

345
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:52,202
# Am I not pretty enough?

346
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,996
# Is my heart too broken?

347
00:50:56,125 --> 00:51:03,702
# Do I cry too much?

348
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:07,951
# Am I too outspoken?
# Don't I make you laugh?

349
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,780
# Should I try it harder?

350
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:17,116
# Why do you see
right through me?

351
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:23,076
# I laugh, I feel

352
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:26,826
# I make believe it's real

353
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:31,122
# I fall, I freeze

354
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,493
# I pray down on my knees

355
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,867
# I hope, I stand

356
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,073
# I take it like a man... #

357
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,745
You're the Prince.

358
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:53,825
That's why I can't find one I like.

359
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,750
It's always been you, Daddy.

360
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:06,158
Just you and me...

361
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,906
# Don't I make you laugh?

362
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:15,990
# Should I try it harder?

363
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:21,574
#Why do you see
right through me?

364
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:22,697
# Why do you... #

365
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,369
Thanks.

366
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,243
I contacted Search & Rescue.
They'll be here in the morning.

367
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:43,497
But if you think of anything
or you need me, you ring me.

368
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,999
We'll find him.

369
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,870
'The person you are calling
is unavailable.'

370
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,615
'Leave a message after the tone.'

371
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,619
Hi Mum, I think it's late over there
so you're probably asleep.

372
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,786
So er...

373
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:17,329
I'll try again later.

374
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,323
OK, bye.

375
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,161
Catch!

376
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,163
(Screaming)

377
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:17,331
(Eric) Drinkie, drinkie.
(Lola) Sing for your supper.

378
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,040
(Screaming)

379
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:22,203
Not loud enough.

380
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,700
# She's a lost cause,
she's a lost, lost cause... #

381
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,664
(Turns car off)

382
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,573
Fuck me.

383
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

384
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:27,409
When I said go somewhere else
I meant off school property.

385
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,995
You're my first drilling.

386
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,206
The trick is not to go too far.

387
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,244
Just enough
to break through the skull.

388
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:06,614
- Do you know how to turn it on?
- I'm not stupid.

389
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,162
(Testing drill)

390
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,913
Remove the King's crown,
please, Daddy.

391
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,289
You've got to push harder.

392
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,282
Two hands.

393
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,744
Cradle it into the body.

394
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:08,748
That's the way.

395
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,036
Stop!

396
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,664
Perfect.

397
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:29,829
(Kettle boiling)

398
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:36,534
It works, you know.

399
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:41,411
It boils your brains
and turns you into one of them.

400
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:51,158
Careful, it's hot.

401
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,536
Sorry!

402
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,869
You've got to give it a bigger tip.

403
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:47,124
The hole's too small,
can you please make it bigger?

404
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,413
Daddy?

405
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,243
Daddy!

406
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,740
Daddy!

407
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,498
Daddy.

408
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:14,450
(Door closing)

409
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:29,579
(Jamie) OK. You all right?
(Mia) Mmm.

410
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:33,246
All right.
Now, we've just got two steps.

411
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,496
Must've danced her off her feet.

412
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:20,823
(Mia crying)

413
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,415
Why can't you find him?

414
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,333
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.

415
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,957
Good night, Mummy.

416
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,038
'Lola Stone.
That's who asked me.'

417
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:13,623
Hello?

418
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,704
I'm going to your house now.

419
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,620
I'm going to stab your mummy
in the neck,

420
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,991
just like you did to my daddy.

421
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:51,080
And then I'm going to stab Holly
in the heart.

422
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:54,496
Just like you did to me.

423
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:02,198
# Am I not pretty enough?

424
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:07,994
# Is my heart too broken?

425
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:13,740
# Do I cry too much?

426
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:19,702
# Am I too outspoken?

427
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:25,289
# Don't I make you laugh?

428
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,324
# Should I try harder?

429
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:39,330
# Why do you see
right through me? #
