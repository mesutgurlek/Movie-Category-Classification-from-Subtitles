What does it mean?

497
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:09,521
I don't know. Nobody knows.
It's just a big mystery.

498
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:13,258
Maybe it's a message
from the local Indians or...

499
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:15,522
Or a word or...

500

Or just a last word.

Nobody knows for sure.

502
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:22,366
But maybe it's...

503
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,562
Maybe it's a warning.

504
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:27,832
A warning, like an error warning

your computer gives you
right before it crashes.

506

A warning from who?

Does it really matter? Huh?

508
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:37,913

this little warning right before the...

You can't say that it's human

That's me.

Never.

658
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:15,951
Okay, once.

659
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:19,528

Your good thing

1003
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,871
Is about to come to an end

1004
01:25:43,482 --> 01:25:47,942
Your real good thing

1005
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:52,716
Is about to come to an end

1006
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:59,095
All those nights I watched the four walls

1007
01:26:00,732 --> 01:26:03,792
I did not have to watch them all alone

1008
01:26:05,971 --> 01:26:08,838
When other men said they wanted me

1009
01:26:11,143 --> 01:26:15,136
I didn't have to tell them
I was your very own

1010
01:26:16,982 --> 01:26:19,473
You have all the love I've got

1011
01:26:20,752 --> 01:26:24,711
Even ice melts to water and gets hot

1012
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:28,754
Look out
Your good thing

1013
01:26:30,429 --> 01:26:33,921
Is about to come to an end

1014
01:26:37,436 --> 01:26:41,896
Your real good thing

1015
01:26:44,343 --> 01:26:45,970
Is about to end

1016
01:26:49,481 --> 01:26:51,608
Getting myself back together

1017
01:26:54,653 --> 01:26:57,781
Is gonna be a big problem, I know

1018
01:27:00,192 --> 01:27:03,218
But when the right man say he wants me

1019
01:27:05,697 --> 01:27:09,690
You can bet I won't say no

1020
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:14,671
'Cause your real good thing

1021
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:19,741
Is about to end

1022
01:27:21,313 --> 01:27:25,750
Your real, your good thing

1023
01:27:26,552 --> 01:27:28,349
Your good thing, baby

1024
01:27:29,021 --> 01:27:30,613
Your good thing

1025
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,151
Your good thing

1026
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:36,461
Is about to come to an end

1027
01:27:36,662 --> 01:27:39,290
Yeah, yeah

1028
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:41,924
Yeah, your good thing

1029
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,433
Your good thing
