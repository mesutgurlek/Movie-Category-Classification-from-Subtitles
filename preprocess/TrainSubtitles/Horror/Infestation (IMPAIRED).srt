Right.

No. I made that mistake already.

Anything can happen

These are human beings in cocoons.
We can't leave them like this.

135
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:21,192
You wake everyone up,
you gotta give an explanation,

136

and then everyone goes off
on their own tangents.

So I'm thinking
the safest place for these people

They like noise.

We could wait it out, stay here?

we could be too much
for them to control.

We were looking for bedding in
the employee lounge and I found these.

306
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:59,001
Congratulations.

307
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:04,642
Er... They're for you, actually.
I noticed you're in heels.

308
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,858
We'll be doing a lot of walking.
Heels are loud.

309
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,763

Yeah.

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,012
I found them in a desk.
I don't even smoke, you know.

314
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:45,572
I figured, what the hell.
What a day, huh?

315
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,114
Hey, did you come
to our office Christmas party?

316
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:52,178
- No.
- Are you on match. com?

317
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:57,624
Sorry. I just keep thinking that I know
you from somewhere. I don't know.

318
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:01,186
Maybe your mom had your picture
in her office or something.

Maybe.

I barely know you.

Oh, my God. I peed a little.

332
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:12,741
Well, I couldn't sleep.
I thought maybe I was hungry.

333
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,649
Well, you definitely don't want anything
in here, that's for sure.

No.

Pathologically witty to cope with
family stress. Father issues, obviously.

You consider yourself spiritual,
just so you can meet women.

Feelings weren't honoured in your home,

387

409
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:26,006
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe it's because she was too weak.

410
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,578
Or she'd already died.

411
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,099

Yeah. Yeah, I still got... Yeah.

Hell, yeah, I still got those smokes.

414
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,682

our part to repopulate the planet.

me the type of girl you really are.

00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,131
Do you have any maps inside, Dad?

620
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,010
In my office.

621
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,614
In... I'm allowed? I can unlock it?

622
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,873
Dad, I'm...
I'm sure she's gonna turn up, OK?

00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:15,752
Yeah.

628
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,689
- Maybe I could look at it first.
- Could you wait for eight seconds?

- Mm.

- How's the food?

00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:59,640
Oh, yeah. Good.

633
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:03,551
Goddamn. I left them in the kitchen.

634
00:51:03,631 --> 00:51:05,083
In the kitchen? Dad, Dad.

635
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:08,537
Before you go into the kitchen,
can I see the map for a minute, please?

Properly, yes.

We're just gonna plot the quickest route

was that, but now some...

No, no, no. No, no. Listen, listen.

My number. In case you decide there's
any damage to the front of your vehicle.

00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:03,123
Oh, OK. And you just happened
to have it written down?

That's a fantastic question.

And I offered it. She said no.

Can I get yours, too,
in case I wanna sue you?

704
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,575
Or ask you to dinner?

I tried the shortwave this morning.

00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:19,426
A few automated distress signals,
but no live broadcast.

713
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,997
I never heard that before.

714
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,803
- What's this?
- Oh, yeah.

715
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:28,749
Those hearing aids, they got fried.
The bug juice just toasted 'em.

716
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:32,813
Now, Hugo and I are gonna be ready
to leave in a second.

Put these on ASAP.

Camo? Dad, the...
the bugs are blind, Dad.

719
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,247
If we move at five miles per hour,

720
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:45,668
we should make it to Gibsonton
by sundown.

721
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,924
I think I should be involved
in the decision making from now on.

00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:52,807
Cooper, come on.
You're here. You made it here.

723
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,641
Well done. Bravo.

724
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:57,595
Now, just drop your ego.
Let me take over.

725
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,709
Drop?

726
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,964
Dad, look,
I was thinking last night, you know.

727
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:05,889
I was gonna say something.
I should have.

728
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:10,646
- I think I should go to the nest.
- What?

729
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:13,670
That girl, Sara, might be there
or might not be there, but...

730
00:57:13,754 --> 00:57:18,162
- You have a plan to go to the nest?
- No, I don't, but... Look, I think...

731
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:23,186
Dad, I've never done anything in my life
that merits, you know...

732
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:26,137
I'm selfish. In fact, I'm solipsistic.

733
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,317
That's a real word. Look it up
in the dictionary. It's in there.

734
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:32,737
- I'm aware it's a word.
- OK, well, then...

735
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:37,343
Look, I don't expect you to go.

736
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,290
But I really think I should go,
and I don't think I can do it by myself.

737
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:44,322
- I think I need... I need your help.
- I think it's a crazy idea.

738
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:47,276
Of course you'd say that.
Of course you'd think it was crazy.

739
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:50,655
Because, you know, feelings
were never honoured in our home.

740
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:02,733
Let me tell you a little story.
You're an idiot.

741
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,315
Oh, my God. I'm done.

742
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:07,306
- Always a pissing contest.
- I've no time for this. I'm done.

743
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:16,243
Alright. So what do you want?
An apology?

744
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:19,160
If you did,
then what would that be for, huh?

745
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:23,680
I have no idea. You and your mother
were always the hypersensitive ones.

746
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,869
- I don't have those needs.
- Mom was not hypersensitive, OK?

747
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:29,857
See what I mean?

748
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:35,310
Would it kill you
just to admit for one second

749
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,183
that what I've done so far
isn't terrible?

750
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:43,439
Cooper, you just don't make
good decisions, alright?

751
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:47,887
Somewhere along the line,
you did not develop good logic skills.

752
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:54,145
Are you gonna take this innocent
with you on your suicide mission?

753
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:56,787
Fuck.

754
00:58:56,874 --> 00:59:00,899
Hugo, you're gonna stay with my dad.

755
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:04,504
Thank you.
You've saved my life a trillion times.

756
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:10,026
Goddamn it, Coop! He's following you.

757
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:15,821
Hugo, stay with my dad, OK?

it was mint chocolate chip.

it was Hugo, Hugo was you.
