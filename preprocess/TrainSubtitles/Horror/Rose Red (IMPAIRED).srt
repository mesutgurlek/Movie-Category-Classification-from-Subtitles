1
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,837
Man: What the hell were
you thinking taking her that way?!

2
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,840
- The park is the other way!
- Girl: Annie wanted--

3
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:59,176
Man: What-- what does Annie want?
I mean, Annie can't talk,

4
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:01,303
- she can't think, she can't--
- Girl: She can think.

5
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,430
If you ever
looked at her you'd know.

6
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,975
Woman: Please. She's all right.
That's the main thing.

7
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:09,103
- Can't you just stop it?
- Man: Oh, you know this?

8
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:12,147
You know she's all right.
What if the damn dog was rabid?

9
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,900
Girl: It wasn't.
Mrs. Stanton told me.

10
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:17,611
Man: What? And you believe her?
Just like that?

11
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:19,738
( Theme from "A Summer Place" )
That woman's an idiot,

12
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:24,034
a careless idiot.
Anyone can say anything, Sissy.

13
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:27,329
Maybe someday you'll learn that,
that anyone can say anything.

14
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,748
Sissy: I saw the dog tag, Daddy.
Why do you always

15
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:34,712
- treat me like a fool?
- Woman: Stop it! Both of you.

16
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,089
She'll hear.
Do you want to upset her?

17
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,134
Father: Oh come on, honey,
give me a break. You might as well...

18
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:43,762
( music blasting )

19
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,644
Boy: Come on, guys!
( children laughing )

20
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,313
Wait up!

21
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:17,671
I figured you could use
something stronger. I know I could.

22
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:22,927
Down the hatch, come on.

23
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,970
It's quick, isn't it?

24
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:28,807
What they do.
And it doesn't hurt them.

25
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:33,312
It's quick, it doesn't hurt,
they just go to sleep.

26
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,857
Come on, drink your drink.

27
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,734
Woman: You know
as well as I do

28
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,362
that Buddy never bit anybody
before in his life.

29
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,072
It was her.

30
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:46,158
He sensed something in her.

31
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,537
( music blasting )

32
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,587
Sissy: Annie,
please open the door!

33
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:02,216
Father: Annie,
open this door, now!

34
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:04,510
( door rattles )

35
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:08,138
Drink your drink.
It'll make you feel better.

36
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:12,434
I'm telling you, there's something
wrong with that little girl,

37
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,812
and I don't just mean
that she's autistic.

38
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,481
( humming to music )

39
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:24,905
Sissy:
Please open the door!

40
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:28,409
Father: Annie, turn the music down!
Somebody'll call the damn cops!

41
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,371
Mrs. Stanton:
There's something about her

42
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,999
that's wrong.

43
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,585
And Buddy sensed it.

44
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:41,088
Dogs know, oh you bet.

45
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,299
( rumbling )

46
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,427
Did you hear that?

47
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,803
Music.

48
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,264
Someone has it
really cranked out there.

49
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,976
( loud music continues )

50
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,690
( humming )

51
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,444
( rumbling )

52
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,404
- Oh!
- What the hell?!

53
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:07,781
It's an earthquake!

54
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:10,034
It's not coming
from the ground-- It's--

55
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,665
( Annie sings )

56
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:21,837
Ahh!

57
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,555
Aah!

58
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,018
( screaming )

59
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:37,603
Come on! Run!

60
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,361
- Mr. Stanton: Run!
- Ahh!!

61
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,612
Come on, come on!

62
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:52,701
- Sissy: Open the door.
- Father: Now, Annie!

63
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:58,374
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

64
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,797
( Mrs. Stanton screams )

65
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,842
- Oh God!
- What's happening?!

66
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,051
I don't know!

67
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,554
Father: Annie, let us in!

68
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,264
Annie!

69
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,975
Sissy: Annie, please,
open the door.

70
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,810
( door shaking )

71
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:22,606
Kill it, Sissy.

72
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,774
( music stops )

73
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,901
Just what the hell
are you doing?

74
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,322
What the--

75
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,911
Sister, look at this.

76
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:52,845
Sister, I got Baby.

77
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:58,601
Yes, I know.

78
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,233
Annie...

79
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,445
what have you done?

80
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:14,301
( crows caw )

81
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:22,393
Woman: And that concludes

82
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:26,313
this years' course-work
in the psychology of the unseen world.

83
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,861
I would like to leave you
with three thoughts if I may.

84
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:36,031
The first, is that the investigation
of psychic phenomena

85
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:41,453
is an honorable pursuit, in spite
of the field's tattered reputation.

86
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:46,041
The second, is that reality
is not always quantifiable.

87
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:51,505
Our inability to count, weigh,
sort or photograph some things,

88
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,884
does not mean that
those things are non-existent.

89
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,387
Third, and most important,

90
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,474
next week's exam will not
be graded on the curve.

91
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:05,060
( laughter )

92
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:08,230
Seriously, I thank you all
for your attention

93
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:13,277
and to remind you of what
someone rather famous once said,

94
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,446
"The truth is out there."

95
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,823
Enjoy your summer.

96
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,618
Student: Professor Reardon,
a question please.

97
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,078
A question.

98
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,165
Your question?

99
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,168
There are rumors
that you're planning

100
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,795
a scientific investigation
of Rose Red this summer,

101
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,674
the Rimbauer Mansion,
a sort of psychic field trip.

102
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,134
Is that true?

103
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,263
- You are...?
- Kevin Bollinger, Class of 'O3.

104
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:44,350
I don't recognize you,
Mr. Bollinger.

105
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,435
Is that because the group
is so large,

106
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,689
or could it be that this is your
first visit to our happy family?

107
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:51,690
( class chuckles )

108
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:54,109
Actually, I'm a reporter
for the campus newspaper.

109
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,655
Oh, my sympathies,
Mr. Bollinger.

110
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,782
Kevin: Is it true,
Professor Reardon, and if it is,

111
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:02,493
are you planning on using
departmental funds

112
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:06,247
or college general funds
to finance your latest spook hunt?

113
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:10,918
As any regular attendee

114
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,462
of these classes will tell you,
Mr. Bollinger,

115
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,882
I'm extremely interested
in Rose Red.

116
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,553
I talk about it all the time.
Have a picture on my office wall,

117
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:23,639
not to mention
one of Ellen Rimbauer.

118
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:27,893
But as Professor Miller can tell you,
I have filed no request

119
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,479
for either general funds
or money from the department

120
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:33,148
to underwrite
what you term "a spook hunt."

121
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:36,485
Reardon: If you feel like
asking him to confirm that, he's--

122
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,070
he's right up there.

123
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,074
Reardon: A question of mine,
Mr. Bollinger.

124
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:43,659
Did Professor Miller, perhaps,

125
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:47,371
suggest you stop by my class
to pose your question

126
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:50,833
instead of dropping by my office
like a normal reporter?

127
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,587
Reardon:
Never mind, Mr. Bollinger.

128
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,047
Let's consider
the issue closed, shall we?

129
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,509
- But you never answered my question.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

130
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,929
Exam next Tuesday at 2:00
and I'll see you then.

131
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,316
If I embarrassed you,
Professor Reardon, I am sorry.

132
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,358
Hmm.

133
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,903
I don't believe it,
Mr. Bollinger.

134
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,364
Carl Miller stuck a key
in your back and wound you up.

135
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,242
And it was his intention
that I be embarrassed.

136
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:26,785
I am not.

137
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:29,038
Even if you're not planning
on using college

138
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,415
or departmental funds
for your Rose Red expedition,

139
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,960
won't you be using a lot of
psychology department equipment,

140
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:37,087
a lot of very
expensive equipment?

141
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,923
Haven't you already
entered into an agreement

142
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,884
with Steven Rimbauer,
the last remaining family member?

143
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,969
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bollinger.

144
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,725
- Girl: Hi, Professor Reardon.
- Hello.

145
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,980
Man: Well, Joyce.

146
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:57,274
- We have to discuss this.
- I think not.

147
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,610
Well, we'll have
to discuss it sooner or later.

148
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,239
You know, speaking for
the department, I think I can say

149
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,617
our patience with your shenanigans
has grown quite short.

150
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,831
Reardon: "...spooks.

151
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:12,957
Somebody call..."

152
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,583
Pfff.

153
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,468
Uh...

154
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,638
( sighing )

155
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:31,058
Oh...

156
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,770
Professor Reardon?

157
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,814
I was wondering
if you could discuss my--

158
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:40,776
Not now. My office hours are
clearly posted, can't you read?

159
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,361
Oh. Sorry.

160
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,322
Oh, um, uh, wait...

161
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,449
Ms. Spruce, isn't it?

162
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,826
Kathy Spruce, that's right.

163
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,662
I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bite.

164
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:54,623
Office hours are between
2:00 and 3:00. Try me then, okay?

165
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,417
Yes, Ms. Reardon.

166
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,346
Out.

167
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,266
Out.

168
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,601
Oh...

169
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:57,228
Far out.

170
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:04,068
Hmm...

171
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,703
( telephone rings )

172
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:20,251
( rings )

173
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,172
( rings )

174
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,260
( rings )

175
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:31,720
Waterman residence.

176
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:35,099
Mr. Waterman, Joyce Reardon.

177
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,893
Waterman:
Oh, hello, Ms. Reardon.

178
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,604
I've been meaning to call,
but I've been uh...

179
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,606
Reardon: Joyce, please.

180
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,400
I've been kinda busy.

181
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:47,778
Reardon: I understand, but I'm
finalizing my list of participants

182
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,574
for my little Rose Red field trip,
and I 'd really like you in.

183
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:55,077
- Have you thought about it?
- Rose Red is a dangerous place

184
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,454
to conduct psychic experiments,
Ms. Reardon--

185
00:15:57,496 --> 00:16:00,791
Joyce.
As I'm sure you must be aware.

186
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,585
Reardon:
With all due respect, Emery,

187
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,962
Rose Red is a dead cell.

188
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:07,089
I'm sure it is,

189
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:08,841
if you're not psychic.

190
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,970
I'm sorry you feel that way.

191
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:15,806
I'll just let you get back
to what you were doing, shall I,

192
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,933
and move on to the next
name on my list?

193
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,060
I doubt
there are that many.

194
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,521
Not post-cognates
of my calibre.

195
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,983
You might be surprised.
Good afternoon.

196
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,860
Wait-- wait-- wait--

197
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,989
I didn't say no, did I?

198
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:33,490
Reardon: Didn't you?

199
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:36,869
No.
But 5,000 is a trifle low.

200
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,954
If you were to be offering
a bit more, say...

201
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,248
7,500 for instance?

202
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:45,127
- Mr. Waterman,
- Emery, please.

203
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:49,048
5,000 is my first,
last and only offer.

204
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,759
And a generous one considering
the fact that there have been

205
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,720
no phenomena in Rose Red
for five years or more.

206
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,598
Since they stopped the tours
and took away the fresh meat.

207
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,016
Isn't that what you mean?

208
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:02,228
Forgive me
but I find that ridiculous.

209
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:07,274
The funding for this expedition
is coming out of my own pocket.

210
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,318
And 5,000
is all I can afford.

211
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,654
So what do you say, Emery?
In or out?

212
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,992
All right, I'm in.
But I warn you,

213
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:20,246
if you want a videotaped
debriefing afterward, I get extra.

214
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,832
That's fine, Emery.
Memorial Day weekend.

215
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:24,375
Mark your calendar.

216
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,752
You send me a check,
Joyce, and I will.

217
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,546
Good day.

218
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,842
Putz.

219
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,786
Poisoned...

220
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,585
Guess not.

221
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,061
Whispering voice: Emery...

222
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,572
Hey, whoever you are,

223
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,909
save the warnings
for someone who's not broke.

224
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,911
Okay?

225
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:44,705
( door opens )
Woman: Emery?

226
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,500
Emery!

227
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,418
( door closes )

228
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,887
Emery!

229
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,100
Here you are.

230
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,770
There are some more bags
out in the car.

231
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,314
They're going
out of business at Griffin's.

232
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,691
Everything's 25%off.

233
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:15,486
That's too much cream,
you'll make yourself fat.

234
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,321
Er.

235
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:18,906
- I beg your pardon?
- Fat-er.

236
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,407
I'm already fat.

237
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,993
Cream clogs up
your arteries, Emer.

238
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,329
A little's okay
but that's too much.

239
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,041
Get my things out of the car.
I tell you, I made a killing.

240
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,460
Mom, I was doing
the bills just now.

241
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,170
Well,
what about the bills?

242
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:36,674
A lot of them are past due.
It's the credit cards, Mom--

243
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm very careful
with the credit cards.

244
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,971
I'm a very wise shopper.

245
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:44,890
I'll get your stuff.

246
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,853
Isn't this
just the best bear?

247
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:53,357
I'm gonna put him on the end
of my bed with Hester and Fester.

248
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,401
What rhymes
with Hester and Fester, Emmy?

249
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,612
Pester.

250
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,033
The woman from the college

251
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,244
who wants to investigate
Rose Red called again.

252
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:09,331
See? Something always turns up.
God provides, I've always said so.

253
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,708
Rose Red's
supposed to be dangerous.

254
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,919
If you take the usual precautions
you'll be fine.

255
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,381
And we'll pray, of course.
Were you able to get her up to 75?

256
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,175
No. She's financing
the expedition herself.

257
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:22,720
Or so she told you
and you believed her, of course.

258
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:25,055
You want to call her back?
I have the number.

259
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,683
No. A deal's a deal.

260
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:30,728
One of the few sensible things
your father ever said.

261
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:33,606
Did you tell her it would be
extra for interviews after?

262
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,149
- Physicals? EKG's?
- Yes.

263
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,693
And no X-rays.
They give you cancer.

264
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:42,531
Now run along and get my bags.
Then you can have your pie.

265
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,241
( door slams )

266
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,345
( loud knocking )

267
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,264
Office hours are over.
Come back tomorrow.

268
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,933
( knocking )

269
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,602
- I said office hou--
- Extra credit, Ms. Reardon.

270
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:14,230
I'll do anything,
look good in a bathing suit,

271
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:16,815
look great in one of those
French maid's outfits.

272
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,860
Come in, you idiot,
and close the door.

273
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,320
All right.

274
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:23,572
Teach, you're looking good today.

275
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,950
- Ooh...
- Mmm.

276
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,785
The idiot wants to know
how you're doing.

277
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:30,287
Well, I won't lie to you,
it's been a tough day.

278
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,122
But I have a very
important call to make.

279
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:34,166
- Oh...
- So...

280
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,127
What, this is the Wheaton girl?
The one you really want?

281
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:40,297
Her sister. If you can sit there
and keep quiet you can stay.

282
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,675
But if you feel an attack
of monkeyshines coming on,

283
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,176
then go. Get out now.

284
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,970
That's pretty
tough talk considering

285
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,056
it's my old family's homestead
you want to go exploring in.

286
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:51,141
But...
I'll be good, Dee, I swear.

287
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,352
( bell chimes )
I won't do that, sorry.

288
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,199
( phone rings )

289
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,201
Hello? Ms. Reardon?

290
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:11,412
Yes, how are you?

291
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,539
Sissy: I'm all right.
But you know how hard it is

292
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:16,167
to keep people away
from a phone in this place?

293
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,503
Also I'm on my break,
so let's make this fast.

294
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:20,546
Reardon: Uh--

295
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:21,881
I could call you later.

296
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,550
Sissy: No, I don't think so.
I still live at home

297
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:26,760
to be near Annie and...

298
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:30,014
my father knows who you are
and what you want.

299
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,974
He doesn't approve.

300
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,894
What are you saying?
Annie won't take part?

301
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:38,981
Sissy: I'm saying that
if I bring Annie to Rose Red...

302
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:43,736
the chances are good that
I could never go home again.

303
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,197
That'd be all right with me but,

304
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,325
Annie shouldn't be there without
someone who understands her.

305
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,202
Mm-hmm. And--
and your parents don't?

306
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,244
Sissy: Well...

307
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:55,581
my mother's
scared to death of her and,

308
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:58,375
my father...

309
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,586
I think my father hates her.

310
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:02,880
What can I do?

311
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:07,676
There's a school just outside
of Tacoma for people like Annie.

312
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:12,056
No, there's no one
like Annie I don't think...

313
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,099
but...

314
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:18,854
it's a place for autistic teenagers.
A good place.

315
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,943
I might as well cut right
to the chase, Ms. Reardon,

316
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:26,904
5,000 isn't gonna be enough.

317
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,532
If you can promise 10
I might try to make this happen.

318
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:33,994
10,000 done. I-- I'll bring
the check to you myself.

319
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,872
This afternoon.
Where-- where do you work?

320
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:41,210
No, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.

321
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:45,381
Reardon: Look, my time is short,
Ms. Wheaton.

322
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:49,093
Please, call me Sister,
why don't you? Everyone does.

323
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,263
Mr. Rimbauer has agreed to open
Rose Red for my group

324
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:56,141
over the Memorial Day weekend.
It's only nine days away.

325
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,269
I need to know if
I can count on Annie.

326
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:02,565
In fact I'm having an orientation
meeting this Monday night,

327
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:06,151
for the participants here
in Wimser Hall at the University.

328
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:09,572
It would be great
if Annie could join us.

329
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:14,159
You understand that if Annie goes
to Rose Red I go too, don't you?

330
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:16,912
Reardon: That--
that's fine, of course.

331
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,165
When can I know,
Ms. Wheaton? Uh, Sister.

332
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:23,294
I-- I might be able
to scrape up as much as $12,000

333
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:26,255
if uh, that is,

334
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:29,800
if you can make a solid commitment
to the expedition right now.

335
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:31,760
I can't do that.

336
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,555
- Goodbye, Mrs. Reardon.
- Reardon: Wait!

337
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,640
When can I expect
to hear from you?

338
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,809
- I'll be in touch.
- Wait! The-- the--

339
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,519
orientation Monday night?

340
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:43,063
I don't know... it...

341
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:45,774
I don't think so.

342
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:48,027
Ohh.
( dial tone )

343
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:52,990
$10,000?
$12,000? You know, I'm-- I'm

344
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:55,284
starting to think that I sold
the old homestead cheap.

345
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:59,371
You didn't sell it, you're renting it.
For a single weekend.

346
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,334
I've gotta have Annie Wheaton.

347
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,544
Why?

348
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,963
I've got the makings of a good
group here, but they're candles.

349
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:10,591
Annie Wheaton
is a searchlight.

350
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:14,720
If anyone can wake up Rose Red,
she is the one.

351
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:15,971
I told you before, Dee,

352
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:18,182
waking up Rose Red
isn't a good idea.

353
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:21,143
I want Annie.
I want Annie Wheaton.

354
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,812
( creaking )

355
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,111
Hello, dear.

356
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,072
Hey, Mom. Hi, Dad.

357
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:35,950
Mrs. Wheaton:
Long day? You look tired.

358
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,910
I'll microwave you
a TV dinner.

359
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:41,622
It's okay. I had something
to eat at the restaurant.

360
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,041
Is Annie okay?

361
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:50,172
- Annie is fine.
- Yeah, wearing out her ears again.

362
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,340
Not to mention ours.

363
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:54,009
If it isn't "A Summer Place"
it's that other crap.

364
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,970
"Pennsylvania 69,000"
and "In The Mood."

365
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,889
Same two, over and over
all afternoon.

366
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:01,475
- I guess she just likes it.
- Mr. Wheaton: Yeah, I know that.

367
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,936
I just can't
figure out why.

368
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:07,064
( "In The Mood" plays )

369
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,110
( whispering )

370
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,159
( music stops )

371
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:26,125
Thank God for small favors.

372
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:31,422
( whispering )
Annie...

373
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:35,217
Annie... come...

374
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,403
( whispering continues )

375
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,399
Reardon: Despite what
some people may think,

376
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,402
psychic powers--
telepathy,

377
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:38,906
telekinesis, precognition,
all the rest,

378
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,200
have no moral gradient.

379
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:44,078
They are neither good
nor bad.

380
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,539
Houses are different.

381
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:48,707
Shirley Jackson was right.

382
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,168
Some houses are born bad.

383
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,213
Houses like this one.

384
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,134
Houses like Rose Red.

385
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,053
I knew it was big,

386
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,639
but that's enormous.

387
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,268
Reardon: Fortunately for us,

388
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,687
an enormous dead cell.

389
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,440
There have been no overt
manifestations in Rose Red

390
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,150
since 1995 or so.

391
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,779
I believe that some houses

392
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,906
have their own inner life

393
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,200
that may or may not
be conscious.

394
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,036
If there was once consciousness
in Rose Red,

395
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:29,039
it manifested itself early.

396
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:32,710
The Seattle of 100 years ago
was a different world,

397
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:35,546
more different than
any of us can imagine.

398
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:38,549
Survival was an actual issue,

399
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,593
not a TV show.

400
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,762
Fortunes were made,
often by bandits in tall hats.

401
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:46,348
You could get out of the way
or get run down.

402
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,350
Those were the options.

403
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:51,562
In the year 1906,
you were on your own.

404
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:54,857
Rose Red...

405
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,735
was built by John P. Rimbauer

406
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:01,113
at the top of Spring Street
in the center of Seattle,

407
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,617
as a wedding present
to his wife.

408
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,912
Rimbauer was founder
of Omicron Oil Company, until 1950

409
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,581
the biggest oil company
in America.

410
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,833
1950 was the year

411
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,960
Ellen Rimbauer disappeared.

412
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,421
The trouble with Rose Red

413
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,174
started even before
there was a house.

414
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,679
Construction crews worked
24 hours a day,

415
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,807
seven days a week.
But that wasn't the problem.

416
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,312
The problem was that even before
there was a house there,

417
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:36,232
that piece of ground
made people mad.

418
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:38,275
Literally mad.

419
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,488
The Teamster made no effort
to get away,

420
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:46,784
just dropped the gun in his wagon
and went down to a Seattle saloon,

421
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,870
which was where
the police found him.

422
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:02,883
The Teamster's name
was Harry Corbin.

423
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,969
When he was tried,
he claimed

424
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:07,012
he remembered nothing
from breakfast

425
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,683
till the time he woke up in jail
with a knot behind his ear.

426
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:13,602
The judge didn't believe him,
neither did the jury.

427
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,396
He got 25 years.

428
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,523
I think Harry Corbin

429
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:20,693
may have been Rose Red's
first victim.

430
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:22,945
First male victim.

431
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:26,740
There has always been a difference
between the way Rose Red

432
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,742
treats the ladies
and the gentlemen.

433
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,955
- What do you mean, exactly?
- In time, Nick.

434
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,291
All in good time.

435
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,961
John Rimbauer
and Ellen Gilchrist

436
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,172
were married
on November 12, 1907.

437
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:44,383
He was 40 and she...

438
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,010
was 20.

439
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,012
By the day they said
their I do's,

440
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:51,015
Rose Red had been
under construction for a year.

441
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,310
Already there had been
three deaths,

442
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:57,354
in addition to the murder
of Rimbauer's first foreman.

443
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:59,356
Pick it up!

444
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,037
Reardon: One man
was decapitated

445
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,247
by a sheet
of falling glass.

446
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,754
Another fell from a scaffold
and broke his neck.

447
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:23,756
And the third...

448
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,841
choked to death
on a piece of apple.

449
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:30,888
This is the way
Rose Red looked

450
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,140
when it was completed
in 1909.

451
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,268
In case your memory
needs refreshing,

452
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,021
this is the way
it looks today.

453
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,235
It's as if it metastasized.

454
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,986
Rose Red has how many rooms?

455
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,989
- No one really knows.
- Man: On Monday you can count

456
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,285
7 4 and come back on Friday
and come up with 87 or 97.

457
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,496
That's impossible,
isn't it?

458
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,997
That's Rose Red, sweetheart.

459
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,833
Nick: How many people
have disappeared?

460
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,252
There must be
an accurate account of them.

461
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:04,171
23 since the end
of the first World War.

462
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,216
Emery:
You'll forgive me if I say

463
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,093
I find that impossible
to believe.

464
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,262
Reardon: Of course you do.
Anyone would.

465
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:13,264
But I assure you it's true.

466
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:16,392
Five men and 18 women.

467
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,937
Rose Red has always been
particularly fond of the ladies.

468
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,315
Remember we're speaking
of a house

469
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,818
- which has fallen dormant.
- Woman: It better be,

470
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,737
because $5,000 isn't enough
if it isn't.

471
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,450
- When was the last disappearance?
- Reardon: 1972,

472
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,953
almost 30 years ago.
As I said before,

473
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:39,039
there have been no
observable phenomena since--

474
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,458
- Who was the last one?
- Reardon: Pam...

475
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,837
We've got a lot to cover,
we don't need to focus on--

476
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,882
A woman on the Historical Society's
annual tour.

477
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,509
She was with the group
when they went upstairs.

478
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,765
It wasn't until
the tour was over

479
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,727
that they realized
she wasn't with them anymore.

480
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,572
Officer: What's that?

481
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,575
Man: They didn't find her,
but they found her purse.

482
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:17,703
Reardon: Finished?

483
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:19,330
Yeah.

484
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,166
Thank you.

485
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,002
The lady's name
was Liza Albert.

486
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:28,339
Since her disappearance,
the house has been closed to tours.

487
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,175
With no psychic energy
for the house to feed on,

488
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:34,011
it seems to have fallen
into a sleep, then a coma.

489
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,639
- And now...
- It's a dead cell.

490
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,098
Reardon: Exactly.

491
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,726
I wouldn't bet on that
if I were you.

492
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,146
Reardon: Rose Red wasn't finished
when John and Ellen got married,

493
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,191
but they weren't in a hurry
to set up housekeeping.

494
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,945
They passed the time with
an enormous, leisurely honeymoon.

495
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,863
They were gone a year.

496
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,450
They circled the globe
on liners like this one...

497
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,620
The Ocean Star.

498
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:03,874
John Rimbauer's favorite part
of the tour was Africa.

499
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:09,129
Ellen didn't enjoy it
quite as much.

500
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,924
In fact,
she nearly died.

501
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,992
- Was it malaria?
- Reardon: Probably not.

502
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:40,286
In her diary she called it

503
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,288
"an unmentionable disease

504
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,874
carried by men
and suffered by women."

505
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,088
Doesn't exactly look prostrate
with worry, does he?

506
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,716
With or without him,
Ellen recovered.

507
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:56,927
When she and John finally
took up residence in Rose Red,

508
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,762
she was pregnant.

509
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,974
January, 1909,
that would have been.

510
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,894
John thought
the house was finished.

511
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,028
They're here!

512
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,927
How beautiful you are,
Rose Red.

513
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,857
Reardon: He didn't know
that the house would never be done.

514
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,028
Not in his lifetime,
not in hers.

515
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,282
What makes Rose Red

516
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,286
one of the world's most
fascinating psychic artifacts...

517
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,247
is that the house
continued to grow

518
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,625
until its death
in 1995 or 1996.

519
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,379
Until 1950 changes
and additions were made

520
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,714
according to the will
of Ellen Rimbauer,

521
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,968
and her will,
ladies and gentlemen, was iron.

522
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,638
After 1950...

523
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,018
after 1950...

524
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,021
Rose Red grew on its own.

525
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:37,194
( whispering )

526
00:36:57,756 --> 00:36:59,633
( baby crying )

527
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,804
Reardon:
In the fall of 1909,

528
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,640
Ellen Rimbauer
gave birth to a son.

529
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,225
Grampy.

530
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,728
- Your grandfather, really.
- Yeah.

531
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,354
I'm afraid so.

532
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,317
In her diary she wrote,
"I have called him Adam,

533
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,527
for he is the first."

534
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,364
Sukeena, the woman who came back
from Africa with her,

535
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,159
saw her through
the difficult labor.

536
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,329
In her diary, Ellen never refers
to Sukeena as her servant.

537
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,916
First she calls her,
"my friend."

538
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,918
Later, "my sister."

539
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:37,755
When Ellen gave birth
to a daughter with a withered arm,

540
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:39,882
she blamed
her African sickness

541
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,134
and her husband's
sexual appetites,

542
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,011
although she wrote,

543
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:47,181
"In my mind they are one,"
to which she added,

544
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,350
"Damn all men."

545
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,062
John and Ellen's daughter
was born in April of 1911 .

546
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,814
And April was what
they called her.

547
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,987
In the years following
the birth of Ellen's daughter,

548
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,365
Ellen became convinced
that her fever,

549
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,910
which recurred periodically,
would kill her young.

550
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,497
That made her easy game
for Madame Stravinsky,

551
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,040
as she called herself.

552
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,751
If you have anything
to say to us,

553
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,462
you may use my body...

554
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,589
to speak.

555
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,302
Stravinsky: Give us a sign.

556
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,432
Show us a sign.

557
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,310
Reardon: Not even Sukeena

558
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,397
could convince her
that the old lady was a fraud.

559
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,274
Stravinsky: Beloved spirits,

560
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,694
we invite you
to commune with us.

561
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,907
Show us a sign.

562
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,327
Reardon: Fraud or not,

563
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,204
Madame Stravinsky,

564
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,166
known to police in San Francisco
and Los Angeles

565
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,293
as Cora Fry,

566
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,712
changed
Ellen Rimbauer's life

567
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,589
one night
in August of 1914.

568
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,409
Sukeena!

569
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,040
- You must build.
- What did she tell her?

570
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:39,126
Rimbauer: That Great-Gram wouldn't
die until the house was finished.

571
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,005
Great-Gram told her it was finished,
and Madame S. told her,

572
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,217
"It isn't finished
until you say it's finished."

573
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,928
"Until you say."

574
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,182
Ellen took it seriously,

575
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,185
probably she was right to.

576
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,978
Everything else aside,

577
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,898
she never had another attack
of her African fever.

578
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,485
- It was probably psychosomatic.
- Just PMS, right, Em?

579
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,403
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

580
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,407
A new wing, the first of many,
started going up the next week.

581
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,701
What did her husband
say about that?

582
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,037
Rimbauer: Nothing,
she gave him a son in 1909,

583
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,331
a daughter in 1911 .
She had a withered arm,

584
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,292
but the son was fine.
It was the son John Rimbauer

585
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,963
cared about. In his mind Ellen
had fulfilled her function,

586
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,173
and could do what she liked.
Would you agree?

587
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,094
Yes. Besides...

588
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,765
he had affairs of his own
to tend to.

589
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,147
Ellen continued to make
additions to the house

590
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,817
until her disappearance
in 1950.

591
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,153
Over 40 years
of well-financed eccentricity.

592
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,990
When she ran out of
conventional things to build,

593
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,784
she hired contractors
and architects to build

594
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,870
- unconventional stuff.
- Such as...?

595
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,664
Reardon: The so-called
tower folly

596
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,666
was completed in 1921 .

597
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,128
John Rimbauer jumped to his death
from it two years later.

598
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,588
Was it suicide...

599
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,967
or did he run into something
he couldn't deal with?

600
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,470
The certificate said
accidental death.

601
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,764
The gossip said
suicide or ghosts.

602
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,434
In any case,
during its active years,

603
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,561
and they were very active,

604
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,273
women in Rose Red
tended to turn up missing,

605
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,067
and men tended
to turn up dead.

606
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,987
- The bad days are over.
- Reardon: Yes.

607
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,280
Indeed.

608
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,823
Are you sure?

609
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,742
Positive.

610
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,120
Then what do you want
from us, Ms. Reardon?

611
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,631
First off, let's all get on
a first-name basis, shall we?

612
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,091
That will make things
less difficult.

613
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,968
This can be...

614
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,012
a difficult field.

615
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,932
People either don't understand
our goals,

616
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,143
or refuse to credit
our findings.

617
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,772
Some people
are actively cruel.

618
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,317
And...

619
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,196
Research goals?

620
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,698
Yes, yes.

621
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,326
My research goals...

622
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,454
specify measurable
psychic phenomena.

623
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,165
Hard data in other words.
Telemetry readouts...

624
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,544
and anomalous energy levels,
primarily.

625
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,964
I want readouts
that even the most...

626
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,676
stupid, sarcastic,
obtuse member

627
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,555
of this so-called scientific
department will have to accept.

628
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:41,058
If I get a little crazy
on the subject

629
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,561
from time to time,
please forgive me.

630
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,896
I've put in a lot
of long days.

631
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,399
If Rose Red is a dead cell,

632
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,402
how much proof can you expect
to find there?

633
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,529
Reardon:
If you apply electricity

634
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,156
to the muscles in the leg
of a dead frog,

635
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,451
the muscles will contract
hours after the frog has died.

636
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,455
You people are my psychic
equivalent of electricity.

637
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,916
My goal is modest...

638
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,169
a single twitch.

639
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,006
One single twitch.

640
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,425
If I get it...

641
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,970
my reputation will be secure
for the rest of my life.

642
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,723
More importantly,

643
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,767
together we can legitimize
a branch of psychology

644
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,354
which has been treated as
a poor relation for far too long.

645
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,565
What are you doing here,
Mr. Rimbauer?

646
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,609
What are your special talents?

647
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,945
Just protecting the family interests.
I promised the professor

648
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,282
one good shot at the mansion
and then the developers await.

649
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,076
Tech-Star Condominiums,
the future.

650
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,663
You're gonna let them tear it down?
It's a piece of history.

651
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,041
History don't pay no rent
and the kid is broke.

652
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,918
Hardly the most noble
of motives.

653
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,379
Are we the team?
The whole team?

654
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,508
- She hopes not.
- Beg your pardon?

655
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,221
I was hoping for one more,
but that's looking iffy.

656
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,849
If I have to make do
with you five,

657
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,393
then I'll count myself lucky.

658
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,897
I'll see you this Friday
at 2:00 p.m. sharp.

659
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,067
I'm sure it will be
a Memorial Day weekend to remember.

660
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,820
If you could
all please join me...

661
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,365
I'd like to close
with a circle.

662
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,422
This sort of thing went out
with high-buttoned shoes.

663
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,301
Joyce, is there anything
you'd like us to focus on?

664
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,054
Good will, good thoughts,
each other.

665
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,056
- That's lovely.
- Thanks.

666
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,140
Say cheese.

667
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,813
Vic, are you okay?

668
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,108
Fine.

669
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,153
I'm gonna go make some room.

670
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,911
He looks a bit gray
about the gills.

671
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,371
No, no.

672
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,666
Maybe half a glass,
but no more.

673
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,220
Man:
Just a minute, please.

674
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,254
TV: The Huskies were caught
off guard by the weak-side blitz.

675
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,925
The linebacker starts to drop back,
and then rushes the quarterback.

676
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,593
( phone ringing )

677
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,971
Y-ello.

678
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,558
Hello. I'd like to speak
with Rachel. Is she there?

679
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,436
- Who is this?
- I'd like to speak with Rachel.

680
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:16,065
I know who this is.
The crazy lady from the college.

681
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,943
- How you doin', crazy lady?
- Is that for me?

682
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,946
Reardon: My business is with
your older daughter.

683
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,615
- I'd be grateful--
- You've got it wrong.

684
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,242
You have no business here.

685
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,952
Not with Sissy, Annie,
or any of us.

686
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,499
Don't ever call here again,
got that?

687
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,172
Daddy...

688
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:45,010
- that was my call.
- That was some crazy lady.

689
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,514
- That was my call. You have no right--
- Yeah, I do,

690
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,141
as long as you live in my house
and eat my food.

691
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,185
Stop it, both of you.

692
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,105
I know what
the crazy lady wants.

693
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,733
Just like I know you've been
talking to her behind my back.

694
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,945
Let me tell you this,
Annie's not going near Rose Red.

695
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,910
- Mama?
- She doesn't say. I say.

696
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,790
Mama?
Won't you help me once?

697
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,543
Please, just this once,
will you speak up?

698
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,044
I've told you 1000 times,

699
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,714
I won't take sides
between you and your father.

700
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,175
Sister: Mama.

701
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,677
What about Annie's side?

702
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,971
- The Gatt School--
- What planet are you living on?

703
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,682
You'll put her
in the Gatt School with $5,000?

704
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:36,645
- Professor Reardon has promised 12!
- I knew she was crazy.

705
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,565
What's your excuse?
$20,000 is what it would take.

706
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,068
- $20,000 at least. A year.
- Rose Red is famous.

707
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,322
If something happens while we're there,
it'd be worth a fortune to Annie.

708
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,701
Sure. I can just
see her on Geraldo.

709
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,578
"Hi, I'm Annie Wheaton.

710
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,206
I'm gonna tell folks
all about a haunted house."

711
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,209
- Sister: Stop it! Don't mock her!
- I'm saving her.

712
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,836
From crazy lady number one,
and crazy lady number two!

713
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,379
That is it, Sister.

714
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,508
This case is closed.
I won't hear any more about it.

715
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,313
- Sister: I'm calling her. We're going.
- No, you're not.

716
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,744
- Stop it, Annie! Stop it!
- ( glass breaking )

717
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,622
Make her stop!

718
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,211
What do you think, Dad?

719
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,255
What do you think
Annie wants?

720
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,304
- Stop it, Annie!
- ( radio switches on )

721
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,722
George!

722
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,269
Make her stop!
For God's sake!

723
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,438
Please, George,
make her stop!

724
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,317
( country music playing )

725
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,405
Nick:
We thought you were lost.

726
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,533
No, just misplaced.

727
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,289
- May I propose a toast?
- Pam: Sure.

728
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,792
To Rose Red.

729
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,086
All: To Rose red.

730
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,968
Vic: Joyce...

731
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:35,431
she's looking,
still hoping for one more.

732
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,017
A sixth.

733
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,311
Six is the number.

734
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,980
Nick:
A girl. A teenager.

735
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,483
And I think our dear professor
will be in luck.

736
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,652
Is that something you see?

737
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,658
What's your special trait,
Pam?

738
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,123
I'm what psychic journals
call a touch-know.

739
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,501
It doesn't always work,

740
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,045
but sometimes
when I handle things,

741
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,798
I see stuff,
or I get feelings.

742
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,134
Of course,
a lot of times

743
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,261
there's nothing.

744
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,890
What about you, Vic?

745
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,270
Two people...

746
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,564
mid-20s.

747
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,484
She's in a blue dress.

748
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,528
Vic:
He's in jeans.

749
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,113
He's blonde

750
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,533
over-golded.

751
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:39,119
He's got a case of Roman hands
and Russian fingers.

752
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,207
What in the world
are you talking--

753
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,042
Man:
...Go outside.

754
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,837
- You wanna?
- Woman: Sure.

755
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,006
Trs chic, n'est-ce pas?

756
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,302
- You're precognitive!
- I can tell a hawk from a handsaw

757
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,721
when the wind's
in the northwest.

758
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,308
What about you, Cathy?

759
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,854
I'm an automatic writer.

760
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,981
- A Ouija board.
- Cathy: Yes.

761
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,108
But I don't like
the Ouija board.

762
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,443
The channel's too wide,

763
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:15,155
and sometimes what comes through
is unpleasant.

764
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,575
This is better.

765
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,870
Sometimes it's precog,
sometimes it's astral.

766
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,581
Mostly it's just
people to people.

767
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:27,084
Someone concentrate hard.
You, Pam.

768
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,670
Oh. Okay.
Let's see.

769
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,880
Uh...

770
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,049
Okay.

771
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,066
I guess
it's not going to work.

772
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,073
Steve?!

773
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,873
What about you, Ste--
Nick?

774
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,708
( chuckling )

775
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
He calls her Dee.

776
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,595
Why does he do that,
I wonder?

777
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,390
Nick?

778
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,605
I do a little of this,
a little of that.

779
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:33,192
Sometimes I get lucky
and things turn out all right.

780
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,945
What about
our new friend, Emery?

781
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,446
What do we know about him?

782
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,326
- Your friend, not mine.
- Cathy: I think Emery is

783
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,330
post-cognitive.
He sees the past.

784
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,874
Not the most comfortable
of talents.

785
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,924
Here's to good thoughts.
Goodwill.

786
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,468
Nick:
Good thoughts, goodwill.

787
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,368
Who are you?

788
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,205
Why are you here?

789
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,956
Where are you from?

790
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,877
When are you from?

791
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,587
Is it Rose Red?

792
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,022
Read my lips.

793
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,275
Save the warnings
for someone who's not broke.

794
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,985
Okay?

795
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,081
I remember that day.

796
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,168
She was happy,
wasn't she?

797
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,550
- We all were.
- Oh, man...

798
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,636
- Would you look at this?
- Huh?

799
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,931
Mr. Wheaton:
Those were the days, huh?

800
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,975
Ignorance is bliss.

801
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,184
Daddy,

802
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:16,063
what Annie is,
isn't anyone's fault.

803
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,859
It's not hers, it's not mine,
it's not yours.

804
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,318
I know that.

805
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,904
But you're too busy thinking
about what you want for Annie

806
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,198
to think about
what she can do.

807
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,659
Have you forgotten
what happened

808
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,578
after she got bit
by the Stantons' dog?

809
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,122
How the stones came down?

810
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,457
Or what she did
to those pipes?

811
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,505
After what
she did tonight...

812
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,633
how can you have any doubts
about what she wants?

813
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,011
Sweetheart,

814
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,598
taking Annie into
a genuinely haunted house?

815
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:55,311
That's like using a lighter
to see how full your gas tank is.

816
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:00,733
It's a chance.
That's what you don't understand.

817
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,276
It's a chance
for her to get out--

818
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,069
And for you
to get out from under.

819
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,371
I just want
what's best for Annie.

820
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:19,418
I know, Sissy, but you don't know
what that is.

821
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,545
Believe me.

822
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,715
Whispering voices:
Annie...

823
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,302
come...

824
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,099
Come...

825
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,480
( whispering continues )

826
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,971
Pity you can't do the same
with the other 40,000 or so.

827
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,684
People read it today and line their
kitty litter boxes with it tomorrow.

828
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,394
I think they'll remember
the photo.

829
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,355
Some will take that
for inspection the next time

830
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,816
the university bond issue
comes up before the voters.

831
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:28,112
A photo like this could put
100 worthwhile programs to beggary.

832
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,239
But what do you care?

833
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,617
Do you have a point, Carl?
If so, get to it.

834
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,870
- I have a lot to do.
- Crystals to polish?

835
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,204
Ouijas to wax?

836
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:40,666
Did you put that kid Bollinger
up to this? You did, didn't you?

837
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,627
You told him where to go
and when to point his camera.

838
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,838
Tsk-tsk-tsk...

839
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,591
( whispering )
Your paranoia's showing.

840
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,967
Reardon: Ah!

841
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,139
It's a nasty little cut.

842
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,933
Well, listen...

843
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,145
I'm afraid I have bad news
for you, old girl.

844
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,523
I'm not old.
Not yet anyway.

845
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:08,569
And I'm certainly
not your girl.

846
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,155
- What are you talking about?
- The Executive Committee

847
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,449
has been in session
regarding tenure.

848
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,243
What? Why? No one in
the department's up for tenure.

849
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,745
The only thing that--

850
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,754
You really are a bastard.

851
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,090
The Committee voted five to two
to revoke your tenure.

852
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,593
We tried to contact you
so you could attend.

853
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,678
You'll find a message
on your machine.

854
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,388
I'm surprised the spirits
didn't tell you.

855
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:40,976
The general consensus is
it's time to stop the silliness.

856
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,355
I will fight you
every step of the process.

857
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,148
Of course,
and you'll lose.

858
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,777
Your days of haunting
the Wimser Psychology department--

859
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,779
to coin a phrase--
are not quite over,

860
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:52,905
but they're numbered.

861
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:56,492
When I come back from Rose Red
with proof, you--

862
00:58:56,534 --> 00:59:01,163
This is the rallying cry of crackpots
and deluded religionists.

863
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,083
Since the Stone Age,
the proof is out there.

864
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,043
This is sad, really.

865
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:09,672
You used to be a respected writer
and lecturer in child psychology.

866
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,550
But then you got bitten
by this... virus!

867
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,845
It is a legitimate field
of psychological investigation.

868
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,263
It's crap! It's sleazy!

869
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,932
It's a spit in the eye
of rational thought!

870
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,351
But the good news is,
that Rose Red

871
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,271
will be your last goose chase
as a member of this faculty.

872
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:28,107
You're an idiot and you're blind!

873
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,609
What if you find proof?
Let's just suppose.

874
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,736
Proof, photographs,
audio recordings

875
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,072
of the clanking chains,
telemetry of some sort.

876
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,534
What good would it do?
Have you considered such thoughts?

877
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:47,251
I feel remarkably well today,

878
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,587
in spite of
all your crap.

879
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,882
This is the world
we live in

880
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,718
and experience
with our five senses.

881
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,637
Skin...
smooth and rational.

882
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:01,056
Reardon:
Every cause has its effect,

883
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,810
and every effect can be predicted
with the right database.

884
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:07,188
But there's a world
under that world,

885
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,190
blood,
under the skin.

886
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,443
That's what rationalistic asses
like you never see.

887
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,321
It's a world that's liquid
instead of solid,

888
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,573
hot instead of just warm.

889
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:21,744
It is a world
full of mystery, Carl.

890
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,872
You don't like it,
do you? No.

891
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:28,042
So don't give me your bull about
bond issues and busted programs.

892
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,045
You're afraid
of what's under the skin.

893
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,256
But I'm not.
Do you hear me, Carl?

894
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,841
I'm not.

895
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:39,553
- If you've given me something--
- That's what it comes down to, huh?

896
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,389
The bottom line?
You're afraid of catching something.

897
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:44,892
Go on, get out of here.
Go wash your face,

898
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,603
then you can trot to the infirmary
and get an AIDS test.

899
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,231
When the semester's over,
you're done here.

900
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,733
You're finished teaching.
You're crazy!

901
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:56,278
- You're totally insane!
- Good day, old boy.

902
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:04,995
- What are you looking at?!
- Nothing.

903
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,622
Then go look
somewhere else!

904
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:13,712
We did it, didn't we?
We nailed her.

905
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:16,549
What's on your face?

906
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,301
Never mind.

907
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,803
Never mind.

908
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:25,432
We have a great deal
to talk about, young man.

909
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:26,976
The story's not over?

910
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,856
It's just beginning.
It's just beginning.

911
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:57,256
Steve: From the Department
of Questions Better Not Answered,

912
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:00,759
if a tree falls in the forest,
and no one hears it,

913
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,845
- does it make any noise?
- Mm-hmm.

914
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,181
Who cuts
the barber's hair?

915
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:09,101
Who leaves money under
the Tooth Fairy's pillow?

916
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,812
How come no one realizes

917
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:15,065
Clark Kent is just
Superman wearing glasses?

918
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,902
- Mm-hmm.
- If I didn't own Rose Red,

919
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,862
would I be in bed
with you right now?

920
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:21,405
Mm-hmm.

921
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,241
Hello.

922
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:31,040
- How was your day, dear?
- Give it back.

923
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,710
How was your day?
Or would you prefer that

924
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:37,379
I just rolled over
and made myself small?

925
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:41,759
They revoked my tenure.

926
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:44,845
Carl Miller dropped by the office
to give me the news himself.

927
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:48,766
- Wait. Can they do that?
- Maybe. Probably.

928
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,976
Bollinger's article
in the paper made us look

929
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,979
like the Stupid Family,
with me as the Head Stupid.

930
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:57,149
You want
to turn off your light?

931
01:02:57,233 --> 01:03:00,694
You're pretty damn
calm about it.

932
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,822
I heard from Sister.

933
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:07,284
She accepted
the $12,000 I offered.

934
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:10,704
When I come back from Rose Red
with hard data,

935
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:14,375
there'll be four dozen universities
willing to hire me.

936
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,085
First,
I'm going to write a book.

937
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:20,756
It is going to sell
a gazillion copies.

938
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,802
I once heard you say

939
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,596
that the only certainty
when dealing with the paranormal

940
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,390
is that nothing is certain.

941
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:32,101
What if you spend three days
in Rose Red and nothing happens?

942
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,644
But it will.

943
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:37,648
Annie Wheaton
is my guarantee.

944
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,650
She's--

945
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,989
Let's just say
she's one of a kind.

946
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,492
You know, Rose Red
is not a true dead cell.

947
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:50,369
Annie's going
to wake it up.

948
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,997
And if you would just let the house
stand for another six months,

949
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,499
- the research possibilities--
- No. No.

950
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,002
It's coming down in July,
and I can't wait.

951
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,504
I cannot wait.

952
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:03,257
How can you hate it
so much?

953
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,593
It eats my relatives!

954
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:09,680
- I'm sorry.
- Did you miss that in your research?

955
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,519
It's just that
it means a lot to me.

956
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:18,272
Yeah, too much maybe.

957
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,734
You'll need some down time
when this is over.

958
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,737
Some serious R&R.

959
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,544
( whispering )

960
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,542
Well, you have
the cell phone.

961
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,126
Right here.

962
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,547
- And you've got plenty of film.
- Of course,

963
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,800
but I don't know if
this is such a good idea.

964
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,637
Don't tell me
you're afraid.

965
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,515
No, of course
I'm not afraid.

966
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,433
It's just big.

967
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,770
What if I get lost?

968
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:43,732
Kevin, you know,
you're about to step out

969
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,901
in the real world
in a couple of weeks.

970
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,820
That's where you're apt
to get lost.

971
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:51,073
But you nail this story,
you can write your own ticket.

972
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,659
I thought that's
what you wanted.

973
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,663
Why don't you come
in there with me?

974
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,166
I do have
a few things to do,

975
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:03,043
like running my department,
overseeing finals...

976
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,547
Call me when you
get the pictures,

977
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,215
either I or my wife
will come get you.

978
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:10,467
She can't stand
that Reardon bitch either.

979
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:14,555
If they catch me in there,
they'll tear me apart.

980
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,682
There's no reason
why they should.

981
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,435
If you're reasonably careful.

982
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:21,770
I guess.

983
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,565
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

984
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,400
Don't forget this.

985
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,321
And try and get a good picture
of them being psychic.

986
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:33,115
- Professor Miller, I don't think--
- Stiff upper, boy!

987
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,450
Stiff upper!

988
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,744
Professor Miller...

989
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:39,872
You're a step away
from stardom, dear boy!

990
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,624
Just get the pictures!

991
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:58,015
( gate creaking )

992
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,157
( crows cawing )

993
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,394
Solarium...

994
01:08:25,436 --> 01:08:26,395
kitchen...

995
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:28,230
tool-shed...
back door...

996
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:30,399
front door...

997
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:35,029
Kevin: Oh.

998
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,823
- I thought this house was empty.
- It would be,

999
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:39,617
Mr. Bollinger, I believe.

1000
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,745
- The reporter.
- Yeah, I'm Bollinger.

1001
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:45,581
- But how did you know?
- Come in, sir.

1002
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,750
You're expected.

1003
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:07,394
Ma'am?

1004
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,773
Where are you?

1005
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,526
Sukeena:
This way, sir.

1006
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,913
Kevin: Hello?

1007
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,234
( door creaks open )

1008
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:57,695
Hello?

1009
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:28,058
Ma'am,
I seem to have lost you.

1010
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,192
Ma'am?

1011
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,866
Is anybody here?

1012
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,056
Ma'am?

1013
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,438
( gasps )

1014
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,818
Screw this.

1015
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:28,160
Okay, very funny,
but I want to leave, all right?

1016
01:11:29,245 --> 01:11:30,496
Let me out!

1017
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:44,093
( bees buzzing )

1018
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:46,595
I could use
a little help in here!

1019
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:49,515
- I'm in the greenhouse!
- ( bees buzzing )

1020
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,820
Let me out!

1021
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:05,948
Let me out of here!

1022
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,783
Let me out!

1023
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,168
I'm out of here.

1024
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:19,461
Come on.

1025
01:12:46,155 --> 01:12:48,240
Get a grip, Bollinger.

1026
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:12,348
( cell phone rings )

1027
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:14,391
( loud music playing )

1028
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,490
( continues ringing )

1029
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:36,831
Miller over phone:
Hello?

1030
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:38,582
Hello?

1031
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:40,042
Who is this?

1032
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:44,046
Bollinger?

1033
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:45,965
Bollinger, is that you?

1034
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:48,717
Hello?

1035
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:02,898
Steve: Hey.

1036
01:14:02,982 --> 01:14:04,984
They'll be here.
Come on.

1037
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:41,604
Wait!

1038
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:44,565
Don't make me chase you,
Emmy!

1039
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:48,444
- Mom, I'm okay.
- Yes, you're always okay?

1040
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,196
Now, listen to me.

1041
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:52,990
If anything happens
that you can't handle,

1042
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:55,743
anything beyond a few
telesmic manifestations,

1043
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:58,537
- call me and I'll come and get you.
- I will, Mom. I have to go.

1044
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:02,291
You call me anyway
so I know you're all right.

1045
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,959
I always do.
I have to go.

1046
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,086
- Emery: They're waiting.
- Let them wait.

1047
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:09,256
They won't do much
without you, huh?

1048
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,925
Now, turn around.

1049
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:13,385
- Mom...
- Turn around.

1050
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:15,804
And stay away
from that blonde girl.

1051
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:19,517
She looks like a tramp.
Now give Mommy a kiss.

1052
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,355
You're all over lipstick.

1053
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:26,190
Fix yourself.

1054
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:33,405
Nick: Friends, I see new frontiers
in abnormal psychology

1055
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:36,158
stretching out before us.
How exciting!

1056
01:15:36,242 --> 01:15:39,620
Mrs. Waterman:
...Especially if you move your bowels!

1057
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:43,624
Gosh, the day before summer camp
must have been a busy time

1058
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,126
- in the Waterman household.
- Shut up!

1059
01:15:49,088 --> 01:15:51,841
Off to the house
on haunted hill, I see?

1060
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,177
Oh and with--

1061
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:59,306
with about $100,000 worth
of department equipment.

1062
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,517
I've got all
the proper paperwork

1063
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,811
if you want to see it signed
in all the proper places.

1064
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:06,021
Oooh...
signed by Rogers.

1065
01:16:06,105 --> 01:16:08,858
When I was on vacation,
he was acting in my stead.

1066
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:10,651
Very clever of you.

1067
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:13,612
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Just trying to be pleasant.

1068
01:16:13,696 --> 01:16:16,699
If you'll excuse us,
Professor Miller, we're in a hurry.

1069
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,451
Yes, of course.
Places to go,

1070
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:22,788
ghosts to bust.
Isn't that right, Mr. Rimbauer?

1071
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:25,457
Yeah, more or less.

1072
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,709
Yes.

1073
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,545
Well, keep the equipment
in one piece.

1074
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:33,090
Good luck.

1075
01:16:34,884 --> 01:16:37,678
The spirits have done it
all in one night.

1076
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:40,514
That's what Scrooge says
when he wakes up a changed man.

1077
01:16:40,598 --> 01:16:44,143
That's what he made me think of.
Scrooge on Christmas morning.

1078
01:16:44,226 --> 01:16:47,146
I don't trust him.

1079
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:50,482
Hello.
Are you the group?

1080
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:52,359
Pam:
The Rose Red group?

1081
01:16:52,443 --> 01:16:54,195
Yes.

1082
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:56,030
I'm Pam Asbury.

1083
01:16:57,448 --> 01:16:59,116
This is Cathy Kramer.

1084
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,201
Hi.

1085
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,828
- Victor Kandinsky.
- Vic. Just Vic.

1086
01:17:02,912 --> 01:17:04,163
Oh.

1087
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:07,416
Pam:
Nick Hardaway.

1088
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:10,586
Pam:
And Emery Waterman.

1089
01:17:12,338 --> 01:17:13,714
And...

1090
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:17,176
- you must be...
- I'm Sissy Wheaton. This is Annie.

1091
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:22,389
I was sure we were going to miss
you guys. Traffic was horrible.

1092
01:17:22,473 --> 01:17:25,142
- We're glad you didn't.
- Sister--

1093
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:28,270
- or do you prefer Rachel?
- Either is fine.

1094
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:40,699
Just quit it.

1095
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,954
Emery:
Good God. She's retarded.

1096
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:47,748
If you keep
your psychological evaluation

1097
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:49,250
of Miss Wheaton to yourself,

1098
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,961
we won't ask you
any embarrassing questions

1099
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:56,090
about your relationship
with your mother. Chin, chin.

1100
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:58,384
Reardon: Folks,

1101
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,845
I think we're ready.

1102
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:08,477
( phone ringing )

1103
01:18:12,648 --> 01:18:14,984
Recording: You've reached
the cell phone of Carl Miller.

1104
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:17,361
Please, leave a message
after the tone.

1105
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:18,654
( beep )

1106
01:18:18,696 --> 01:18:20,072
Bollinger, where are you?

1107
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:22,283
I told you to keep
that phone with you...

1108
01:18:22,366 --> 01:18:26,120
In any case,
they've left the campus.

1109
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:28,372
They'll be there
in 40 minutes,

1110
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:30,040
so be ready.

1111
01:18:30,124 --> 01:18:32,168
Then call me back.

1112
01:18:58,235 --> 01:18:59,862
There she is.

1113
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:18,923
It seems
to be looking at us.

1114
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:21,926
It is, Cathy.
It is.

1115
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,145
Steve.

1116
01:19:36,232 --> 01:19:37,608
Boy: Mommy?

1117
01:19:38,943 --> 01:19:40,486
Where are you?

1118
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,241
( whispering )

1119
01:20:14,854 --> 01:20:16,105
Mommy?

1120
01:20:16,188 --> 01:20:17,731
I'm scared.

1121
01:20:18,858 --> 01:20:20,484
Where are you, Mommy?

1122
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:28,033
Nick: Steve.

1123
01:20:28,117 --> 01:20:29,618
Steve, you okay?

1124
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:32,204
Huh?

1125
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:36,750
Yeah, sure. Fine.

1126
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:38,729
You wanna know a secret?

1127
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:41,815
I've never done anything
like this before

1128
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:44,693
and I'm pretty much
scared to death.

1129
01:21:44,735 --> 01:21:46,529
Be not afraid.

1130
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:48,948
Only believe.

1131
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:52,201
We're lucky most
of the electronic stuff

1132
01:21:52,243 --> 01:21:54,203
was delivered and installed
earlier this week.

1133
01:21:54,245 --> 01:21:56,163
- What are these?
- House plans.

1134
01:21:56,247 --> 01:21:59,333
Probably as useful as
a 14th century map of Africa.

1135
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:02,878
And here,
a coil of rope.

1136
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,924
How are you doing, sweetie?
Are you okay?

1137
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:14,139
Boy's voice:
Mommy? I'm scared.

1138
01:22:16,225 --> 01:22:18,519
( whispering )

1139
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:27,653
( whispering )
Stevey...

1140
01:22:27,736 --> 01:22:30,114
Stevey... come...

1141
01:22:47,882 --> 01:22:50,801
Nick:
What is it? What can you hear?

1142
01:22:50,885 --> 01:22:53,888
- Steve...
- It knows we're here.

1143
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:01,520
Steve:
It wants us here.

1144
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:08,068
( whispering )

1145
01:23:28,255 --> 01:23:30,299
( whispering continues )

1146
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:37,932
God help us.
It wants us here.

1147
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:07,211
( whispering )
Come in...

1148
01:24:19,932 --> 01:24:22,601
Come see...
