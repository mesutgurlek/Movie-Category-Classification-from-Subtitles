<i>a partnership between native

These ice roads have been

Well, you need a sustained sub-zero

Well, then find me some sub-zero!

That's what

Hell, the amount of oil
that they're gonna get out of here

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,120

before we fuck it up.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,000
So if North... is willing to pay me
to be here, then so be it.

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,520
Is this Maxwell flagging these sits?

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,920
What is he, sniffing glue out here or what?

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,320
I don't know what this is.

491

Jesus.

492
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,600
We're gonna have to check
all these sites now.

493
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,880
Yeah, okay.

494
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,800
Lee, this is going to be you.

495
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
All of them.

496
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,120
Will do.

497
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,120
Excuse me.

498
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
You're gonna have your
work cut out for you.

499
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah, I think this is going
to take more than one of us.

<i>Oh, nature calls.</i>

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,240
So, Hoffman, what do you figure,

503
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,200
we bring the rigs in here on rollagon?

504
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Is that gonna work?

505
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,960
Uh, the tundra is barely frozen.

506
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,280
It won't support the weight
of those vehicles.

507
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,840
Well, now...

508

509
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,320
how do you propose we get
the equipment in here, then?

510
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Maybe you won't get it in.

511
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,120
Maybe you're gonna have
to reconsider your plans.

512
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,320
That's the wrong answer.

513
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,920
<i>It's the CO2 feeding back up.</i>

514
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,040
As the ground warms,

515
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,040
permafrost, all this organic material

516
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,680
that's been frozen for thousands
of years is thawing,

517
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,360
which accelerates the warming.

518
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,600
It's exponential,
what we're talking about here.

519

What is this, some
global warming bullshit?

it's a little late in the day

to be having that particular debate?

It's not a debate
about global warming, Ed.

652

I need to rest.

Dawn's got him on something.

What the hell was that in there?

659
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,920
I got Maxwell out here, you know.

660
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,440
Told his old man how good
it would be for him.

[sighs]

662

I know, Ed.

664
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
It's Hoffman!

665
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,520
I have no idea how you ended up in
the sack with that guy.

666
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,880
But I gotta tell ya,

667
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
I consider it a security breach.

668
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,760
We had nothing to hide, Ed.

669
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
Everything is by the book.

670
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,760
He works for North.

671
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,560
Every report he does goes through us.

672
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,600
I think you made a big mistake
transferring him out of here.

673
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,440
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him
or anybody else fuck this up for me!

674
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,000
I had his confidence.
I had my eye on him.

Sure hope you don't like
the new guy as much.

- Hmm.

Don't think you need

We'll take care of him.

693
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
That sounds ominous.

694
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,120
You know, you're getting awfully vocal
about what we're doing up here.

695
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,920
It's not gonna work with Pollack.

696
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,880
You should've just signed
those impact reports.

697
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,120
Pollack has no idea
what's going on out here.

698

<i>- Oh, and you do?
- No, I don't, either.</i>

699
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,480
That's why I'd like to
take a giant step backwards

700
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,920
and get some people up here
who can figure out what is going on.

701
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
You know your deal with North prohibits you

702
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,640
from saying anything
about this to anyone.

703
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,000
What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Just need to make that clear.

705
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,680
Abby!

706
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,160
You don't feel that something is off here?

707
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Listen, Abby.

708
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,320
You can make a real difference here.

709
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,160
Draw a line in the sand.

710
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,280
If they shut this project down,

711
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,680
the others could be called into question.

712
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,960
You could be part of
a change for the better.

713
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,920
Take your case to North, if you need to.

714
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,680
At this station, we're fighting
to get those rigs in.

715
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,840
Whatever it takes, and on schedule.

716

I fix stuff around here.

Two hours later, it's broke again.

728
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,640
Maybe we need to get somebody
down here who could figure this shit out.

Hey. Look at this.

You should have sent him the fuck home!

I say it does. This

Somehow, this hydrogen
sulfide's making its way to the surface
