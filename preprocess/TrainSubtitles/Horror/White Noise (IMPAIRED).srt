- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's nice here.

Could you take Mikey for the weekend?

Yeah, of course.

- They'd like to see you this week.

Sure. Fine, it shouldn't be any problem.

(John) No, I didn't.
Let me see what I can do here.

you're running over budget, right?

Ask them if they have a light.

- You guys OK?
- We are now.

209
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,568
Yeah.

210
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,271
I trust you'll fix this
before Mr. Cunningham arrives.

Oh! Please, come. How nice.

230
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,367
- Hello.
- Hi.

231
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,465
- Look, er...
- I was just about to finish with someone.

232
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,603
- I can come back.
- No, it won't take long.

233
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,773
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.

234
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,976
- Thank you.
- This is Sarah Tate.

235
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,247
Let me introduce you to Mr. Rivers.

236
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,221
Sorry, I'm a little...

237
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,225
We've had a breakthrough today.

238
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,419
It's incredible.

239
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,257
It truly is.

240
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,090
- This is ridiculous.
- Stay awhile.

241
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,534
I should get these boxes back to the store.

242
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,004
Sarah, there's no need to hurry.

243
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,030
Make yourself a cup of tea.

244
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,201
I suppose. Thank you.

245
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,135
Would you like one?

246
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,477
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

247
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,244
Thank you.

248
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,815
Mr. Rivers, please.

249
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,289
Oh, er... Excuse me. Please, sit here. Sit.

250
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,827
So, have you heard of E.V.P., Mr. Rivers?

251
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,268
No.

252
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,637
I'm not surprised.
Those that have call us cranks.

253
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:19,371
E.V.P. Stands for
electronic voice phenomenon.

254
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,404
- I'm listening.
- Well.

255
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,611
I'm not a clairvoyant, I'm not a medium,

256
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,312
I don't contact the dead,

257
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,480
the dead contact me.

258
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,648
And, with E.V.P.,

259
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,593
I can hear them,

260
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,255
I can see them, and...

261
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,931
I can record them.

262
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,537
(Static)

263
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,773
(Snippets of speech)

264
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,077
'... I understand... '

265
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,595
'... you shouldn't be... '

266
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,908
- And they are...
- That's right.

267
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,007
People that have passed over.

268
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,663
Is this your job, or a hobby, or what?

269
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,138
(Laughs) I think obsession
would be more appropriate, to be honest.

270
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,231
Now, I wonder where... Ah!

271
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:01,075
Here we are. They don't always appear visually
the first few times.

272
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,913
We tend only to pick up their voices
and people can find that frustrating.

273
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,815
But when it works,

274
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,755
and you see the faces of the people
that you're able to help, like Sarah,

275
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,455
nothing, believe me, nothing comes close.

276
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,131
Mr. Rivers, do you want to hear your wife?

277
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,240
Yes.

278
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,577
(Crackling)

279
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,060
'Jonathan.

280
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
'Jonathan.

281
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,965
'Find him.

282
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,241
'Jonathan Rivers.

283
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,267
'Find him.

284
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,945
'Jonathan... Jonathan...

285
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,848
'Rivers...

286
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,445
'Find him, please. '

287
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,458
(Sobbing)

288
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,138
The frustrating thing about E.V.P.
Is it's not live.

289
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,908
You need to make the recording

290
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,713
and you'll only know
if you've got results when you play it back.

291
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,413
Here. It has milk.

292
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,251
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Excuse me for a moment.

293
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,326
It's an amazing feeling, isn't it?

294
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,591
Er...

295
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,123
It's indescribable.

296
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,194
It took me a few visits to get used to it
but it's addictive.

297
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:10,037
I'm here all the time. He's really helped me.

298
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,478
I try to help him when I can,
so I keep some of this stuff at the store.

299
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,175
- What store?
- I have a bookstore.

300
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,447
Your wife was a wonderful writer, Mr. Rivers.

301
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,024
Yeah.

302
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,363
- So what made you come here?
- My fiancé.

303
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:41,634
He died eight months ago. We've had trouble
deciphering what he's been saying

304
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,607
but this afternoon we cracked it.

305
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
Only two words - "Sarah, yes. "

306
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,545
Because, before he died, he promised me
that if it was like they say it is

307
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,848
that he would find a way of getting to me

308
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,878
and letting me know that he's happy.

309
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,958
So, "Sarah, yes. "

310
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,661
Oh.

311
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,962
Raymond thinks we probably won't
see him again now but that's OK.

312
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,966
And I've heard what I wanted to hear.

313
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,341
(Thunder)

314
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,232
(Crackling)

315
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,710
Anna...

316
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,815
this is John.

317
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,887
If there's any way you can hear me...

318
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,520
will you please let me know?

319
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,532
Please.

320
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,093
Just any kind of... Just any kind of sign.

321
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,567
Please.

322
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,926

323
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,377

00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,160
(On tape) 'Susie. '

325
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,434
'Susie. '

(Horn blares)

330
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,029
I recorded this a few hours ago.

331
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,736
It's quite faint, so I had to save it as a sound
file on the computer to enhance the sound.

332
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,272
So, um...

333
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,180
- she knows that I visited?
- I believe so.

334
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,911
- So will I get to see her this time?
- No.

335
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,476
This will just be sound. I'm sorry, John,

336
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,351
we have to be a little patient.

337
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,021
Trust me, John,
this is just the beginning. Sit, here.

338
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,723
Now...

339
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,658
If you want to hear it again,
just press that key.

340
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,692
I'll be back in a moment.

341

'Tell him... because I love him. '

(Man) 'Bastard. '

347
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,232
What was that?

348
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,135
It's OK, it's OK.

349
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,266
We do have some very bad people out there.

350
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,242
You just have to press that...

351
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,270
and they're all gone.

352
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,807
We've had a step towards visual contact
with Anna. Let's celebrate that.

353
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,978
Here.

354
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,982
They can't all be nice,
they can't all be Anna.

(Static)

358
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,245

(Phone)

362
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,767
Hello.

363
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,503
- 'Lt's Raymond. Something's happening. '
- Really?

364
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,341
- 'Get over here. '
- I'm on my way.

365
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,670
(Knocks)

366
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,949
Hello?

367
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,529
Raymond?

368
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,865
(Rapid electronic beeping)

369
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,797
So you'll tell me whatever you find out?

370
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,997
I can't tell you any more
than you'll read in the papers.

371
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,109
Yeah, thanks.

372
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,263
Thank you for coming to the service.
It would've meant a lot to him.

373
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,064
Oh. Thank you for doing this for me.

374
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,336
I'm not sure where to start.
He was working off a disk, so...

375
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,867
Maybe Anna's original tapes
might be in one of these boxes.

376
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,640
You all right?

377
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,575
I still can't believe he's gone.

378
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,147
Well...

379
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,917
- Maybe he'll be in touch.
- I don't know.

380
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,222
Said he'd made enough of a nuisance
of himself when he was alive.

381
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,589
Just doesn't make any sense.
He was helping people.

382
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,963
Wow.

383
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,730
- These go back years.
- 23, to be precise.

384
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,529
"Carol should know. "

385
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,100
"Tell Thomas he should. "

386
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,169
"Men in the room. "

387
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,978
Oh, here's one - "500 dollars still there. "

388
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,246
- That's the kind of message I like.
- Yeah.

389
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,942
(Static)

390
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,199
There we go.

391
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,031
Why do we got so many?

392
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,301
So you can watch your favorite show
and I can watch my favorite show.

393
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,041
Yeah.

394
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,313
(Inaudible)

395
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,884
(Static)

396
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,561
(Glass smashes)

397
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,839
OK... Um...

398
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,849
They're showing me something.

399
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,441
It's...

400
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,145
It's, uh...

401
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,652
Willow Avenue.
They're showing me Willow Avenue. Yes?

402
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,423
No. No. No.

403
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,725
Oh. OK.

404
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,168
It's no problem. Sometimes it happens.

405
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,445
Your wife, she passed over recently.

406
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,643
(Quietly) Yeah.

407
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,456
Her passing was difficult.

408
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,318
Yeah.

409
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,918
She was, um...

410
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,061
She's a writer. She was a writer.

411
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,531
Yeah, her words are important.

412
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh...

413
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,103
I'm sorry, the light is way too bright.

414
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,408
It's... it's like these tiny, noisy, little pinpoints.

415
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,118
It's making it hard to see anything at all.
Can you...

416
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,722
(Sharp scream)

417
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,666
- It's electronic voice...
- I know what this is.

418
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,603
- I've been making tapes...
- You shouldn't.

419
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,906
You shouldn't try this by yourself,
it's not safe.

420
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,971
It's like homemade Ouija boards
and teenage séances at Halloween.

421
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,643
E.V.P. Is not good.

422
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,917
We spend years developing
our relationships with our guides

423
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,456
so that we can protect you.

424
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,786
- From what?
- From the ones who like damage.

425
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,154
Cos they are out there and they will find you.

426
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,600
If you're gonna
keep insisting on meddling, then...

427
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,797
Anna, my wife, she sent me a sign.

428
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,137
No. No. Not Anna.
You are misreading everything.

429
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:15,271
Listen, it is one thing to contact the dead,
it is another to meddle,

430
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,610
and you are meddling.

431
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,323
- I just came cos I wanted some help.
- I know, I can help you.

432
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,484
It's just that they are urging me
to tell you to stop.

433
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,461
Right. Thank you.

434
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,529
Mr. Rivers...

435
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,969
Willow Avenue. Are you sure?
They keep showing me Willow Avenue.

436
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,564
No.

437
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:49,705
No Willow Avenue,
no Willow Street, no Willow Terrace.

438
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,982
Mr. Rivers. She was pregnant. Yes?

Excuse me. Are you Susie Tomlinson?

452
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,861
- Yeah.
- My name's Jonathan Rivers.

453
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,666
- Hi.
- May I speak to you?

454

(Sobbing)

455
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,318
My mother died giving birth to me.

456
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,686
And my grandmother, she tried for years
to make contact with her.

457
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,216
You know, with candles,
darkness and smoke...

458
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,559
- Séances?
- Yeah.

459
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,031
All of that, she tried everything.

460
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,070
She used to tell me...

461
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,968
that when she died she'd let me know
if she found her, if she...

462
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,207
if she found my mother.

463
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,853
Whenever I was sad,
she nagged me to cheer up.

464
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:22,450
She would say, "Susie Tomlinson,
look on the brighter side. "

465
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,221
"Susie Tomlinson, lighten up. "

466
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,597
"Susie Tomlinson, smile. "

467
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,127
They've found each other.

468
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,933
Haven't they?

469
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,642
That's what she wanted me to know.

470
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,426
It's like she didn't really die.

471
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:12,932
I get the call from my father and then, what,
like two days later you come by?

472
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,604
It's like she just carried straight on.

473
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,276
Susie, I don't understand.

474
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,150
I've been getting messages
from your grandmother for a week.

475
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,644
No, that can't be.
She just passed away two days ago.

476
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,165

- On our laps.

There you go. It works.

481
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,389
What's that, Dad?

482
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,025
That means it's time for us
to go pack up your gear. Come on.

483
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,967
One, two, three... Hoi!

484
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,833
That's it.

485
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,040
Next week, can I watch a video
and you watch a video like you said?

486
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:57,012
Yep, but only if you're good, and ready
for when your mom comes to pick you up.

487
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,708
OK.

488
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,810
- Daddy.
- Yeah.

489
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,152
Are you gonna be OK?

490
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,632
Yeah.

491
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,898
I promise.

492
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,212
(Woman) 'John.

493
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,949

Anna, baby.

00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,316
'John, my love. '

499
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,604

'John, my love. '

00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,849

00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,222

00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,843
(Man) 'Willow Avenue. '

516
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,633
(Electronic hissing)

517
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,692
(Baby crying)

518
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,658
(Electrical bang)

519
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,965
(Radio station playing, distorted)

520
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,099
Please! Please, get my baby!

521
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,898
Please.

522
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,236
Get my baby. Please.

523
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,071
(Baby crying)

524
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,100
Please.

525
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,183
(Horn blares)

526
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,088
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

527
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,929
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, sure.

528
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,198
How's he doing?

529
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,035
He's good. Gets a little better every day.

530
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,331
How are you?

531
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,980
I should...

532
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,212
- Sorry. Thanks again.
- Yeah. OK.

533
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,450
- Mr. Black.
- John...

534
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,823
Mr. Black.

535
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,658
Uh...

536
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:05,327
This is gonna sound strange
but I need to tell you. I went to Willow Avenue

537
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:09,600
because she reached out to me,
she asked for help.

538
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,903
That's the thing. She wanted help.

539
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,477
I am grateful for what you did, Mr. Rivers.

540
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:21,040
My son wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So thank you.

541
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,852
- But now I'd like you to leave us alone.
- Mr. Black...

542
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,584
Carol may have believed
your bullshit but not me.

543
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,626
So you and your sick friends,

544
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,720
you stay the fuck away
from me and my family, you understand?

545
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,755
You stay away.

546
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,446
Number one, they're not dead.

547
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:56,513
When I see them, they're not dead.
She shows me things that haven't happened.

548
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,747
- Things that haven't happened?
- Right.

549
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,517
Number two, she's showing me things
that are here,

550
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,923
not somewhere else where I can't do anything.

551
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,761
She doesn't show me an earthquake in India
or some bomb in the Middle East,

552
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,131
they're here in this city
where I can maybe do something.

553
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,797
I've seen things that haven't happened yet.
You understand?

554
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,238
I can see how you're putting it together.

555
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,435
Putting it...? Putting it together?
What do you mean?

556
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,038
She wants me to help.

557
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,998
I couldn't help Carol Black.

558
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,435
But I can help them.

559
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,494
(Ringing tone)

560
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,297
- 'Jonathan Rivers' office. '
- Karen, cancel my appointments

561
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,701
- for the next few days.
- 'Are you all right? '

562
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,729
I need a few days.

563
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,965
- 'Take care of yourself. '
- Yeah, I will.

564
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,776
(Voices)

565
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,080
(Anna) 'It hurts. '

566
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,718
(Distorted voices)

567
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,889
(Anguished cry)

568
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,427
(Growl)

569
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,281
(Man) 'Stop.

570
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,744
'She's ours. '

571
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,790
(Growling)

572
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,858
'She's ours. '

573
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,315
'John, my love. '

574
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,615
(Man) 'Willow Avenue. '

575
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:26,125
'Stop, you pig. Willow Avenue. '

576
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,020
It's the same voice.

577
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,400
When I was at Raymond's,
he had been receiving messages,

578
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,499
angry, violent messages.

579
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,533
Now I'm getting the same thing, Sarah.

580
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:44,375
- But from whom?
- I don't know.

581
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,922
Sarah.

582
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,985
Edith Tomlinson, 207.

583
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,193
I was getting messages
from Susie Tomlinson's grandmother.

584
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,260
She was trying to reach her dead daughter,
Susie's mother.

585
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,434
"Edith Tomlinson. Daughter died
giving birth, tapes 200 to 208."

586
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,278
Susie's grandmother.
She was visiting Raymond.

587
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,112
Probably just a coincidence.

588
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,845
Look for Carol Black, the woman in the car.

589
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,423
Remember what her husband said?

590
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:36,056
"My wife might have been
into that shit but I wasn't. "

591
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,598
"Carol Black.

592
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,506
"General interest, tape number 231."

593
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,875
Raymond had lists of clients.
You've seen only two.

594
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,352
I've seen hundreds of faces.
It could be the same with all of them.

595
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,220
I'm in there, you're in there,
Edith, Carol, they're just two people...

596
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,351
- There's too much else.
- It's a coincidence.

597
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:16,095
Mary Freeman. The missing woman.

598
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:21,174
She's on my tapes.

599
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,201
I've seen her.

600
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,237
She's on my tapes.

601
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,882
First they visit Raymond.

602
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,785
Then I see them.

603
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,930
Then they die.

604
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,569
- What are you doing?
- If she's alive, Anna will show her to me.

605
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,906
We don't know
that everyone you see is alive.

606
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,310
Susie's grandmother, Carol Black.

607
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,246
- What about Anna?
- Anna's different.

608
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,181
She's helping me.

609
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,845
- We don't know what's happening here.
- I do.

610
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:09,017
If Mary Freeman's on these tapes, she might
be alive and we might be able to save her.

611
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,312
(John) Sarah! Sarah, come here!

612
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,583
Look at this. Come here.

613
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,461
Come here. Look at this.

614
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,257
(Whimpering on tape)

615
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,030
Hear that?

616
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,564
That's her.

617
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,004
Oh, my God.

618
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,409
She's alive.

619
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,741
'Go. Go now. '

620
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,215
- Go where, baby?
- John...

621
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,243
Anna, go where?

622
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:15,518
'Please, John. Go! '

623
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,025
Go... go where, baby?

624
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,392
- 'Go now! '
- Go where?

625
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,824
(Faint voices)

626
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,436
Go where?

627
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,142
Damn it! She's gonna die.

628
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,979
- You don't know that.
- She's on the tape.

629
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,284
She's on the tape. She's gonna die.

630
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,663
'John.

631
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,057
'John.

632
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,515
'Lt hurts. '

633
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,088
Oh, my God.

634
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,562
Oh, my God.

635
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,174
- What if I don't wake up?
- You will.

636
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,501
I promise you will.

637
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,828
You will stay with me?

638
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,769
Sure.

639
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,266
Sure.

640
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,173
- Promise?
- Promise.

641
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,939
Thank you.

642
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,831
(Quiet moans)

643

- (Electronic beep)
- (Man) It's as much as we can say.

651
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,484
There's a 30, 40% chance
she might pull through.

652
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,323
Let's hope she's OK.
Thanks again for your help.

653

Mr. Rivers.

654
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:05,061
Neighbors say they saw you on the balcony
when Miss Tate fell. Is that true?

655
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,000
I was trying to stop her.

656
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,798
From falling?

657
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,237
Well, she was on the balcony.

658
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:14,333
Any idea why she was on the balcony?

659
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,776
I don't know. I don't know.

660
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:21,146
All right. I'll give you some time
but we'll need a full statement from you.

661
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,809
Are you heading home soon?

662
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:30,158
I'm not leaving town,
if that's what you mean.

663
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,193
OK. I may come by later then.

You're gonna be OK.

668

You're gonna be fine.

669
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,780
It hurts.
