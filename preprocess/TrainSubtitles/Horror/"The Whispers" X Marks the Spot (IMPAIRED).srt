I couldn't play anymore.

I said it was an accident,
but she didn't believe me.

If daddy was home, he would have listened,

but daddy's gone. Daddy's<i> always</i> gone.

5
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,843
Mommy says his job is very important.

6
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,512
He's a scientist. He looks at stuff.

7
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:41,682
I can't remember what now,
but he said when I'm older

8
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,019
he'll show me the funny-looking buildings.

9

That's an interesting name.

So someone's communicating
telepathically with these kids?

No, what I am saying is
that there are some children

00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:48,787
who are easily manipulated

is not and vice versa.

Yeah, but what's it doing here?

357
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,307
And what happened to the pilot?

358
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,309
Damba: We found no trace of him.

359
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,945
But we were curious, as well,

360

why an unauthorized American military plane

361

would be found within our borders.

You know I can't answer these questions.

This isn't a special projects affair.

This is air force. Why did you call me?

I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Karif.

He's a geologist
from the University of Algeria.

Why is a geologist interested
in a crashed fighter plane?

376
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,824
He's not interested in your plane.

There's something else we need to show you.

four months ago.

Nothing was here then.

Unfortunately, that's the best
timeline we have.

The plane...

Looks like it never
touched the ground here.

You're saying it did not crash?

Listen, I'm sorry about your husband.

00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,326
I should have said something before.

That's not what people
are talking about, is it?

Let's just say it hasn't
escaped people's attention

that you took your leave of absence

before your husband died,

the same time the assistant director did.

There are those who don't think
that's a coincidence.

How about you? What do you think?

to ask you about your son.

This morning, a little girl
tried to hurt her mother.

"You'll get through this."

That's what people say, don't they?

432
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:35,017
They said it to me.
It really pissed me off.

433
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:40,356
What exactly does it mean
to "get through this"?

434
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,860
Through what? What's on the other side?

435
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:48,530
I didn't want to get through it.

436
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:52,651
I wanted to die... In it.

437
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:58,824
And then my mom,
she said that grief is like

438
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,461
a suitcase that sits
at the bottom of your bed.

439
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,630
And no matter what, without fail,

440
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:08,500
you have it pick it up
every day, take it with you.

441
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:11,336
Some days, it will be filled with rocks,

and you won't think you can carry it.

Light as a feather.

445
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:26,568
That, she said, is "getting through it."

446
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,522
It made sense to me.

447

My husband was killed three
months ago in a plane crash.

I'm sorry.

what you were going through.

I'd be like if I lost him.

that you remember, anyone?

What?

493
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:54,665
There was someone across the street.

494
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,835
A-a man watching the building,

495
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,004
like he was waiting for something.

496
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:01,589
Can you describe this man?

497
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,343
His eyes...

498
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:07,678
it was like there was nothing there.

499
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,817
He had all these tattoos.

500
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,653
His body was covered with them.

When a kid gets old, they turn.

No.

he helped a little.

- [Beep]

568
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:18,969
You got to take a look at this.

569
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,137
So, that F-22?

570
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:21,972
- Mm-hmm.
- 94th fighter squadron.

571
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:23,974
Three months ago, it was sent out

572
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:25,809
on a classified surveillance run.

573
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:27,444
The mission was to gather
photographic evidence

574
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,813
of Chinese and Russian military
buildup in the arctic circle.

575
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,649
- Mm-hmm.
- But get this.

576
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,318
As soon as the pilot reached its target,

577
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,786
he radioed in he was losing control.

578
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,788
Two minutes later,
the plane disappeared off radar.

579
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:39,790
The arctic circle? You're sure?

580
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:41,125
Yeah, that's what it says.

581
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,993
That's... that's almost 4,000
miles away from the wreckage.

582
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,662
And according to the fuel log here,

583
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:46,880
the plane took off with only
300 miles worth of fuel.

584
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,715
So no way it could have made it
to that desert on its own.

585
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,384
No.
