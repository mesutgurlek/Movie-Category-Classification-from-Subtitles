00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:36,259  X1:317 X2:404 Y1:388 Y2:411
Charlie!

340
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:39,964  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:388 Y2:416
Stay in the light!

343
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,401  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:388 Y2:416
Wake up.

344
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:22,276  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:388 Y2:416
Wake up.

346
00:29:27,218 --> 00:29:28,242  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:388 Y2:416
Wake up.

347
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:30,516  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:388 Y2:416

348
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:32,386  X1:280 X2:441 Y1:388 Y2:411
It's the dream.

349
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,650  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:388 Y2:411
You know it's the dream.

350
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,682  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:388 Y2:416
Wake up.

353
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,604  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:388 Y2:416
[Whispering] Mary.

354
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:59,246  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:388 Y2:411
You are real.

355
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:07,515  X1:288 X2:434 Y1:388 Y2:416
LUCY: Mary?

356
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:14,059  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:388 Y2:416
Mary, wake up. Mary, wake up!

357
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,761  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:388 Y2:416
You were screaming.

358
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,769  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:388 Y2:416
God, you scared me!

359
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,134  X1:303 X2:418 Y1:388 Y2:411
I saw him.

360
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,766  X1:271 X2:450 Y1:388 Y2:411
I--I saw his face.

361
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,865  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:388 Y2:411
Who?

362
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,728  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:388 Y2:416
[Panting] Mary.

363
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,101  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:415
There's something wrong with me, Lucy.

364
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:34,866  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:388 Y2:416
There's something so wrong.

365
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:36,398  X1:315 X2:405 Y1:388 Y2:416
[Crying]

366
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,712  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:388 Y2:411
It's OK.

367
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,873  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:388 Y2:416
It's OK, Mary.

368
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:44,713  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:415
MARY: I've had these dreams my whole life--

369
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,914  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:410
trapped in darkness with this man.

370
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,721  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:415
I used to think they were just nightmares...

371
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,730  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:388 Y2:414
but this one, it was so real...

372
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,255  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415
I could feel his breath on my skin.

373
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:02,762  X1:347 X2:374 Y1:388 Y2:411
I...

374
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,606  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:388 Y2:416
I think I'm losing it.

375
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,302  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:388 Y2:416
Then it's good you're here.

376
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:14,713  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:415
It's been a long time since your last confession.

377
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,875  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:388 Y2:411
I'm not here to confess.

378
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,211  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:388 Y2:416
I need to ask you something.

379
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,187  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:388 Y2:416
All right.

380
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,794  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:388 Y2:416
My mother came to this church...

381
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,797  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:410
for the last five years of her life.

382
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,459  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415
Did she ever talk about my father?

383
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,127  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:388 Y2:416
Why she left him?

384
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:37,262  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:388 Y2:416
Why she took me away?

385
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,272  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:388 Y2:416
Did she ever say what it was...

386
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,399  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:415
she thought she was protecting me from?

387
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,238  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:388 Y2:416
Why are you asking me this?

388
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:47,737  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:388 Y2:416
She was afraid of something.

389
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,545  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:388 Y2:416
Spiritually afraid.

390
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:54,016  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:388 Y2:416
She must've told you things...

391
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:56,147  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:388 Y2:411
she couldn't even tell me.

392
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,490  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:410
She came to you the week before she died.

393
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:04,463  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:410
Did she confess some terrible secret?

394
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:10,197  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:388 Y2:411
Do I have some terrible secret?

395
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,803  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:410
Her confession would've been confidential.

396
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:19,539  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:388 Y2:414
We're friends, David.

397
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,980  X1:292 X2:429 Y1:388 Y2:411
Remember?

398
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,642  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:388 Y2:416
We went to school together.

399
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:24,673  X1:347 X2:374 Y1:388 Y2:411
I...

400
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:28,780  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:388 Y2:416
I boycotted your ordination.

401
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:33,150  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:388 Y2:411
MARY: She's dead now.

402
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,790  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:388 Y2:411
You can tell me.

403
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:39,893  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:388 Y2:416
As my friend.

404
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:42,663  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:388 Y2:416
MARY: Not as a priest.

405
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:52,705  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:388 Y2:416
I'm sorry, Mary.

406
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:55,408  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:410
FATHER DAVID: She never told me.

407
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:56,780  X1:296 X2:427 Y1:388 Y2:416
Not a thing.

408
00:32:58,952 --> 00:33:00,749  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:410

409
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:03,847  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:358 Y2:415

412
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,492  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:415

413
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,500  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:388 Y2:416
that took place earlier today.

414

415
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,168  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:415

417
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,404  X1:244 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:410

421
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:30,007  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:415
I'm here in a swamp of death tonight...

422
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,042  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:415
for five doomed souls destined for points unknown.

424
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,054  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:415
Sensitive viewers may want to turn away.

426
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,525  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:415
with radio cable and bound in twisted pipe.

427
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,292  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:388 Y2:416

429
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,435  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:415
were removed to nearby Clarke...

430
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:50,902  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:388 Y2:416
where a tiny town hall...

431
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,531  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:415

436
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,724  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:388 Y2:416
All right.

437

445
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,948  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:388 Y2:416

446
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,214  X1:258 X2:465 Y1:388 Y2:411

447
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:16,154  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:388 Y2:416

448
00:35:16,189 --> 00:35:17,816  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:388 Y2:416

603
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:16,777  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:388 Y2:416
Only this--he hates God.

604
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:19,477  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:415
He is repulsed by all things Christian...

605
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:21,349  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:410

606
00:47:21,386 --> 00:47:26,153  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:415

618
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:11,460  X1:221 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:410
and he senses it. He senses his own blood.

01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,854  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:388 Y2:416
Welcome to my world

1116
01:34:36,898 --> 01:34:41,801  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:415
Feel the weight of it grinding down again

1117
01:34:44,072 --> 01:34:46,870  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:388 Y2:411
Shook off

1118
01:34:46,908 --> 01:34:48,876  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415
Gather your pathetic masses

1119
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:50,207  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:388 Y2:416
And bring them to me

1120
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:52,303  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:388 Y2:416
To a world devoid of light

1121
01:34:52,347 --> 01:34:55,578  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:358 Y2:415
To another time, to another place

1122
01:34:55,617 --> 01:34:58,586  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:415
And then the broken ones taste my misery

1123
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,248  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:415
Rip away the disguise, and you will realize

1124
01:35:01,289 --> 01:35:03,985  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:415
That you find the truth is sickening

1125
01:35:04,025 --> 01:35:07,017  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:415
We don't need to change it, really

1126
01:35:07,061 --> 01:35:10,758  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:388 Y2:416
I kind of like it ugly

1127
01:35:10,798 --> 01:35:12,789  X1:340 X2:382 Y1:388 Y2:416
Lay

1128
01:35:12,834 --> 01:35:14,358  X1:351 X2:369 Y1:398 Y2:421
It

1129
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:16,267  X1:328 X2:392 Y1:388 Y2:411
Make

1130
01:35:16,304 --> 01:35:18,295  X1:307 X2:413 Y1:388 Y2:416
It binding

1131
01:35:18,339 --> 01:35:20,204  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:388 Y2:416
Seething

1132
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:21,936  X1:315 X2:407 Y1:388 Y2:416
Blinding

1133
01:35:21,976 --> 01:35:23,568  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:388 Y2:416
Screaming

1134
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:25,238  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:388 Y2:416
Heavy

1135
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:26,712  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1136
01:35:26,748 --> 01:35:28,978  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:415
Welcome to my world, grinding down

1137
01:35:29,017 --> 01:35:30,814  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:388 Y2:416
And heavy

1138
01:35:30,852 --> 01:35:32,410  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:388 Y2:416
I want it heavy

1139
01:35:32,453 --> 01:35:35,013  X1:251 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:415
Feel the weight of it grinding

1140
01:35:35,056 --> 01:35:36,546  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:388 Y2:416
Heavy

1141
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:39,355  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1142
01:35:39,394 --> 01:35:42,124  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1143
01:35:42,163 --> 01:35:43,824  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy
