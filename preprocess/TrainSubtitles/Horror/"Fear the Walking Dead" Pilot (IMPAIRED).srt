Hello.

He has a bruised rib,
contusions.

66
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,169
Physically, your son is lucky,
but I'm more worried about--

67
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,788
- Woman: Toxicology?
- There's that, yes, but--

68
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,841
- Heroin's his drug of choice.
What did he take? - He's over 18, ma'am.

Clark.

Witnesses said he ran
into traffic with intent.

- He was ranting.

I requested a psych consult.

You were running, Nick.

82
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,662
I went for a run.

83

Barefoot, down "Needle Alley"?

84
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,167
Man, Kenyans run barefoot.

Uh-huh. You said
someone got hurt.

86
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,005
You remember that? You
were raving about "flesh

and blood and viscera."

88
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:27,394
Um, it's runner's high.

89
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,681
Yeah.

90
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,684
Oh, I don't know
what "viscera" is.

91

Tell us where you scored.

92
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,022
Lots of kids
buying in that hood.

93
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,491
We clean it up,
you come out a hero.

95
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,414
Nick, you could have died.

96
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,417
Yeah, coulda, woulda, shoulda.

97
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,421
Police officer: <i>Okay, we'll
take it from the top.</i>

98
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,591
- Nick, why were you running?
- Is my son under arrest?

99
00:07:57,593 --> 00:08:01,378
- No, ma'am.
- Then get out. Thank you. Leave.

100
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
- We could charge him.
- Well, charge him when he's healed.

101
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,383
- For now, go away.
- She do all the talking?

102
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,218
Get the--
get out.

103
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm not as eloquent.

104
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,555
What happened?

105
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,807
L.A. is not
a pedestrian-friendly city.

106
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,977
- Nick.
- I just tried to beat the light.

107
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,563
Why the restraints?

108
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,316
I don't know.
Ask the lab coat.

109
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:24,651
Did you try to hurt yourself?

110
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,236
Nick:
<i>No, Mom.</i>

111
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,871
<i>Come on, it was an accident.</i>

112

<i>It was just an accident.</i>

113
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,909
All right, I'm gonna
call for a bed.

114
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:35,161
No, no, no.
Mom, no.

- It's how we help you.

116
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:39,332
- No, we can't help me.
- Listen to your mother, Nick.

117
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,834
You definitely can't help me.

118
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,669

- He's just--

121
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,308
None of you can--
can you just leave me alone?

122
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,393
- Can you just let me go?
- There's an idea.

123
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,479
- Alicia, not helpful.
- I'm not trying to help, Travis.

124
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:55,098
- What did you say?
- It's none of his business anyway.

125
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,983
- You know what? Go to the car. Go.
- Travis:<i> It's okay.</i>

126
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,103
- Please just leave me alone.
- Everyone take a breath, huh?

127

-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>

128
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,116
( ringing continues )
Tell me what happened. It's just you and me.

129
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:17,087
Glad you moved in?

130
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,872
Yeah.

131
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,291
- Liza.
- Did you find him?

132
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,127
Travis: <i>Yeah, wanted
to let you guys know.</i>

133
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,297

- Banged up, but he'll recover.

okay for the weekend?</i>

137

What do you mean?

138
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,189
Can you still take Christopher?

139
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,808
- I don't want to go.
- Chris, it's Dad's weekend.

140
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,660
<i>He has a say.</i>

141
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,326
Well, I get a say in this
and I don't want to go.

142
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,542
Let me talk to him.

143
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,910
Well, maybe I don't want
you here, Mr. Unpleasant.

144
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,033
Maybe I have plans.

145
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,485
Chris: <i>I'll stay at Dante's.
Look, I'm not gonna go</i>

146
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,203
<i>to some hospital</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

147

148
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,490
Please.

149
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,210
Talk to your father.

150
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,830
I don't want to come.

151
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,049
Well, it's my weekend.

152
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:07,137
Fine, Dad.
Force me.

153
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,472
Let's bond. What do you got
planned for the weekend?

154
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,058
Come on, I'm doing
the best I can.

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,978
Yeah, but that really
doesn't help.

156
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,681
We're all building
a family, okay?

157
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,317
All of us. Now, coming
here to support Nick's

158
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,018
- not the worst thing.

<i>Question of the day.</i>

485
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:07,548
Now, what is London
trying to teach us here?

00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,801
That wasn't
a rhetorical question.

You keep working on that.
That's good.

Way to go, Brandon.
To think, good.

489
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,310
- To listen.
- To listen. Yeah, that's good.

<i>What does London--</i>

but this is an English class.

Put it away.
Russell!

494
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,822
Enlighten us.
Come on, bud.

495
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,625
I don't care about
building a fire.

496

Travis: <i>No? Can
you build a fire?</i>

Russell:
<i>I got a stove.</i>

All right, all right.

500
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,920
So what about this wolf dog?

501
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,721
Does he care about
the man in the story?

502
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,556
Hell, no.

503
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,342
Hell, no?
Why?

504
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,560
<i>'Cause the man tried</i>
<i>to cut the damn dog open</i>

505
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,512
<i>to keep his hands warm.</i>
<i>That's gruesome.</i>

506
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:58,315
That's gruesome,
but why would he do that?

507
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,934
To build a fire.

508
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,937
But why? Why would
he build a fire?

509
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,105
( snaps fingers ) Think about it.
Think about it.

510
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,658
- Why would he build a fire?
- To not die.

511
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:12,279
Nailed it.
See, man versus nature.

512
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,699
London's trying to teach
us how not to die.

513
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,451
Good analysis, Russell.

514
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,287
<i>Imagine what would happen if
you stayed awake in my class.</i>

Artie.

522

You know how I have to evaluate
each teacher each semester?

523
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,051
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm evaluating.

526

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>The dog is instinct.</i>

527
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,261
The dog is nature.

528
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,730
And nature, well,

529
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,900

- Sure.

I'm here for him and for you.

Oh, no, I don't have to.

536

I take my dog out when I want
to, not the other way around.

00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,275
He doesn't want to be found.

643
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:43,779
We'll bring him home.

644
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,032
Travis, he'd rather sleep in
that place than his own bed.

645
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,401
I don't--

646
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,324
I don't know if I want
him to come home.

647
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,742
I get it.

648
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:58,744
You do?

649
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:00,796
I don't.

650
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,715
- What does that make me?
-<i> ( sirens wailing )</i>

651

Human.

652

Weak.

653
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,176
I'm just tired of waiting
on the call from the morgue.

654
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:16,812
Not gonna happen.

655
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:21,767
We're gonna find him,
we're gonna get him in rehab.

656

<i>I'm gonna drag him there</i>

and drag his ass.

659
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:31,827
I promise.

-<i> ( sirens wailing )</i>

661
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,039
Better call Alicia.

662
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,592
Get her to eat something.

663
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:53,382
Might have been
a high-speed gone bad.

- What the hell is happening?
- Back in the truck.

675

I'm getting out of here.

Only five?

What, did you miss a few stops?

679
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:00,635
I hope you guys
got your flu shots.

680

Teacher: <i>KTLA killed the

681

but the cameras kept rolling.

682
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,810
Someone leaked the footage.

683
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,229
What the hell is this?

684
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:13,314
Teacher:
<i>Artie, check this out.</i>

Costa:
<i>What?</i>

686
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:23,942
Guy's not dead.

<i>Traumatized from the accident

Teacher:
<i>Look how they beat the guy.</i>

690
00:47:45,382 --> 00:47:47,015
There's an explanation.

691
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:48,383
No one's offered it.

692
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:51,469
<i>Folks talking airborne toxins,</i>

693

<i>poisoned water, viruses.</i>

Costa: This is why
everyone's staying home.

695

<i>How he keeps coming.</i>

698

Costa: <i>I've got to
call the district.</i>

699
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,867
See how they want to play this.

700
00:48:09,322 --> 00:48:11,572
This is what Nick
was describing.

701
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,661
- Call the police.
- You're sure?

702
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:19,297
We have to find him. I don't
know how else to do it.

( exhales )

704

sorry to keep calling you,</i>

705
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:34,479
but I got to know what
went down at the church.

706

Please just call me back.

707

Teacher: <i>Traditional science

<i>such as gravity...</i>

<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>nonlinear things</i>

It's not real.
It can't be real.

Matt's not texting me.

And you're not texting him.

721

What about Nick?

Well, you'll be there

It was a horror show.

780

Gloria killed two people.

And I need to get
it out of my head.

- I know.
- You're not making any sense, Nicky.

I know. I know.
I know, but I saw it, Cal.

I saw her do it and I need
to get it out of my head.

You need to contain yourself.

788
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:47,875
- You need to contain yourself.
- Okay, yeah.

789
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:54,415
I'm so sorry, man.
I'm leaving.

790

- I can't. I can't scrub it out.
- Yeah, you can.

798
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,826
Yeah, you can.
Yeah, you can.

799

How long has it been?

800

Um, a couple of days.

Okay.

You got your works?

No.

Oh, man.
Thank you so much.

- Thank you so much.
- Let's go. Come on.

Your mom told me
you were in an accident.

Yeah. Yeah.

Well, I didn't look both ways.

Cops talk to you?

814
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:33,013
They had a lot of questions.

815
00:56:04,597 --> 00:56:07,098
Sit tight, brother.
It's safe here.

Nick, hey, I said

I told you not to bring her.

Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

838
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,579
- Travis, I said not to bring her.
- Are you all right?

839
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:13,614
- I know. We've both been looking for you.
- Why wouldn't I?

- Are you okay?
- I did a-- I did--

841

- I did a bad thing.
- It's okay.

842
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:19,620
- What are you talking about?
- It's okay, just get in the truck, Nick.

843
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,372
- It's not okay.
- Nicky, what happened?

844
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:24,291
- Okay, so he-- he pulled a gun on me.
- Who?

- Who did? - He pulled a gun on me
and he tried to kill me.

what was in the shit
he gave me, you know?

What are you
talking about, Nick?

849
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,300
Calvin.
I shot Calvin.

- Calvin?
- I shot Calvin. I killed Calvin.

Nick! Where? What are
you talking about?

it was
self-defense, okay?
