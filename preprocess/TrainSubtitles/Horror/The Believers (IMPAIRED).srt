Yeah, sure. The family is Cuban.

507

- Ever hear of that?
- No.

509

511

- And Lopez is into this?
- Yeah. He kept it quiet, but...

512
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,358
You said he found the body on an altar,
with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?

513

There's at least 200 places sell that shit,

If I'm evaluating a patient,

Wouldn't you?

516
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,618
A citizen's got a right to his own religious
preference. That's the First Amendment.

517
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,871

I'd say he forfeits that right.

of a surgeon, not a psychopath.

that Lopez is a suspect?

521

That it's one of your own?

522
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,886
It's not this religion, is it?

Kate's fieldwork. Post-graduate.

the elders of the tribe came to see us.

1314

Single-mindedness.

One life from each of us, Cal, is all he asks.

Sacrifice our children, our families
to false gods, ambition, lust, pride!

- Dad.
- It's hypocrisy! This is all lies.

1412
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,561
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life! God gives you life!

01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:38,236
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?

1416
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:41,614
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?

1417
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,911
And you sacrificed your son
to the gods, didn't you?

That was my salvation.
