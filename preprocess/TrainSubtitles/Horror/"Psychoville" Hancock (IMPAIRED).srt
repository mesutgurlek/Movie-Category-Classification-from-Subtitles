1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,239
Still got a few tricks
up your sleeve, Jolly.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,440
We're missing a book.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,079
50 Great Coastal Walks
Of The British Isles Volume Two.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,839
Police have been asking -
I need someone to look after it.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
Stop it! Oh, why should I?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,559
Because you've got cancer!

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,720
No loose ends, Kelvin.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,479
And if he doesn't know anything?
Kill him.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,279
What do you know about Hancock?

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,359
Who is he? Fill me in.
His name's Shahrouz. Oh, my God!

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,760
Will you marry him for me?

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,839
I won't say anything.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,039
Billy was nine years old,
fell out of a tree.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,999
Lost a lot of blood.
My wife said we'd better call Tony.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,719
What? He was the father?

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
I loved that boy
but I walked out on him that day
and never seen him since.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,120
How long have I got?

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,359
I'm just reading the file on
Oscar Lomax. Have you read it?
Oh, yes, ma'am.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,839
I can't believe it.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,119
Indeed, ma'am. It's quite
extraordinary, if it's true.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,279
What's the clown up to? Mr Jelly?

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,439
Still visiting the old lady,
the occasional children's party.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,159
Nothing out of the ordinary.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,159
BEEPING

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
It's my video conference call.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,519
Mr Mansour. Can you see me?

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,159
Yes, I see you.
Now, am I in high definition?

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,160
We had these HDMI cables fitted.
You should be able to tell
if I hold up this.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,079
Never mind.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,999
We are growing impatient,
Miss Andrews.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,399
When will we see
a return on our investment?

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,639
I can assure you we are very close to
making our presentation, Mr Mansour.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,759
I'm sure you can appreciate
we're working at the cutting-edge
of technology here.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Sorry ma'am, just need to grab
a bit of Blu-Tack. Thanks.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,199
We are just waiting on the
final piece of the jigsaw
before we can proceed.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,639
I hope I need not remind you how
much is at stake here, Miss Andrews?

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,239
Of course. And I can assure you
that we will leave no stone unturned.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
No offence.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,799
What do you mean?

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Well, you stone people, don't you?

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,919
Do you?

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
I hope to hear from you soon.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Shit.
Think I put my foot in it, there.

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Kelvin, get Detective Finney.
I need that locket!

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,199
Hi, Mum.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,879
Morning, David.

47
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,960
I've mushed a Weetabick up for you,
it's on the table.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,719
How you feeling?

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,639
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Here, take your vitamins.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360
It burns.
That's because it's working.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,639
Sorry about last night.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,319
Robin's fault. I've spent ages
unblocking that toilet bowl.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,879
You should've seen me.
It was like Augustus Gloop.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,280
No, I mean the cancer.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,680
What are you going to do?

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,879
I'm clearing out under your bed

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,839
so if there's anything you don't
want me to see, shift it.

Hello?

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,399
Is that David Sowerbutts? Speaking.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,279
I sent you a card recently
with a message.

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
I think it would be wise if we met.
Meet me at King's Cross Station.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,119
Three o' clock. There'll be
a ticket in your name. Yeah.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
I want this to end.

Hello, Hoyti Toyti's.

69
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,439
I've got to make a phone call.
Be back in ten minutes, all right?

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Aye, go on then. Cod and chips.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,039
A what, dear? A Homepride Fred?

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,319
Oh, you mean like a flour shaker?

73
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,239
No, we do toys, dear. Antiques.

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,999
Try Kath's Kitchens.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,999
Oh, here comes trouble.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,879
Where is it, then?

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,519
Here, I've laid it all out for you.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,719
Not much new stuff in this month.
Come and have a feel.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,799
That Sooty turned out
to be fake, then?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,559
Yes, they traced it back to a woman
in Pickering. She made them herself.

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,999
Apparently, she had a whole
attic full of Sues.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,039
She was about to flood the market
but they caught her.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,079
This Slinky's a bit loose, isn't it?
I know, it's Chinese.

84
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,279
HE GROANS

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,319
Now, I know the answer to this
but I'm going to put it out there
anyway.

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,839
Would you have any interest
in a Simpsons chess set?

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,039
Not in the slightest.
I cannot shift it.

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,079
Oh, stay away from the '80s, Peter.
You've been burned before.

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,119
What's this?
Not seen one like this before.

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,719
Oh, it just came in this morning,

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,479
not had a chance to give it
the once-over myself yet.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,079
Papier mache head, wooden hands,
nicely carved.

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,560
Original lace.

94
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,479
French, I'd say.
This is quite a find, Peter.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,159
Yes, apparently it was a prop
in that old film,

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,399
The Punch And Judy Man with,
oh, what's his name...?

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
The lad himself?

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Tony Hancock.

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,080
All right, see you in a bit. Cool.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,319
You following me, bruv? What?
I've seen you following me.

101
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,079
What do you want?
I think you can help me.

Hello? Hello, husband.

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,479
Do you know, I still can't get used
to saying that. Hello, Hattie.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,319
Eh, Chris is not here.
He go to Cranford.

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,919
I know. I tried to call him
but couldn't get through.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,839
Listen, Shahrouz, I don't want
to panic you, but we might
have a bit of a problem.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,879
Huh?

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,279
I've had a call from the man
at the Home Office who's
processing your visa application.

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,319
Visa, yes.

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,479
Well, he's suspicious about
our wedding cos it was so close
to the expiry date of your old visa,

112
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,199
and he wants to do a home visit,

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,799
just to check we are actually
living as Mr and Mrs,
what is it, Japan...?

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,479
Javanmardy. That's it.
Hattie Javanmardy. Unreal.

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,239
You want me to come round after work?
Erm...

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,519
I think you should, you know,
just to be on the safe side. OK.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,599
I will be there after six.
Thank you, Hattie.

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Oh, and Shahrouz? Yes?

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000

Hello. I'm Mr Jolly.

122
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,839
Yes, we are expecting you.

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,920
Oooh, I know it says Jelly on there
but it's a mistake.

124
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Just ignore it.

125
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,679
Mmmm. This is all very posh.
How long you lived here?

126
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,359
Oh, I'm not the owner, sir.
I'm just in service here.

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,799
Oh, right. Oh, yeah.
I wondered why you had gloves on.

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,680
Thought you might be allergic.

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,359
So, can I ask, the party -
is it a boy or a girl?

130
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,839
A young man I believe, sir.
He's just upstairs getting prepared.

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,519
Right, well, I usually do
pirate stuff for the lads.

132
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,840
I used to do balloon animals but
it's got ridiculous with the hook.

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,080
Well, we have a room prepared
for you. Just let me have your bag.

134
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
I shan't be a moment.

LAUGHTER

136
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,479
SHE SCREAMS

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,560
Oh, sorry! Sorry! Use a lock.

138
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,599
Yo, ho, ho. Hello,
my name is Captain Hook and
I'm looking for the birthday boy.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,279
Have any of you landlubbers
seen him?

140
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,400
HE SINGS "The Sailor's Hornpipe".

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,919
Sorry, have I dropped a bollock?
Everyone, this is Mr Jolly.

142
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,359
He's our entertainment
for the afternoon.

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,159
Can I get you a drink?

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,800
Why not? I am Mr Jolly.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,719
No! I told you before,
I don't want anything to do with him!

146
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,119
He only wants to talk to you.
I'm not meeting him, Tealeaf.

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,679
Here, ring him up and cancel it.
Tell him it's off.

148
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,679
Look, you should just chat to him.
He seems like a nice guy.

149
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,999
I can't meet him, Tealeaf. Do you
understand? I can never meet him.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,959
He doesn't blame you for anything.
It wasn't your fault.

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,639
You were the one who was lied to.
If I saw him it would only make
things worse than they already are.

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,639
It wouldn't,
he sees you as his father.

153
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,239
I am his father. That's what he
wants. I mean I'm his real father.
I thought Hancock...

154
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
I am Hancock!

155
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
What?

156
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm Tony Hancock.

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Stone me, what a life.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
Can't even do the voice any more.

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,920
Does your son know?

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes, I think he's worked it out.

161
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,960
Go and fetch him, Tealeaf.

162
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
It's time I faced the truth.

163
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,600
All right. Be back in half an hour.

164
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,760
Hancock's Half Hour.

165
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Sorry. That's all right.

166
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,079
You? Yes, me.

167
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
I know what you did.

168
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
What do you want?

169
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,199
Well, I've been thinking a lot about
how to commit the perfect murder.

170
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Coffee?

171
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,759
I have a bit of a problem
with cash flow.

172
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,839
I don't know if you know
about Haringey's payment structure,

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,039
but there's a glass ceiling
for public sector workers

174
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,920
and I'm banging my head against it.

175
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,079
It's supposed to incentivise
cross-borough collaboration,

176
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,799
but why would we want to get
into bed with the Barnet lot

177
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,239
when their grants
are not centrally managed?

178
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,479
I don't know. Exactly!

179
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,319
Anyway, I have, shall we say,
substantial debts,

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,839
and I can't keep chasing
the Thunderball forever

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
because that way, madness lies.

182
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,599
What's this?

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
I have a great aunt who's
left me some money in her will.

184
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,599
It's not much, but it'll see me
debt-free for the first time
since the credit crunch.

185
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I want you to help her on her way.

186
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
You want me to murder her?

187
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,119
Don't look so shocked.

188
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,999
Last time I saw you,
you were happily telling me
you'd just killed five people.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,879
Three men, two ladies.
Three men, two ladies.

190
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
This just makes it three of each.
Balances it.

191
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,759
You do this for me,
and all the information
I have on you and Critchley Gardens

192
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,720
will mysteriously find it's way
into the recycling.

193
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,799
You scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours. My mum does that.

194
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
Oh.

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, do we have a deal?

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
She's not well.

197
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,199
If I do this for you,
you've got to do something for me.

198
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,359
Criss cross.

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,440
How do you mean?
I don't want her to suffer any more.

200
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,879
Is that your watch?

201
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,039
There you are. Thank you, ladies.

202
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,519
Everything's prepared for you
upstairs. If you'd come this way.

203
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,479
God, half pissed now!
Birthday boy ready, is he?

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,799
I believe so, sir.

205
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Right. Well, I'd better get going.
I'll take that, thank you.

206
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,840
Everything in order, sir?

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,440
I think so, yes.
I won't be a moment.

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,360
Just checking you have everything,
Jolly? We've prepared the lights.

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,319
What's this?

210
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,559
This is Mr Kakkar.
And it's his left kidney, I think.
Is that right, Gravy?

211
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,599
It is, sir.

212
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,199
And the local anaesthetic
has been administered as instructed.

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,880
It goes in here when you're done,
then ring the bell.

214
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,519
I was thinking more of
a rabbit out of a hat.

215
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
We'll just leave you to it.

216

Oh, God. I'm going to have
to learn all about this, aren't I?

238
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
Are you going to try and convert me?

239
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,320
Or should I try and convert you?

Yeah, he is, but we don't know when.

I sleep on the couch.

Don't be daft.
You can sleep in my bed.

I'll go in the spare room.

On the 14th of October 2007,
you borrowed
Alice Through The Looking Glass.

310
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,199
Do you remember that book, Chloe?

311
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,799
Beware the Jabberwock, my son.

312
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,520
The jaws that bite.
The claws that catch.

313
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,279
On the 28th of October,
your mummy brought the book back
to the library,

314
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,839
and on the 31st of October
Margaret Cheng took it out again.

315
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,080
Because libraries are all about
sharing, aren't they, Chloe?

316
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,919
What do you want?

317
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,600
Where is 50 Great Coastal Walks
Of The British Isles Volume Two?

318
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,439
It's a book, Chloe.

319
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
One of our books from the library
and your mummy has stolen it.

320
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,280
Jabberwocky would like to read
that book, Chloe.

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,959
Would you like me to send him to
your room so he can look for it?

322
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,959
Very well.

323
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,280
You have to look for it.

324
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll be watching. Night night.

325
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,200
Never been with a woman before,
have you?

326
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, as Bonnie said,
I can always...

327
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,600
"Turn around, bright eyes".

328
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,280
I'm very proud of the fact
my ex-partner said
he could never tell the difference.

329
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,800
Turn the light out, Shahrouz.

330
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,279
There wasn't a day go by
I didn't think of you, Billy.

331
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,000
But after what I did,
I knew I couldn't go on.

332
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,600
Sugar? Thank you.

333
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,439
I ruined my best friend's life.

334
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
Slept with his wife and
fathered a son he thought his own.

335
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
It killed him.

336
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,799
And the guilt killed me.

337
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,440
One fake suicide in Australia later
and all my sins were washed away.

338
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,480
The career was on its way out
so that didn't bother me.

339
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,199
I'd turned them all against me,
anyway.

340
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,319
Sid, Ray and Alan.

341
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,360
Williams.

342
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,360
All I had to do was
become somebody else.

343
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,919
It was easier to arrange
away from home.

344
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
A weighted coffin was buried.

345
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,360
Then I came up here
to start my new life.

346
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
A quiet life.

347
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,199
It's quite a story.

348
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,919
Yes, indeed.
But what about you, Billy?

349
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,399
There must me so many things
you want to ask me.

350
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,719
Oh, only one thing.
Where's the locket?

351
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,959
Eh? The locket!

352
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,359
Oscar. What happened to it?

353
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,119
What do you mean?
I don't know anything about that.

354
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,919
I thought you probably didn't.
But it'd be rude not to ask, eh?

355
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,400
Here we go, then.
Billy! Please. Billy, I'm sorry.

356
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I forgive you.

357
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Here we go, then.

358
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,080
You ready for this?
Just give me a moment.

359
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
I've waited 40 years for this.

360
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm shaking.

361
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,599
Don't worry.

362
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,279
I'm sure your dad's just as
choked up as you are.

363
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah? Come on.

364
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Mr Lomax, Billy's here.

365
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,920
Not again.

366
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,560
There you are! Where've you been?

367
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,280
Eccles.

368
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
What for?

369
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,079
Eccles cake.

370
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,599
David, how many more times?
You can get them from the Spar.

371
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
You don't have to go to Hamburg
to get a hamburger.

372
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,479
I've been picking out the music
I want at my funeral.

373
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,199
I want one classical and
one from the cheering-up tape.

374
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,519
Trying to decide between Superman
and Oops Upside Your Head.
See how wide the pews are.

375
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,120
But for the classical, I want this.

376
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,720
