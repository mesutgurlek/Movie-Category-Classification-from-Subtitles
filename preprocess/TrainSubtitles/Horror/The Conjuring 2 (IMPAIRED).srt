the Lutzes moved in,

a young man named Ronny DeFeo

Ed and Lorraine Warren,

at the Amityville house.

And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

226
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,846
Dr. Steven Kaplan, who says that the
investigations the Warrens conducted

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,402
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

Why is that?

229
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,046
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,645
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

Yes, it has.

232

The Lutz family made everything up so
they could profit off of all the publicity.

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,125
That's just not true.

Look, we see this all the time.

been there and experienced it for yourself.

Yeah.

822
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,206
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.

823
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,365
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

And it looked right at me.

Of course, my mom and the nurses
