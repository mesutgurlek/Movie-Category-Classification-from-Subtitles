Oh, jeez Brent, you are cracking up.

531
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,301
A few years ago,
I thought about contacting her.

532
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,977
I traced her to West Virginia.

533
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,771
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.

534
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,188
Listen, Brent... Nobody has seen
or heard of her for over 25 years.

535
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,400
Now why the hell would she be showing up
now as some sort of psycho killer?

536
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,281
Put the phone down, I'll call you back.

- What's wrong?

What did you hear?

No, I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call Mom.

to get a line out, that's all.

to make a full confession.

- Girls, there's no time for the pill...

for withdraw, so...

What about clitoral or vaginal orgasm?

be described as...

the senseless slaughter of innocence
here in Cherry Falls, Virginia.

629
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,323
In the last 3 days, four teenagers have
been killed, a fifth viciously attacked.

630
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:20,028
Certain local officials believe
the killer, still at large...

631
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,331
may be targeting teenage
high school virgins.

632

And now, students here on campus
are rumored have organized a sex party
