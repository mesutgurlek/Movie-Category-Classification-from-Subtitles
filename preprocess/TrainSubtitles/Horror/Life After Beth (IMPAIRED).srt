00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,725
Because she died.

313
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,131
- What?
- She died.

314
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,282
She died, and she's not dead now.

315
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,365
I don't know why. But she's back.
Who cares why?

316
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,885
My daughter's alive, Zach.

317
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,123
Look, I am not stupid, okay?

318
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,328
And I will go to the police.

319
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,562
Tell me what happened.

320
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,763
The doorbell rang
about a half an hour after you left

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,251
the night we played chess,

322
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,446
and it was Beth.

323
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,523
We don't know how, okay?

324
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,443
Okay. Okay, great.

325
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,522
So this is not a grift, right?

326
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,206
So then what is it?
Because you said she was really dead.

327
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,402
And then you said she wasn't dead.
So, what are you saying?

328
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,166
Are you saying that
she just dug herself out of her own grave

329
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,971
- and then walked home?
- Yes.

330
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,605
I don't know.

331
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,881
She... Uh...

332
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,964
Was it the type of snake?

333
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,169
Was it a poison that didn't...
That made her seem dead?

334
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm not a herpetologist, Zach. I
don't know. She remembers nothing.

335
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,886
I mean, what is that?
She's dead, now she's not dead.

336
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,530
- What, she like...
- Crazy things happen.

337
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,761
ZACH: She wasn't really dead?

338
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,366
What is that? What are you saying?
Are you saying that she's a zombie?

339
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,488
- She's my baby girl.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

340
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,045
- It's a miracle.
- It's a miracle.

341
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,724
- She's resurrected.
- She's resurrected.

342
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,325
She could be a zombie!

343
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,965
Stop saying that, please.
It's a resurrection.

344
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,485
- Resurrection!
- She's resurrected!

345
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Okay, and that's better why? Why is
that better? Because that's a nice...

346
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,240
It's from the Old Testament.

347
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,769
Shouldn't we call someone at Harvard
or MIT and have them study her?

348
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,446
- Keep your voice down. She's upstairs.
- BETH: Mom, have you seen my jewelry?

349
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,601
What is going on?

350
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,048
Sweetheart, it's in the Bankers Box
with your sticker collection.

351
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,440
Why is all my stuff in boxes now?

352
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,561
Not a word, Zach.

353
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,766
BETH: Hey, Zach.

354
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,245
Hey, Beth.

355
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,406
- Do you want to go hang out in the attic?
- The attic? No. Why the attic?

356
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,767
- She likes the attic.
- Why? What's with all this why?

357
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,251
- Why? Why?
- Can't we just do something else?

358
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,051
MAURY: Why not enjoy yourself?
GEENIE: Wait, smile!

359
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,043
Oh, I love it!

360
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,963
Go, Zach. Just go.

361
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,010
Go and tell her what you wanted to tell her
when you couldn't.

362
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,361
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- No. Hold on a sec.

363
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,090
You go first. I'm right behind you.

364
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,690
Come here.

365
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,529
Your hair is so warm.

366
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,803
My hair is warm?

367
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,803
What... What does that mean?

368
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,167
Zach, why are you acting so weird?

369
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,045
Like what's going on
with you and Mom and Dad?

370
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,804
Everyone's so weird.

371
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you really not remember
what happened last week?

372
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm sorry. Did I do something
that pissed you off or something?

373
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,330
Just tell me what you remember.

374
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,522
(SIGHS) I don't know. It's a blur. Why?

375
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,161
What about going hiking alone?

376
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,247
(SIGHS) Honestly, I can't really
think straight right now.

380
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,728
What about breaking up with me?

381
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,689
And what about...

382
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,922
Why do you keep saying that?

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,771
I don't want to break up with you, Zach.

384
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,251
I love you.

385
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,680
I would never want to break up with you.
I don't know why you keep saying...

386
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,923
Hey. Beth, sweetie.

387
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,001
Hey, don't cry.

388
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,202
- Why are you being so mean?
- I'm not being mean.

389
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,441
- I just...
- Yes, you are.

390
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,124
No, I...

391
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,804
Look, I've just...

392
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,770
I've just been having
a lot of thoughts about us recently.

393
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,251
- Like bad stuff?
- Um... No. No, no, no, no.

394
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,810
Like really good stuff.

395
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,126
Like, you are my favorite person
in the whole world.

(CHUCKLES)

397
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,490
And I wish we went hiking together more.

398
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,565
And, like, I wish that I went
flamenco dancing with you

399
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,769
every time you asked.

400
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,330
And, um...

401
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,282
And whenever you go away,

402
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,931
you're the only thing I can think of.

403
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,531
I think of you all the time too.
All the time.

404
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,286
I'm so happy that you're back.

And I just... I don't...

406

I really want it to last this time.
(PANTING)

- What?
- Wait, not...

411
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,881
Not with my parents downstairs.

412
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,407
Okay, do you want to go somewhere?
Like, hiking?

413
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,084
- Yeah.
- Okay.

- Wait till nightfall.
- Why?

- Because, baby, it's safer.
- At night?

- Nobody hikes at night.

Yeah, but no, we're not gonna do that.

00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,563
Um, could you change
the radio station, please?

789
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,481
You don't like The Wave?

790
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,683
It's just really stressing me out.

791
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,204
It's smooth jazz. I mean,
it's supposed to have the opposite effect.

792
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,487
- It's supposed to calm you down.
- Well, not with me, man.

793
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,801
So can you just, like,
do something about it?

794
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,803
No one else seems to have a problem.

795
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,281
Zachery Orfman? Sorry.

796
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,600
Yeah?

797
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,490
No, no. I'm sorry.

798
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,844
Um, it's Erica.

799
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,320

00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,321
Erica.

801
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,561
Hey-

802
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,884
Hey, yeah. Erica Wexler.
My mom was just talking about you.

803
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,122
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh.

804
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,160
Hey, should we hug?

805
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,561
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

806
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,641
Ready? (GIGGLING)

807
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,084
So stupid. Okay.

808
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,809
Um, yeah, I just transferred to State,
and my mom and your mom are homies.

809
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,525
- Or my mom and your mom talked anyway.
- Right.

810
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,602
- So sorry about Beth, by the way.
- Mmm.

811
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,244
- Your mom talked to my mom about it.
- I know.

812
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,403
You know,
I used to really want her to come back.

813
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,527
Of course.

814
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,602
But things were complicated
between us, you know.

815
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,729
- It was kind of fucked up.
- Right.

816
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,362
Now, I just kind of wish she'd stay dead.

817
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,564
- I mean, I'm still mourning.
- Uh-huh.

818
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,769
You know, I'm just feeling
a lot better about everything.

819
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,247
Yeah. Well, that's good.

820
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,121
You, uh...

821
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,727
You have really great skin.

822
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,681
- Really?
- Yeah, it's like...

823
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,364
- it's really great.

Thank you.

826
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,290
Can I touch it?

827
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,970
Yeah, okay.

828
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,327
You're so interesting.

829
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,651
- Wow. It's flawless.

Can I ask you something?

Yeah.

836
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,601
Have you noticed anything, like,
really strange lately?

837
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,085
Like what?

838
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,247
Like people that you used to know
suddenly reappearing.

839

No. No, just...

Just forget about it.

845
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,486
Okay.

846
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,531
And I'm sorry about all that Beth stuff.
It's just things were really complicated.

847
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,329
- No.
- We had troubles.

848
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,721
No, I understand.

849
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,211
(SNICKERS) I don't think you do.

850
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,408
No, I do. I do. It's hard to let go.

851
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,567
And she's dead, and you have to move on.

852

That's what I had to do with my nana.

- Yeah. Yeah. I mean, she's dead.
- Right.

Oh, I'll get it.

I got it.

I want to go to flamingo class.

- No, retard, flamingo. Let's go.

No, okay? I ran you over.
And how am I a retard? You said flamingo.

874
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,169
A flamingo is a fucking pink bird, okay?

Stop being such a pussy.
You said you wanted to dance with me.

Your test that you have tomorrow.

- Okay, fine. What do you want to eat?

Zachery?

- She's just a childhood friend.

- From when? I don't know her.
- She's our moms' Jazzercise friend.

Is there another Beth?

- Beth, sweetheart, like...

You are, right?

910
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,721
- Yeah, I am. Who's the other Beth?
- Okay, Erica, you should probably just go.

- Shut up, Zach.
- Do you want me to call the cops?

- I wish it was.

922
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,727
What is that?

923
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,490
You died a week and a half ago,

924
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,530
and then you must have
dug yourself up or something.

925
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,401
No, no, no. No way.
That's impossible, Zach. Zach.

926
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,530
- Listen, you went hiking by yourself.
- No, I didn't.

927
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,046
Yes, and you got bitten by a snake,
and then you died.

928
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,964
How could I be dead, Zach? I'm not dead.

929
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,567
My mom and dad would have told me
if I was dead.

930
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,642
They didn't want to hurt your feelings.

931
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,841
No. No.

932
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,288
How could I be dead if I'm alive?

933
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,930
You can't be both things, Zach.

934
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,486
You can either be dead or alive,
and I'm alive.

935
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,803
Look at me, Zach. Feel me. Look.

936
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,763
Your parents think you were resurrected.

937
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,329
Like Jesus?

938
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,850
Or a zombie.

939

"Or a zombie"? What the fuck, Zach?
What does that mean?

940
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,891
I'm dead.

941
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,166
Yeah.

942
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,850

- No.

Right? Let's just go. I mean,
you always wanted to, and I never did,

1240
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,842
and now's our opportunity,
so let's just do it, right?

1241
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,526
Let's just do it. Let's just do it.

No.

- Promise?
- Everyone else I love is dead.

So, you're all I have right now.

1247
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,131
I have to tell my mom.

1248

Mom! Mom!

Hey, no, it's cool. Let's just go.

1250
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,726
But don't eat me. Don't eat me.
And let's just go.

01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,446
- Hit the deck.
- What?

1256
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,642
- Hit the deck.
- Wait, no, no, no, no. Stop.

1257
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,529
She'll eat brains out
of your cranium, Zach.

No, she' got a stove on her back.
We're going hiking.

What are you talking about?
Move. I got to shoot her in the head. Move.

I'm saving you. Get down.

01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,806
No, no, what about all the burnt bodies
at the house and Mom and Dad?

1264
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,803
It was horrible, Zach.

1265
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,166
I shot them all.

1266
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,651
You shot Mom and Dad?

1267
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,326
No. No, I didn't shoot Mom and Dad.
They're at the Levine'.

- We cleared eagle's nest.

I'm working on Briar Grove now,
but I shot Poppy in the head.

Hey, that's okay. That's okay.

1271
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,889
All I ever wanted to do was shoot people.

1272
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,042
They were going to eat everybody.

1273
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,168
You did the right thing.
They were suffering.

1274
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,050
- Yeah.
- They were suffering.

1275
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,488
But hey, maybe the shooting,

1276
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,530
maybe that's not the best dream, Kyle.

1277
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,127
Maybe you should think of
a different dream, right? A better one.

I'm part of the resistance.

We have AR-15s. We have Stinger missiles.

I swear to God, we're gonna win this war.

Let me take her for a hike.

- BETH: Zach. Zach.

You got to shoot her in the head, though,
all right?

- No.
- She's going to kill us all.

1293

- They eat everybody. They all eat people.
- I know.

- Please, just be quiet and let me...
- She'll fucking eat you.

Let me take her for a hike
and clean my conscience.

Now, she's got to die.

to shoot Grammy and Poppy.

Just let me take her for a hike,

Where's my Desert Eagle? I thought you
were gonna give my Desert Eagle back.

- Why?

- I need my gun.
- I thought you guys had bazookas and shit.

You're such an asshole.
That cost me a lot of money.

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,840
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I used it to murder my girlfriend.

01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,600
I didn't really feel like holding on to it.

1386

Hey, look, we need to
focus on what is next.

1387
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,810
- Exactly.
- All right.

1388
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,645
Everybody, listen up.
I've got some provisions.
