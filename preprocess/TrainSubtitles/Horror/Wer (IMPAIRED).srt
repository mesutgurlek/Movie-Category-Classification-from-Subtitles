first of all,
indiscernible.

I can't tell you
what animal
they're from.

640
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:09,639
Um, also, Henry Porter's
skull was crushed

641
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:13,577
and it takes 1400 PSI
to crush a human skull.

642
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,714

is maximum 200 pounds.
