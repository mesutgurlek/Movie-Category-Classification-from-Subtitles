3

The Archangel Gabriel led
this war of extermination,

5
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:26,531
hoping to rid the world of humans

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,035
and claim dominion over it.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,672
Some higher angels refused to take sides,

8
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:37,976
but the lower angels joined Gabriel.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,944
These lesser spirits lacked bodies,

10
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:45,016
so their first line of
attack was to steal ours.

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,885
But Michael, the greatest
of all archangels,

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,021
chose to fight for man.

15
00:00:56,662 --> 00:01:00,565
Soon, word spread of a
baby Michael had saved,

16
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:03,501
a child who would grow
up to be mankind's savior.

17

This chosen one would be known
by the markings on his body.

18
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:11,409
Finally, Gabriel and his army retreated,

19
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:13,211
and we were left with the realization

20

00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:26,884
- Asshole.
- You're an asshole.

171
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:29,353
We continue to hope...

172
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:33,023
No, to believe that the chosen one,

173
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:35,959
our savior,

174
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:39,430
will someday reveal himself to us.

175
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:47,404
Is there anything else

176
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,441
I can help you with tonight, ma'am?

177
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,615
What happened to your head?

178
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,084
There were eight balls by the truck.

179
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,552
What?

180
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,153
Your father told me not to say anything,

181
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,254
so you have to keep quiet.

182
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,723
Alex, they attacked you.

183
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:09,126
That's what they do. I'm fine.

184
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,664
You need to speak to your dad.

185
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:16,500
I know. I know. I will tonight.

186
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:17,768
I've asked to see him.

187
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,169
I'll tell him about us,

188
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:21,772
and I will get his permission to marry.

189
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:24,742
But you still have to do
the knee and the ring thing.

190
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,612
It just so happens I
have a knee and a ring.

191
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:35,018
What?

192
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:37,521
Alex, he'll say yes. Trust me.

193
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,490
I know him.

194
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:43,627
You're my shield. You took a knife for me.

195
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:47,931
There is no me without you.

196
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,867
We're different, you and I.

197
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,301
Yeah, what?

198
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,836
You think you know him better than I do.

199
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,638
I know the system better than you.

200
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,273
Claire, the truck is ready.

201
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,709
We have enough supplies to
easily make it to Delphi.

202
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:02,112
Claire, they don't have numbers there.

203
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,148
Everyone is equal.

204
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:06,683
We could start a new life,

205
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,552
but it's got to be tomorrow night.

206
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,287
The city will be busy with the Jubilee,

207
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,989
and you could slip out.

208
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:15,025
But it won't come to that. He'll say yes.

209
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,496
But if he doesn't,

210
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:23,133
wherever you go,

211
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:26,370
I follow.

212
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,272
Okay?

213
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:41,552
What's your name, soldier?

214
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,855
Alex Lannon, V-2. The
House Riesen, AA Corp.

215
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,391
Alex Lannon.

216
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,893
It's against our law for you
to be alone with Claire, Alex,

217
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,696
so next time make sure

218
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,200
you're accompanied by another guard.

219
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,269
[Clears throat]

220
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:02,239
- Principate.
- Please, Claire, not you.

221
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,707
I'm still the same William

222
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,275
you played marbles with in this room.

223
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,779
Yes, and always be.

224
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,848
Yeah, maybe you should call me Principate.

225
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,917
It does sound much better
when it comes from you.

226
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,752
You missed services tonight.

227
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:18,755
- I was teaching.
- That's right.

228
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,392
You know, I admire your work
with Vega's less fortunate.

229
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:25,229
You of all people know how important it is

230
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:26,630
that our faith must be nurtured.

231
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:31,768
It must be kept like a promise.

232
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:34,404
It troubles me that so
many of Vega's citizens

233
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,941
have forgotten this simple truth.

234
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,713
Yes.

235
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,816
- Well, let us pray.
- Yes.

236
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,908
Hey, Bix.

237
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,576
What'd you do now?

238
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,912
I got on the wrong side of the peacock.

239
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,513
Riesen stepped in.

240
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,615
You should keep out of
anything to do with the tops.

241
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,150
Yeah, they're no different than us.

242
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,618
They just got a better number.

243
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,393
When's the last time you ate?

244
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:31,562
Here. I ate at the palace.

245
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,002
You want to know a secret?

246
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:42,806
One day, we're gonna live somewhere

247
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,342
where there aren't any numbers,

248
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,811
where we aren't told
what to do, what to eat,

249
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:51,448
where to sleep, and whom to marry.

250
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:54,351
One day, we're gonna be free.

251
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,821
- Promise?
- I promise.

252
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,698
Stay close the next day or so.

253
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,666
Something big's gonna happen,

254
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,004
and whichever way it goes,
you're coming with me.

255
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,650
- Consul.
- General.

256
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,219
Oh, lookee here.

257
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:30,754
I asked the horticulturist

258
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:35,359
to grow these on the agri-towers.

259
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:41,365
I never much cared for berries.

260
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,004
There was an angel attack on a soldier

261
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,873
outside the walls today.

262
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,675
Small group, three angels.

263
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,343
Easily destroyed.

264
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:57,581
Not all of 'em. One survived.

265
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,786
Don't worry. It's been taken care of.

266
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,122
But the archangel is concerned,

267
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,891
and you should be too.

268
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,128
Michael sees evil portent
in everything and everyone.

269
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,130
[Chuckles]

270
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,465
It was an isolated incident, nothing more.

271
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,102
No further sightings
on our long-range scans.

272
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:21,371
We deployed the drone.

273
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:24,941
All clear.

274
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,477
We don't want it getting out.

275
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,613
It could cause panic.

276
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,482
Perhaps that wouldn't be a bad thing.

277
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,385
We've done our jobs too well.

278
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,956
Vega has grown complacent, lazy.

279
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,228
So are you looking forward

280
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,664
to the announcement at the Jubilee?

281
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:51,168
Yes.

282
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,470
Tomorrow, then.

283
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,776
I've been guarding David
Whele for six months.

284
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,312
I finally saw what he
feeds that tiger of his.

285
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,481
It's not a tiger. It's a lion.

286
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,949
Is there a difference?

287
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,517
- Yeah, stripes.
- Whatever.

288
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:11,354
It gets steak for dinner...
dry-aged porterhouse.

289
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,123
When was the last time
you even tasted beef?

290
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:15,325
Cat's one of a kind. We're a dime a dozen.

291
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,127
Speak for yourself.

292

- Hey, boys.
- Both: Noma.

293
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,997
Hey, Ethan, can you weasel your way

294
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,532
into a bottle of Scotch for me tonight?

295
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,267
"Weasel"? Really?

- Nooo... I mean "Weasel"!

You know what goes great with Scotch, Noma?

299
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:34,277
Porterhouse steak, and I can get some.

300
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,846
My gift to you.

Alex, I'll grab one for you too.

302

We're gonna eat like tigers tonight.

303

- Lions.
- Tigers.

304

You've been logging some serious overtime

- at House Riesen.
- I go where I'm told.

306
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,860
So General Riesen's just
decided to tighten security?

307

Why wouldn't he? He's lord of the city.

308
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,498
The man's concerned about
his daughter's safety.

00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,200
Who said anything about his daughter?

No one.

311
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,138
It's just you know how he is about Claire.

312
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,407
Yeah.

He cares a lot about her, doesn't he?

[Mechanical whirring]

315

Don't the Wheles ever sleep?

316
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:27,964
Not if there's money to be made.

317
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,104
It's a delegation from Helena.

318
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,505
It's been a while since you seen anyone

319
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,007
from Helena around in these walls.

320
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,075
Have you ever seen one
of their kids before?

321
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,778
They keep 'em hidden. It's their law.

322
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:47,450
You think that kid's the one?

323
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:48,952
The chosen one's a myth.

324
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,420
That's something they tell children

325
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:53,256
to give them hope.

326
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,225
I don't understand why you'd have me travel

327
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,395
all this way to see
another of your factories.

328
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,464
Well, this isn't one of our factories.

329
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,201
Has Evelyn considered my proposal?

330
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,536
She's not ready to join
in a treaty with you

331
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:09,039
which may pit us against New Delphi.

00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,265
A thoughtful gift.

341
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,969
You obviously learned a lot
about me on your last visit.

342
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:41,471
A passion for weapons is hard to forget.

343
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:42,939
I would prefer you remember me

344
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:46,142
for something more inspiring.

345
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:50,113
- And what would that be?
- Hope.

Gone are the days when
darkness is something to fear.

With this technology,

00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,034
the lights of Vega will
shine as a beacon of hope

349

for 1,000 years.

Along with food and our medicines,

in exchange for the technology

354
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,518
to build our own reactor.

355
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:31,021
There'll be time to negotiate later.

Thank you, David.

And tomorrow night,

361
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,333
you'll be my guests at the yearly Jubilee

362
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,168
in the Grand Arena.

363
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,870
It's a small gesture
the house of Whele makes

364
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,639
to inspire and entertain the city.

365
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,776
- Good night, Arika.
- Good night.

366
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:59,749
I wonder if the brides she
was offering would be spies.

00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:04,387
Possible. We have so much that they don't.

Helena has the only
air force in the cradle,

369

a fleet of aircraft

370
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:12,162
they inherited from hill air force base.

371
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:14,898
The cripple Riesen won't
be an obstacle much longer.

372
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,100
Once we have consolidated our position

373
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,736
and you've been made lord of the city,

374

I see you still like the highest perch.

It's been 15 years.

- I thought you were dead.
- Hmm.

14 1/2, but who's counting?

381

- What does everyone else think?
- The same.

382
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,601
David Whele built you a statue in memoriam.

383
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:28,071
That's creepy.

384
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,273
It's not a good likeness.

385
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:31,641
It looks more like Whele than you.

386
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:36,112
[Chuckling] He hasn't changed.

387
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,948
We all assumed the tattoos were lost to us.

00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,751
No.

389
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:45,321
Have you deciphered any of them?

390
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,123
It isn't just a language to decipher.

391
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,492
It's something else.

392
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:50,860
And from what I could find,

393
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,296
there's no historical equivalent.

394
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,132
Much of the last 14 years was
spent on wild goose chases,

395

looking for the names of
prophets I'd misspelled

396
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:03,339
or tasks I thought I was
commanded to carry out.

397
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:06,743
Unfortunately, the
tattoos are indecipherable.

How is he?

What's he like?

Undisciplined, strong-willed,

War's coming.

People have lived inside these walls

407

so long they've forgotten
they're not prisoners.

408

Father, there's something
that I need to tell...

409

I'm stepping down from ruling Vega.

410
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,909
The city's strong enough

411
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:14,410
to give power back to the people.

412

give up power that easily.

to govern themselves.

in the name of democracy,

00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:33,263
he will turn this city into a dictatorship.

Why now?

We have worked so hard to build this city

00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,587
into what it is.

You can't just give up.

I'm not giving up. I'm moving forward.

So should you.

that Vega desperately needs, Claire.

430
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,569
You'll be important to its survival,

and soon, you'll be
called on to protect it.

So what was it you wished to tell me?

433
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:28,651
Nothing. It was nothing.

434

You're as paranoid as ever.

Why bring him here?

439

441

She dotes on him like an adopted son.

Why?

444
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,914
He's a savant.

00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:36,152
Knows 20 languages, can
play a Bach piano concerto,

446
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:38,087
recites Shakespeare.

447
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:41,858
His knowledge of history is astonishing.

448
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:45,495
He's amazing, teaching us many things,

449
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:47,764
but he's painfully shy

450
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,336
and needs to be treated gently.

451
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,571
Roan wanted to see the great city of Vega,

452
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,207
and Evelyn denies him nothing.

453

She believes he's special,

454
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,347
very special.

I've never seen a child quite like him.

835
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:42,517
My little demonstration
couldn't have worked any better.

836
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:47,122
Now we'll all be ready for
the battle that's coming.

837
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:51,192
So, Alex Lannon,

838
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:53,695
show us your arms.

839
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:13,114
Who's that?

840
00:58:13,149 --> 00:58:15,617
Bixby.

841
00:58:15,651 --> 00:58:17,485
- Designation?
- V-1.

842
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,654
V-1... What... what is she doing here?

843
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:22,157
She's with me.

844
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:25,827
She's under my protection.

845
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:30,632
The protection of House Riesen.

846
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:33,201
Well, she better be able to keep a secret,

847
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:36,971
because no one here is
gonna breathe a word of this

848
00:58:37,006 --> 00:58:39,474
to anyone until we've
figured out what it all means.

849
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:41,176
- Is that understood?
- She'll be quiet.

850
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,745
I promise.

851
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:56,391
I'm fine.

852
00:58:56,425 --> 00:58:58,026
What happened?

853
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,896
The reactor was damaged,
but containment held...

854
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:05,266
for now.

855
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:23,218
The boy was an angel,
another member of the powers.

856
00:59:23,252 --> 00:59:25,420
That's why he was able to
pass through our scanners.

857
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:28,389
Jeep was right.

858
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:30,692
More than one higher
angel has joined Gabriel

859
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:32,927
in his war against us.

860
00:59:38,834 --> 00:59:40,201
Cover up.

861
00:59:40,236 --> 00:59:43,872
Make sure none of the tattoos show.

862
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:47,308
Alex is the baby I saved
all those years ago.

863
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:52,647
He's under my protection.

864
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:06,741
I don't believe this Alex
Lannon is the chosen one

865
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:08,543
or even that the baby was ever real.

866
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:10,878
You saw the tattoos. You saw what happened.

867
01:00:10,913 --> 01:00:15,550
I saw the tattoos
transfer from Jeep to Alex,

868
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:17,418
but I've seen more
extraordinary things happen

869
01:00:17,452 --> 01:00:19,220
since this insanity began.

870
01:00:19,254 --> 01:00:22,423
The tattoos are a
harbinger of what's to come.

871
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:24,659
They will usher in a period of hope.

872
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:28,396
Save it for your flock, William.

873
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,730
Religious theater is one thing.

874
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:31,332
This is politics.

875
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:34,802
My faith is not a theater,
nor is it a delusion.

876
01:00:34,836 --> 01:00:37,438
I don't know what it all means,

877
01:00:37,472 --> 01:00:39,774
but I'm not bowing to anyone,

878
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:42,577
and you aren't either.

879
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:45,980
Alex Lannon is now our greatest threat,

880
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:47,982
and Claire Riesen is in love with him,

881
01:00:48,016 --> 01:00:49,917
which makes your union that much harder.

882
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:53,921
What? You're wrong.

883
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:55,823
Oh, William, come on.

884
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:57,592
I'm sorry, but your feelings for Claire

885
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:59,126
have obviously blinded you

886
01:00:59,161 --> 01:01:01,829
to what was plain to see in that room,

887
01:01:01,863 --> 01:01:03,698
which makes it more imperative than ever

888
01:01:03,732 --> 01:01:07,802
that we take full control of Vega.

889
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:11,172
Evelyn isn't gonna like
us holding Arika in prison.

890
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:12,840
Riesen thought she was innocent.

891
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:15,176
She seemed to be speaking
the truth when she said

892
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,044
she had no idea what Roan was.

893
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,980
I don't care.

894
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:20,514
That city is full of assassins.

895
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:22,116
How do you think Evelyn came to power?

896
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,552
You know Arika is Evelyn's wife, don't you?

897
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:28,222
Don't agree with Riesen about anything

898
01:01:28,257 --> 01:01:32,260
ever again.

899
01:02:07,262 --> 01:02:11,265
You were never alone.

900
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,367
What?

901
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:16,437
When Jeep left, you were never alone.

902
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:19,006
I watched over you.

903
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:22,109
I made sure you joined the army.

904
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:23,377
I formed the Archangel Corps

905
01:02:23,412 --> 01:02:24,612
so that I could stay close to you

906
01:02:24,646 --> 01:02:26,414
without arousing suspicion.

907
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:29,050
Everything was done so
you could train in secret.

908
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:31,619
No one could know who you were.

909
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:35,790
Am I supposed to thank you...

910
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,793
thank Jeep... for all of this?

911
01:02:38,827 --> 01:02:42,463
No, it just is.

912
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:45,433
As your father, Jeep held
the tattoos on his body

913
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,301
for when you were ready.

914
01:02:47,336 --> 01:02:49,570
He knew it might mean his death.

915
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:52,239
I'm not ready.

916
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:55,209
- I'm no savior.
- You are.

917
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:58,079
It's up to you to decipher the tattoos.

918
01:02:58,113 --> 01:03:00,147
I bore them on my body
before they were transferred

919
01:03:00,182 --> 01:03:02,416
onto Jeep's,

920
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,885
but they were always
meant for the chosen one.

921
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,955
First the tattoos were on
you. Then they were on Jeep.

922
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:09,590
Then they're on me.

923
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:11,992
How do I know they're not
meant for someone else?

924
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:18,499
What are they?

925
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,469
Our fate...

926
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:24,572
Our hope...

927
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:29,009
written in a language long since forgotten,

928
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,344
one even I don't know.

929
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:34,515
Can you show them to me?

930
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:41,155
Can you read them?

931
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:46,694
- I can't.
- You must.

932
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:50,498
This is war, and only one side can win.

933
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,433
What's in those tattoos will guide you

934
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:54,435
through what's to come.

935
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:55,703
They will lay out the path

936
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,505
through which mankind can be redeemed

937
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:00,107
and Gabriel and his legions pushed back,

938
01:04:00,142 --> 01:04:03,210
but this path will not be easily traversed.

939
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:05,146
At every step,

940
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:10,017
you must choose which course to take.

941
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:14,555
I believe you are the only one

942
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:19,860
that can end this war.

943
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:23,864
I'm just a man, Michael.

944
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:30,237
How can you be sure?

945
01:04:30,272 --> 01:04:33,874
Nothing is ever certain,

946
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:36,877
but Jeep had hope, Alex.

947
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:40,548
He had faith in you,

948
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:42,416
and so do I.

949
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,187
Try.

950
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:49,557
Can you discern anything?

951
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:08,309
No.

952
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,480
My son,

953
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:48,315
William.

954
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,450
We found him.

955
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:04,800
