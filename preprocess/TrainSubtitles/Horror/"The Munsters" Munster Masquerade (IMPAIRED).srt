1
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:07,317
Uh, Tom?

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:10,845
Before we say good night, wouldn't
you like to come in for a minute?
Mm-hmm!

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:13,051
And meet my folks.
Oh, you always
bring that up.

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,651
Why do I have to
meet your folks?

5
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:18,994
Well, I've been out with you
a lot, and my aunt and uncle
would like to meet you.

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:22,160
And your family.
Mm.
[Inhales Sharply]

7
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,068
They're sort of old-fashioned.
Well, I'll tell you what.

8
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,663
My parents are having that party
that you're coming to next week,

9
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,437
so why don't I get them
to invite your, uh...
[Door Banging]

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,206
Uh... Aah! Aah!
Oh!

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,874
It is your aunt and uncle,
isn't it? Yes.
Are you all right?

12
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,747
It is your aunt and uncle?
Yes, I've lived with them
since I was a baby.

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,687
Oh. Well, come here, baby.
Mm!
[Kissing Sound]

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,568
They're standing real close, Lily.

15
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:59,071
Uh, you know, this is the fourth date
she's had with that young man.

16
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:03,633
Oh, yes. It's amazing how some boys
will overlook a girl's appearance.

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,769
Sh-sh-sh-sh!
[Door Creaks, Closes]

18
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,713
Uh, have a good time, Marilyn?
Uh-huh.
And guess what?

19
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:12,343
Tom's parents are giving
a party next week, and I think
you're both going to be invited.

20
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:17,049
Well! I think it's high time we met
this young man's parents.

21
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:19,558
You can't be too careful these days.

22
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,390
There are a lot of strange people
in this world.

23
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:25,898
Hmm. A party.
Sounds wonderful.

24
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,696
You know, we don't get out at night
as much as we used to.

25
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,130
Well, I'm going up to bed.
[Kissing]

26
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,174
See you in the morning.
Good night, dear.

27
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,335
[Herman]
Good night.

28
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,404
[Gasps]
By the way, Tom says it's going
to be a masquerade party.

29
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:49,584
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to go, for Marilyn's sake.

30
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,056
But I wish it weren't
a masquerade.

31
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,059
I know what you mean.

32
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:58,621
If there's anything that disturbs me, Lily,
it's the idea of grown people like us...

33
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,690
dressing up in costume
and looking ridiculous.

34
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:15,567
Tom, dear, your father and I will be
happy to invite your little girlfriend
to the masquerade party,

35
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,100
but really now...
now, now the whole family.

36
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,272
I mean, just who are
the Munsters?

37
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,442
Mother, they are simply
her aunt and uncle.
[Scoffs]

38
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,113
And if they're anything like Marilyn,
I'm sure they're lovely, charming people.

39
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:31,783
All right, but I do so hope
the society columns...

40
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,918
won't misspell the Munsters'
name on the guest list.

41
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:39,091
I'd hate to have my friends
read that we'd entertained
a couple of Monsters.

42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,566
Oh, Dad. Thanks very much
for putting in a word with Mom.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,438
[Sighs]
If we invite Marilyn's folks,
well...

44
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,500
[Chuckles]
It'll really help me out with her.

45
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,512
You know how it is.

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,413
Son, I haven't known how it is
for years.

47
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,847
If the Dalys are anything
like their handwriting,

48
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,288
they must fall over backwards a lot.

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,093
This party'll give us a chance
to look over the boy's parents.

50
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,790
We wouldn't want Marilyn marrying
into the wrong sort of family.

51
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,962
I've never heard of these Dalys,
and after all, we Munsters
are a very old family.

52
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:20,529
You're right, dear. It's not as if
someone just dug us up yesterday.

53
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,371
Look! They didn't invite me?

54
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,539
Why, I've never been so insulted
since the day I died.

55
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:32,608
Hmm. And besides,
as Marilyn's grandfather,
I should be there!

56
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,745
But, Grandpa, we don't even
know Mr. And Mrs. Daly.

57
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,880
We can't just take you along.

58
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:40,051
If I don't get to go,
I'll use my magic powers.

59
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll turn myself into chopped liver
and show up in the hors d'oeuvres.

60
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,193
Now, Grandpa,
will you calm down?
I won't! I won't!

61
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,634
I won't.! If I don't get to go,
I'll sit here and hold my breath...

62
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,638
till the color comes back
in my cheeks.

63
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,435
You're being a big, spoiled baby.

64
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:57,340
Well, I suppose I could
ask the Dalys to invite him.

65
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,607
It's better than having him
come as chopped liver.
Thank you.

66
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,741
Of course, Mrs. Munster.
Mr. Daly and I will be happy...

67
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,549
to have dear Grandpapa.

68
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,455
Not at all, Mrs. Munster.
You're quite welcome.

69
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:16,587
[Hangs Up Receiver]
Albert, I'm afraid those Munsters
are frightful pushers.

70
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:21,100
Mrs. Munster just wheedled
an invitation for some old grandpapa
they've got kicking around the house.

71
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,658
- You couldn't put her off?
- How could I?

72
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,730
She gave me this sob story.
Said when someone's been living
with you for hundreds of years,

73
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,105
he's just like
one of the family.

74
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,605
Now what on earth could
she have meant by that?

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,910
You must have
misunderstood her, dear.

76
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:40,214
The way things are going, the only
worse thing that could happen would be
if it rained on the night of our party.

77
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,815
[Thunderclap]

78
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,824
Boy, look at the neat lightning.
I sure hope it hits our house.

79
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,297
Eddie, how do you like me
as Priscilla?

80
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:57,769
Corny. Why don't you dress up
as a lady gorilla or something
pretty like that?

81
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,169
I don't think
even that would help me.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,199
If you're going to a masquerade party,
who am I gonna have for a babysitter?

83
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:07,212
Mrs. Morton, the mother
of one of my girlfriends.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,748
She's a very nice lady
who just loves little boys.

85
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,717
Yuck.
[Clanking]

86
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,118
Hey, Dad!

87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,553
Uncle Herman, you make
a simply wonderful King Arthur.

88
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:24,188
Daddy? Are you in there?

89
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:27,028
Hello, "dere."
[Chuckles]

90
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,125
[Chuckles]
What's Aunt Lily coming as?

91
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,363
Uh, she hasn't let me
see her costume.

92
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,838
She's being coy.
[Lily]
Yoo-hoo.

93
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:36,375
- Lily?
- Guess who?

94
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:40,402
- Who?
- Little Bo Peep.

95
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:46,685
[Muffled]
Lily! Uh, uh, you scared me
out of a century's growth.

96
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,416
- How do I look?
- Positively awful.

97
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,153
Thank you. [Chuckles]
It's amazing what
they can do with makeup.

98
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:59,665
Eddie, don't forget
to give Spotty his supper,
and then go on up to bed.

99
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,201
Oh, and don't forget
to wash behind your points.

100
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,202
Okay, if I have to.
Good night, everybody.

101
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,204
Good night.
Good night, Eddie.
Good night, Eddie.

102
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:11,676
[Squawking]
At the sound of the tone,
the time is 8:09.

103
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,908
Nevermore. [Squawks]
Nevermore.
Why don't you pipe down?

104
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,108
[Muffled]
Pipe down!

105
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,777
[Door Banging]
That must be Tom.

106
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,316
[Wind Howling]
Hello, Priscilla.

107
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,758
Hi, John Alden.
Where's your raincoat?

108
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:31,797
Why, it's the most beautiful weather
all over town. It's only raining in this block.

109
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:35,266
Crazy!
Tom, I want you to come in
and meet my aunt and uncle.

110
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,499
Tom, this is my Aunt Lily.
How do you do?

111
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,202
How do you do?
[Chuckles] It's a...
It's a great pleasure.

112
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:50,608
This is, uh...
It's uh, uh, uh, quite a house
you have here.

113
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,950
Why, there's a fine old relic.

114
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,319
- [Clanks]
- Tom, my uncle's in there!

115
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,921
Oh, the masquerade!
I'm... I'm terribly sorry, sir.

116
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,260
L...
Gadzooks, that smarts.

117
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,734
Well, we'll see you all
at the masquerade.

118
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,170
You're going to love my parents.
They're a... They're a gas.

119
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,367
We're certainly looking forward
to meeting your parents, Thomas.

120
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,741
Now, you children have fun.
Oh, don't worry about us.

121
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,838
I'm... I'm terribly sorry, sir.

122
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,543
Oh, uh, quite all right.
Quite all right.

123
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,543
Nice to have
bumped into you.

124
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:45,628
Grandpa?
Hurry it up!
[Banging]

125
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:51,473
[Bottles Rattling]
I'll be there in a minute!
I'm still working on my costume!

126
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,442
Let me see. Jack the Ripper,
Fairy Godmother,

127
00:08:56,516 --> 00:09:00,646
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde...
Mr. Hyde!

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,451
[Laughing]
Mr. Hyde! Ooh, that's quick,
sure-fire,

129
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,221
and got Frederic March
his first Academy Award.

130
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,163
?? [Humming]

131
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,741
?? [Continues Humming]

132
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:30,205
[Bubbling]
Cheers.

133
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,679
[Gulping]

134
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,212
Ahh!
[Sighing]

135
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,593
Well, come on already.
You know, I don't have all day!

136
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,894
[Winces, Screams]

137
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:51,499
[Continues Screaming]

138
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,407
Nothin'!

139
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,080
It's still me.

140
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,486
Oh, boy!

141
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,957
Somebody up there's been
cuttin' this stuff again.

142
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,757
Herman? No matter what
these Dalys are like tonight,

143
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,999
I want you to remember
to be gracious and polite.

144
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,873
Don't worry, dear. In spite
of this silly costume,

145
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,345
I'll be my own
charming, natural self.

Albert, the guests will be
arriving soon. Are you ready?

153
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:57,600
[Albert]Just a second, dear.
And, Albert, for Tom's sake, no matter
what you think of those Munster people,

154
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,867
I don't want you doing or saying
anything to offend them.

155
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,306
You know me better than that, dear.

156
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:16,812
Our little boy, Eddie, is playing
in his room, Mrs. Morton.

157
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,948
I'm sure he won't
give you any trouble.

158
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:22,620
Of course he won't.
I've been a babysitter
for 20 years,

159
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:26,631
and there's nothing in the world
that can... faze me.

160
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:40,270
Why, Grandpa. You really
look like Napoleon.

161
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,873
Oh, it was easy. I just combined
the bottles marked...

162

and Marlon Brando.

163
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,663
Come on, Lily.
We'd better get going.

164
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:03,191
Oh, Mrs. Morton.
This is my husband, Mr. Munster.

165

- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?

Oh, yes, and this is
my father, the Count.

it's stopped raining.

170
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,818
Well, let's try not to let it
spoil our evening!

171

Well, good night, Mrs. Morton.
Make yourself at home.

172
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:40,331
Oh! And if Eddie's pet, Spotty, comes
scratching at the back door,
don't let him in.

173
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,636

Now, Grandpa, I want you
to behave yourself tonight.

00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,849
Don't get silly after two drinks and start
telling those shaggy wolf stories of yours.

We want to make a good impression,
so let's keep the Munster dignity.

Oh, don't worry. You can count
on me to be in a very dignified vein.

Yes, Eddie. What is it?
Request permission
to skip bath tonight. Over.

Skip your bath? Well, why
would you want to do that, Eddie?

00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:03,663
Oh!
You told me you had
a fun family!

298
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,814
[Yawns]

299
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:21,910
Thank you so much, Mrs. Morton.
Oh, your little Eddie was
no trouble at all.

300
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,820
If he didn't have that peculiar habit
of howling like a wolf,

301
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,222
I wouldn't have known
he was in the house!

302
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,260
Good night!
Good night.

303
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,230
What did she mean by
"Eddie's peculiar habit"?

304
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,931
Don't all children howl
when the moon comes up?

305
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,682
Uh, someone's on
the front porch.

306
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:58,587
Oh, it's probably Tom Daly
bringing Marilyn home.

307
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:01,592
I do hope she's not
too serious about him.

308
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,357
I'd hate to have those awful
parents of his in this family.

309
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,565
Well, all the lights are off.
I guess your folks must have
stopped off on the way home.

310
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:13,161
[Owl Hooting]
You, uh, going to
invite me in?

311
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:16,139
I don't think I should.
[Sighs]
Now, look.

312
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,371
I don't know what happened
at the party tonight, but...

313
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,606
great big old John Alden
just can't let Priscilla...

314
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,614
go into that cold, dark house
all by herself.

315
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,049
Thanks anyway, Tom.
The least I can do is to come in and
hold your trembling little hand.

316
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,350
Tom!
What are you so nervous about?

317
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:35,916
Listen. Why don't I go out
in the kitchen and fix some coffee?

318
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:38,224
And, uh, you go on into the living room.

319
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:41,960
Turn on a light. The switch
is right beside the door.

320
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,025
Don't be too long.

321
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,209
Ooh, Tom.
Come right in.

322
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:54,006
Yes. Uh, hello, Thomas.

323
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,846
We just got out of
our masquerade costumes,
and we're relaxing.

324
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,249
You mean, you...

325
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,379
He...

326
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:05,480
She...

327
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,091
Oh, no!
[Whimpering]

328
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,831
Uncle Herman, what happened?
Why is Tom running?

329
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:23,273
I don't know. It-It was extremely rude
of him not even to say good-bye.

330
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:27,779
I'm not surprised.
With a family like that, how
could he have any manners?

331
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:32,613
Well, looks like I scared
another one away.

332
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,982
But for once, I'm kind of glad.

333
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:40,317
I must say, there was something
strange about that boy.

334
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,088
He had the weirdest hairdo
I've ever seen.
