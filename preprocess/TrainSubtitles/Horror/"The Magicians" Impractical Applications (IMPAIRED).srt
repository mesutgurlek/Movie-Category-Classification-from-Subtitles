There's wards all over the room.

333
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,183
Yeah, in this dimension, sure.

334
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:42,185
The one thing I can't figure out
is how to get the hook in.

335
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:46,057
You know, we need someone
inside for that.

336
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,227
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:52,228
You think we can pay
someone off?

No.

Okay, here is the question.

341
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,212
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

342

that a genius could solve
this by dawn?

343
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,782
Well yeah, I mean,
