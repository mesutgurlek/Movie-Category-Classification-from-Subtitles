Wouldn't have anything to do with how good
a basketball player she is, would it?

Or how pretty she is?

- Well...

00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay.

159
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,147
But you know Mom's gonna be real
bummed if you bring him in the house.

160
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,152
Just a sec.

I didn't mean to scare you.

165
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,035
The door was open and I didn't see you
anywhere. I got worried, so I came in.

166
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,600
I was just checking the house out.

167
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,167
I'm okay, I guess being alone had
me more spooked than I realized.

168
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,543
Look, why don't you just come
in and sit down for a second?

169
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,998
I'm okay.

170
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,479
No, come on in. I'll stay with
you until your friends get here.

Oh, yes. It's okay.

- But we're not invited.

- What does that guy see in her, anyway?
- She's beautiful.

213
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,196
I think she has a big mouth.

214
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,038
Hey, it's not how big your mouth is.
It's what's in it that counts.

215
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,867
What I don't see is what
she sees in John Minor.

216
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,330
Maybe it's what we don't see.

it is, remember?

like Charles II.

stuck her finger in the wall socket.

- Who?
- Got caught in the act?

- Yeah. In bed.
- Who?

234
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,558
- Stephanie and Joe.
- What? Are you kidding?

235

Oh my god.

236
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,558
You know what? That must have been the
reason she didn't show in class Friday.

237
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,024
I have her in my third period
class. She wasn't even there.

Well, you know why?

239
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,944
Because she was sore.

240
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,491
They were in bed, and guess
who came up the stairs?

241
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:39,610
- Where were they?
- They were in her house.

242

- Her parents' house?
- Yeah, her parents' house.

Oh my god. What'd they do?

245
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,090
So they just made it.
They didn't get caught.

246
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,257
They just kind of
flew out really fast.

247
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,253
There she goes.

248
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,164
I'm glad I've never been in
that situation, aren't you?

249
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,844
Me too. How embarrassing.

What's the big deal?
I don't get it.

251
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,147
Her parents walked in on them
while they were screwing.

00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,984
I don't think I've been giving Kim
the attention she deserves.

Who would have guessed?

254

But Stephanie didn't show
up to third period, right?

255
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,732
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,704
- And Joe hasn't been in class for...
- God, I bet they're grounded forever.

257
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,750
- Well, they didn't get caught, right?
- I know, but they almost got caught, Diane.

258
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:31,964
- Well, it's their fault.
- You've never been in that position, Diane.

- I think we died and went to heaven.

Don't laugh, I have to concentrate.

Ok, but do me a favor and don't
tear out the centerfold this time.

What do you say we order a pizza?

266
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,869
- No anchovies.
- Mushrooms and olives.

267

I'll go get wood for the fire.

And this is the only
good way to get 'em.

They come out after dark and
they eat up my vegetable garden.

My dad goes on snail hunts too.
He doesn't like to use pesticides.

We'll get the door.

466
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,819
Hey, let's go ask Jana,
before it gets too late.

467
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,163
- What's the damage?
- Six, so far.

468
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,159
Six, even.

469
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,538
Hi, Coach Jana?
This is Kimberley Clark.

470
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,166
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- What's up?

471
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,505
Did you happen to catch
last night's ballgame?

472
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,557
<i>(OVER TELEPHONE)
Sure did, it was a rout.</i>

473
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,377
We're trying to figure out
where the six runs came from.

474
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:23,968
- Well, you've got Cey Homer, obviously.
- Yeah, you've got Cey...

475
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,496
- Here's four.
- Okay, here's one.

476
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,631
Here, I'll take all this,
you pay with the ten, okay?

477
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,104
Pizza!

478
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,397
(SCREAMING)

479
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,494
Kimberly, is this
some kind of a joke?

480
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,371
Hello?

481
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,751
We've got to call
anything, anybody,

482
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,462
Hello?

483
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:04,383
There's been a murder,
we're all alone. Please send help.

484
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,390
- Where's Diane?
- Please send the police.

485
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,312
We are in 3664 of...

486
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,353
Hello? Hello?!

487

The line is dead!
The line is dead.

488
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,031
Well, I don't know, coach. My little
sister did hear some screaming,

489
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,608
but it seems perfectly quiet now.

490
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,282
Do you think you can go
over there and take a look?

491
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:27,530
Well, if you want me to, I guess.
But frankly, I'd rather not.

492
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,625
Oh, never mind, it's a bad idea.
You shouldn't go out of the house.

493
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,373
Maybe I'll go over there by myself.

494
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,307
I bet they're having
a blast over there.

495
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,527
Well, let me know if
there's anything I can do.

496
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,332
Okay?

497
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,385
Okay. Take care. Bye bye.

498
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,304
I'll go. I'd love to go.

499
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,012
You just want them to see you with
your hair up like that. You can't go.

500
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,577
It's out of the question, alright?

501
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:54,566
Courtney! I'll tell mom.

502
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:06,484
I think we should turn off a lot of the
lights, close the curtains that aren't

503
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,864
already closed, and make sure
all the doors are locked.

504
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,875
Ok, it's a beginning. Let's go.

505
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,092
Jeff, we gotta do something
to help the girls.

506
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,552
Okay, what can we do?

507
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,848
Perhaps it we should make a run for
it. Valerie Bates lives next door.

508
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,595
What if we don't make it?

509
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,895
Maybe we should split up.

510
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,976
One of us'll make it, even
if the other one doesn't.

511
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:45,491
Here, this is a good one. I almost took
my finger off chopping carrots yesterday.

512
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,739
I wish I hadn't dropped
out of Cub Scouts.

513
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:53,725
Maybe I would have learned
what to do with it.

514
00:49:54,366 --> 00:50:01,170
Jeff, think this is a good idea? Maybe
if we all just stuck together now...

515
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,007
It's the right thing to do.
I know it.

516
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,305
Are you guys set?

517
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:14,436
You have to go through the garage,
then Mr. Contant's house is right there.

518
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,964
You know he's home?

519
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,349
Yeah. If there's anything
I know, it's that.

520
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,317

what Val told me about the French kissing?

You know, with your tongue
and everything like that?

He started kissing me, and he stuck his
tongue in my mouth. I could have died.

542
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,869
I thought I was gonna
throw up or something.

543
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,668
No, I didn't throw up,
I just felt like it.

544
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:22,646
It was so gross. It was
all slimy and everything.

- Me too.
- And what are we gonna do with him?

Maybe we should cover him up.
