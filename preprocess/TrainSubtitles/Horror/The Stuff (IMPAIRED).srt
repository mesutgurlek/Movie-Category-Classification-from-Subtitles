1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,082
( gurgling )

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,543
What the hell is this?

3
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,757
So smooth! Huh!

4
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,764
That tastes real good!

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,807
Tasty! Sweet!

6
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,977
MAN: Harry, what are you doing
down there? Taking a leak?

7
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:35,189
- No.
- Want us to wait for ya?

8
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:40,277
Uh... No, no. You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up to you later.

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,948
Well, I'll be damned.

10
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,453
Whatever that could be,
it's mighty good.

11
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,871
Mm.

12
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:54,124
Harry, what are you doing,
eating snow?

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,003
You outta your head, buddy?
If this is snow... Try it.

14
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,173
- No. I don't eat snow.
- C'mon! Give it a try.

15
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,509
That's not snow. Try it.

16
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,931
HARRY: Huh?

17
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:10,766
What the hell is it?

18
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,894
You know, if this stuff keeps
bubbling out of the ground,

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,147
there might be enough over here
that we could sell to people.

20
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:19,274
BOY: Ow!

21
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:39,461
Jesus Christ! I'm being eaten alive.

22
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:47,094
( sighs )

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,221
I'm burning hot!

24
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:33,765
( tap running )

25
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:52,117
( squelching )

26
00:02:57,207 --> 00:03:00,250
You scared me! You shouldn’t be
walking around here like this.

27
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:03,378
What are you doing down here? I thought
you were a burglar or something.

28
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,423
- I was hungry.
- You were hungry?

29
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,842
Did you see?

30
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:12,346
- See what?
- It...

31
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:16,225
What's the matter with you, anyway?

32
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,852
It was moving!

33
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,482
Listen to me, young man. Get your butt
back to bed! You understand?

34
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,901
Don't ever pull this on me again.
Move!

35
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,548
( cutlery rattles )

36
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,644
When I was a little girl,
I didn't think there was anything

37
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,813
that I liked better than ice cream.

38
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:05,482
Now I'm a big girl

39
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:10,779
and I've decided there's something
I like better. Much better.

40
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,865
It's called The Stuff.

41
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,784
And believe me,

42
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,913
enough is never enough.

43
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:23,125
( seagulls calling )

44
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,800
A month ago, they acquired the
Chocolate Chip Charlie chain of outlets

45
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:34,803
on the West coast,
with the intention of converting them

46
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,306
and being in business in 60 days.

47
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,850
After that, they'll go national.

48
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:43,687
I wish to hell we knew how they make it.
Yeah, we could copy it.

49
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:47,524
What I meant to say is, uh,
"we could, uh, improve on it".

50
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,403
Apparently, we've had no luck
in analyzing the ingredients

51
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,489
and no luck getting close to anybody
inside the company.

52
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,451
That's why I've asked Moe Rutherford
to come here today.

53
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:02,456
Huh. Look, are you sure we want to get
mixed up with industrial spies?

54
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:05,292
Look, I want results
and he's the best there is.

55
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,378
It's men like Moe Rutherford
that help us stay in business.

56
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:12,549
Yes, I suppose we do have to keep
the world safe for ice cream.

57
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,928
Didn't you used to be
with the Bureau?

58
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,432
At least I didn't get my ass kicked out,
like you did.

59
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,225
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

60
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:25,354
I missed out on Abscam, DeLorean,
all the good times.

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,522
Well, just follow me, hotshot!

62
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,692
Let's see if you're worth your money.

63
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:36,156
Oh! This is some place
you've got here, fellas.

64
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,617
- Hm.
- Gosh! Let me, uh...

65
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,869
That's a sweaty palm.
That's two sweaty palms.

66
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,872
Let me feel you!
Ah! That's another sweaty palm.

67
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:47,751
- Yes, sir. Hello, sweaty palms.
- How do you do?

68
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:52,839
- So, tell me about The Stuff.
- You've been briefed on this problem.

69
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:57,427
Well, I don't understand why you didn't go
to the Food and Drug Administration.

70
00:05:57,553 --> 00:06:01,973
Well, for one reason or another,
right after it was approved,

71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,476
most of those involved resigned.

72
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:07,187
They're either out of the country
or on vacation.

73
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:11,733
Or they have been, uh, paid off!
That is the American way, you know.

74
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:15,028
We've never had so much trouble
getting information out of a company.

75
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:18,865
Don't you worry about that.
Every stone wall has a chink in it.

76
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:22,953
I'll get inside there, penetrate
the company, do some damage.

77
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,414
- But it's going to be expensive.
- Look!

78
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:29,793
We don't want to know how you do it.
Just, uh... do it!

79
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,880
I understand. You guys don't like me.
I heard it on the tap there.

80
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:38,385
Someone said I'd been fired
from the FBI, I'd been blackballed,

81
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,554
that I was obscene.

82
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,765
Someone here said I was obscene.
Who said I was obscene?

83
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,559
How the hell did you know that?

84
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:49,104
Well, while you were
at the Metropolitan Opera last night,

85
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,441
I just happened to be walking
through your hotel room

86
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,776
and I dropped this in your pocket.

87
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:57,279
Huh?

88
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,114
Oh, shit!

89
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,663
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch!

90
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:11,793
- You know, Mr... Uh?
- Rutherford, Moe Rutherford.

91
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,004
- You know why they call me Moe?
- No, why?

92
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,840
'Cause every time people give me money,
I always want mo'.

93
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,718
- Well, you know, Mr Rutherford?
- Yes, sir?

94
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,889
I don't think you're quite as dumb
as you appear to be.

95
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,018
No one is as dumb as I appear to be.

96
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,936
( man chuckles )

97
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:35,066
Now, as I understand it, there is
a certified check with my name on it.

98
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,694
- The gentleman there.
- Ooh, this fella here?

99
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,529
MOE: Oh, yes. Look at that.

100
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,948
Okay, yeah.

101
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,201
That's good enough for starters.

102
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,329
Asshole!

103
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,373
When you talk to the FBI,
would you tell them this for me?

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,583
Ugh!

105
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:55,837
- Broke his jaw.
- What the hell...?

106
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,173
Uh, thanks for the job, gentlemen.

107
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,347
Will you go up and tell your brother
to get down here?

108
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:08,225
Oh, come on! My cereal’s gonna get
soggy. I'll get him when I'm done.

109
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,560
Do as I tell you and do it now!

110
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,605
Maybe his alarm didn't go off.

111
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:17,359
He was up running around in the middle
of the night. No wonder he's exhausted.

112
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,944
( mouths )

113
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,864
Tell him he's not missing school.
I don't care what his excuse is.

114
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:25,742
Hi.

115
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,745
MOM: There he is!

116
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:32,874
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Nothing.

117
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,961
I'll scramble a few over easy for you.

118
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,880
Well, uh, my stomach doesn't really
feel too good.

119
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:43,510
DAD: It sure felt good
at four o’clock this morning!

120
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:47,347
Listen, young man, you've missed
three days of school already.

121
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,183
You're not missing any more.
I don't know what your plans are today,

122
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,227
but you're not about
to miss any more days.

123
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,854
May I have some?
I've finished my cereal.

124
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,567
- Sure. It's good for you.
- No! Don't eat that!

125
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:02,654
There's nothing wrong with it.
I had some last night.

126
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,156
I'm telling you, it isn't good.

127
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:06,700
It's... spoiled.

128
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,537
It doesn't taste spoiled to me.

129
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:17,502
You taste it and tell me
if you think it's spoiled.

130
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:18,837
I don't want any.

131
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:24,467
Look, it moves around all by itself.

132
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:30,557
It moves!
I saw it move in the refrigerator.

133
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,687
Hey, freak!
What are you on, anyway?

134
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:42,611
- Jason! You come back here!
- I hope these stains come out.

135
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:46,740
- What's the matter with that boy?
- Look at that. Not a spot.

136
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,452
Low in calories, good tasting
and it doesn't even spot.

137
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:51,953
And he doesn't like it.

138
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,878
- There's nothing like it around.
- Coupled with benign bacteria?

139
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:03,089
It was probably just a lucky accident
that tasted great.

140
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,925
They seem to reproduce this accident
in great quantities.

141
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,678
Well, that's what I don't understand.

142
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:12,515
I thought some government regulation
requires them to reveal the contents.

143
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:16,811
They're protected by the FDA's
Statute of Identity's rule.

144
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:22,067
The same law protects Coca-Cola’s
secret formula for their syrup.

145
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,403
MOE: Gentlemen,
the little lady entering the room

146
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,448
is doing some
undercover research for me.

147
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:32,327
Because, folks, if we're going to
find out the secret formula of Stuff,

148
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,412
we're going to have to steal it.

149
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,997
( music plays )

150
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:39,626
WOMAN: A little faster paced. Okay?
Let's get movement into this. Step, step!

151
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:44,005
Let's see the bathing suits.
Okay, I want wonderful smiles.

152
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,133
- You got that, is it good?
- MAN: Yes.

153
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,179
Now I want you to feed each other

Pearl and Cathy, get a slightly
tighter shot of them, will you?

157
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:05,527
- MAN: You want me to move in?
- As they come forward, move in.

158
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:07,237
Can you get it?

159
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,119
Go in for a close-up of the faces of
these two 'cause they're real beauties.

160
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,621
Let me see how much you love it!

161
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:19,582
Very good. Thanks, girls.

162
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:23,044
Okay, Christine, by yourself.

163
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,381
Right to the lens. Right here.

164
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,175
I'm going to want you to go in
for a tight close-up

165
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,761
- as she feeds the camera.
- ( whispers )

166
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:35,014
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

167
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,559
- Who the hell are you?
- Everybody break for five minutes.

168
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:41,354
I got to talk to Miss Kendall about
her employment and this job.

169
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,399
You all can break. Coffee?
You can take off with that.

170
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,860
Kill the lights and the sound.
You got that?

171
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,820
- ( music stops )
- What...?

172
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:51,781
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I can't wait in line.

173
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:55,201
I can tell you're not the type
of person to wait in line either.

174
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:58,204
You didn't get where you are now
by waiting in line, did you?

175
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:03,710
- How do you know that story?
- That's the way I got where I am.

176
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:07,756
And here I am with you
and you're awful pretty.

177
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:12,051
- "David...Rutherford?"
- Moe! My friends call me Moe.

178
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,805
They call me Moe 'cause every time they
give me something, I always want mo'!

179
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,853
And I suppose you're wondering
what I want out of you.

180
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,356
Yes, I'd like to know
what this was all about.

181
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:28,693
I want to put you on
our public relations campaign.

182
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,198
I need you not just to raise the image,
you gotta convince the public

183
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:39,078
that Lee-High Petroleum
has the public’s interest at heart.

184
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:42,749
Oh! But... But why me?

185
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,628
Well, I mean,
look what you did for The Stuff!

186
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:50,298
You invented the name,
as I understand it.

187
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:53,760
You created the image and put
the whole sales pitch together.

188
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,471
That's why I don't have a lot
of time for petroleum companies.

189
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:59,390
Well, darling,
I'm not here to hire your agency.

190
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,310
I want to buy your agency
and put you in charge.

191
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,272
Oh! Oh! Um...

192
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:10,151
You want to buy the agency
and make?... That clarifies things.

193
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,737
Will you just sit right there one second.

194
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:15,573
Mitzi? Mitzi.

195
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,995
I want you to check out this guy
thoroughly and get back to me.

196
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,916
I want you to cancel my dinner date
and go get me a dress to wear.

197
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,210
No, problem.
Right away, Miss Kendall.

198
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,965
So, you were saying?

199
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,427
I do like to see a woman
with decision.

200
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,222
Pick your favorite restaurant.

201
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,350
Mm... Where are you staying?

202
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,185
The Sherry-Netherland.

203
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:48,314
Do they have room service
at the Sherry-Netherland?

204
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,900
My limousine's just outside.

205
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:55,864
So is mine.

206
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,199
I'm betting mine's bigger than yours.

207
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,660
( baby crying )

208
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,453
( scanners beeping )

209
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:23,808
- Hey, give me that!
- Give me that back!

210
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,019
What do you think you're doing?

211
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:31,107
Wait! Come back here, kid!

212
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,904
MAN ON PA: <i>Security to aisle seven,
please.</i>

213
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,949
<i>All security personnel
to aisle seven, please.</i>

214
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,923
Oh, shit!

215
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,069
Get off me! Let me go!

216
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,445
Please!

217
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,865
Let go!

218
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:23,159
It's gonna kill you all!

219
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,386
( doorbell )

220
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,054
( growling )

221
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,181
( doorbell )

222
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:50,019
Hello, Mr Vickers.
I called you about an appointment.

223
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,480
Sure, the man
from Consumer Magazine?

224
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:55,733
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, come on in.

225
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,194
( dog growling and snarling )

226
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,579
- Is he friendly?
- He's absolutely harmless.

227
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,957
- How old is he?
- One year.

228
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,545
- One year old? He's awful big.
- I feed him very well.

229
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:18,673
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm off that now.

230
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,427
I'm glad to hear that. The liquor
can kill you. It ought to be outlawed.

231
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:28,850
Mr Vickers, how long have you been
with the Food and Drug Administration?

232
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,812
Almost 19 years.

233
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,523
Yeah, pretty soon
they'll be retiring me.

234
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,400
( growling )

235
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:41,154
And as I understand it,
you were part of the team

236
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,615
that tested and approved
a product called The Stuff.

237
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,868
They didn't have a name for it then.

238
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:50,079
They merchandised the hell out of it,
but we agreed it was a good product.

239
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:53,041
How long was it tested
before you approved it?

240
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,920
You've got to understand
that this is a dessert,

241
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,339
not a prescription medicine.

242
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,510
Not any different from yogurt
or ice cream.

243
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:06,846
What's in The Stuff?
What's it made out of?

244
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,806
How's it made?

245
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,686
- What was your name again?
- Rutherford.

246
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,646
- Rutherford.
- Moe Rutherford.

247
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,565
I hope...

248
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,818
I hope you're not going to tell me
that there's been some trouble,

249
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:24,947
- I mean someone's allergic to it.
- That would upset you, wouldn’t it?

250
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:30,078
Look, all we can do is look for
something common to most people.

251
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:35,374
If there's no reason to forbid the use
of a product, then we have to okay it.

252
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,793
( growling )

253
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,587
- And in this case, it was...
- ( snarling )

254
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,964
In this case it was a pleasure.

255
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:44,759
It was an absolute pleasure
because I love it! I love it!

256
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:47,428
- Oh, you eat The Stuff?
- All the time.

257
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:50,932
- I feed it to Ben. Ben has some.
- You feed the dog The Stuff?

258
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:53,184
Absolutely. Ben eats it all the time.
Right, Ben?

259
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,311
( growling )

260
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:59,398
Well, I... I suppose if both of you eat it,
it's got to be all right.

261
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,985
- Yes. It's really good.
- ( snarling, barking )

262
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:06,322
But I understand that
you're not a chemist, Mr Vickers.

263
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:10,243
No. I'm an administrator, but, uh...

264
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:13,079
but I can give you the names
of some of the people on the panel.

265
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,415
Well, I tried that already
and for some strange reason,

266
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,085
they're all out of the country
or deceased.

267
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,588
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

268
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:27,176
Say, where did you test The Stuff?

269
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,095
- Stader.
- Stader Virginia?

270
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,265
I still have some preliminary
worksheets in my office.

271
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,767
Maybe you should look at them.
Nothing confidential.

272
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:38,980
I'd appreciate that. I'd Xerox them
and send them right back to you.

273
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:41,607
You're lucky.
I never throw anything away.

274
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,234
( dog panting )

275
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,237
- ( barking )
- Ben! Good boy!

276
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:54,787
Why is your master afraid of you?
Huh?

277
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,418
You hungry? Want something to eat?

278
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:03,004
Come on. Let's go in the kitchen.

279
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:18,895
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have offered
you a cup of coffee or a soft drink.

280
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:21,522
I felt like a glass of water,
but I'm not thirsty any more.

281
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,859
These are some of my old documents,
just a lot of old names.

282
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:27,945
Well, thanks very much.
I appreciate it.

283
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:29,947
It's my pleasure. ( chuckles )

284
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:38,372
I'll get copies of this
as soon as possible.

285
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:41,167
- Well, take your time.
- Goodbye, Ben!

286
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:49,759
- ( Ben whines )
- You've been a good boy, Ben.

287
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:53,721
I've got a treat for you.
In fact, I have a treat for both of us.

288
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,057
We deserve it, don't we?

307
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,147
( honks horn )

308
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:28,482
MAN: Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

309
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:31,652
- What can I do for you?
- Fill her up.

310
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:34,864
Fill her up. Yeah.

311
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:38,868
There's nice clean restrooms
out there, if you want to.

312
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:42,621
I must have taken the wrong turn-off
here somewhere.

313
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:45,916
- This is Stader, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

314
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:49,003
I know somebody here.
I can't remember his name. Uh...

315
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:51,047
- Melville.
- ( bell rings )

316
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,382
You mean old Harold? He moved out.

317
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:57,845
- They're just about all moving out of here.
- Ain't nobody here but you?

318
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:01,265
Don't you want to wash your hands?
I put in a new towel.

319
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,517
- ( bell ringing )
- Could you stop that at $20?

320
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:06,228
Okay, yeah. Sure.

321
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,196
Do you recognize that car down there?

322
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:18,032
No.

323
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,162
Ain't that a novelty?
Two strangers in one day.

324
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:06,705
Hi-yah! Hah!

325
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,583
Ow!

326
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,299
You're Chocolate Chip Charlie!

327
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:21,345
Well, I sure as hell ain't
the Kentucky Colonel! Get off of me.

328
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:25,850
I'm sorry. What are you doing in a town
like this, big executive like you?

329
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,394
I'm trying to find out somethin'
about the sons-of-bitches

330
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,897
who stole my company and threw me
out on my beautiful black ass!

331
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:35,067
- You work for them, huh?
- I'm investigating them, same as you.

332
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:37,111
Those shits!

333
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:40,906
Somehow, man, they got to my asshole
brother and my two idiot nephews

334
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:43,826
and everybody else
I trusted with stock.

335
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:48,289
And they brainwashed them, man!
Next thing, they was in and I was out!

336
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,583
Yeah, Okay, Charlie.
Did you find anything out?

337
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,879
What you gonna find out in a town
that's been dried up and blown away?

338
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,088
( dog barking )

339
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,968
Must be a side-effect of eating too
much dessert. An urge to migrate.

340
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,762
There's a widespread urge of that
around here.

341
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,475
I might have gone along with the idea.
They didn't have to steal my company.

342
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:10,019
These guys don't like having partners,
Charlie.

343
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:14,023
I figured if they was a Mafia front,
I'd get back at 'em, expose 'em.

344
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,818
- And then get my company back.
- But how did you find this place?

345
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:19,987
Those damned relatives of mine again.

346
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:23,782
After they voted me off the board of
directors, you know what they did?

347
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:28,579
They hid from me, man, disappeared
because they knew I'd kill 'em!

348
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:31,749
Then they left this place here
as a forwarding address.

349
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,751
- A forwarding address?
- Yeah.

350
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,545
Well, that's a Post Office.

351
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,176
Where does that mail get rerouted to?

352
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:46,555
Oh, to these people,
the addresses they left behind.

353
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:51,185
But I don't see that's
any i-interest, uh, to you.

354
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,357
Midland, Georgia. Midland, Georgia.
Midland, Georgia.

355
00:24:56,483 --> 00:25:00,027
A whole lot of folks have relocated
to Midland, Georgia, man.

356
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:05,115
It's dinner time.
Why don't you close up shop?

357
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:07,493
We’ll take you out for a bite to eat.

358
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,204
I've...eaten already.

359
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,540
Midland, Georgia, huh?

360
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,543
They all went there
and you stayed here?

361
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,212
Go away.

362
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:21,632
- Leave us alone.
- What do you mean "us", man?

363
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:25,052
We're talkin' to you. Ain't nobody
else in this place, is there?

364
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:29,932
All we see is you and the gas
station man and now he's gone.

365
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,309
We're not...bothering anybody.

366
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:33,644
( croaking )

367
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:37,189
Excuse me.

368
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,066
I'll be right back.

369
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:48,909
( door creaking )

370
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,788
What do you think, Charlie?

371
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,082
The man is not in proper operating order.

372
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,458
Absolutely!

373
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:58,168
I'd like to take him some place
and get him X-rayed.

374
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,045
What if he doesn't want to come
along?

375
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,131
- We snatch him.
- Now, Charlie.

376
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:04,758
I run a high-tech operation.
I don't go in for things like that.

377
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:08,470
I got a few lo-tech solutions.
We hit that sucker over the head...

378
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:11,307
Ooh, well... We could do that.

379
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,767
- We throw him in the trunk of the car.
- We could do that, too.

380
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:16,437
- And we take off.
- But whose car?

381
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:18,355
( groaning )

382
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:28,115
I'll be right there, baby.

383
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:31,994
Hello?

384
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:40,919
- Okay, lethal hands. Kill the door.
- Okay. Watch out for splinters.

385
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,632
I always knock first.

386
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:49,637
Huh!

387
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:04,360
- ( whispers ) What happened to him?
- Nobody's mouth can open that wide!

388
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,240
You are not thinking about
going after it?

389
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,451
I hope you got a gun on you, Charlie.

390
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:16,163
- My hands are lethal weapons!
- I hope you're right.

391
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,209
Because if that thing
tries to kill me, you kill me first.

392
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:31,428
- Wait, wait, wait. We are not alone.
- ( footsteps running )

393
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:35,182
The only thing Chocolate Chip Charlie
knows better than fighting is running.

394
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,101
Pick a direction.

395
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,317
- Get in that...
- ( yelling )

396
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:48,487
MOE: Get in that boat, Charlie.

397
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,864
I just knocked a hole in that sucker!

398
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:53,951
( gurgling )

399
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,412
Get in the boat!

400
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,896
- Honey, you got a coffee for me?
- Sure do.

401
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:25,149
You're a pretty thing! Look at her.
Isn't she pretty?

402
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,275
Mm-hm.

403
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:30,279
Every time I feel like eating,
I think of that guy with the mouth.

404
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:33,073
- It turns me right off my stomach.
- ( Charlie chuckles )

405
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:36,869
Hey, waitress. You got any good
chocolate chip cookies?

406
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,204
Sure do. Home-made.

407
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,331
You got any of The Stuff?

408
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,709
( country music plays on jukebox )

409
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:48,464
Wish I did. I can't get it.
It's on order, though.

410
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,508
Charles?

411
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:57,931
You and I are gonna have to split up.

412
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:02,227
You sure you no longer need
my iron fists?

413
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,524
I want you to go to Washington DC

414
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,445
and see Special Agent
Frank Herbert...

415
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:14,698
( whispers ) from the FBI.

416
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:21,079
He won't believe me.
Maybe he'll believe you.

417
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:24,792
- Uh... Frank Herbert, the FBI?
- Ssh!

418
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:26,752
I got ya.

419
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,254
( Charlie laughs )

420
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,715
There you go, honey. Thanks a lot.

421
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:37,095
Hey, fellas. Any of you going down
to Route 105 could give a guy a lift?

422
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:40,140
- Yeah. I'm just about done.
- Ooh, good. Thanks very much.

423
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,893
- Is your friend coming with you?
- No. He's got other business.

424
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,396
Charlie! Remember where you are.

425
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:20,430
Here he comes.

426
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,730
( tires screech )

427
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,734
( horns honking )

428
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:41,535
- You're Mr Rutherford.
- That's right.

429
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:43,704
I expected you about now.

430
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,001
I gather Stader wasn't a rather
congenial community for you.

431
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:52,087
- News travels fast.
- Hm.

432
00:30:53,673 --> 00:30:58,635
You're not one of 'em, are you, huh?
You're not on The Stuff, are you?

433
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:02,931
Oh, no, no. My doctor would never
allow me to take any of that.

434
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:05,309
But you distribute it.
You know what it is.

435
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:07,728
You put it in the stores
and the supermarkets.

436
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:09,438
I know what it is?
Don't be ridiculous.

437
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:11,523
I don't know what it is.
Does anybody know what it is?

438
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,609
I only made it what it was.

439
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:17,613
Those who would take
a critical mass of it, it's everything.

440
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:23,076
Those people who discovered it and
brought it to me were already addicted.

441
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:25,662
They were compelled
to find somebody like me

442
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:27,623
who could market it
in the tens of millions.

443
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:31,627
That was long before you
test-marketed the product in Stader.

444
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:33,170
Where did it all start?

445
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:37,799
Everyone in Stader went to a little
town called Midland, Georgia.

446
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:42,304
Now, your conglomerate owns
a mining company in Midland?

447
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:46,266
Let go of it, Mr Rutherford.
You can't stop it.

448
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:48,435
I can shut you down.

449
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:52,230
( laughing ) I don't know.
I really don't know.

450
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,942
I don't think anybody
would pay much attention

451
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,277
to a disreputable character like you.

452
00:31:57,403 --> 00:32:00,030
You're a rogue, you're a crook

453
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:04,952
in the pay of ice-cream companies
trying to screw the competition.

454
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,496
I could always kill you.

455
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,456
( laughs nervously )

456
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:12,584
Or you could come to work for me.

457
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,920
Let me show you something.

458
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:20,717
I had a little envelope here for you
in anticipation of your arrival.

459
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:26,640
- What do you think of that?
- $1,000 bills?

460
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:29,601
- About 25 of them?
- Hey! Right on!

461
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:34,856
Also a first draft of a contract
to supervise our security here.

462
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:37,442
You do know who I am, don't you?

463
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:38,735
Mm.

464
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,238
I don't have to eat The Stuff though,
do I?

465
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,407
I would like to leave that
to the Stuffies.

466
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:46,118
- It's not your fault.
- It is my fault.

467
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,996
I invented the whole campaign
that made it so popular.

468
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:51,164
Are you the only person
ever done anything wrong?

469
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,292
No, I know I'm not the only person
that ever did anything wrong.

470
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,629
Do you want to trade sins,
Miss Kendall?

471
00:32:57,755 --> 00:33:01,299
All right. I'll trade a sin with you.

472
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:04,344
I am not an oil millionaire.

473
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,471
- I'm an industrial saboteur.
- ( she laughs )

474
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:13,603
Why don't you just call the FBI
and tell them what you know?

475
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,897
I haven't got any credibility
with the Bureau

476
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:18,483
or any other Federal agency,
for that matter.

477
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:20,819
I was one of them.
They kicked me out.

478
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:25,949
- Um... What about Ralph Nader?
- Oh, I got a bad name with him, too.

479
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:29,745
A couple of motorcar companies
hired me to discredit consumer groups.

480
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,247
- I did too good a job.
- But if you've got proof...

481
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,416
- we've got to go to somebody...
- I don't have any proof.

482
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:35,959
I got no proof at all.

483
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:39,463
That's why I gotta go to the factory
with you tonight to get proof.

484
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,798
- Tonight?
- David, you seen this?

485
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:45,343
Oh, hi, doc. This is Nicole.

486
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,929
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

487
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:50,515
Some kid on Long Island sure as hell
doesn't like The Stuff for breakfast.

488
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:52,768
Went bonkers in a local supermarket.

489
00:33:55,938 --> 00:33:57,731
I've got to see that kid.

490
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,693
- Honey, I'll see you at the airport tonight.
- What?

491
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:04,780
Doc, would you see Miss Kendall
home, please?

492
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:06,156

00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,933
<i>...missing persons reported...</i>

502
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,935
Hey! I'm up here, you know!

503
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:39,189
<i>A phenomenon not confined to individuals.
Families have been reported missing.</i>

( bleeps and blasts from video game )

508
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,827
Hey, look. He's here.

509
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:36,872
So, what you looking at?

510
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:39,791
- Is that dinner?
- We're dieting.

511
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:42,919
I've lost five pounds this week
and I've never felt better.

512
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:45,088
Why are you talking
like you're on a commercial?

513
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:47,215
Here, Jason, take some.

514
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,178
You know what I said about that.
That was the truth.

515
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:56,474
And you know that there is
something alive in there.

516
00:35:56,601 --> 00:36:01,021
Jason, there's something alive in yogurt.
It's called benign bacteria.

517
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:03,648
- Yes!
- There's something alive in bread.

518
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,317
It's yeast. That's a living organism.

519
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:08,403
We eat plenty of things
that are still alive that are good for us.

520
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,823
I know that, but...that was moving.

521
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:16,161
All micro-organisms move, Jason, if
you could see them with the naked eye.

522
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,456
Under a microscope you see them move.
What's the difference?

523
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:24,544
They're good for us, Jason.
They kill the bad things inside us.

524
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,671
( bleeping from video game )

525
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:30,759
He's just a baby.
Always afraid of everything.

526
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,554
Get him!

527
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:44,940
Help!

528
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:57,202
- What am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to eat it.

529
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:01,039
Eat as much of it as you can
and you keep eating it.

530
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:06,628
We thought you loved this house, Jason.
That's why we bought it.

531
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:09,339
What about your new room!
We got you everything you asked for.

532
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,675
Are we asking you for so much?

533
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,015
You always get everything you want.

534
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:34,781
Stay in your room
until you finish that.

535
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:37,826
Then you can become
a part of the family again.

536
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:22,787
( squelching )

537
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,919
( flushes )

538
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,798
Hey!

539
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,427
What are you doing down here?
Dad said stay upstairs and eat it.

540
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:22,263
He was right.

541
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,933
I tried some of it and he was right.

542
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:30,980
Hey! That's mine!

543
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,732
Sure it is.

544
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:35,485
Hey, Dad. Jason loves it.

545
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:38,780
Jason always did have
a hell of an appetite.

546
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:42,450
- Why don't you have some more?
- Still working on this one.

547
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:44,744
Then I'll have some more.

548
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,622
Books off the table. Glasses off.

549
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:51,501
As a matter of fact, I'll take
a whole bunch of it up to my room.

550
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,588
Just in case
I get a little bit hungry.

551
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:00,593
BROTHER: I never get tired any more.

552
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,180
We don't get tired,
now that we've been eating properly.

553
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:31,416
- Get in the car!
- Who are you?

554
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,668
I saw it move, too. Get in the back.

555
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:38,006
BROTHER: Hey! Who are you?

556
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,091
Stop him!

557
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:47,015
MOE: Boy, they sure do have
a lot of energy.

558
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,229
( coughing )

559
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,984
Ex... Excuse me, sir.

560
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:00,862
I kinda just threw up in your car.

561
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:02,614
I know!

562
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,159
I'm sorry! I mean...

563
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:09,037
- That's all right.
- I just ate shaving cream.

564
00:41:09,163 --> 00:41:13,374
Everybody has to eat shaving cream
once in a while.

565
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:23,760
You feelin' a little better?
Would you open the window now?

566
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:27,597
- Open the window?
- Mm-hm.

567
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,274
MOE: All aboard for Georgia!

568
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:44,072
Wait a minute, David. What?...

569
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:47,575
- Are we all set to go?
- Well, we got this ex-con here.

570
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:55,333
Wow! I've never been
in a plane like this before.

571
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:02,423
MOE: Midland, Georgia.

572
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,093
Fletcher's conglomerate
that distributes The Stuff

573
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:07,387
owns mines and quarries
all around here.

574
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:09,180
There's got to be a connection.

575
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,818
Thank you. Very nice flight.

576
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:24,153
- Are you Miss Butterman?
- Yes, very nice to meet you.

577
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,655
Very nice to meet you, too.

578
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:28,408
When he wakes up,
keep him entertained.

579
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:30,410
If we're not back in three hours,

580
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:33,204
take him to Savannah Airport
and wait for instructions.

581
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:38,293
NICOLE: I hope you don't mind
my bringing my secretary, Roger.

582
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:41,588
- He's so creative.
- I'm Elliot Howard.

583
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:44,757
- I'm the chief of public relations.
- Very nice to meet you.

584
00:42:44,883 --> 00:42:48,303
- This is my partner.
- My name is Michael Grimsby.

585
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:51,055
Grimsby and Howard,
Howard and Grimsby. Yeah.

586
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:55,643
Didn't you gentlemen live in
the town of Stader, one time or other?

587
00:42:57,938 --> 00:43:00,607
- Uh... How do you know that?
- Well...

588
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:03,651
That's where the tests were done
by the Food and Drug Administration?

589
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:05,528
That's how we heard about it.

590
00:43:05,654 --> 00:43:08,656
I had my own business,
but I gave it up to join the firm.

591
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:13,703
We were both convinced
that this is the product of tomorrow.

592
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:22,712
Look at those tall stacks!
All full of The Stuff, huh?

593
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,345
- Call me Cassidy.
- What?

594
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:16,057
- Cassidy, I'm the company foreman.
- Nice to meet you.

595
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:19,852
Thank you for the wonderful job you
people do down on Madison Avenue.

596
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:24,357
Oh, it's very easy to sell a product
when people like it so much.

597
00:44:24,483 --> 00:44:26,442
Yes, we like it ourselves.

598
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:30,113
It's tough to keep the workmen
from eating up all the profits!

599
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,489
I bet.

600
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,950
( birds chirping )

601
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:41,499
( water running )

602
00:44:45,546 --> 00:44:47,296
( mysterious bird calls echo )

603
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:54,053
You shouldn’t be shooting
pictures here.

604
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,723
- ( camera clicks )
- Smile.

605
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:59,726
NICOLE: This is very,
very interesting, Mr Cassidy,

606
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:01,394
but I think that
what we'd like to see

607
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,481
is the room where they put
all the ingredients together,

608
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:07,525
where they mix The Stuff.

609
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:10,820
Oh, now, that's a state secret.
We're very tight on that subject.

610
00:45:10,946 --> 00:45:15,658
Mr Cassidy, I intend to bring

Do you mean they don't process it
or manufacture it at all?

688
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:45,709
No, they siphon it right off
and into the trucks.

689
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:50,214
The only way I can prove that
is to steal one of those trucks.

You can't do that. This place is

We have a chance.

766
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:40,726
JASON: A castle?
MOE: I know the man who lives here.

767
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:43,729
I know everything about him,
only he doesn't know me.

768
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,569
Wait here.

769
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:09,963
( violent yelling )

770
01:02:18,598 --> 01:02:20,515
I am reporting to Colonel Spears.

771
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:30,692
Who are you?

772
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:33,653
Well, I once worked for a man
named Hoover.

773
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:38,408
And he once ordered me to put
some taps on an apartment

774
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:42,954
that you rented for, uh...
a 17-year-old black chick.

775
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:46,625
And I wish I'd brought along
the tapes

776
01:02:46,751 --> 01:02:49,503
because I could prove to you
I really am who I am.

777
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:53,673
- You're not with the Bureau any more?
- Oh, no! They canned me.

778
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,718
Just before they mailed those tapes
to your wife.

779
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:02,557
I could toss you off this tower.

780
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:04,684
You'd land right about there.

781
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,646
You're a trespasser.

782
01:03:07,772 --> 01:03:11,733
Oh, Colonel, I only told you about
the tapes so I could get to see you.

783
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:13,527
'Cause I need you.

784
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:17,155
You know that the whole country
needs you?

785
01:03:19,283 --> 01:03:22,536
You wouldn’t be tryin' to deceive me
or entrap me?

786
01:03:22,662 --> 01:03:25,330
Do...do you remember
you were worried

787
01:03:25,456 --> 01:03:28,500
about the commies
putting fluoride in our water system?

788
01:03:28,626 --> 01:03:29,918
Mm-hm.

789
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:33,630
You know, there's a thing goin' on
now that's a lot worse?

790
01:03:34,674 --> 01:03:37,759
Americans are being poisoned faster
than you can imagine.

791
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,594
- Poisoned?
- Yeah.

792
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,474
The FBI are always worried about
commies getting deep-cover agents

793
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,811
and putting them into high positions
in American industry.

794
01:03:47,937 --> 01:03:50,814
Then they'd acquire a corporation,
right?

795
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,860
And then they'd establish themselves
and they'd work on us

796
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:57,612
( whispering ) ...from within,
right inside it.

797
01:03:57,738 --> 01:04:00,699
Inside, get us from the inside,
get it?

798
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:04,286
Sounds like one of my radio speeches
a year ago last Thanksgiving.

799
01:04:04,412 --> 01:04:06,413
You were a deep prophet.

800
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:08,748
A product is being sold now

801
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:12,377
and is being consumed
by tens of millions of people,

802
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:15,672
and it contains
a mind-affecting drug.

803
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,509
And you and I both know
who they are.

804
01:04:20,428 --> 01:04:22,929
- And they're doin' it?
- Oh, yeah.

805
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:25,432
Their headquarters
are less than 100 miles from here.

806
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,103
Sons-of-bitches!
They're flaunting it at me!

807
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:32,981
I guess they forgot
about Colonel Spears, huh?

808
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,066
They didn't know you were around,

809
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:37,277
that you could bring them
to their knees!

810
01:04:37,403 --> 01:04:38,904
Hmm!

811
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:44,826
Come with me. We're gonna have
a nice tall cool drink.

812
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:48,246
You in the army or something?

813
01:04:48,372 --> 01:04:50,624
We are your only army, son.

814
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:55,587
So, this is the young lady
who's gonna go with us?

815
01:04:55,713 --> 01:04:59,633
She's familiar with the plant.
You can ride up with me.

816
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:02,344
Well, that's gonna really be
an honor, Colonel.

817
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:06,598
I know, and after this mission,
you can reward me in a suitable fashion.

818
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:09,935
Oh, uh, Colonel.
I think you're movin' in on my lady.

819
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:14,022
I wouldn’t worry about that, son.
You'll probably be a casualty.

820
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:25,492
You know that missing truck?

821
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:28,119
I see it coming down the road
right now.

822
01:05:29,705 --> 01:05:31,957
No, I can't see who's at the wheel.

823
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:42,008
Hey!

824
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:45,553
I found this here truck
down by Highway 12, abandoned.

825
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:50,392
Kind of figured you might, uh...

826
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:54,187
give us some kind of cash reward
for bringing it back.

827
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:57,941
Yeah, okay. Move it on in.

828
01:06:02,905 --> 01:06:05,031
( gate rattles )

829
01:06:07,368 --> 01:06:09,786
Well, c'mon! Move it on in!

830
01:06:12,123 --> 01:06:14,916
- Not till we talk about money.
- It's all settled.

831
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,209
( gunshot )

832
01:06:16,335 --> 01:06:18,461
( rapid gunfire )

833
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:23,425
I kinda like the sight of blood,
but this is disgusting.

834
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:25,135
( yelling )

835
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,151
MAN ON PA: <i>Attention! The main gate
has been penetrated.</i>

836
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:44,487
<i>Outsiders are entering the factory.
Do not resist them.</i>

837
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:46,489
<i>Follow the agreed upon
course of action.</i>

838
01:06:46,615 --> 01:06:48,950
<i>Repeat. Follow the agreed
upon course of action.</i>

839
01:06:54,623 --> 01:06:57,625
Where the hell are the yellow-bellied
sons-of-bitches Stuffies?

840
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:00,962
Get back! C'mon!
Check out behind that truck.

841
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:03,798
Get some men up on that tower. Now!

842
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,681
C'mon, you Stuffies sons-of-bitches!

843
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,434
That's right, Colonel. You tell 'em!

844
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:28,073
Let's go have a look inside, guys.

845
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:30,575
( rapid gunfire )

846
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:41,169
- No show of resistance.
- They may not be armed, sir.

847
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:45,673
Doesn't matter if they are. There is
no match for the American boy.

848
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,927
- We have never lost a war.
- What about 'Nam, sir?

849
01:07:49,637 --> 01:07:52,555
We lost that war at home, sonny.

850
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:54,390
They may have run out on us.

851
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,982
( gasps )
Don't look. Don't look.

852
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:06,945
The yellow sons-of-bitches.

853
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:10,406
They took their own lives.
Commie bastards! You cheated me.

854
01:08:12,743 --> 01:08:14,786
Still warm.
This must have just happened.

855
01:08:15,663 --> 01:08:18,748
Must have issued suicide capsules,
ready for us.

856
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:22,669
Standard KGB procedure.
FBI, you ever seen anything like this?

857
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:26,422
( gasps )

858
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:29,134
No white stuff
in this son-of-a-bitch!

859
01:08:29,593 --> 01:08:33,263
Whatever was inside of them
must have just taken off.

860
01:08:35,474 --> 01:08:38,935
- I want to see this.
- No, we have to go outside.

861
01:08:39,061 --> 01:08:42,230
You have to protect the young lady,
trooper.

862
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:49,070
- How do you get out of here?
- Down to the end, take a left.

863
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:55,076
Come over here, boy.
C'mon, move!

864
01:08:55,619 --> 01:08:58,413
With these guns
you've got in your hands,

865
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:00,665
you think you can shoot anything
you don't like?

866
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:05,795
What if what you don't like is inside you?
How you gonna shoot it?

867
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:08,006
( rumbling )

868
01:09:11,302 --> 01:09:12,635
( screams ) No!

869
01:09:25,524 --> 01:09:28,526
Go faster, Nicole.
Hurry up! Move!

870
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:37,202
We've got to make it
through that door. Come on!

871
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:39,037
Oh, yeah!

872
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,123
NICOLE: One...two...three!

873
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:54,052
Look out! Don't get any of it on you!

874
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:57,180
( screaming )

875
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:15,573
All right, we're gonna leave it
where it is.

876
01:10:16,867 --> 01:10:19,202
I own two radio stations in Atlanta.

877
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:22,664
We're gonna fly down there.
We're gonna broadcast a warning.

878
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,291
We're gonna tell the public
what this Stuff can do.

879
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:35,843
COLONEL: 75, 80, 90% of the people
in this world don't like me.

880
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:39,389
- No?
- I give my body, I give my soul.

881
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:42,642
- And they still don't like you?
- They never have liked me.

882
01:10:42,768 --> 01:10:46,813
When I was a boy, I was the toughest
and smartest and best-looking.

883
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:50,692
They want someone lily-livered
and weak and spineless, like they are.

884
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,986
Ain't that right, FBI?

885
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:57,448
So, anyway, is there something
you can do to change my image?

886
01:10:57,574 --> 01:11:00,827
Colonel, I think she can change
your image like that!

887
01:11:00,953 --> 01:11:04,163
You sold them that white shit.
Why can't you sell 'em me?

888
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:16,968
Come on, gorgeous! I should'a taken
you into combat years ago.

889
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,389
( yelling )

890
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:31,899
What is this, World War III?

891
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:36,029
Just get us to 4th and Main
and no more of your liberal remarks.

892
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:17,236
( women screaming )

893
01:12:17,988 --> 01:12:20,573
MAN: Where are they going
with machine guns?

894
01:12:27,915 --> 01:12:29,665
( yelling )

895
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:33,753
Pay the drivers. Issue a 10% tip.

896
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:36,005
- Get a cash receipt.
- Yes, sir!

897
01:12:36,131 --> 01:12:38,216
Proceed to the lobby.
We will reassemble. Hup!

898
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:40,718
Report!

899
01:12:40,844 --> 01:12:43,262
Sir, our affiliates in Florida
and Memphis

900
01:12:43,389 --> 01:12:45,348
have agreed to carry your remarks
in full.

901
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:47,850
Buy clearances on as many stations
as you can.

902
01:12:47,976 --> 01:12:50,895
Try the network affiliates.
Make it worth their while.

903
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:54,649
- What's on our station now?
- Local sports then a tribute to Elvis.

904
01:12:54,775 --> 01:12:57,110
♪ Can't get enough of The Stuff! ♪♪

905
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:59,987
<i>The stuff. The taste that makes
you hungry for more!</i>

906
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:02,740
- Get that shit off my station!
- ( turns radio off )

907
01:13:04,576 --> 01:13:06,327
Get it off!

908
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:12,708
- You can't write this.
- What?

909
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:16,254
Well, you say that you're partly
responsible for the whole thing

910
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,215
and that you promoted
reckless advertising.

911
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:22,885
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- You want to wreck your career?

912
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,222
You can be idealistic,
but don't be stupid. This is...

913
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,433
I thought I'd let you support me
for a while.

914
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:32,687
- <i>Support you?</i>
- <i>Yeah. You do make money.</i>

915
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:35,481
Yeah, well,
when I blackmail people, I do.

916
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:39,694
Get these Stormtroopers out of my way
before I lay them all to waste!

917
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:43,656
Get out the way! Don't you know
who I am? I am Chocolate Chip Charlie.

918
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:47,201
My hands are registered with the Midland
Georgia police as lethal weapons

919
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,495
and I eat them guns for breakfast.

920
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:55,918
"The American people are being
poisoned by a popular dessert product

921
01:13:56,044 --> 01:13:58,045
"known as The Stuff.

922
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:01,215
"If you have this food in your possession,
do not eat it." Good.

923
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:04,260
"If you are a merchant and you..."
What is that?

924
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:06,471
That's "do not sell it".

925
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:09,098
Get! Get! Just get out of it!

926
01:14:09,224 --> 01:14:13,436
- He's all right. Charlie, how are you?
- How are you doing, David, my man?

927
01:14:13,562 --> 01:14:14,854
Hey, David, man.

928
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,524
They tried to get to me,
but I punched a lot of holes in them.

929
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:21,569
- How did you find us?
- You got time for a long story?

930
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,447
No, I don't, but I never did hear
from the FBI.

931
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:26,824
You are not gonna do a program

932
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,452
without the participation
of Chocolate Chip Charlie.

933
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:33,289
They stole my company, man.
I got a right to be heard.

934
01:14:33,415 --> 01:14:35,416
That's a great idea.

935
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:39,212
Course, they might figure I'm lying,
trying to knock the competition.

936
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:42,423
Often it's easier to believe lies
than the truth.

937
01:14:42,549 --> 01:14:44,842
Charlie, you are really welcome.

938
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:49,805
- I'm Nicole, queen of the ex liars.
- Eight minutes to air. Who is this?

939
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:52,850
- He's on the broadcast.
- Not on my station.

940
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:55,978
Hey, are you really
Chocolate Chip Charlie?

941
01:14:56,104 --> 01:14:58,606
It's nice to see that somebody
still likes me.

942
01:14:58,732 --> 01:15:02,985
I am just plain old Charlie W Hobbs,
who wants to make a statement.

943
01:15:03,111 --> 01:15:05,613
You are not going to keep me off
those microphones,

944
01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:08,407
even with your stooges
in the funny costumes.

945
01:15:08,534 --> 01:15:12,245
Do you realize how many people love
Charlie as much as Jason does?

946
01:15:12,371 --> 01:15:15,331
- 20 million!
- 20 million people.

947
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:17,208
In advertising money,
how much is that?

948
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:19,835
An extra 20,000 a minute, probably.

949
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:23,422
If you wanna throw away
all that money, go right ahead.

950
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,259
I will permit this colored man
to speak.

951
01:15:27,302 --> 01:15:30,596
But speak one word
of the Commie Party line

952
01:15:30,722 --> 01:15:34,600
or one word in code,
and I will blow his head off.

953
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:39,522
Look, can I go somewhere
to get my thoughts organized?

954
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:42,358
We'll get the plot outlined
and be back in a minute.

955
01:15:42,484 --> 01:15:46,279
We don't have a lot of time,
so are you prepared to say on air

956
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:49,115
that you've seen people
devoured by The Stuff?

957
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:54,287
Hell, yes! And I've seen what's left of
them when The Stuff comes back out.

958
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,625
You want to run that by me again?

959
01:15:59,751 --> 01:16:03,379
I've seen what's left when it gets
through with them and comes back out.

960
01:16:03,505 --> 01:16:06,549
It sort of vacates the premises
when it's through.

961
01:16:06,675 --> 01:16:08,509
How?

962
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:13,889
I'm sorry. What am I asking you for?
How would you know?

963
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:16,225
Oh, I know!

964
01:16:17,269 --> 01:16:18,978
Charlie.

965
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:22,773
Charlie, are you all right?

966
01:16:22,899 --> 01:16:25,443
Charlie, are you all right?
What's the matter?

967
01:16:26,069 --> 01:16:27,903
( groaning )

968
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:33,075
Charlie! Let go!

969
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:38,581
( screams )

970
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:40,750
Oh, God! Charlie!

971
01:16:49,968 --> 01:16:51,636
( screams )

972
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:56,724
Jason, don't move.
Don't let it touch you.

973
01:16:58,393 --> 01:17:00,061
( both scream )

974
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,272
NICOLE: Moe!

975
01:17:03,398 --> 01:17:04,982
Help!

976
01:17:07,027 --> 01:17:08,569
( inaudible )

977
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:10,655
- Moe, help us!
- Help!

978
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,368
NICOLE: Oh, God! It's growing!

979
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,037
( screams )

980
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:24,669
Hit the juice!

981
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:29,006
Hit it!

982
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:36,138
Get the girl out! Get the kid out!

983
01:17:36,264 --> 01:17:38,724
I'm coming. Come on, Jason.

984
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:46,982
( Nicole groaning ) Oh, no!

985
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:49,527
It was slithering!

986
01:17:56,576 --> 01:17:58,703
30 seconds, sir. Should we delay?

987
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:00,705
No. We'll never get
the clearances again.

988
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:03,332
( beeping )

989
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:06,419
ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Atlanta, Georgia,</i>

990
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,713
<i>this is a broadcast of warning.</i>

991
01:18:08,839 --> 01:18:12,508
<i>This is not fiction.
This is not a dramatization.</i>

992
01:18:15,053 --> 01:18:17,012
My fellow Americans.

993
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:19,348
This is Colonel Malcolm
Grommett Spears.

994
01:18:19,474 --> 01:18:22,435
I have never misled you
and I will never mislead you.

995
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:25,271
Tonight, America is in grave danger.

996
01:18:25,397 --> 01:18:29,316
We are under alien attack by
a substance which represents itself

997
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:31,861
as a popular dessert
known as The Stuff.

998
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,363
If The Stuff is in your house,
do not eat it.

999
01:18:34,489 --> 01:18:36,574
Repeat, I mark you, do not eat it!

1000
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,702
If you are a merchant and have it
on your shelves, do not sell it!

1001
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:42,997
If you have a distributorship
and you distribute this material,

1002
01:18:43,123 --> 01:18:45,082
close your doors,
make no more sales.

1003
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:48,335
If a member of your family
is dependent on this product,

1004
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,171
get them to a hospital.

1005
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:53,758
If you have this product in your home,
cook it. I repeat, cook it.

1006
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:01,891
And the people did believe.

1007
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:05,227
In the weeks that followed, The Stuff
was withdrawn from distribution.

1008
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:08,230
The nation mobilized to collect it
and destroy it.

1009
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:13,611
REPORTER: <i>Violent action has been
taken against the stores and franchises</i>

1010
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:15,446
<i>that carried The Stuff.</i>

1011
01:19:15,572 --> 01:19:18,115
<i>Local authorities cautioned
the public to remain calm.</i>

1012
01:19:18,241 --> 01:19:19,825
<i>Upon reports
that the product was toxic,</i>

1013
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:22,870
<i>public health officials visited
the quarry in Midland, Georgia,</i>

1014
01:19:22,996 --> 01:19:25,372
<i>only to find it buried
in a mass of rubble...</i>

1015
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,562
<i>...more at 11.</i>

1016
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:51,857
Although the casualties were
in the thousands

1017
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:54,944
American industry has worked
with full government support

1018
01:19:55,904 --> 01:19:57,905
<i>to save millions of other lives</i>

1019
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:01,534
<i>and to compensate the injured
for their tragic losses.</i>

1020
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:05,287
<i>I am reading these words
off a teleprompter</i>

1021
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:07,373
because I...

1022
01:20:08,124 --> 01:20:10,209
I simply didn't know what to say.

1023
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:12,962
The fact of the matter is that...

1024
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:16,006
I'm selling you an apology.

1025
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:19,844
I'm sorry.

1026
01:20:24,182 --> 01:20:26,141
She is a pretty thing, isn't she?

1027
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:27,935
Well!

1028
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:31,856
Well, are you here to throw my money
back in my face?

1029
01:20:31,982 --> 01:20:34,525
- Uh, no. I spent it.
- Hm.

1030
01:20:35,277 --> 01:20:38,612
You think by dynamiting one quarry
you could shut us down for ever?

1031
01:20:38,738 --> 01:20:41,782
You realize that stuff seeps up
through the Earth any place?

1032
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:44,743
Well, I guess we'll just find
those places.

1033
01:20:45,829 --> 01:20:49,498
I'm afraid I'm not alone tonight,
Moe.

1034
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:53,127
I suppose you've spent my money
as well, eh?

1035
01:20:53,795 --> 01:20:57,965
- You two are in business together!
- It was inevitable, wasn't it?

1036
01:20:58,091 --> 01:21:01,844
The Stuff is finished, of course,
but look here.

1037
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:05,264
Look at the new campaign
for The Taste.

1038
01:21:08,268 --> 01:21:12,688
Only 12% of The Stuff in it. Just enough
to make the public crave for more.

1039
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:15,733
And the balance is natural
dairy products.

1040
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:20,154
There won't be enough of The Stuff
in it to get a grip on anybody's mind.

1041
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,532
- How do you know?
- Well, we tested it.

1042
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:25,659
We tested it
in a small Illinois town.

1043
01:21:25,785 --> 01:21:27,703
If you tested it, you can taste it.

1044
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:29,872
Oh! You go too far.

1045
01:21:29,998 --> 01:21:34,084
I didn't come alone here, either.
I brought along a couple of friends.

1046
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,920
Jason!

1047
01:21:39,382 --> 01:21:42,760
- This is no place for a kid, Moe.
- Oh, he ain't a kid any more.

1048
01:21:42,886 --> 01:21:45,554
The Stuff took away his parents
and took away his brother.

1049
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:48,891
- You brought another friend?
- Yup.

1050
01:21:49,017 --> 01:21:50,225
Him.

1051
01:21:50,769 --> 01:21:55,105
Now, put that away. You wouldn’t
use it in front of the boy.

1052
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:58,108
Like he said,
I've been through a lot.

1053
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:02,196
Well, you sit right down.
Go on, have yourself a seat.

1054
01:22:02,322 --> 01:22:04,573
We're gonna have a little dinner.

1055
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:06,325
Jason?

1056
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:09,870
- Serve the gentlemen.
- A pleasure.

1057
01:22:12,248 --> 01:22:14,333
You recognize that, don't you?

1058
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:19,713
No. Wait...

1059
01:22:19,839 --> 01:22:23,384
Make a big old mountain of it
right in front of them.

1060
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:27,388
- Here.
- Yes, pass it right on down.

1061
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:30,891
- Dig in yourself.
- Look! I had nothing to do with it.

1062
01:22:33,228 --> 01:22:35,479
You see this hole here?

1063
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:37,815
It's getting bigger and bigger,
isn't it?

1064
01:22:38,858 --> 01:22:42,069
So you'd better eat that
or you're gonna eat this.

1065
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,738
- Eat it!
- How much of it?

1066
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,783
You eat as much of it as I want you
to eat, until I tell you to stop.

1067
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,743
Till it's comin' outta your eyeballs.

1068
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:57,126
- Eat it.
- You, too, partner.

1069
01:22:59,129 --> 01:23:00,587
Eat it!

1070
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:04,383
Mm. Mmm.

1071
01:23:09,055 --> 01:23:11,682
Are you eatin' it?
Or is it eatin' you?

1072
01:23:26,072 --> 01:23:28,032
( sirens approaching )

1073
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:31,618
JASON: Here they come.
Right on schedule.

1074
01:23:35,749 --> 01:23:37,458
I guess we did it, Moe.

1075
01:26:27,879 --> 01:26:29,379
Enough is never enough.
