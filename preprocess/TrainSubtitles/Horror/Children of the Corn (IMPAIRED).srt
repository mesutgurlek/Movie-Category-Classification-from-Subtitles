it was about three years ago.

00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,214
I was the only kid
in church that day.

10
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,675
The others were with lsaac
out in the cornfield.

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,303
I didn't get to go
'cause Dad didn't like lsaac.

12
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,014
He was pretty smart, my dad.

13
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,269
After church, we went to Hansen's...
just like always.

00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,354
Sarah was home sick with Mom.

15
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,690
She'd come down
with the fever real sudden.

- Man: Morning, Dave.

- Morning, Pop. How are you?
- How are the wife and Sarah?

18
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,866
Dad was worried, so he went
to call Mom first thing.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,744
Sarah's been better.
I'm going to call your mom, okay?

- Okay, Joby, you want your usual?
- Yeah, strawberry shake.

23
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,881
That's when I saw
Malachai and the others.

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,550
I guess their meeting
with Isaac was over.

- I'm worried, Dave.

- Uh-huh.

You're making something
out of nothing.

Right. To me it's something;
to you it's nothing.

I'm just worried about
this internship, okay?

he was running away.

take it anymore.

to be afraid of.

I said I'd come back for you.
I promise.

- Can't we go with you, please?
- No!

00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,954
I'd never make it with you two.

123
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,124
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be all right!

them pictures you've been drawin'.

She can't help it.

That won't matter
to lsaac and Malachai.

127
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,633
They'll take it as a sign.

128
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,135
Anyways, you know crayons
and drawings are forbidden...

that record player.

But we like it.
Isaac doesn't let us do anything!

131
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,851
Well, you just better
mind him till I get back

132
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,979
or else you know what happens.

133

You're not going
through the corn, are ya?

134
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,655
- I can't go no other way.
- But what about...

135
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,281
I said it'll be all right!

136
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,575
Unless you tell
anybody I'm gone.

Okay, you know what
that means now?

If you tell, you're gonna
burn in the lake of fire for all eternity!

141
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,798
Make sure nobody's lookin'.

142
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,139
Okay! Go!

something that begins
with the letter C.

- Corn.
- Right.

148

So now we know...

the backroads are even less interesting
than the highway.

150
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,788
Maybe they've discovered music.

in His house.

Amen! Peanut butter
and white bread!

There's no room
for the college graduate!

159
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,276
No room for people
who watch public television!

160
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,446
- No room for commitment!
- Amen!

161
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,864
( Chuckles )

162
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,951
Come on.

163
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,418
( Panting )

164
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,139
( crow squawks )

165
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,019
( faint giggling )

166
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,403
( gasps )

167
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,470
Ah!
( grunting, gagging )

168
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,643
Vicky: Here it is.

169
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,397
I wonder how it got in here.

170
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,400
Not me.

171
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,408
Okay now, it looks like...

172
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,785
this one goes goes
to Grand Island,

173
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,704
and this one cuts
up to the highway.

174
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,127
Where's this Gatlin
we've been seeing signs for?

175
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,963
It's not on here.

176
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,424
What do you mean?
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

177
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,675
Burt, look out!

178
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,638
- ( Tires screech )
- ( Screams )

179
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,353
( groans )

180
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,022
Hang on.

181
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,275
Let me check.
Let me check.

182
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,487
- Where, right there?
- Yeah.

183
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,865
- ( Gasps )
- It's just a bump.

184
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
Just try and relax.

185
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
That was an animal, right?

186
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
I got to go back there, okay?

187
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,543
Just stay here
and try and rest.

188
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,267
Come on, buddy.

189
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh lord.

190
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,775
( Crow squawks )

191
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
ls... he...

192
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
Oh, yeah.

193
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,370
( Gasping )

194
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,040
- Oh my God!
- Easy, easy, easy. Come on.

195
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,251
Easy.

196
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,837
Take it easy.
Don't look at him.

197
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,469
Okay, now, listen to me.

198
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,805
There's something
very wrong here.

199
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,433
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there,

200
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,678
Understand? Keep all the doors
locked until I get back.

201
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,396
- Why? Where are you going?
- I'll tell you when I get back.

202
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,773
- Just do what I say.
- Okay.

203
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,600
( Heavy breathing )

204
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,781
( indistinct chuckling )

205
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,675
( soft grinding )

206
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,363
Burt?

207
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,312
Burt?!

208
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,084
I'm so sorry.

209
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,544
( Screams )

210
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,756
- Vicky, come on.
- ( Panting ) Burt!

211
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,716
- Easy, calm down.
- I kneeled...

212
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,135
I kneeled down next to him.
He said...

213
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,180
it's okay.
Take it easy.

214
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,265
Just take it easy.
Relax.

215
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,185
You're okay.
You understand?

216
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,521
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

217
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,399
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

218
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,987
You're okay.

219
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,070
( Music playing )

220
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,406
Joby: Me and Sarah were playing
in our old house.

221
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,157
We played there lots.

222
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,368
Malachai said it was forbidden.

223
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,287
But I think that was 'cause
nobody ever asked him to play.

224
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,124
When I grow up,

225
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm gonna have all
the money in the world.

226
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,254
Me too.

227
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,756
- You can't.
- Why not?

228
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,260
- Because I'm gonna have it.
- I'll get it first.

229
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,720
- Will not.
- Will too!

230
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,179
- Will not!
- Will too!

231
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,597
Oh yeah, how?

232
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,858
It's easy.

233
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,777
Seven.

234
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:47,073
One, two, three, four, five,

235
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,117
six...
( coughs )

236
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,952
seven.

237
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,454
All right, see?

238
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,707
$200.

239
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,834
Uh-uh, Joby.

240
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,717
How much?

241
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,137
13 thousand hundred dollars.

242
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,639
13 thousand hundred dollars?

243
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,726
Uh, okay, $2,000.

244
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
Mm-hmm.
I thought so.

245
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,357
100, 200...

246
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,234
I got a great idea.

247
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,863
Let's pretend
this guy is lsaac.

248
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,782
And we're gonna
put him in jail.

249
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,160
What if he gets
a get-out-of-jail-free card?

250
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,162
Simple as that.

251
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,486
- What cards?
- ( Both laughing )

252
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,311
Do you think it might have been
some kind of accident,

253
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,063
like farm equipment
or something?

254
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,564
Not a wound like that.

255
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,401
His throat was cut
deliberately.

256
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,865
He was already dead
when he stumbled out into the road.

257
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,536
Whoever killed him...
do you think he saw us?

258
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,081
I mean, I felt like
we were being watched.

259
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,749
It's possible.

260
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,544
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

261
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,463
When I went to get the suitcase,
it was still fresh.

262
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,385
- Then he could have been out there.
- I couldn't leave it there.

263
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,470
I mean, what if it
holds some sort of clue?

264
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,560
- Let's open it.
- No.

265
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,355
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or someplace.

266
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,610
Joby: Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

267
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,863
I figured he finally
talked the little squirt

268
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,990
into punishing us
for being unbelievers.

269
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,076
Up till then, we'd been forgiven
'cause we weren't in the corn

270
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,996
the day He Who Walks Behind the Rows
made himself known.

271
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,248
That bothered Malachai.

272
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,833
He had a lot of problems.

273
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,084
( Footsteps )

274
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,386
I found these two
in one of the old homes.

275
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,598
They had a game and music.

276
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,727
And this.

277
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,857
They come already.

278
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,325
You have the gift of sight.

279
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,244
This is a blessing, my child.

280
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,413
Malachai: I've seen this car
upon the road.

281
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
Go to the old man.

282
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,709
Make sure
he tells them nothing.

283
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,169
What about these two?

284
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,761
Take them back where they were.

285
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,554
But they had a game and music.

286
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,641
- They're forbidden!
- Question me not, Malachai.

287
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,143
I act according to His will.

288
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,065
( Sarah grunts )

289
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,080
Ugh, you'd think
we were on the damn moon.

290
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,539
We haven't even seen a truck.

291
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,083
We'll be in Gatlin soon.

292
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,588
You think he lived there?

293
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,132
We may never know that.

294
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,511
I really think
we should open it.

295
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,848
Okay.

296
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Let's see if I
can get some news.

297
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,987
Atone!

298
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,615
Preacher: Only by the blood
of the Lamb are we saved!

299
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm getting tired of that crap!

300
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,786
( Clasp releases )

301
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,251
- Ugh!
- What is it?

302
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,550
- Jesus Christ.
- Not in my book.

303
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,554
Looks like some kind
of primitive folk art.

304
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,431
I think it's repulsive.

305
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,814
Man:
Sarge, how about that number six?

306
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,365
Oh damn it.
Better make it an eight.

307
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,079
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

308
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:51,002
( Grunts )

309
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
Oh, good boy, Sarge,

310
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,633
We'll have that transmission
fixed in no time!

311
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,345
Then we'll get on the radiator.

312
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,724
Damn, this road
is becoming a regular highway.

313
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,186
Ain't this about the third car
in a month, huh?

314
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,105
We know what to do,
don't we, boy?

315
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,368
You'd better put
that suitcase away.

316
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,873
Be right back.

317
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,756
- Hi, we've had ourselves...
- I ain't got no gas.

318
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,759
- No, I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel if you all need it.

319
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,923
Burt: No, you don't understand.
I need to use your...

320
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
You don't buy no gas,
you can't use no restroom.

321
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,724
( Crow squawks )

322
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,476
Your telephone.
I need to use your phone.

323
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,353
Telephone?!
I ain't got no telephone.

324
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,896
- ( Dog barks )
- Sarge.

325
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,316
( Sarge continues barking )

326
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,901
Sarge, you be still now.

327
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,535
Mister,

328
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,329
what you want to do
is to go to Hemingford.

329
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,833
- About 19 miles down that right fork there.
- What about Gatlin?

330
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,585
Gatlin? There ain't
nothin' in Gatlin.

331
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,463
( Sarge barking )

332
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,507
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in Gatlin?

333
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
Folks in Gatlin's got religion.

334
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,013
They don't cotton to outsiders and
probably won't have a phone either.

335
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,600
Sarge! Mister, I'd like to stay here
and shoot the breeze with you

336
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,854
about politics and stuff,
but I got a transmission to fix.

337
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,898
You get on that right fork there
and you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

338
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,650
Right.

339
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,193
- ( Barks )
- Sarge.

340
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,487
I said at ease!

341
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,448
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- ( Barks )

342
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,994
- ( whimpers )
- Sarge!

343
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,082
Either that man's senile or he's been
out in the sun too long.

344
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,418
Sarge!

345
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,171
- Come back here!
- ( Barking )

346
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,173
Sarge, get back here!

347
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,175
I don't have time for this.

348
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,930
You hear me?
Come back here.

349
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,642
Come on.
That's an order!

350
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,811
( Metal thuds )

351
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,108
( loud thunder )

352
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,448
Who is it?
Ls that you?

353
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,326
What do you want?

354
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,915
( Crow squawks )

355
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,676
( clanging )

356
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,428
What are you doing in there?

357
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,783
There really isn't that much stuff in here.
Just kid's stuff...

358
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,954
clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

359
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,874
- I don't get it, camping stuff?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,629
Oh great.
This must be our day.

361
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,674
Didn't the last sign
we saw say Gatlin was three miles

362
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,968
- and point that way?
- That's what I thought.

363
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,303
Did I miss a turn?

364
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,180
No, we've been going straight.

365
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,309
Somebody's been messing
with these signs then.

366
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,272
- Hemingford's gotta be straight ahead.
- Yeah.

367
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,573
Must have been the wind.

368
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,854
Those latches
ain't worth a damn.

369
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,523
Blow over in a bad fart.

370
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,030
( Children's laughter )

371
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,325
( thunder )

372
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,038
I never told them nothing.

373
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,459
I swear it.
I kept our bargain just like always.

374
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,798
Burt:
Jesus Christ.

375
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,551
Gatlin! What do they have a monopoly
on road signs?

376
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,762
What about Hemingford?

377
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,432
For people who don't like visitors,
they sure do advertise enough.

378
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,479
Over there.

379
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,444
Of course, it's the wind.

380
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,243
( Grunting )

381
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,395
Why did you have
to go after them, Sarge?

382
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,991
Why you bastards.

383
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,327
You can't do this to me.

384
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,874
( Grunts )

385
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,940
I know you're in here.

386
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,614
Come on.

387
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,076
Come on!

388
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,174
I can smell you,
you stinkin' little skunks.

389
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,593
Come on!

390
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,436
You murdering little devils.

391
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,398
Come on!

392
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,671
( Thump )

393
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,007
Vicky:
What was that?

394
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,301
( Exhales )
That probably was just my golf bag.

395
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,137
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean am I sure?

396
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,998
God, this isn't even a road.

397
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,603
- We're never gonna get out of here.
- We will too, now stop it!

398
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,005
Sorry.

399
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,344
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

400
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,943
We're right back
where we started from.

401
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,696
We never should have
listened to that old fool.

402
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,950
Hemingford's 19 miles.
Gatlin's only three.

403
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,714
I don't care how much religion
they've got,

404
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,907
we're going there right now.

405
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,124
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

406
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,270
Behold.

407
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,148
A dream did come to me in
the night.

408
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,902
And the Lord did show
all this to me.

409
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,779
Crowd: Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

410
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,574
A time of tribulation has come.

411
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,577
A test is at hand.

412
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,874
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

413
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,836
In the dream,
the Lord did come to me

414
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,630
And He was a shape.

415
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,424
It was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

416
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,844
And I did fall
on my knees in terror,

417
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,471
and hide my eyes,

418
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,182
lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead!

419
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,352
And He told me all
that has since happened.

420
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,229
- He said,
- ( Baby crying )

421
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,608
"Joseph has taken his things
and fled this happy place,"

422
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,445
because the worship
of Me is no more upon him.

423
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,533
"So take you his life
and spill his blood."

424
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,869
- He did?
- Yeah.

425
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,206
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

426
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,668
- "Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so it was done!

427
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,796
Joseph the betrayer
was cast out.

428
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,216
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say,

429
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,511
"I will send
outlanders amongst you,"

430
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,138
a man and a woman.

431
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,225
And these outlanders
will be unbelievers

432
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,685
"and profaners
of the holy."

433
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,396
I wish Isaac never came here.

434
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,814
But he's always been here,

435
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,733
just like He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

436
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,152
"And the man shall
sorely test you."

437
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,363
For he has great power,

438
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,157
"Even greater than
that of the blue man!"

439
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,995
Crowd: The blue man.
Yes, the blue man.

440
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,748
And just as the blue man
was offered up unto Him,

441
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,002
so shall be the unbelievers.

442
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,045
Malachai:
Make sacrifice unto Him.

443
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,298
Bring Him the blood
of the outlanders.

444
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,718
( All chanting )
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

445
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,512
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

446
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,432
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

447
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,101
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

448
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,770
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

449
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,522
( Whispers )
Let's get out of here.

450
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,276
( Chanting continues )

451
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,941
it looks like a swinging place.

452
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,417
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

453
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,670
- I hope not.
- ( Scoffs )

454
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,132
God, I don't see anybody.

455
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,681
Town hall.

456
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,309
Grocery store.

457
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,938
Hansen's Cafe.
Let's see if they've got a phone, huh?

458
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,525
- Unless a ghost is using it.
- ( Chuckles )

459
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,930
What is it with this corn?

460
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,224
You got me.

461
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,812
Phew.

462
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,831
( Hangs up phone ) It's dead.

463
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,583
Just like everything else
around here.

464
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,251
- ( Squeals )
- Yuck!

465
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,546
- A rat.
- Yeah.

466
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,382
Just your ordinary
coffee shop rat.

467
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,343
Now can we get
out of here, please?

468
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,513
Hey.

469
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,016
Hey hey, wait a minute.
Come back here!

470
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,727
Come on, Vicky.
Hurry up, I don't want to lose them.

471
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,529
( Tires screeching )

472
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,910
So what are you
gonna do if you catch them?

473
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,754
Ask them where
we could find help, what else?

474
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,248
- They cut off that way.
- Okay.

475
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
Burt:
Damn it. Where'd they go?

476
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,132
Look, we're already in the car.

477
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,135
Why don't we go on to Hemingford?
It'll take us 20 minutes.

478
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,637
We just found people.

479
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,640
Yeah, three kids who tried
to steal our car.

480
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,186
There's something
very strange about this town.

481
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,565
( Sighs ) Maybe you're right.

482
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
Burt: We'd be better off
in a bigger town anyway.

483
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,573
- The size of Seattle.
- Vicky: Yeah.

484
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,876
- Over there.
- What?

485
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,754
I just saw a door
open and close.

486
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,048
I didn't see anything.

487
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,676
Let's check it out.

488
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,761
Why? I thought
we were going!

489
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,554
Settle down.
Jeez.

490
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,307
- Don't patronize me, Burt.
- I'm not patronizing you.

491
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,643
I just want to see
if somebody's there.

492
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,526
Hello?

493
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,749
Anybody home?

494
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,213
We've had an accident and we need
to use your phone.

495
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,218
Okay?
Now can we go?

496
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,892
Burt, this is somebody's house!

497
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,519
I know, I just want
to use their phone.

498
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,521
Burt: Hello?

499
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,052
Gross.

500
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,222
I'm going to check out back.

501
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,571
I found the phone.

502
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,284
It matches the decor perfectly.

503
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,952
This is three years old.

504
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,667
I don't understand
what's going on here.

505
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,463
Well, can we go?

506
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,714
( Thump )

507
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,931
( whispers ) Burt.

508
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,118
Hello?

509
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,711
Ls anybody here?

510
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,924
( Stairs creaking )

511
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,526
( both gasp )

512
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,324
( guitar music playing )

513
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,547
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

514
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,841
Hi.

515
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,931
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

516
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,476
Oh, Sarah.
That's a beautiful name.

517
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,103
This is Burt and I'm Vicky.

518
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,647
Are you here alone, Sarah?

519
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,692
Do you live here?

520
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,155
You just come here to play?

521
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,785
Are your mommy
and daddy around?

522
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,205
- They're in the cornfield.
- Oh.

523
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,748
What are they doing there?

524
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,917
All the grown-ups
are there.

525
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,671
Are they working there
or are they having a meeting?

526
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,758
No, lsaac put them there.

527
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,260
Who's lsaac?

528
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,015
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell us who Isaac is.

529
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,017
Our leader.

530
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,602
Leader of what?

531
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Of everybody.

532
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,650
Of course.

533
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,283
Listen, could you
take us to lsaac?

534
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,785
- Huh-uh.
- Vicky: Why not?

535
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,203
He's scary.

536
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,789
Look, Sarah,
it's very important

537
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,292
that we speak to some
grown-ups as soon as possible.

538
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,043
We're wasting
our time here, Vicky.

539
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,920
Well, give her a chance.

540
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,964
I'm gonna go look
at the town hall.

541
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,883
Why?

542
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,803
Because we have
a murder to report.

543
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,973
And we're standing here
talking in circles wasting our time.

544
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,808
Maybe she can help.

545
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,727
Well, fine, then you
stay here with her.

546
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,608
Listen, things just
aren't happening fast enough.

547
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,943
So I'm gonna leave you the car.

548
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,403
I won't be gone very long.

549
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,156
If anybody comes,
just honk, okay?

550
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,287
Are we safe?

551
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,583
Yeah, it's a little weird
here, but it's safe.

552
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,210
I'll be back.

553
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,981
So looks like
it's just you and me.

554
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,153
What were you doing here by yourself?
Just playing records?

555
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,616
Come on, you can tell me.

556
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,121
- Drawing
- Drawing.

557
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,916
What's so secret about drawing?

558
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm not supposed to.

559
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,170
You're not supposed to draw?

560
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,299
Who says?
Isaac?

561
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,259
Malachai.

562
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,345
Malachai?

563
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,639
Well, I'll tell you what.

564
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,015
Why don't you draw me a picture

565
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,768
And we won't tell Isaac
or Malachai or anybody?

566
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,354
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

567
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,472
- So how's it coming, huh?
- Fine.

568
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,393
- What did you draw?
- You.

569
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,479
You did?
Could I see?

570
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,033
What is this?

571
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,160
( Stairs creak )

572
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,995
Burt?

573
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:24,378
Burt, is that you?

574
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,322
Vicky:
ls somebody here?

575
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,203
Who are you?

576
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,498
What do you want?

577
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,963
We want to give you peace.

578
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,967
Seize her.

579
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,635
Boy:
Come on, get her.

580
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,107
Come out of there.

581
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,278
Sarah!

582
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,798
- No!
- ( Indistinct chuckling )

583
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,342
Vicky: No!

584
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,597
Burt! No!

585
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,604
Vicky's voice:
Are we safe?

586
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,274
Burt's voice:
it's weird here, but it's safe.

587
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,652
( Both voices repeating )

588
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,029
Vicky.

589
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,788
( Vicky screaming ) Help me!

590
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,082
Where are you taking me?

591
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,087
Burt!

592
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,715
- Burt! No!
- ( Sarah crying )

593
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,605
Vicky!

594
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,946
Sarah, what happened here, huh?

595
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,325
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

596
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,660
You've gotta think.
Now think.

597
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,245
What happened to her, please?

598
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,919
Does He speak to you, Isaac?

599
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:06,089
He speaks to me always.

600
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,341
But today He is displeased.

601
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,011
He is displeased
with you, Malachai.

602
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,846
What have I done?

603
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,099
Question Him not in vain.

604
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,060
Do you not know you did sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

605
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,188
And did you not
spill the blood of the old man

606
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,774
when his oil and gasoline were
still useful to us?

607
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,193
We have our own
fuel now from the corn.

608
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,863
Show not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

609
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,036
Maybe He is displeased
we have not offered Him Sarah and Job.

610
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,789
Sarah has the gift of sight.

611
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,543
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

612
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,212
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

613
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,840
I am the giver of His word.

614
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,886
Go you and bring me
the husband.

615
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,514
I must offer them tonight
when Amos leaves.

616
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,437
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her, please.

617
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,316
Sarah, look at me.
Now think.

618
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,152
- ( Whispers ) Malachai.
- What?

619
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,530
- Malachai.
- Who's Malachai? What do you mean?

620
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,657
Huh?

621
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,127
No.

622
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:31,633
Vicky?

623
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,328
Vicky's voice:
Oh my God!

624
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,419
( Bell tolling )

625
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,549
( roaring )

626
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,145
( crowd cheering )

627
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,327
( screams )

628
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,457
( crowd chanting )
Kill kill kill kill...

629
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,729
( bell tolling )

630
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,257
( bell continues tolling )

631
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,521
Now the blood
of Amos will be shared!

632
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,232
Stop it!
Stop that!

633
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,651
- Woman: What?
- Hold the outlander!

634
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,659
What the hell's going on here?

635
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,704
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

636
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,206
My passage, it's my birthday.

637
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,084
You got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

638
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,212
- Listen, I...
- Silence, interloper!

639
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,966
Your presence does
profane this holy place.

640
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,968
He will reckon with you!

641
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,928
That's terrific.
I don't know who he is,

642
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,848
but maybe he'd like to discuss the medical
side of what's going on here with me.

643
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,016
- It's as it should be.
- Amos!

644
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,517
It's as it is written.

Girl:
Speak no more to him!

646
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,606
He is an unbeliever.
Hurry, get lsaac.

647
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,108
No, wait.

648
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,444
Bring Malachai.

( All gasping )

650
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,702
So what do you mean,
"as it is written"? Written where?

651
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,460
What, in this?

652
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,838
You rewriting the whole thing or just
the parts that suit your needs?

Burt:
What do we have here?

01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,981
19, 19 year...
what is this?

659
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,025
These people all died so young.

660
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,444
Amos:
Not die. We go to Him

661
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,405
- on the first night of our 19th year.

Check the door.
Check the doors.

You guys, go back up the alley.

Psst.
Hey, mister.

701
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,645
I know a place to hide.

702
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,063
But we gotta hurry.

703
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,065
- Who are you?
- Job.

704
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,609
Come on.
Stop asking questions.

705

Will you come on?

707
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,388
Careful.

Hey, don't be a scaredy cat.

- Come on. it's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

710
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,439
Yeah, my sister.

711
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,779
Isn't this neat?
My dad built it

712
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,490
for when the communists
launch their first strike.

713
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,036
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worry about.

714
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,331
Don't worry.
Nobody knows about this place.

715
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,334
It's secret.

716
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,837
- Are those guys friends of yours?
- No way.

717
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,548
They listen to lsaac
and Malachai.

718
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,967
Who are lsaac and Malachai?

719
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,094
Isaac started the whole thing.

720
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,972
If he hadn't had come,
this would never have happened.

721
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,100
When he was young, he was a preacher,
so everybody believed him.

722
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,811
They thought he had
great spirit.

723
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,313
I thought he was weird,
huh, Sarah?

724
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,785
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

725
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,496
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

726
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,748
She'll bring the man to us.

727
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,876
No, he must be
taken without her.

728
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,920
We cannot remove her
from this place. it is holy.

729
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,298
We will bring the Lord
two by using one.

730
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,508
Do not blaspheme, Malachai!

731
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,636
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

732
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,973
I think not, Isaac.
You're the one who's lost favor with Him.

733
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,435
He's the god of blood and sacrifice,
not ceremony.

734
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,313
Ah, sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

735
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,939
Shut your mouth, lsaac.

736
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,025
You've grown prideful
and apart from us.

737
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,569
Girl:
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

738
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,197
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

739
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,575
Don't just sit there.
Seize him!

740
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,077
Punish him!
Cut him down! I command you!

741
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

742
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,208
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

743
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,878
Do it now or your punishment shall be
a thousand times a thousand deaths.

744
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,713
Each more horrible
than the last.

745
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,715
They are tired
of your talk, lsaac.

746
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,258
I have shown them
what I can do.

747
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,552
Cut the woman down.

748
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,387
Put lsaac in her place.

749
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,890
You will see how
the Lord favors you.

750
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,059
No, you dare not.
You blaspheme.

751
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,520
He will punish you.
The god of hell will devour you.

752
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,689
All of you! No!

753
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,193
( Screaming )

754
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,362
When my dad wouldn't get up,

755
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,365
I ran from Hansen's
to get Officer Hotchkiss.

756
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,742
But I was too late.

757
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,744
Why, what happened to him?

758
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,704
He got away...
that time.

759
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,916
Then he went down to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

760
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,961
The minister?
What happened to the minister?

761
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,295
Malachai.

762
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,134
Malachai:
Outlander!

763
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,513
Outlander!

764
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,517
Get over there.
He's gonna come. Get over there.

765
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,855
- Boy: You come with me down this street.
- Outlander!

766
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,276
Outlander!

767
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,530
We have your woman.
She still lives.

768
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,201
Outlander, maybe you don't
hear so well.

769
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,704
( Screams ) Burt!

770
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,165
Outlander, her blood will spill

771
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,251
unless you give yourself up.

772
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,129
We won't wait much longer.

773
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,174
Night is coming.
Night is His time.

774
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,427
Outlander!

775
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,095
Come on!
Come on!

776
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,472
Come on, outlander!

777
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,058
( Faintly echoing ) Come on!

778
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,603
Outlander!

779
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,942
Are you looking for that lady?

780
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,611
Yeah, you know where she is?

781
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,739
- They took her out to the clearing.
- What clearing? Where?

782
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,824
In the cornfield.

783
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,452
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

784
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,871
- I followed them like I followed you.
- Show me.

785
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,709
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

786
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:56,835
Okay.

787
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,859
- ( Hinges squeak )
- ( Whispers ) Quiet.

788
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,430
Come on.

789
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,184
Follow me to the barn.

790
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,478
Careful.

791
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,369
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

792
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,621
Isaac:
Malachai, He will not forgive you!

793
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,790
None of you will be forgiven!

794
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,708
All of you
shall feel His wrath!

795
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,877
- ( Screaming continues )
- We have a surprise for you, Amos.

796
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,338
You morons. Don't you understand
what he's trying to do?

797
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,298
Isaac's going
to keep you company.

798
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,425
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

799
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,220
I am the word and the giver
of His laws!

800
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,847

967
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,981
( Sighs )
Well, Hemingford's 19 miles, right?

Are you okay?

01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,416
You better believe it.

979
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,263
Burt:
Oh, I don't know.

980
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:51,766
You guys want to come live with us

985
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,403
All right.
All right.

986
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,031
I'll grab the map.

987
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,283
- Ever been to Seattle?
- Sarah: What's Seattle?

988

Oh, boy.

Oh, she's out cold.

993
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,687
What are we gonna do now?

01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,689
Send her a get-well
card from Seattle.

995
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,440
Let's get the hell out of here.
