1
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,418
(water bubbling)

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,919
(suspenseful music plays)

3
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:23,762
(people shriek)

4
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,940
(cell phone chimes)

5
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:46,953
- You're texting again?
- Huh?

6
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:49,182
Come on,
put that down and swim with me.

7
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,883
In the ocean?
There's fish out there.

8
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:54,485
- Your loss.
- (chimes)

9
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,712
(chimes)

10
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,739
Oh my God. Bree!

11
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,578
Bree! Shark!

12
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,246
Bree, there's a shark!

13
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,724
(shrieking)

14
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:13,270
Oh my God!
Somebody help her, please!

15
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:17,037
There's a shark!
Bree, shark! Oh my God.

16
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,780
(bellows)

17
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,221
(creature calling)

18
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,834
(pings)

19
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,737
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

20
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,300
- Are you okay?
- What just happened?

21
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:54,370
- There was a shark.
- Oh my God.

22
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,414
- (elevator bell dings)
- (keyboard clacking)

23
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,154
Welcome to Blue Water.

24
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,389
This better be good, Sands.

25
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,421
I stood up an admiral to be here.

26
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,662
Trust me, Commander.
You're gonna wanna see this.

27
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,768
What are we looking at here?

28
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:24,003
S-11's been fitted with cameras.

29
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,512
We received these images
10 minutes ago.

30
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:29,806
My God.

31
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,181
Very "National Geographic,"
isn't it?

32
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,715
- Freeze it.
- (beeps)

33
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:38,690
See?
The girl got away.

34
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,556
Why didn't S-11 go after her?

35
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,119
Because we jerked its leash.

36
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:44,858
We told it to behave.

37
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:48,561
- Come again?
- Like a shark...

38
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,298
let me let my daughter explain.

39
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:54,739
Like a shark, S-11 can sense
electrical impulses,

40
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:56,742
helping it navigate.

41
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,074
We manipulate this ability

42
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,444
by transmitting
focused electrical charges

43
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,711
to a series
of receptors implanted

44
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,014
in S-11's cerebral cortex.

45
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,917
I have no idea what she just said.

46
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,616
S-11 is now totally
under our control.

47
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:14,593
Blue Water Corp. Has just created
the Navy's next superweapon.

48
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:18,587
Sands, you crafty SOB.

49
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,190
You did it.

50
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,725
Was there any doubt?
Baby girl, bring S-11 home.

51
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,606
- (beeps)
- (S-11 bellows)

52
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:44,746
Sir, we've got S-11 on an intercept path
of a fast moving vessel.

53
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,281
Change course.

54
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,385
No, take it in closer.

55
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,396
Commander, the swimmer
was a chance encounter.

56
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,227
S-11 still needs more testing.

57
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,995
I procured millions of dollars
of taxpayer money to develop that thing.

58
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,765
Before Blue Water gets one more cent,
I better see it perform.

59
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:59,772
But the external interface
is a prototype.

60
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,740
If something were to happen...

61
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,471
What did you have in mind,
Commander?

62
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,741
S-11 was designed
to go where the Navy can't, right?

63
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,716
Sneak into hostile waters, hunt down
drug runners and pirate vessels.

64
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,981
So you want us to treat
that craft like the enemy?

65
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,888
Move in tight
and pursue without being seen.

66
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:20,893
- Dad?
- Make me proud, pumpkin.

67
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,724
I told you to stop
calling me that.

68
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,060
Make me proud, Nicole.
(pats)

69
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,036
(beeping)

70
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,939
- Isn't this fun?
- Yeah, man.

71
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,772
- (laughs)
- (shouts) Hold on!

72
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,813
(beeps)

73
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:56,121
You can breathe now.

74
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:09,132
- (thuds)
- (moans)

75
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,202
Whoa. What was that?
You hit something?

76
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,644
Whoa!

77
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,309
(alarm beeping)

78
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:23,451
What's going on?

79
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,651
- S-11 isn't responding to command.
- (keyboard clacking)

80
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,660
The propeller must've damaged
the external interface.

81
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:29,855
I told you it wasn't ready
for adverse conditions.

82
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,660
Get the system back
online now.

83
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,326
It's not working.

84
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,970
I'm engaging the kill switch.

85
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,838
- (high-pitched whine)
- In three...

86
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,901
two...

87
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:48,380
- one.
- It's too late, Nicole.

88
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:50,143
Look.

89
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,052
- (alarm blaring)
- Woman: We've lost our signal.

90
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,150
- Oh my God.
- What just happened?

91
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,253
S-11 escaped.

92
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,823
(groans)

93
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,780
So you ever see anybody
fall off one of these things?

94
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,547
Fall? Nah.

95
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,986
I seen a guy jump once, though.

96
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,855
Wife left him
so he took a nosedive

97
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,722
from 60 floors up.

98
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,990
- That's horrible.
- Ain't so bad.

99
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,930
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

100
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,933
Feel the wind in your hair.

101
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,800
- (sighs)
- Splat!

102
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:47,705
(laughs)
It's all over with.

103
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,708
I can think of worse ways
to go anyhow.

104
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,039
Like what?

105
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:53,944
Like falling face first
in a French fryer.

106
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,743
- (mimics sizzling)
- Thanks.

107
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,579
I'll have that image
in my head all day.

108
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,419
Huh?
(groans)

109
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:05,049
How about getting jammed
into a wood chipper?

110
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,718
Whoa!

111
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,262
Oh no!

112
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,198
Not like this!
(screaming)

113
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,532
- (man grunting)
- (S-11 bellows)

114
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,438
Signals from the tracking implant
are fading,

115
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,103
but it looks like
S-11's heading south.

116
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,305
Commander.

117
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,646
You just unleashed an eight-legged
man-eating shark on the world.

118
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,810
A minor setback.

119
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:36,379
If you're thinking of going back into that
lab and creating a new freak, forget it.

120
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:40,017
I'm cutting off all Blue Water funding
until you get S-11 back.

121
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,823
Fail, and that's not all I'll cut off.

122
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,092
Relax, Commander.
We'll get S-11,

123
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:48,100
even if we have to go
to the ends of the earth.

124
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:59,811
Okay, telemetry shows
he's heading to Mexico.

125
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's get a team down there now.

126
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,874
(birds coo)

127
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,151
Any changes?

128
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,715
Hard to say.

129
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,557
The tracking implant was damaged
when S-11 ripped off its control plate.

130
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,688
But we're still receiving ghost signals

131
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,665
indicating S-11's presence
in the coastal waters.

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,497
Can we pinpoint its location?

133
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,526
Not exactly, Dr. Sands.

134
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,131
But S-11 is here, and for some reason,
it's sticking around.

135
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:03,642
Migratory instincts.

136
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:07,544
It'll feed along the coast
a few days and then move on.

137
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,571
- This is us, sir.
- We're here?

138
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:18,855
I chartered a smaller craft too
for the recovery mission.

139
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,256
A fast one, I hope.

140
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,783
- It will do the job, sir.
- Good.

141
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,388
Sir, I think we should
also contact Andy Flynn.

142
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,523
Flynn?

143
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,966
He's here in Mexico?

144
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,731
Since you let him
go two years ago.

145
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,933
I didn't let him go, Santos.
I fired his ass

146
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,635
'cause he demanded a raise...
a big one.

147
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:38,473
He's a greedy bastard,
no doubt,

148
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,536
but he knows these waters
better than anyone.

149
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,377
And he knows
what we're up against.

150
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,851
If you want S-11 back,

151
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,716
Andy Flynn is your best shot.

152
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,517
(groans)

153
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,957
All right, find him.

154
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,727
(women speaking Spanish)

155
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,117
Who's ready
for some tequila ball?

156
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,862
- Ready, gringo?
- Whoo!

157
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,891
You missed.
Let's go, ladies.

158
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,926
(woman speaking Spanish)

159
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,871
- There you go.
- Gracias.

160
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,934
Andy Flynn.
Still drinking that rotgut, huh?

161
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,877
Santos.

162
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,608
What's up, brother?
What are you doing here?

163
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,707
Looking for you.

164
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,650
No, you didn't.

165
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,483
- Blue Water wants you back.
- Not a chance, man.

166
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:56,545
Not a chance.

167
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,854
- If it's about the money...
- Look, it's always about the money.

168
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:02,520
All right? That idiot Sands,
he won't pay me what I'm worth,

169
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,291
so I'm retired.

170
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,458
- Not anymore, amigo.
- (sighs)

171
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,560
S-11 escaped.

172
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,075
(metal detector beeping)

173
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,993
(metal detector whines)

174
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,892
(screaming)

175
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,917
Please help me!

176
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,088
Please! No! Please!

177
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,961
Please!
(screams)

178
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,661
No, don't!
No no no no no no!

179
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,363
No! No!

180
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,714
(S-11 bellows)

181
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,713
Hey, guys.

182
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:06,650
So glad you could join us,
Mr. Flynn.

183
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,711
- Do we have a location?
- Sands: No.

184
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:12,690
But like an octopus, he's very territorial.
It won't stray far.

185
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:16,491
You understand you are to capture S-11,
not terminate it, right?

186
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,156
Well, your fish might
have other ideas.

187
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,825
S-11 can be controlled,

188
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,663
Mr. Flynn.

189
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,602
Let me show you.

190
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,348
We call these interface darts.

191
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:39,977
Once attached, I can access S-11's
bioimplants with my computer

192
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,680
allowing me to direct
its movements.

193
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,656
Like a remote control toy.
Sounds easy.

194
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,285
It won't be easy, believe me.
First, we have to tranquilize S-11.

195
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,454
That'll make him docile.

196
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,396
And then he won't resist commands.

197
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,399
The tranqs will bring S-11
to the surface,

198
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,162
and then we can hit it
with the interface dart.

199
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,636
Why don't we just nail it
underwater with your dart?

200
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,468
They're more accurate if shot
from a grenade launcher.

201
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,997
And since we only
have two darts,

202
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,805
accuracy is key.

203
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,142
Once I establish a link,
I can then navigate S-11 to open waters.

204
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,704
Then our techs on the yacht
will be able to fix the interface.

205
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,211
So what do you say?
Are you game?

206
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:14,719
Yeah.

207
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:18,087
100 grand,
200 more upon completion, why not?

208
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:21,218
You think a great deal of yourself,
don't you, Flynn?

209
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,525
Yeah, you know what I think?

210
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,690
I think you're
a money-grubbing Neanderthal.

211
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,529
And the word on you is

212
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,900
you like cheap women
and cheaper booze.

213
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,599
Is that right?

214
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,575
300 grand
or I go back to the pool.

215
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:40,735
Fine, 300 grand.

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,180
But only if you
bring S-11 back alive.

217
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,183
Otherwise you get nothing.

218
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,243
This is a bad idea, Sands.

219
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,154
We should just 86 that freak
before it takes any more lives.

220
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,216
That freak represents a giant leap
in genetic engineering.

221
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,127
Damage it and heads will roll,
Mr. Flynn.

222
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,098
Yours will be first.

223
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,928
Fine.
Get your stuff ready.

224
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,665
We're going to the boat.

225
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:09,197
Santos and I will meet you
at the dock.

226
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,583
Donde esta senor Kingsberry?

227
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,560
(sighs)

228
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,500
Ay ay ay.

229
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:58,256
Classy.

230
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,917
You Kingsberry?

231
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,689
Well, the locals call me Pez.

232
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,593
What can I do for you, angel?

233
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,393
First, Pez,

234
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,798
you can stop staring at my rack.

235
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,462
They're just boobs. They're not gonna
get up and dance or anything.

236
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,938
Second...

237
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:17,101
you can tell me about this.

238
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,338
How'd you find me?

239
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:21,539
It's what I do.
I'm Stacy Everheart,

240
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,775
an investigative reporter with CNE.

241
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,546
- And this is my cameraman Bones.
- Hey, buddy.

242
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,519
(sighs)

243
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,613
You sent that to our station
two days ago.

244
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,625
It was a joke.

245
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,287
- A joke.
- That's right.

246
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:38,853
- Oh, we like jokes.
- Sorry to waste your time.

247
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,196
You're lying.

248
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,994
A creature fitting this description

249
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,507
was sighted just last week
in California.

250
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,874
Now it's in Vallarta
and you've seen it.

251
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,812
Well, I wish to the devil I hadn't.

252
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,681
I can't close my eyes
without imagining that...

253
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,652
that thing squirming
towards me.

254
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,487
It's gotten so bad
I can't take my boat out.

255
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,761
No, I'm done with that thing.

256
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,527
There's nothing you can...

257
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,238
What do you wanna know?

258
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,405
All right, Pez.

259
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:29,039
Can we stop?

260
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,811
Come on. We gotta burn off
those enchiladas from last night.

261
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,116
But we're on vacation,
and it's Mexico.

262
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,714
I think it's against the law
to jog in Mexico.

263
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,747
Fine. You're gonna have to
save your breath anyway.

264
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,851
You'll be screaming
your lungs out soon.

265
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,384
Wait. Why?

266
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,659
Two words...
bungee jumping.

267
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:47,666
I found a great spot over the ocean.

268
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,567
So not funny.
You know I'm afraid of heights.

269
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:54,369
Gonna have to get over that
sooner or later. Today's the day.

270
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,465
All right, tell you what.

271
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,342
Do this and spend the rest
of the day at the spa.

272
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:01,471
Mud-baths?
Seaweed wraps?

273
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:04,642
- Sure.
- Okay, you're on.

274
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:06,674
(birds squawking)

275
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,492
- (laughs)
- (screaming)

276
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:20,488
All right! Yes! Great.

277
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,592
- Nice.
- Whoo!

278
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,139
(laughing)

279
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,270
Man: Yes!

280
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:36,076
Nice.

281
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,810
Babe, that was awesome.

282
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,818
I can't believe I did it.

283
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:42,218
Who's afraid of heights now, huh?
Not my girl.

284
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,916
- Wait, I wanna go again.
- Wild child.

285
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,792
Vendor:
Listo. Vamos!

286
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,821
(screaming)

287
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,596
Whoo!

288
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,626
(laughing)

289
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,939
(boat horn blows)

290
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:22,618
It's gonna be
like old times, Santos.

291
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:24,686
- Yep.
- It's gonna be like old times.

292
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:30,199
She's got
a sexy-librarian vibe going.

293
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,533
- You ever notice that?
- Don't even think it, bro.

294
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,095
Oh, what?
I'm just gonna talk to her.

295
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:35,970
I've heard that before.
Remember Cairo?

296
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,976
The lady snake-charmer
with cobras?

297
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,103
- Cairo, come on.
- My left butt cheek went black, Flynn.

298
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:43,512
- Almost fell off.
- So you miss me?

299
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,380
Excuse me?

300
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:49,376
You might've noticed I took
a little hiatus from Blue Water.

301
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:52,720
By hiatus,
you mean my father fired you.

302
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:56,023
Yeah.
I did notice, Mr. Flynn.

303
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,585
Look, call me Andy.

304
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:01,800
(sighs)
All right.

305
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,099
Let's just get this over with
so I can get back to work.

306
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:06,729
Give me your best line.

307
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:13,400
Okay. Um, here.

308
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:18,448
- What?
- Souvenir from Baghdad...

309
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:21,385
piece of shrapnel
from an IED.

310
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,583
Went in back here,
played ping-pong with my insides.

311
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:26,750
If it weren't for Santos over there,

312
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,352
I probably wouldn't have made it.

313
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,363
So I have him to blame.

314
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,627
Look, I remember you too,
Nicole, all right?

315
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,896
You spent your whole life
in that lab.

316
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,232
First one there,
last one to leave.

317
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,238
And I get it.
That was me once.

318
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:42,433
All right?
My whole life was work.

319
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,443
Thanks to this little guy,

320
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:48,378
it looked like
there was no tomorrow.

321
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,239
So that's my line.

322
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,343
What do you think?

323
00:22:56,855 --> 00:23:00,154
Being first in the lab earned me
a doctorate from MIT

324
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:04,151
and made me one of the best
biomechanical engineers in the country.

325
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:08,155
I care about what I do,
Mr. Flynn.

326
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,566
As for you,

327
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,332
you're a mercenary.

328
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,335
Says it all.

329
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:19,571
Hmm. Okay.

330
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,485
As smooth as ever, huh?

331
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,111
- Oh, shut up.
- (laughs)

332
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,332
(dance music playing)

333
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:54,173
Okay, if that didn't get
your booty shaking,

334
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:57,148
have somebody check your pulse,
'cause you might be dead.

335
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:59,548
I'm Captain Jack
and this is PV Pirate Radio,

336
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,214
your spring break destination.
Just in case they're listening,

337
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,951
I wanted to give
a special shout out to the FCC,

338
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:09,483
'cause those are the boys
who kicked my ass out of America.

339
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,052
And, boys, you have doomed me

340
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:14,031
to a life filled
with sandy beautiful beaches,

341
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:17,126
smoking hot senoritas
and ice cold pina coladas.

342
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,501
- You sure taught me a lesson.
- (both laugh)

343
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,335
Folks, I may never leave here.

344
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,704
God, I hate it here.

345
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,576
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, this place is amazing.

346
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:28,739
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:32,012
And what is it with all this...
what do you call it?

348
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,280
- Sunshine?
- Yes. Sunshine.

349
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,310
Enough with
the freaking sun already.

350
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,380
- It's annoying.
- (phone chimes)

351
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:40,323
What do you got here?

352
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,886
Tell you in a sec.
You are live in five.

353
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,557
Four, three, two...

354
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,031
Hey, party people,
it's Captain Jack

355
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,660
and you are listening
to PV Pirate Radio.

356
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:53,364
First mate Stephie has just handed
me some breaking news.

357
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:56,670
Apparently a half shark,
half octopus

358
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,938
has been sighted off the coast

359
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,241
two miles south
of Playa Del Sol.

360
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,044
According to sources,
it is armed and dangerous.

361
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,041
Yes, it's half octopus, so it would be
eight-armed and dangerous, right?

362
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:11,453
Well, Stephanie apparently is hitting
the tequila a little early today

363
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,890
and she's not sharing
with her captain.

364
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,528
- (clicks)
- I always share with you.

365
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,963
Yeah.
So what is this, Stephie?

366
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:23,297
Is this some mad experiment
gone horribly wrong?

367
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,769
- Maybe they're doing a movie.
- Oh, yeah. I could see that now.

368
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,898
A former Navy SEAL
slash oceanographer

369
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:32,377
is tracking down this abomination
before it takes any more lives.

370
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:34,709
I'd watch it.

371
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,476
Yeah, I know you would, Stephanie.
That's because you're easily amused.

372
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:40,485
I've seen you mesmerized

373
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,147
watching a frozen burrito rotate
in a microwave oven.

374
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,123
Let's get back
to the music, shall we?

375
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:49,059
Coming up next,
it's the Cheetah Whores,

376
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,289
very hot band out of New York City.
Here is their latest hit.

377
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,390
It's called
"Hot Rod Hell Kitten." Meow.

378
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:58,335
- (rock music playing)
- What are you doing with this stuff?

379
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,069
I'm a hot rod hell kitten,
get inside

380
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,341
I'm a hot rod
hell kitten, take a ride

381
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,247
Itty-bitty pretty kitty

382
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,444
Let's go out
and prowl the city

383
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:19,490
Do you wanna be my pet?

384
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:23,358
Do you wanna
be my pet?

385
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,523
I'm a cheetah whore,
can you run with that?

386
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:30,433
Yeah! Yeah!

387
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,247
Well, this is it.

388
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,775
- Nice view, huh?
- Yeah yeah, breathtaking.

389
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,184
- Hey!
- There.

390
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:52,190
Thank you.

391
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,252
- Hook me up?
- Not a chance.

392
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,764
Aw, you're no fun.

393
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,891
So what makes you think
it'll come back here?

394
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:04,698
Well, when you spend
your days gutting fish,

395
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:07,466
you learn a thing
or two about marine life.

396
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:10,304
- (spits)
- Hard to believe you're still single.

397
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,833
Would've thought some lucky lady
would've snapped you up by now.

398
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,582
As I was saying,
octopi are very territorial.

399
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,608
He'll be back.

400
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,777
Nicole: Santos, take it 20 miles south
and stop by the rocks.

401
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,022
Let me see that thing.

402
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,986
Easy, bro.
Those spears inject enough MS-222

403
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,360
to put a bull shark to sleep.

404
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,228
But it can't bring down S-11?

405
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,790
Nicole: S-11's metabolism
is higher than a typical shark.

406
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,633
Tranqs just make it more...

407
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,902
amenable.

408
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:18,603
- Kind of like you and tequila, huh?
- (laughs)

409
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:21,635
- (sonar pinging)
- I got a signal.

410
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,754
- It's two miles south of here.
- Yeah, I know the place.

411
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,619
Resorts all over the area.

412
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,781
(dials cell phone)

413
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:37,488
(rings)

414
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,087
- Dad.
- Yes, Nicole.

415
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:41,099
- We got a signal.
- I don't have to tell you what's

416
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,623
at stake here, pumpkin.

417
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,568
I told you to stop
calling me that.

418
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,072
I'm counting on you, Nicole.

419
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,097
Bring S-11 home.

420
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:15,592
Okay, Stacy, in three, two...

421
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,068
Stacy Everheart here

422
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,470
with local fisherman
Ryan Kingsberry.

423
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:25,576
It's Pez.

424
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,942
All right, Pez.
Can you tell us what you saw?

425
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,881
Well, I first saw
the creature coming in

426
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,182
from out there chasing a charter.

427
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,848
I thought it was a shark at first,

428
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,414
and then I saw the tentacles

429
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,394
and black soulless eyes
like my third wife's.

430
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:45,396
Cut.
What are you doing?

431
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,227
Are you high
or just that stupid?

432
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,665
Holy crap!

433
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,692
(bellowing)

434
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,867
Hey!

435
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:03,369
Hey!
Get out of there!

436
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:06,316
Yoga instructor: Inhale.

437
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,818
Get out of there!

438
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:11,516
Inhale. Exhale.

439
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,252
Break left.

440
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,897
Hola, senorita.
You wanna play?

441
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:30,169
Not really.

442
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,343
Hey, what's the holdup?

443
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,010
Got it!

444
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,727
(grunting)

445
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:53,060
Mark!

446
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:59,736
(crunches)

447
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,640
(roars)

448
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,769
(people screaming)

449
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,143
- Are you getting this?
- Yes. Yes.

450
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:11,911
(screams)

451
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,724
- (S-11 roaring)
- (screaming)

452
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,893
(shrieks)

453
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,969
Pez:
Get out of there!

454
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,604
(screams)

455
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,608
- Is it over yet?
- Um, not quite.

456
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,637
(gasping)

457
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,517
Pez:
Oh, this ain't happening.

458
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:55,983
(panting)

459
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,267
That was horrible.

460
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,771
Sure. Sure.

461
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,741
Horrible.
Come on, let's go.

462
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:25,215
(sonar pings)

463
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:27,225
Damn it!
Lost the signal.

464
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,387
- What?
- I lost the signal. S-11's gone.

465
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,726
Damn it!

466
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,959
You sure that thing works?

467
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,468
I told you the tracer got damaged
when S-11 escaped.

468
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:40,266
Great.
So we're chasing ghosts out here.

469
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:43,638
I don't think so.

470
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,525
We sure our freak did that?

471
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,119
The abrasions on his body
are tentacle markings.

472
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:06,722
Why didn't it eat him?

473
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,232
Maybe he wasn't hungry.

474
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:10,826
Oh, keen insight.

475
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,099
I'm so glad you came along.

476
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:16,266
Tell me something,
Ms. Sands, what do you know?

477
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,900
I know octopi like big rocks.

478
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:36,385
- Sir.
- What is it?

479
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,022
There's something on TV
I think you should see.

480
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,198
Stacy:
My crew and I captured

481
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,867
this footage an hour ago
around Playa Del Sol...

482
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,241
So far only CNE
is carrying this.

483
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,405
And that's supposed
to make me feel any better?

484
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,644
Stacy: The creature appeared to be
some hybrid of shark and octopus.

485
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:02,210
- A sharktopus, if you will.
- Hell.

486
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,720
Stacy:
As viewers can see,

487
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,417
the creature is like nothing
ever witnessed before,

488
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,790
and neither is its brutality.

489
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,193
There's no confirmation
by authorities yet,

490
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,789
but fatalities are certain.

491
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,664
Dr. Sands, you've got
an incoming call on satellite link.

492
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,833
- Stacy: It's only a matter of time...
- It's Commander Cox.

493
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,571
...before the sharktopus
strikes again.

494
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:29,580
- All right, patch him in.
- Stacy Everheart reporting.

495
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,104
Wait.

496
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,118
First bring me a great,
big, enormous scotch.

497
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,643
- Three and neat, sir?
- Yeah.

498
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:38,781
Got it.

499
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,936
What's going on?
Why did we come ashore?

500
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,909
To get away from your dad's
Eagle Scouts

501
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:01,503
so you can tell me
what the hell you're hiding.

502
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:05,107
- What are you talking about?
- S-11's killing at random. Why?

503
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,118
I told you,
I have no idea.

504
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:09,518
Look, even I know sharks
aren't serial killers, okay?

505
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,647
They kill for a purpose.
And octopi?

506
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,852
(scoffs) Smart as hell,
and not to mention stealthy.

507
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,861
Okay, so they're not gonna
expose themselves

508
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,386
unless they got a damn
good reason not to.

509
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,456
Maybe our neural implants

510
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,332
are damaging the impulse controls
in S-11's brain.

511
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,496
Or maybe your father
did something to that freak,

512
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:28,028
something you don't know about.

513
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,632
You know, a little gene splicing
behind closed doors?

514
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:33,701
No, he wouldn't do that,
not without consulting me first.

515
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,213
My father is a man of science.

516
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,272
How about you tell that
to the dead guy out there?

517
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,681
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:41,742
It means that I think your dad
intended S-11

519
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,913
to succeed at all costs.

520
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:46,014
Blue Water didn't hire you
to think.

521
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,457
They hired you to do a job.

522
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,825
And if you can't do it,
we'll find someone who can.

523
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:56,323
(sighs)

524
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,836
Get Tom on the phone.

525
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,040
Look, I don't care if he's
in a meeting.

526
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,073
Tell him Stacy Everheart wants
to talk to him now.

527
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:15,347
- Thank you.
- (TV playing)

528
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,877
Yep, I'm watching
the recap right now.

529
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:19,856
So what'd the network say?

530
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:22,792
Tom: The network
is replacing you, Stacy.

531
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:24,886
- What?
- I'm sorry.

532
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,898
- That's the decision they've made.
- But it's my story.

533
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:31,459
- Hey, Stacy...
- I hope you understand, all right?

534
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:34,165
No, I understand.

535
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:37,140
- Fine.
- (beeps)

536
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:40,474
Rat bastards are sending
in another reporter to take the lead.

537
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,106
- What?
- What is this?

538
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:45,707
Pez figured out a pattern
in the attacks.

539
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,217
Show me.

540
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:49,083
This is where I first spotted
the creature.

541
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,247
This was the attack
on the bungee tower.

542
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:54,053
And this was the attack
on the resort.

543
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:56,151
So it's sticking
to the coast heading south.

544
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,593
- Yeah.
- What are we supposed to do?

545
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,995
Just head south
and hope we run into it?

546
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,659
Worth a shot, and maybe we
can get some more footage.

547
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,930
Then the network would have to
make us the leads.

548
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:06,459
You know,

549
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,268
I bet we could cover
a lot more miles by boat.

550
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:13,409
Fine.

551
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,412
But you're gonna
double my salary

552
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,107
and you're gonna pay
for my car.

553
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,514
Oh, Pez,
I could just hug you right now.

554
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,349
I mean, if you were better looking
and had better hygiene.

555
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:26,616
Oh, what the hell!

556
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:32,520
- Pez!
- I'm sorry.

557
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:42,702
Lock and load, boys.
It's time to get wet.

558
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:48,045
You got the helm, brother.

559
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,274
You better watch your back
down there.

560
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,510
Oh, watching my back is your job.

561
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,519
- I don't know. Am I in your will?
- You get my dog.

562
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,886
You don't have a dog.
(laughs)

563
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:02,450
Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't
want S-11 harmed, all right?

564
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,688
And we always do what Daddy says,
don't we?

565
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:07,391
Relax,
I've got 300,000 reasons

566
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,457
to bring that thing back
in one piece.

567
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,866
We stick to the plan,

568
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:13,700
tranq it,
force it to the surface,

569
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:17,697
then Santos shoots it
with your remote control gizmo,

570
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:21,178
and you guys jockey it back

571
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:25,080
to your yacht,
if your gear really works.

572
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:28,313
Yeah, it does work.
So make sure you don't miss.

573
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,548
I haven't yet.

574
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,323
Now I'm ready.
Patch him in.

575
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,735
Guess what I just saw on CNE.

576
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:50,263
S-11 looks impressive on TV,
doesn't it, Commander?

577
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:52,071
Are you drinking?

578
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,704
Yes, I am. Scotch.

579
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:57,340
- Good scotch.
- Damn it, Sands.

580
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:58,940
You said you could handle this.

581
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,713
- Listen, if you can't handle...
- No, Commander, you listen.

582
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:03,948
The Navy said they wanted
a killing machine.

583
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:06,081
That's exactly what I gave them.

584
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:09,491
And yes, the civilian deaths
are a tragedy.

585
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:13,287
But greatness comes at a price.
It always has.

586
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,299
Just capture that freak

587
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,301
before it shows up on TV again.

588
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,270
If the media links this to the Navy,
we're screwed.

589
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:23,967
Don't worry, Commander.
I've got my best man on it.

590
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:27,597
Don't worry.
Flynn can take care of himself.

591
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:30,300
Worried?
Why would I be worried?

592
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,809
- No reason.
- Hey, do me a favor.

593
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,371
Stay out of my business
and focus on the shooting.

594
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:39,315
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am.

595
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,268
(growling)

596
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,484
What is that?

597
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:56,755
- Ink.
- Oh God, no.

598
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,370
(bellows)

599
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:13,568
- (thuds)
- (gurgling)

600
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,393
Santos.

601
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:42,270
It's right behind me.
It got me in the leg.

602
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,534
Did your tranq hit it?

603
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:48,909
No.
It pulled it out of its hide.

604
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:50,914
- What about the others?
- They're gone.

605
00:42:50,948 --> 00:42:52,813
They're dead.

606
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,986
So what makes you think
we'll spot it out here?

607
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:06,622
I don't know, but if you've got
a better idea, I'm all ears.

608
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:08,859
No no, you're the captain.

609
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,391
Nice yacht, by the way.

610
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:14,700
Bite me.

611
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,670
(groans)

612
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:34,615
Flynn: What do you think?
Two or three stitches?

613
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:36,354
Santos:
This is nothing.

614
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:39,192
Remember that go-go dancer
in Bangkok?

615
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,097
Crazy chica nearly bit
your pinkie toe off.

616
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,124
Now that was bad.

617
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,329
Man, I have no idea
where that thing came from.

618
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,897
- It's like it knew we were coming.
- That's what sharks do, amigo.

619
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:53,877
No, this wasn't predatory instinct.
This was a planned attack.

620
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,675
- Is that mine?
- Damn it.

621
00:43:56,714 --> 00:43:58,204
You better not have any diseases.

622
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:00,547
Yeah, well,
it burns when I urinate.

623
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:03,052
- Shouldn't be concerned, should I?
- (cell phone rings)

624
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:05,647
- Oh, there's Daddy.
- Dad.

625
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,420
Yeah, it escaped
and the tracer went dead again.

626
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,586
Is that your dad?
Tell him I miss him.

627
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,892
Is that Flynn?

628
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,797
Yeah, he's still in shock
from the blood loss.

629
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:18,996
- Can he continue the mission?
- He'll be fine.

630
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:21,004
But the others,
they weren't so lucky.

631
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:23,165
They knew the risks, Nicole.

632
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,675
Dad, S-11 is a killer,
and they're random.

633
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,735
It's not even feeding on its victims.

634
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,178
Dad?

635
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,844
I had the tech boys
make some adjustments

636
00:44:34,885 --> 00:44:37,183
to S-11's subroutines.

637
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:40,349
You altered my programming?

638
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,586
S-11 was a hunter.

639
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:44,753
We needed a killer.

640
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,786
So we enhanced
its aggressiveness.

641
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:48,526
I designed the bioware.

642
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:50,557
I should've been consulted.
This isn't right.

643
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:53,035
It's time for you to grow up,
baby girl.

644
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,039
Our feelings are irrelevant.

645
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:58,598
Right now all that matters

646
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:00,974
is getting S-11 back.

647
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:04,038
Am I clear?
Are you with me?

648
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:06,743
- Yes.
- Good.

649
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:09,582
Now bring S-11 home, baby girl.

650
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:15,288
Did he ask about me?

651
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:20,795
- Can you move on that thing?
- Why? Wanna go dancing later?

652
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:23,527
Do you always make asinine jokes
when men have died?

653
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,865
Look, what do you
want from me?

654
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:28,838
I want you to do your damn job
and capture S-11.

655
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:31,569
Okay. You heard the woman,
fire it up.

656
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:35,443
- Where are we headed?
- South.

657
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:40,477
(motor revving)

658
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:16,883
Nicole:
He's headed straight for that boat.

659
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:22,759
Flynn: I'm pulling up behind them
to get their attention.

660
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:31,799
We gotta get them out of here.

661
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:33,463
Hey!

662
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:36,632
- Leave!
- Hey, this is a restricted area!

663
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,165
Can you hear them?
I can't hear what they're saying.

664
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,075
This is restricted area.

665
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:44,479
Bones, get on the clock.
Something's going on.

666
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,415
Please go!

667
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,748
They're not listening.

668
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:50,686
They'll listen to this.

669
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,681
- (gunfire)
- (gasps)

670
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:56,192
Keep filming.

671
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:58,855
- What are you doing?
- I didn't sign up to get shot.

672
00:46:58,896 --> 00:47:00,557
That's my story
you're running away from.

673
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,498
I'm getting the hell out of here.

674
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:10,335
Hey!

675
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:12,365
You crazy bitch!

676
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:22,945
(screams)

677
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,182
Oh my God!

678
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:30,052
(panting)

679
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:31,857
Your dad's gonna have to settle
for damaged goods.

680
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:36,699
(screaming)

681
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,495
(S-11 roars)

682
00:47:45,075 --> 00:47:48,704
It's heading away from the rocks.
I'm gonna run that bastard down.

683
00:47:57,054 --> 00:47:58,783
Santos, take the helm.

684
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:00,653
- I'm gonna take a shot at it.
- Got it.

685
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,354
- Santos.
- I'm on it.

686
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,231
(fires)

687
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,236
Damn!

688
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:35,656
How about that one?

689
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:38,751
All right, man.
Perfect.

690
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:41,264
To the boat and back.
Loser gets the tequila.

691
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,960
Let's do it.

692
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,536
What are these morons doing?

693
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,481
Hey, you're a little close, huh?

694
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,176
- (whistles, laughs)
- What are you doing?

695
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,653
What is this,
an amusement park to you?

696
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:11,120
- Hey!
- I'm trying to fish here.

697
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,789
- (laughing)
- Hey!

698
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:20,036
Hey, Maria.
I can't believe this.

699
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,732
What's going on, honey?

700
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:24,741
Bunch of stupid punks.

701
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:33,542
(engine sputtering)

702
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,195
(screaming)

703
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:56,932
(clamoring)

704
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:07,610
Dios mio.

705
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:15,119
Tequila's on you guys,
and I'm super thirsty.

706
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:16,786
Where's Bob?

707
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:19,591
I don't know.
He was just right behind you.

708
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,293
Hey, something
just touched my leg.

709
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:26,895
What was that?
(screaming)

710
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:30,500
Ed. Ed!

711
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,510
Ed!
Ed!

712
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:37,105
(screams)

713
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:39,138
(crunching)

714
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:05,641
I've been horrible
to you this whole time.

715
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:08,839
And you don't deserve it.

716
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:10,779
I'm sorry, Flynn.

717
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,741
It's Andy.

718
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:23,990
Andy, there's something
I need to tell you.

719
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,002
(man speaking Spanish)

720
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,738
Got it.
Gracias, Miguel.

721
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:47,442
What?

722
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:50,681
Nothing.
What'd you find out?

723
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:54,282
The powerboat was rented
by some Blue Water Corporation,

724
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:55,814
some shady
genetics engineering firm,

725
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,157
knee-deep
in defense department contracts,

726
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:01,187
enough cash
to go all Frankenstein

727
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:03,893
and create our fish.

728
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:05,629
That's great.

729
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:07,500
What is wrong with you?

730
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,631
Were you a lawyer in a past life?

731
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:13,336
Or no,
maybe you worked at the DMV.

732
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:15,345
Do you feel nothing, Stacy?

733
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,678
That guy was killed right in front
of us inches away.

734
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,307
Inches away!

735
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:25,082
Gosh. He was kind of
a nice guy, you know?

736
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:27,590
Smell a little funky,
but he was okay.

737
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:29,888
Now he's dead.

738
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,521
And that's tragic truly.

739
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:35,691
But the story of a lifetime
is right out that door.

740
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,700
And we can find it
thanks to Pez's map.

741
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,328
- No no.
- Oh, come on, Bones.

742
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,736
He would've wanted it this way.

743
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:46,038
Don't let his death mean nothing.

744
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,608
You are so full of crap.

745
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:51,841
I know,
but you're coming with me anyway.

746
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,809
Hell not!

747
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:07,056
Your father did what?

748
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:10,533
Altered S-11's neural implants,
disrupting serotonin levels.

749
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:13,968
Making it more aggressive.

750
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,700
That explains all the random attacks.

751
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:22,468
You know what I gave up
to be my dad's perfect little scientist?

752
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:26,005
Now he goes
and does this behind my back.

753
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,210
Look, I'm sorry, Nicole.

754
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,287
What can I say?
He's my dad. I love him.

755
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,725
- (sonar pinging)
- Santos: Flynn.

756
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:40,662
It's the tracking device
on my computer. S-11's near.

757
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:57,312
Do you mind telling us the plan?

758
00:53:57,347 --> 00:54:00,510
We've been one step
behind that freak all day.

759
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:02,542
Time to cut it off.

760
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:07,348
(rock music playing)

761
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:09,484
(cell phone beeps)

762
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:14,653
You aren't gonna believe this.

763
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:16,188
What?

764
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:22,102
You're finally ready
to admit you're attracted to me?

765
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:24,004
Thank God.
The sexual tension was unbearable.

766
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,271
Ew! Gross. God.

767
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,710
- You?
- All right, easy.

768
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:31,578
A simple no would've sufficed.
The captain has feelings, you know?

769
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:34,607
All right, Jack, there has been
another sighting of this creature.

770
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,710
And now supposedly CNE
is running footage of it.

771
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:38,846
Really? Wow.

772
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:42,450
- How gullible do you think I am?
- Look, this isn't a joke, I swear.

773
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:44,653
Just, please, warn the audience.

774
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,129
- Okay, I'll warn them.
- (music turns off)

775
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:49,860
Attention all hands.
This is your captain speaking.

776
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,336
We're getting more reports about this
half shark, half octopus creature

777
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,464
that's terrorizing the coast,
but please do not panic.

778
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:58,974
There is a way
we can stop this thing.

779
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,840
Virgin sacrifices.

780
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:03,209
Yes, the Mexican Fish
and Game Commission assures me

781
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,510
the only way to appease
this beast

782
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,143
is to offer it a beautiful virgin,

783
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:10,483
preferably 18 to 25 years old.

784
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,148
I repeat...
sharktopus wants our virgins.

785
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,215
So all prospective candidates,

786
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:17,692
please email your photos,
preferably nudes,

787
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:20,720
to Captain Jack
at pvpirateradio. Com.

788
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:23,460
I wish there was another way.
I'm sorry.

789
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,492
This is our only hope.
Damn you, sharktopus!

790
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,527
(laughs)

791
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,506
(music turns on)

792
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,407
Oh, what?
Don't look at me like that.

793
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:37,839
Oh!

794
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,818
How can you live
with yourself?

795
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,949
- You're not punking me on this thing?
- No.

796
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:51,085
Stephie, this has to be a hoax, okay?
It's gotta be.

797
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:54,962
There's no way a shark-octopus
fishy thingy really exists.

798
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:57,865
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Trust me, okay?

799
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:01,234
There is no such thing
as a sharktopus.

800
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:03,739
(screaming)

801
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:15,474
- (thuds)
- Gotta love these Mexican roads.

802
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,214
Where are we?

803
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:19,688
Please,
just keep your eyes on the road.

804
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:23,284
Shame on you if you kill us
before sharktopus does.

805
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:45,447
Honey, why don't we go back
to the resort?

806
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,474
Not until I hook a fish.

807
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:51,510
You still worried about
that shark we saw?

808
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:53,455
It wasn't a shark.

809
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,323
Look, babe, relax.
It's a big ocean.

810
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:58,850
No matter what it was,

811
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:00,590
we're not gonna see it again.

812
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:09,729
(water splashes)

813
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,181
(whistles)

814
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:30,716
What are we doing here?

815
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:33,821
- We're two miles off the last signal.
- Check your map.

816
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:37,732
You'll notice the distance between
S-11's attacks are nearly equal.

817
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:40,532
How did you figure this out?

818
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,470
Back at Los Arcos

819
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:44,133
I wasn't sure.

820
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:45,505
And now you are?

821
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:49,945
Nope, but I'm sick and tired of chasing
the freak around all day.

822
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,710
So if I'm right, it'll come to us.

823
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,240
You're in no condition for diving.

824
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:56,718
Wasn't planning on it.

825
00:57:56,753 --> 00:57:59,085
We can lure S-11 to the surface
without using the tranqs.

826
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:01,249
And how do we do that?

827
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,757
- Ugh!
- What?

828
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,893
You've never seen five gallons
of fish guts before?

829
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,248
- (reel clicking)
- Whoa!

830
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,582
Come here.

831
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,250
Good!
Did you get a fish?

832
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:38,386
Come on.

833
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:40,419
(grunting)
Come on!

834
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:42,658
Come on.

835
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:44,530
Come on.
Come on.

836
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:49,967
(laughs)

837
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,371
Got you.

838
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:52,739
I can't believe you bought that.

839
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,903
- Estupido.
- Oh, estupido? How about now?

840
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:56,913
- How about now, honey?
- No. No.

841
00:58:56,947 --> 00:58:59,780
How about now, honey?
Huh? Huh? How about now?

842
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,788
(screaming)

843
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:21,062
Kevin!
Kevin, where are you?

844
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:25,438
Kevin!
Kevin!

845
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:28,501
Kevin, where are you?

846
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:31,309
Kevin! Oh my God.

847
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:33,680
- Kevin!
- (S-11 growls)

848
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:36,618
(screaming)

849
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,509
Flynn.

850
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:12,020
Over there.

851
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:13,215
Get us over there.

852
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:17,555
No, the chum's working.
S-11's coming to us.

853
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:21,387
(pinging)

854
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:35,567
Nicole: S-11 has gone off the grid.
The software is glitching.

855
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:49,985
Damn, lost the signal.

856
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:01,935
(screaming)

857
01:01:01,972 --> 01:01:03,872
- No.
- Santos!

858
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,374
Nicole: Santos!

859
01:01:05,408 --> 01:01:08,377
- Santos!
- Help me!

860
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:11,869
- Flynn: I got you, buddy.
- Santos, hold on. Don't let go.

861
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:15,180
- (S-11 growls)
- Santos: Flynn!

862
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:17,015
Nicole: Hold on!

863
01:01:17,053 --> 01:01:19,283
Santos:
Flynn! Shoot it, Flynn!

864
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:21,813
- Damn you, you freak.
- Shoot it with a dart.

865
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:24,383
- Shoot it with a dart.
- I can't, it's jammed. Don't let go.

866
01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:26,793
Don't let go. Don't let go.
Don't let go.

867
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:29,890
- Don't let...
- (groaning)

868
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:33,060
- No!
- Santos!

869
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,968
- (Santos screams)
- Flynn: No!

870
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:41,100
(crunching)

871
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:46,113
Santos!

872
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:50,744
(screams)

873
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,391
No!

874
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,624
Andy.

875
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:42,331
It knew
we were setting up an ambush.

876
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,431
It knew.

877
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:48,403
What are you doing?

878
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:50,970
What I should've done
from the beginning.

879
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:53,005
(motor starts)

880
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,006
Take the wheel.

881
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:40,992
Get that.

882
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:45,234
- (shouting)
- Right.

883
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:55,143
Where is it?

884
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:57,510
I don't know.
It was right in front of us.

885
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:59,572
Check the trace.

886
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:15,457
Whoa!

887
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:29,206
You okay?

888
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:32,775
Yeah.

889
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:38,420
Andy, look.

890
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:41,719
It's heading for the resort.

891
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:44,818
Great.

892
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:47,455
(motor sputters)

893
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,758
It must've damaged the propellers.

894
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:56,237
No no, damn it!

895
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,008
(cell phone rings)

896
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:03,012
Nicole, what's happening?

897
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,606
S-11 just killed Santos.

898
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:07,582
It's moving ashore.

899
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:10,609
- Has it been harmed?
- What?

900
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:13,747
Has S-11 been harmed?

901
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,953
Listen to me, you arrogant bastard.
Santos was my best friend, all right?

902
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:19,928
Emotion is blinding, Mr. Flynn.

903
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:22,693
This is bigger than Santos.
It's bigger than you.

904
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:25,064
Yeah, I'll think about that when
I'm drowning your freak in bullets.

905
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:28,764
I have $1 million
that says you won't do that.

906
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,797
One million
to bring S-11 back to me.

907
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:35,038
What do you say?
What do you say?

908
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:38,479
- Keep your money.
- (hangs up)

909
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:48,452
Sir, we've got Commander Cox
on the satellite link again.

910
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:51,187
Uh...

911
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:53,252
patch him in.

912
01:05:53,296 --> 01:05:56,390
What's the news, Sands?
Did you catch our fish yet?

913
01:05:56,432 --> 01:05:59,196
It's my fish.

914
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:01,829
- And we're closing in on it.
- Not good enough.

915
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,668
You need to bag that thing now.

916
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,436
If you can't do it,
I'll send a team in to terminate it.

917
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:09,240
- Shut up.
- It can be there in an hour,

918
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,510
turn that freak of yours into chowder
and leave no sign it ever existed.

919
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,846
Shut up!

920
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:18,843
- Sands. Sands!
- Cut him off. Cut him off!

921
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:21,880
- What's going on?
- Son of a bitch.

922
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:33,194
- Find a place to dock this thing.
- Sir?

923
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:37,195
Move. Contact Briggs.
Tell him to get a car ready.

924
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,003
Go!

925
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:54,153
(motor sputtering)

926
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,091
Flynn: The engine's toast.
That's all she's got left.

927
01:06:57,126 --> 01:07:00,493
Come on. Come on, baby.
You can make it.

928
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,640
Andy, wait. Talk to me.

929
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:24,346
I am done talking.

930
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:34,890
(crowd cheering)

931
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:38,166
- (dance music playing)
- Woman: Ladies and gentlemen,

932
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:40,965
presenting
the Puerto Vallarta Dancers.

933
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:34,356
Tell me we can find them.

934
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,484
Yes sir. We're tracking the GPS
in your daughter's computer.

935
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:43,357
Honestly, Mr. Sands, I don't think
that's gonna be enough to stop S-11.

936
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,833
It's not for S-11.

937
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:52,207
Which way?

938
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:59,612
- Woman: Oh my God.
- That's great.

939
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:11,183
(S-11 growls)

940
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:23,672
- Is that part of the show?
- I don't know.

941
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:26,334
- Cool, Dad. Look.
- Oh my God!

942
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,706
(screaming)

943
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,873
(roars)

944
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,441
(screaming)

945
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:37,748
(bones cracking)

946
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:40,889
(grunting)

947
01:09:49,499 --> 01:09:52,866
- Oh man!
- (screaming)

948
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:55,393
That way.

949
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,563
(screaming)

950
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,636
Dude, that's awesome.

951
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:08,073
- (screaming)
- Move. Move!

952
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:11,443
(screaming)

953
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:16,985
- Eat this, you bastard.
- (gunfire)

954
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:22,825
(S-11 howls)

955
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:28,699
(grunts)
You can't hide.

956
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:30,729
I'll find you.

957
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,682
- Damn it.
- Where does this channel lead?

958
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:45,186
Where are you going?

959
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:48,850
I might be able to head it off
before it reaches the river.

960
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,160
Okay, if S-11 wants upriver
it has to pass by here.

961
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:57,597
Check the trace.

962
01:11:02,838 --> 01:11:05,363
(typing)

963
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:08,536
Come on, come on.

964
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:11,069
There's no signal.

965
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:12,978
Damn it.

966
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:14,676
What about them?

967
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:20,214
Excuse me.
Excuse me, everyone.

968
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:22,554
There's a killer shark-octopus
hybrid headed this way.

969
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:26,392
So please leave the marina
in a timely fashion.

970
01:11:26,429 --> 01:11:29,523
- What are you talking about? No.
- No?

971
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:32,159
- Okay, how about this?
- (gunfire)

972
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:33,691
(screaming)

973
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:40,875
- You enjoyed that way too much.
- It worked, didn't it?

974
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:51,347
Mr. Flynn!

975
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,321
Tell me, Mr. Flynn,

976
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:56,655
when did you become
such a people person?

977
01:11:58,027 --> 01:11:59,688
Dad, what are you doing?

978
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:02,197
Last chance for you
to reconsider my offer.

979
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:05,894
Or what?
Your boys gonna shoot me down?

980
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:11,534
What's your life compared
to a miracle of science?

981
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:14,338
- Dad, don't do this.
- Baby girl, my SUV's in the parking lot.

982
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:17,073
Go wait for me there.

983
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,446
No.

984
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,076
I'm not your little girl anymore.

985
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:25,383
Andy's right.

986
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:27,753
S-11 needs to be put down.

987
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:31,055
- You don't know what you're saying.
- S-11's a crime against nature.

988
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:33,584
- We went too far.
- It can be controlled, baby.

989
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:35,290
You know that.

990
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:39,458
At what price?

991
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:42,437
How many more lives
are you gonna sacrifice?

992
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:44,405
What about my life?

993
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,034
Oh, baby.

994
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:50,534
S-11 is my creation.

995
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,240
Mine.

996
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:54,476
I dedicated my entire life to it.

997
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:57,315
I will not allow anyone
to destroy it.

998
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:01,787
Not even you.

999
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,491
(sonar pinging)

1000
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,795
- What?
- Dad, it's here.

1001
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:12,960
- Come on!
- (S-11 bellows)

1002
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,681
(screaming)

1003
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,588
No. No!

1004
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,647
- (Sands grunts)
- Dad!

1005
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:43,196
Nicole:
Oh my God! No!

1006
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:46,633
(growls)

1007
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:48,796
(screaming)

1008
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:52,365
No, Dad! Help me!

1009
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:55,104
- No! Dad!
- Nicole!

1010
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:56,975
No no!

1011
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:59,003
- Nicole, no.
- Help me!

1012
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:03,715
- Dad, be careful. No!
- (gunshots)

1013
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:11,351
Dad!

1014
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:13,020
(whimpers)

1015
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:16,354
(groans)

1016
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:20,031
Nicole: No!

1017
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:22,333
Dad!

1018
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:27,332
(moans)

1019
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:30,675
- (gagging) Nicole.
- Dad!

1020
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:34,672
- Nicole. Nicole.
- Dad.

1021
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,777
- Kill... kill swi... kill swi...
- What?

1022
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:41,654
- Dad.
- You can still...

1023
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,250
What?

1024
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:46,523
I love you, pumpkin.

1025
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:51,856
No.

1026
01:15:12,555 --> 01:15:14,523
(crying)

1027
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:16,388
(kisses)

1028
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,754
I'm sorry, Nicole.

1029
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,738
I've gotta go after it.

1030
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:41,238
Someone will come for you.

1031
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,421
Andy, wait.

1032
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:12,171
- This is the place.
- You said that the last three stops.

1033
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:15,581
This map is useless.
We should call it quits for today.

1034
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:18,348
We call it quits
when I say we call it quits.

1035
01:16:19,889 --> 01:16:22,653
Hey, it's the guy
from the speedboat.

1036
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:26,127
The one following the sharktopus.
Come on.

1037
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,162
The river narrows a few miles south,
so we just need to get a pair of wheels.

1038
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,791
All right.

1039
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:36,267
I'm Stacy Everheart with CNE.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?

1040
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:37,363
Get out of my face, lady.

1041
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,840
What connection do you have to
the creature known as the sharktopus?

1042
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,503
Are you employed
by the Blue Water Corporation?

1043
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:44,011
You got a car?

1044
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:45,638
- Yeah.
- Gimme the keys.

1045
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,479
You're going after that thing,
aren't you?

1046
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:50,007
Take me with you,
and you can use my van.

1047
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:53,886
- No.
- Then have fun walking.

1048
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:09,033
(thudding)

1049
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,835
Gotta love Mexican roads, huh?

1050
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:21,246
What are you planning?

1051
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:24,912
The river bottlenecks upstream.
I'll cut it off there.

1052
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:27,752
- What about my story?
- No names, no interviews.

1053
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,020
Then what the hell do I get?

1054
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:33,927
Exclusive footage
of sharktopus getting shot to hell.

1055
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:46,470
Man: Hey!

1056
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:53,678
Yeah!

1057
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,641
Whoo!

1058
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,058
Hey, guys.
Can I get you anything?

1059
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,091
Are you finished?

1060
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,126
(roaring)

1061
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,150
Jack, be careful.
Not too close to the edge.

1062
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:49,569
Whoo-hoo!

1063
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:02,774
(roaring)

1064
01:19:03,852 --> 01:19:07,288
Mom! Mom!

1065
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:11,583
Help me!
Help me!

1066
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:14,755
Help me, please!
Somebody please help me.

1067
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:23,130
Woman:
Jack! Jack!

1068
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:26,005
- Jack! Oh my God!
- (clamoring)

1069
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:35,382
(screaming)

1070
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,278
No! Jack!

1071
01:19:45,127 --> 01:19:46,958
Oh my God.
Jack!

1072
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:50,455
(people screaming)

1073
01:19:56,572 --> 01:19:58,563
(screaming)

1074
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:12,148
Looks like we're late to the party.

1075
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:15,987
Great, I've got no bullets left
and we're out of grenades.

1076
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:18,515
- You could use this.
- Nicole, we're past that.

1077
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,121
Wait. Hear me out.
S-11 has a kill switch...

1078
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:23,893
explosives laced
into its neural implants.

1079
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:26,457
But the switch became inoperable
when S-11's bioware was damaged.

1080
01:20:26,502 --> 01:20:28,026
Then what good is it?

1081
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,504
My dad...

1082
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,166
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

1083
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:35,870
I think I can access the kill switch
with my computer.

1084
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:38,880
- Bones. Bones.
- What?

1085
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:41,178
I think it's over there.
Come on, let's go.

1086
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,616
But only if we establish a link
with the interface dart.

1087
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:46,712
We're gonna blow up
S-11's brains,

1088
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:50,191
but we can only establish a link
if we get close enough

1089
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,386
to the interface dart and S-11.

1090
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:54,395
(sighs)
Okay.

1091
01:20:54,429 --> 01:20:57,159
So in other words, what you're trying to
say is that I've gotta tag that mother

1092
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,158
with an interface dart and you've gotta
be close enough to blow it to hell?

1093
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:04,366
Yeah, that's the plan.

1094
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:08,299
Better than no plan.

1095
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:13,606
Please help me find my son.
He's missing!

1096
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:15,640
Calm down.
What's his name?

1097
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:17,276
Mom!

1098
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:20,254
- I got him. Stay here.
- He'll be fine. Just calm down, okay?

1099
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,624
(whimpering)
Please.

1100
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:28,826
I cannot believe that
you didn't get that shot.

1101
01:21:28,864 --> 01:21:30,491
I am sick of your attitude.

1102
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:32,591
You know what?
I'm tired about you.

1103
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:35,296
I'm tired about the work.

1104
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:37,100
Just go on your way
and I'm going on my way.

1105
01:21:37,139 --> 01:21:39,300
- Fine.
- Boy: Mom!

1106
01:21:39,341 --> 01:21:41,571
(crying)

1107
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:46,677
Jack. Jack, come here.
Come to me, buddy. It's okay.

1108
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:48,740
Come on.
Trust me, it's okay.

1109
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:51,184
Jack, come on.
Come to me. It's all right.

1110
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:54,280
Give me your hand.
There you go. There you go.

1111
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:57,190
Yeah, let's go, buddy.
I got you.

1112
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:58,454
Yeah.
Yeah, come here.

1113
01:21:58,493 --> 01:22:01,428
I got you.
I got you. Let's go.

1114
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:04,193
(crying) Jack!

1115
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,134
Here. It's the last one
so you better not miss.

1116
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:18,908
I've been missing all day
and I'm getting tired of it.

1117
01:22:18,947 --> 01:22:21,677
Now go over there.
It'll be safer.

1118
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:23,685
No, I'm staying with you.

1119
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:26,847
Nicole, go over there
and get your mojo ready.

1120
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:29,322
I'm gonna draw it to you.
Go!

1121
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:40,890
Bones!
Bones, where the hell are you?

1122
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:42,904
God.

1123
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:47,798
Oh my God.

1124
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:00,447
(S-11 growls)

1125
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:05,354
Oh God.

1126
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:10,489
Oh God.
Oh my God!

1127
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:18,206
(screaming)

1128
01:23:26,682 --> 01:23:28,673
(gurgling)

1129
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:41,624
(S-11 roars)

1130
01:23:41,663 --> 01:23:43,187
Got you, you mother.

1131
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,131
(beeps)

1132
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:08,980
Whoa!

1133
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,441
Nicole!

1134
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:37,909
(grunts)
Nicole, hurry!

1135
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,683
Nicole!

1136
01:24:40,722 --> 01:24:43,486
I got it.
Anytime now, Nicole.

1137
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,155
Oh, Dad, what did you do?

1138
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:52,994
I hope you choke
on me, you freak.

1139
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:56,130
Come on!

1140
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:59,834
(grunting)

1141
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,866
Oh my God.

1142
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:07,373
(Flynn screaming)

1143
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:13,954
Hold on.

1144
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,126
(Flynn screaming)

1145
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,168
Oh, Dad.

1146
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:35,336
Nicole!

1147
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:37,208
Okay, I got it.

1148
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:43,842
(growling)

1149
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:47,184
(Flynn screaming)

1150
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:58,693
Oh my God.
(panting)

1151
01:26:06,374 --> 01:26:09,400
Nicole:
Impressive. You need help?

1152
01:26:09,444 --> 01:26:11,207
I'll live.

1153
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:14,044
That thing better not
jump out at us again.

1154
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:16,880
No, that only happens
in the movies.

1155
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:18,909
(laughs)
Yeah.

1156
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:30,688
