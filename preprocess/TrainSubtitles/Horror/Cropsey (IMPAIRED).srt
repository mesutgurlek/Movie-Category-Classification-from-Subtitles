1
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,068
Growing up on staten island,

2
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,536
Barbara and I had often heard

3
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,472
The legend of cropsey.

4
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,507
For the kids in our

5
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,008
Neighborhood, cropsey was the

6
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,611
Escaped mental patient who lived

7
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,179
In the tunnels beneath the old,

8
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,614
Abandoned willowbrook mental

9
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,750
Institution...

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,519
Who would come out late at night

11
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,786
And snatch children off the

12
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,723
Streets.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,060
Although we didn't know each

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,929
Other as children, Barbara and I

15
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,431
Had both shared versions of the

16
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,797
Cropsey legend as it filtered

17
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:05,833
Through our separate

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,234
Neighborhoods and seeped into

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,768
Our collective fears.

20
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,938
Sometimes cropsey had a hook for

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:11,639
A hand.

22
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,740
Other times he wielded a bloody

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,207
Ax.

24
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,742
But it didn't matter.

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,777
Cropsey was out there, lurking

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,846
In the shadows, waiting to get

27
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,615
Us.

28
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,751
We're... we're gonna get her

29
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,285
Back.

30
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,154
[ Sobbing ]

31
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:29,422
Okay.

32
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,891
Later, as teenagers, we

33
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,425
Assumed cropsey was just an

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,195
Urban legend, a cautionary tale

35
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,796
Used to keep us out of those

36
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,430
Buildings... to stop us from

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,998
Doing all those things that

38
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,335
Teenagers like to do.

39
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,771
But all that changed the summer

40
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,674
Little Jennifer disappeared.

41
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,341
That was the summer all the kids

42
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,842
From staten island discovered

43
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,012
That their urban legend...

44
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,947
Was real.

45
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,047
Staten island is one of the five

46
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,484
Boroughs of New York City.

47
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,150
For the past century, the island

48
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,619
Was mostly just farmland and

49
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,255
Woods...

50
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,089
That was, until they built the

51
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,624
Verrazano bridge in '64.

52
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,459
Now it's home to nearly half a

53
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,596
Million people.

54
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,030
Before the verrazano bridge

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,400
Was built, that's all it was.

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,767
It was just this island, this

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,667
Forgotten island.

58
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,035
All the children of Brooklyn,

59
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,570
You know, wanted their own home,

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,772
And everybody wants land.

61
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,240
You have a dog, you let him out

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
The backyard, just like, you

63
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,943
Know, "father knows best."

64
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,312
It can be pretty quiet.

65
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,813
I mean, even though Manhattan

66
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,179
Is, like, right across the

67
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,448
Water, it's definitely a

68
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,350
Different life out here.

69
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,720
If you travel around sometimes,

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,953
People would say, "oh, right",

71
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,288
That's where the largest garbage

72
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:15,788
Dump was.

73
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,089
And, you know, rumor has it you

74
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,391
"Could see it from outer space."

75
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,894
So one big garbage dump.

76
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,864
It was the least-populated,

77
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,732
Most heavily wooded borough.

78
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,635
From what I understand, like,

79
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,736
This is a big dumping ground for

80
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,638
Mob bodies.

81
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,705
Someone needs to be disposed of,

82
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,741
It's like, "let's bring them to"

83
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,977
Staten island."

84
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,578
It's like there's almost too

85
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,980
Many spaces to go to to be

86
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,349
Isolated and alone and do

87
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,383
Whatever you want.

88
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,851
So if you have a bad idea in

89
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:48,220
Your head, you can do it there.

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,357
Across the middle of the

91
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,657
Island lies a section of ancient

92
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,861
Forest known as the greenbelt.

93
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,563
Bordering this forest is a

94
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,229
Boy scout camp and an old

95
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,300
Tuberculosis ward.

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,670
As kids, we used to roam around

97
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,070
These grounds, trying to scare

98
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,439
Each other with stories about

99
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,941
Cropsey.

100
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,209
Is that pouch camp over

101
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:09,877
To the left?

102
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,311
No, that's jcc camp over to

103
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,879
The left.

104
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,480
And right here... this is

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,115
Sea view, the t.B. Wards.

106
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,984
Our camp counselors would lead

107
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,819
Us down this path, and they'd

108
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,653
Come out of the buildings and

109
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,124
Scare us.

110
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,626
You know, this is where we

111
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,460
Thought that cropsey lived... in

112
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,261
The basements down in here and

113
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,730
In these other buildings.

114
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,433
And, you know, we used to walk

115
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,701
Through here, and you'd find

116
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,037
Beds and papers of people who

117
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,304
Had died here.

118
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,608
So, you know, it kind of made

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,411
Sense to us.

120
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:46,046
"Cropsey," for some reason,

121
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,616
Became the generic term for a

122
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,385
Maniac in boy scout camps up and

123
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:56,155
Down the Hudson river region of

124
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,757
New York state.

125
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,726
So it would've made perfect

126
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,595
Sense for a story about a

127
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,864
Maniac who was hiding out in the

128
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,365
Woods and who abducted and

129
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,934
Killed little children to be

130
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:07,901
Called cropsey.

131
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,603
First learned about cropsey

132
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,570
In summer camp.

133
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,705
He was a doctor.

134
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,305
He was supposed to have a

135
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:13,774
Hook.

136
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,508
With a knife about this big.

137
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,110
And he was an ax-wielding

138
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,777
Madman.

139
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,379
The wife was killed.

140
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,080
He was being chased or

141
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,814
Taunted.

142
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,116
He wanted kids.

143
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,119
And he would find them and...

144
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,121
He would hack you up.

145
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,021
Chop 'em up.

146
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,691
"Don't go behind the Sherwood"

147
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,191
Bunks.

148
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,392
"Cropsey's out there."

149
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,061
"Make sure you get off at the"

150
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,528
Mall.

151
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,828
Don't continue to go any

152
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,295
"Further."

153
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,565
"Don't go down by the lake at"

154
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:37,965
Night.

155
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,899
"Cropsey's down there."

156
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,766
"No, don't go near"

157
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,534
Willowbrook park.

158
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,835
"Willowbrook park is dangerous."

159
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,204
There are many communities

160
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,239
That have a subterranean

161
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,109
History, a house where

162
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,545
Unspeakable things are said to

163
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,914
Have happened, an institution

164
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,917
Where people were...

165
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,986
Segregated from the rest of

166
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,454
Society.

167
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,757
We got pictures of sea view.

168
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,192
These are like overall,

169
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,960
Bird's-eye view of, you know,

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,860
The hospital.

171
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,696
This included the tuberculosis

172
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,230
Wards.

173
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,999
This included tuberculosis

174
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:12,565
Wards?

175
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,166
Yes.

176
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,967
And also on this property here

177
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,804
Were a hospital for contagious

178
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,539
Diseases, and then it got the

179
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,139
Morgue and the cemetery.

180
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,208
Well, this was across the street

181
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,111
In the farm colony, which was

182
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,946
Like a different part of the

183
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,680
Hospital.

184
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,881
They called it the "poor farm."

185
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,518
Okay, here we have theor farm."

186
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,985
Halloran hospital in

187
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,053
Willowbrook.

188
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,320
Right. It was halloran, and

189
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,187
Then it became the

190
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,288
Willowbrook state school.

191
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:36,856
Exactly.

192
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,190
Willowbrook was strictly for

193
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,959
The mentally ill?

194
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:45,698
Yes.

195
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,067
Back in 1972, the

196
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,401
Willowbrook state school was the

197
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,672
Subject of a famous exposé by a

198
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,840
Young reporter looking for his

199
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,909
Big break.

200
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,111
I first heard of this big

201
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,378
Place with the pretty-sounding

202
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,446
Name because of a call I

203
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,681
Received from a member of the

204
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,583
Willowbrook staff, a

205
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,783
Dr. Michael Wilkins.

206
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,385
The doctor invited me to see

207
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,020
The conditions he was talking

208
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,488
About, so unannounced and

209
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,890
Unexpected by the school

210
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,324
Administration, we toured

211
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,692
Building number six.

212
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,694
The doctor had warned me that it

213
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,662
Would be bad.

214
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,797
It was horrible.

215
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,532
There was one attendant for

216
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,067
Perhaps 50 severely and

217
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,901
Profoundly retarded children.

218
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,703
Lying on the floor naked and

219
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,539
Smeared with their own feces,

220
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,206
They were making a pitiful

221
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,109
Sound, a kind of mournful wail

222
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,011
That it's impossible for me to

223
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,546
Forget.

224
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,114
This is what it looked like.

225
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,748
This is what it sounded like.

226
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,551
But how can I tell you about the

227
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,484
Way it smelled?

228
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,220
It smelled of filth, it smelled

229
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,854
Of disease, and it smelled of

230
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,791
Death.

231
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,004
Despite Geraldo's report, it

232
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,740
Still took more than 10 years

233
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,540
Before authorities began

234
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,809
Shutting down willowbrook.

235
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,612
Many patients were transferred

236
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,478
To group homes, but others were

237
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,381
Left to fend for themselves.

238
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,517
There are those who believe that

239
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,585
Some patients, out of confusion

240
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,487
And habit, returned to the 365

241
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,323
Acres of willowbrook to roam the

242
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,092
Abandoned buildings and live in

243
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,628
The tunnel system that lay

244
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,962
Underneath.

245
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,932
Out of this, our own version of

246
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,434
The cropsey legend was born.

247
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,901
At what point, though, in

248
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,269
Your life did you start to

249
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,872
Realize, "hey, maybe cropsey is"

250
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,372
Real?"

251
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,472
When kids started

252
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,541
Disappearing from staten island.

253
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,010
You're watching channel 7,

254
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,545
Eyewitness news.

255
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,714
Hi, guys. Listen.

256
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,349
We need all the help we can to

257
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,449
Help find Jennifer.

258
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,085
The relentless search for a

259
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,552
12-year-old girl with down

260
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,155
Syndrome continues today as it

261
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,757
Has for the last three weeks,

262
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,423
With the hope that this will be

263
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:52,458
The day they find

264
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,393
Jennifer schweiger.

265
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,535
She's very friendly, very

266
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,036
Happy.

267
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,473
She's a doll.

268
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,775
Very loving.

269
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,143
You know, that's a down syndrome

270
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,445
Child's nature.

271
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,713
Instead of lying in the sun

272
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,082
Today, I figured I'd come out

273
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:15,849
And just help.

274
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,083
Could be one of our own

275
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,418
Children, you know, that was

276
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,354
Kidnapped or, you know, molested

277
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:21,954
Anyways.

278
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,490
Maybe it's Jennifer's added

279
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,957
Vulnerability of having down

280
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,226
Syndrome or possibly the

281
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,427
Close-knit feelings of

282
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,961
Staten islanders at having one

283
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,497
Of their children missing, but

284
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,799
Every day, more and more

285
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,333
Volunteers turn out, searching

286
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,835
Through the woods and hitting

287
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,336
The streets, hoping to put an

288
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,738
End to the schweiger family

289
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,504
Ordeal.

290
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,708
So many people turned out for

291
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,809
This search.

292
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,511
Everybody felt that...

293
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,847
This was one of their own that

294
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,480
Had disappeared.

295
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,116
They would show up at the

296
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,884
Firehouse with flashlights,

297
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,754
Ready to go into willowbrook,

298
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,655
Willing to go into the forest,

299
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,925
Into the tunnels underneath.

300
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,458
There was one family in

301
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,660
Particular, Donna cutugno, and

302
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,929
Some of her friends and

303
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,563
Neighbors who had stepped

304
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,734
Forward to organize searches.

305
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,201
Today, we're concentrating on

306
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,069
Willowbrook park.

307
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,237
The police went in there

308
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,404
Yesterday, and we're just

309
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,872
Continuing where the police left

310
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,240
Off.

311
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,674
This is what willowbrook looked

312
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,909
Like when we were in here.

313
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,376
I'll never forget the first time

314
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,478
I went into one of these

315
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,913
Buildings.

316
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,548
It was really blood-curdling,

317
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,283
Because here was the first time

318
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,650
I was actually in these

319
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,385
Buildings I heard these horrible

320
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,887
Stories about.

321
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,521
And as you walk through,

322
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,724
Completely empty.

323
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,591
You still hear, you feel it.

324
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,261
You could almost feel the

325
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,095
Children's presence there or

326
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,398
The adults' presence there.

327
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,835
And it's something you never get

328
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:42,469
Used to.

329
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,204
When you're looking, make sure

330
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,839
You look down on the ground.

331
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,106
Look up in the trees.

332
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,809
Anything you find, the police

333
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,410
Can get a lot of information

334
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,077
From it.

335
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,846
In our searching, what we found

336
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,815
Was a number of people that

337
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,582
Actually lived here when

338
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,752
Willowbrook was up and running

339
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,720
And in full swing tend to come

340
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,822
Back here.

341
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,023
So there was a whole...

342
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,691
Underground of people that still

343
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,326
Lived here, even though all the

344
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,728
Buildings were closed, and

345
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,097
Andre rand was definitely

346
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,931
One of them.

347
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,265
Andre rand worked as an

348
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,101
Orderly at the

349
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,568
Willowbrook state school from

350
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,605
1966 to 1968.

351
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,273
For years he lived in numerous

352
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,008
Makeshift campsites in the woods

353
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,210
Surrounding willowbrook.

354
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,178
He was also the lead suspect in

355
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,014
The Jennifer schweiger case.

356
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,983
There was two witnesses that

357
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,018
Stated that they saw her walking

358
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,221
Along the street with a

359
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,722
Middle-aged gentleman, and he

360
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,291
Had a female green bike with a

361
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,159
Basket on the front of it.

362
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,061
The week before, I was in

363
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,996
Shoprite, and I saw rand.

364
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,165
I recognized him from a prior

365
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:46,800
Case.

366
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,903
He purchased baby food, and he

367
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,703
Got on a green female bike with

368
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,040
A basket on the front.

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,606
At that point, bam, I said,

370
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,442
"It's Andre.

371
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,709
I saw him last week."

372
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,346
Rand was immediately brought

373
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,780
In and questioned in the girl's

374
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,615
Disappearance but released for

375
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,616
Lack of evidence.

376
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,318
After four weeks of surveillance

377
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,820
In hopes of finding Jennifer

378
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,989
Alive, he was arrested.

379
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,691
Rand had been familiar to police

380
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,360
After pleading guilty to sexual

381
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,862
Misconduct with a 9-year-old

382
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,865
Girl back in 1969... a crime

383
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,333
Which he denied.

384
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,368
Good afternoon.

385
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,669
Here's what's happening.

386
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,070
A homeless man, 43-year-old

387
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,571
Andre rand, is under arrest.

388
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,772
He is charged with the

389
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,074
Kidnapping of 12-year-old

390
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,008
Jennifer schweiger.

391
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,343
The suspect was picked up last

392
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,210
Night here at the

393
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,345
Church of the God within.

394
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,612
Police had questioned him as

395
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,015
Early as the second day into the

396
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,316
Investigation, and after four

397
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,716
Weeks of a making a case against

398
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,019
The man, they finally decided

399
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,087
They had enough to get a

400
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,521
Conviction.

401
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,255
I've never seen a perp walk like

402
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:43,722
That.

403
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,425
Watching him coming out looking

404
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,961
Like he had lost his mind

405
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,830
Further angered people in the

406
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,865
Community.

407
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,967
That image forced a lot of

408
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,135
People to say, "that is the"

409
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:56,937
Killer.

410
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,770
That man is not right.

411
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,840
"Look at him there, drooling."

412
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,410
And it certainly caused me to

413
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,011
Ask a lot of questions.

414
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,312
Who is Andre rand?

415
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,181
Did they get a crazy man and

416
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,083
Just say he's the guy, or did

417
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,085
They really have good evidence

418
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,087
Against him that would stick in

419
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,355
A court?

420
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,689
I used to teach the

421
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,990
Andre rand story in my

422
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,092
Journalism class.

423
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,692
Coming down the steps of the

424
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,229
Courthouse with a headline,

425
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,031
"Drifter arrested."

426
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,432
Well, what does that mean?

427
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,698
It means guilty, right?

428
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,200
Whether he is or not, I don't

429
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,701
Know the whole story either.

430
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,270
But it's a lot easier to do it

431
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,906
That way than to say, "you know"

432
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:33,339
What?

433
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,840
It might be somebody on your

434
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,375
"Block."

435
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,143
[ Chuckles ]

436
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,709
"It might be somebody you work

437
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,311
With."

438
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,679
Did you ever think that

439
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,082
Anybody else was involved?

440
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,650
Well, we always had to think

441
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,317
There was somebody else until we

442
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,553
Could just rule it out.

443
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,753
You know, you always have to

444
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,956
Keep that in the back of your

445
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:49,321
Mind.

446
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,091
And plus, by going by our

447
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,993
Witnesses, if you consider our

448
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,928
Witnesses credible, it was only

449
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,228
Andre and Jennifer.

450
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,198
There was no other person.

451
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,900
Of course, when we had him

452
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,036
For the 26 hours, where was she?

453
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,904
Did he leave her with somebody

454
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,406
Else?

455
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,975
With rand's arrest, the

456
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,541
Search for Jennifer turned

457
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,310
Desperate.

458
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,878
Rumors were spreading that

459
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,445
Someone, maybe even one of

460
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,014
Rand's friends, was hiding

461
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,816
Jennifer and moving her late at

462
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,350
Night through the tunnels

463
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,751
Underneath willowbrook.

464
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,120
I want my daughter.

465
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,888
I want the man to talk.

466
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,691
I want him just to tell us where

467
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,727
Jennifer is.

468
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,328
Despite constant threats by

469
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,862
State officials to stay away

470
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,532
From willowbrook, Donna and the

471
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,134
Friends of Jennifer kept going

472
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,801
Back.

473
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,836
This area had been covered

474
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,405
Thousands of times by

475
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,574
Volunteers, by police, by dogs.

476
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,775
But in that time, one gentleman

477
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,677
Came across an area that he

478
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,679
Noticed had Clay balls up on

479
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,415
Top, like someone patted down.

480
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,218
And then this was all, you know,

481
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,053
Pushed back over with the trees.

482
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,753
It was just a little spot that

483
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,288
He noticed the Clay balls.

484
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,091
And that's what made us go back,

485
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,791
Or made him insist that we go

486
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,259
Back.

487
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,960
And George showed us the

488
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,166
Location that he thought...

489
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:11,603
Needed to be looked at.

490
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,005
The smell... as soon as you

491
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,075
Start digging...

492
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,179
We saw her toes.

493
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,217
And everybody stopped.

494
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,617
Father Henry gave her last

495
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,554
Rites.

496
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,796
And they took us out of the

497
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,864
Woods.

498
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,232
Ernie, a grisly discovery

499
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,733
Back here tonight, back here in

500
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,769
The 384 acres of the

501
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,104
Staten island developmental

502
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,371
Center... an arm and a leg

503
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,706
Sticking out from a shallow

504
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,174
Grave.

505
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,608
They are eerie shadows, police

506
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,009
And others at the scene where

507
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,178
The body of 12-year-old

508
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,679
Jennifer Lynn schweiger tonight

509
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,912
Was found.

510
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,347
Police were preventing anyone

511
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,848
From getting this close to the

512
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:57,316
Scene.

513
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,817
Even Jennifer's father is kept

514
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,251
Away.

515
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,653
Yeah, Jennifer's father's

516
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,020
Here.

517
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,622
He says you gave him permission

518
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:03,490
To come through?

519
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,823
Unless they can walk on

520
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,993
Water, they stay outside.

521
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,262
There are two other girls

522
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,497
Who, over the last couple of

523
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,797
Years, have turned up missing

524
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,832
Here on staten island.

525
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,233
They will be searching this area

526
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,634
In the next few days to see what

527
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,369
They can find.

528
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,637
As one police officer told us

529
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,937
Tonight, God knows what they

530
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,172
Can find here.

531
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,342
The discovery of Jennifer's

532
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,544
Body only 150 yards from rand's

533
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,646
Campsite confirmed everyone's

534
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,946
Worst nightmare.

535
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,981
Residents were outraged, and

536
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,517
They wanted justice.

537
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,720
The district attorney, however,

538
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,887
Had no physical evidence tying

539
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,423
Rand with Jennifer's

540
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,591
Disappearance.

541
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,560
The case was relying almost

542
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,229
Entirely on eyewitness

543
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,331
Testimony, which most experts

544
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,235
Agree is often unreliable.

545
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,369
After the largest criminal trial

546
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,371
In staten island history, rand

547
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:57,409
Was convicted of kidnapping.

548
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,611
But the murder charge was

549
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,079
Dismissed after jurors couldn't

550
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,515
Reach a verdict.

551
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,684
Rand was sentenced 25 years to

552
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,854
Life and would be eligible for

553
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,788
Parole in 2008.

554
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,832
Staten islanders like to find

555
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,701
Easy scapegoats, but not the

556
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,534
Real ones.

557
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,503
And we don't want to think too

558
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,606
Deeply about what this means for

559
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,539
Our society.

560
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,476
When you look at a place like

561
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,478
Staten island, it was viewed as

562
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,445
A dumping ground for all kinds

563
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,314
Of things.

564
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,316
The fresh kills landfill, which

565
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,185
Took all the city's garbage,

566
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,985
8 million people's garbage,

567
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,788
Dumped in staten island.

568
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,790
The farm colony was a place

569
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,658
Where people went who had

570
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,759
Tuberculosis.

571
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,094
Willowbrook warehoused thousands

572
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,264
Of people and left them there.

573
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,064
It was a dumping ground.

574
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,065
Why would you dump them in

575
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:54,701
Staten island?

576
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,768
'Cause that's where you dump

577
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,169
Things.

578
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:56,868
So you dump kids.

579
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:57,770
What's the difference?

580
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,905
You're dumping garbage, you're

581
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,038
Dumping kids to staten island.

582
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,106
Doesn't make any difference,

583
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,675
Right?

584
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:09,949
Look.

585
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,819
Trays from the institution.

586
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,754
They're everywhere.

587
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:29,202
It's more about the undercurrent

588
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,839
That cannot be tamed by building

589
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,442
Or organization.

590
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,142
You put a bunch of people that

591
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,910
Are mentally ill, and you put a

592
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,313
Bunch of people that are

593
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,913
Physically ill, and you bury

594
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,615
People here and there, and you

595
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,417
Dump garbage, and you poison the

596
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,085
Environment.

597
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,620
And then you sit around, and you

598
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,889
Scratch your head, and you

599
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,258
Wonder, "gee, why are things"

600
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:51,990
Going wrong?"

601
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,425
Or, "why is there a chill cast"

602
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,827
Over this staten island, this

603
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,728
"Wonderful place?"

604
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,928
Because it's about those

605
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,465
Undercurrents, those things that

606
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,532
Had come before.

607
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,200
As children, we were deluded

608
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,303
By our parents' belief that

609
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,704
Staten island was such a safe

610
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,938
Place to grow up.

611
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,440
But in reality, every community

612
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,809
Has a seedy underside.

613
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,979
Every suburbia has its secrets.

614
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,146
We only discovered our own

615
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,415
Because of what happened with

616
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,585
Jennifer...

617
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,851
And then with all the other

618
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:25,892
Children.

619
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,594
After Donna cutugno and her team

620
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,595
Found the body of

621
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,195
Jennifer schweiger, the police

622
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,697
Started connecting the dots.

623
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,198
They looked at other missing

624
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,700
Children from staten island.

625
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,303
Eventually, they focused in on

626
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,870
Four different cases spanning

627
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,273
Over 15 years...

628
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,008
Tiahease Jackson, a 10-year-old

629
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,709
Girl with learning disabilities

630
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,210
Who disappeared four years

631
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,380
Before Jennifer.

632
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,180
Hank gafforio, 21 but with the

633
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,549
I.Q. Of a 15-year-old,

634
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,352
Disappeared three years before

635
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,553
Jennifer.

636
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,356
7-year-old holly Ann Hughes, who

637
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,024
Went missing six years before

638
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,190
Jennifer.

639
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,260
And finally Alice pereira, last

640
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,896
Seen 1972, 15 years before

641
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,897
Jennifer.

642
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,065
To this day, none of their

643
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,837
Bodies have ever been found.

644
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,105
They are missing-person cases

645
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,706
That have occurred on

646
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,975
Staten island that have not been

647
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,312
Resolved.

648
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,447
As kids, we never thought

649
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,713
We'd learn the real story behind

650
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,850
Cropsey.

651
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,352
Instead, rand was sent to

652
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,985
Prison, and the stories just

653
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,856
Faded away.

654
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,557
But now, 20 years later, we may

655
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,159
Get the chance to uncover the

656
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,695
Truth behind our urban legend.

657
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,030
Because Andre rand...

658
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,369
Is back.

659
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,635
Andre rand scared a

660
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,036
Generation of parents and

661
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,538
Children on staten island.

662
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,206
Convicted in the disappearance

663
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,942
Of one child in the 1980s, he is

664
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,242
Once again on trial for

665
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,678
Kidnapping.

666
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,145
After spending 17 years in

667
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,882
Prison, Andre rand has returned

668
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,616
To staten island to stand trial

669
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,851
For the kidnapping of

670
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,119
7-year-old holly Ann Hughes, who

671
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,088
Disappeared two decades earlier.

672
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,957
Her body has never been found.

673
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,826
Can you tell us if you ever

674
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,160
Met holly Ann Hughes?

675
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,697
Any comment whatsoever, please.

676
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,164
I love my sister very much.

677
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,165
It's been 20 years.

678
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,533
[ Voice breaking ] Something

679
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,735
I've had to carry for an

680
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,836
Incredibly long time.

681
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,004
And I miss her so much.

682
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,538
You know, it's, like, nice to

683
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,873
See that finally she's being

684
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,375
Treated like she's a person and

685
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,710
Not like a lost wallet, you

686
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,109
Know?

687
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,645
That's pretty much like how it's

688
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,613
Been for like the last 20 years.

689
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,687
Staten island tonight, the

690
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,424
Story of another missing child.

691
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,790
7-year-old holly Hughes

692
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,258
Disappeared on Wednesday.

693
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,061
So far, no one has any idea what

694
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,630
Might have happened to her.

695
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,263
She's very outgoing, very

696
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:45,932
Friendly.

697
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,500
Very adorable, I think, you

698
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,469
Know.

699
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,870
We just want you to bring

700
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,806
Holly home... Today.

[ Voice breaking ] And we're...

702

We're looking for her, and we're

703
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,949
Going to get her back.

705
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,853
Okay.

706
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,256
This is Eddie, holly Ann, and

707
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,657
Sean.

708
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,994
She was a very warm little girl.

709
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,396
Typical 7-year-old.

710
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,198
You know, I mean, cute as a

711
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,832
Button.

712
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,300
You know, that's probably one of

713
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,636
The last things that you ever

714
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,036
Think about that could possibly

715
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,473
Happen, that somebody would take

716
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,039
Your daughter.

717
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,741
The mother and I weren't

718
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,410
Conversing at the time in a

719
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,044
Proper way because we were

720
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,947
Having a little custody problem

721
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,416
There during that separation

722
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,184
Period.

723
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,385
I remember just searching all

724
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,420
Night long.

725
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,690
I mean everywhere... the train

726
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,092
Trestle, park Avenue... anywhere

727
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,393
I could possibly think of where

728
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,562
She might be.

729
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,964
I was getting very strange phone

730
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,233
Calls from anonymous people that

731
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,103
They knew where holly Ann was.

732
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,837
Just crazy things, you know?

733
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,171
Unbelievable things.

734
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,440
But no one ever mentioned

735
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,774
Andre rand?

736
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,044
No.

737
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,646
Rand was interviewed and

738
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,214
Released back in 1981 after

739
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,849
Being spotted on holly Ann's

740
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,650
Street the day she disappeared.

741
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,285
Now, 20 years later, the d.A.

742
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,021
Finally believes he has enough

743
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,888
Evidence to get a conviction.

744
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,825
However, there is another issue

745
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,760
That concerns local residents.

746
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,594
Rand will be up for parole in

747
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,330
Less than four years, which

748
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,198
Means he may walk the streets

749
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,066
Once again.

750
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,035
We are here today in support

751

For holly Ann Hughes' family.

752
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,272
The common thread that we share

With the family is Andre rand,

754
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,278
The alleged...

755
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:40,912
Bad guy.

756
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,649
Does it make you angry that

757
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,215
This guy has been out there

758
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,018
Since holly Ann's disappearance,

759
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,520
And then your daughter was

760
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,055
Taken?

761
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,889
I think that in reality,

762
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,625
Jennifer was the one that

763
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,527
Probably brought this all to

764
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,563
Life for the simple reason she

765
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,531
Was found, number one, and it

766
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,865
Opened the case for

767
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,701
Holly Ann Hughes.

768
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,470
Cases like this never go

Away.

770
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,873
It's like the whole community

771
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,841
Was just thrown into chaos over

772
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,375
This.

773
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,077
You know, here's this guy,

774
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,111
Allegedly, going around, picking

775
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,847
Off these kids.

776
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,482
I mean, there are all these

777
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,384
Rumors that fly about the island

778
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,186
About this guy, and the media,

779
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,088
You know, have painted him as an

780
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,156
Absolute fucking monster.

781
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,627
And he may very well be.

782
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,695
There's no physical or

783
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,096
Scientific evidence that I know

784
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,797
Of in this case.

785
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,464
There's no body.

786
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,735
They haven't found her.

787
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,670
It's all circumstantial.

788
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,607
They've gone.

789
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,208
They've dug up graves.

790
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
They've gone to his old

791
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,476
Neighborhood.

792
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,213
They searched his car.

793
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,514
There's nothing that's come up.

794
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,550
So I'm completely confident

795
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,653
That, you know, he didn't do

796
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,186
This.

797
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,055
So why do you think the d.A.

798
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,488
Is pursuing this case?

799
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,158
Mr. Murphy just recently

800
00:25:59,158 --> 00:25:59,858
Retired.

801
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,560
This was one of his probably

802
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,362
Last, biggest investigations,

803
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,197
This rand case, and perhaps he

804
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,099
Wanted to put this baby to rest

805
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,802
Before he left office.

806
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,178
I remember the inadequacies

807
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,479
Of the witness' statements back

808
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,549
In 1981 and 1982.

809
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,153
Some of them were out-and-out

810
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,921
Alcoholics who just didn't have

811
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,692
Clear recollections of what was

812
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,526
Going on from day to day, but in

813
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,130
Recovery, their memories were

814
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,231
Improved.

815
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,868
That the Andre rand story is

816
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,704
Being told is simply an example

817
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,538
Of what can be done if people

818
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,007
Remain vigilant, remain

826

To find evidence of the other

843
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,346
Yeah.

844
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,781

Gone for an hour, I can imagine

00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,086
How they must feel, you know,

848
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:35,954
Not knowing.

849
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,522
Goes back to that original

851
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,792
Could've been my children.

They're the most precious thing

853
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,461
In my life, and no one's gonna

854
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,197
Take my kids away from me.

Worships George Lucas.

A lot of reasons why my

866
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,011
Suppose he got out on a

867
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,747
Technicality.

868
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:01,680
Would he come after me?

869
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,349
You know, that's always in the

870
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,852
Back of my mind, till this day.

871
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,087
For years, rand had been

872
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,555
Shuffled around various New York

873
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,889
State prisons, where he shared

874
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,191
Cellblocks with the likes of

875
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,859

877
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,096
Joel Steinberg.

878
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,330
In the past few weeks, he had

879
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,631
Been moved to rikers island for

880
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:23,468
The upcoming trial.

881
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,103
We had sent him letters trying

882
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,873
To arrange an interview but got

883
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:27,672
No response.

884
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,140
Then on the day Barb and I

885
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,309
Decided to visit him

886
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,910
Unannounced, we received this

887

Letter.

888

What do you think it says?

889
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,647
He doesn't really speak to

890
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,250
Anyone other than his attorney,

891
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,786
And for years he hasn't spoken

892
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:40,585
To the press.

893
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,053
Nobody really knows anything

894
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,954
About him.

895
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,090
He puts our phone number at the

Top, and he writes, "person"

897

Answering the call should be

898
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:49,762
'Joshua.'

"Possible subpoena."

913

Communicate with you, as long as

915

Talking about it.

But not the extent.

In the back of their minds, they

933

Didn't really think they were

On the second floor of that

Building, as well.

947
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,757
Holly was outside playing one

948
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:03,029
Evening, and Andre rand was here

949
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,829
To visit.

950
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,530
And then got into his

951
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,464
Volkswagen.

952
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,367
Apparently then holly walked

953
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,936
Down this street to...

954
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:15,207
That deli right down there.

955
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,742
Holly was last seen at this

956
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,309
Deli, just down the street from

957
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:18,945
Her home.

958
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,546
A clerk says she came in at 9:30

959
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,048
Wednesday night with 27 cents

960
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,781
And bought a bar of soap.

961
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,984
She's a quiet girl, you know?

962
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:25,952
She didn't say nothing to

963
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,317
Nobody.

964
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,453
And she just got her thing and

965
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:27,785
Left.

966
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:28,719
I really don't know what

967
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,720
Happened after that.

968
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,022

Holly Ann. Yeah.

972
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
She came in. When was this?

973
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,261
This was in 1981.

974
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,328
1981.

975
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,130
She went to buy a bar of soap.

976
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,865
The bar of soap was 31 cents.

977
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,034
Why do I remember?

978
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,634
Because she was short four

979
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:44,036
Cents.

980
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,336
And the old man working behind

981

982
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,173
To her.

983
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,375
That's why I remember.

984
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,809
When I seen his picture, I said,

985
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,945
"Yeah, I've seen that guy"

986
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:53,412
Before.

987
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,779
You know, he's like a quiet guy

988
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,414
To himself.

989
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,415
"He don't look right."

990
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,715
Like I think he talked with a

991
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,051

00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,493
And like I said, before I die,

1038
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,094
I would love this guy to just

1039
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,363
Talk to me, just once.

1040
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,997
And all he's got to do is just

1041
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,566
Give somebody a note and say,

1042
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,267
"This is where they're buried."

1043
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:27,005
That's all.

1044
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,041
He sent us, I think, I guess

1045
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,775
The view from his window.

1046
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,744
This is the decision and order

1047
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,012
From the judge...

1048
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,281
In the case of

1049
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,615
Jennifer schweiger?

1050
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,716
No, no, no.

1051
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,250
This is in the case of

1052
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,086
Holly Ann.

1053
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,121
So he's basically responding

1054
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,190
To each of the witnesses in the

1055
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,756
Last pretrial hearings.

1056
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,059
Testimony, right.

1057
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,859
It says, "detective lotito asked"

1058
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,395
The defendant if he noticed

1059
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,697
Anything unusual about

1060
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,331
Holly Ann Hughes at the time.

1061
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,932
The defendant said, 'she was

1062
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,000
Very, very dirty.

1063
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,203
Her legs were dirty.

1064
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,503
Her hands were dirty.'

1065
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,206
He gave her money and sent her

1066
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,839
To the grocery store to buy a

1067
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,040
Bar of soap.

1068
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,776
The court here is continuously

1069
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,511
Quoting the detectives' own

1070
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,913
Invented statements.

1071
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,881
The defendant never met or saw

1072
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,917
Hughes at any time, nor did the

1073
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,286
"Defendant admit these things."

1074
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,501
The only witness today was

1075
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,570
Elsie Castro.

1076
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,771
She lived across the street from

1077
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,373
Where holly Ann lived.

1078
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,276
She says on her side of the

1079
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,043
Street, but one house up,

1080
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,311
There's a green volkswagen.

1081
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,680
She doesn't see anybody in the

1082
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,547
Green volkswagen.

1083
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,715
She goes into the house.

1084
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,049
She goes to take a shower and

1085
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,153
Discovers that there's no soap.

1086
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,620
Larry interviewed

1087
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,655
Elsie Castro.

1088
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,158
She saw nothing.

1089
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,891
But she claims she bought a

1090
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,893
Bar of soap at the store and was

1091
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,095
Five cents short.

1092
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,963
It's very coincidental that

1093
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,699
She was a nickel short when

1094
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,100
Holly Ann was reportedly a

1095
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,069
Nickel short, as well, all

1096
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,071
Within the time span of about an

1097
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:06,505
Hour.

1098
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,006
So do you think the other

1099
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,207
Witness misremembered?

1100
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,141
I don't know.

1101
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,742
And what that says, if I don't

1102
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,345
Know and the jury doesn't know,

1103
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,879
That's reasonable doubt.

1104
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,348
This is Elsie's car.

1105
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,483
Elsie Castro.

1106
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,217
Right.

1107
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,718
Here, the kids were all back and

1108
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,652
Forth around here.

1109
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,586
On that corner.

1110
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,020
And where was the actual point

1111
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,322
Where they believed she was

1112
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:24,790
Taken?

1113
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,056
Well, this is the other

1114
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:26,492
Thing.

1115
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,894
We're not sure. Look at that.

1116
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,996
A volkswagen.

1117
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,131
He came back to see what was

1118
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,766
Going on.

1119
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,602
All of the crimes that we seem

1120
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,571
To link him to all took place in

1121
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,141
July, with the exception of

1122
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,575
Tiahease.

1123
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,512
This was tiahease... tai.

1124
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,124
She lived with her mother, and I

1125
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,927
Believe there were four other

1126
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,762
Siblings, and they were all in

1127
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,497
One room in the conca d'oro.

1128
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,265
It was a welfare hotel at the

1129
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,800
Particular time.

1130
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,269
It was an August day, and the

1131
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,604
Older brother left tiahease

1132
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,206
Talking to a man.

1133
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,409
That man was described as

1134
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,144
Someone that looked like Andre.

1135
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,580
She's never been seen again.

1136
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,949
The evidence is the bodies.

1137
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,618
I'm sure buried somewhere, he's

1138
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,221
Got the evidence.

1139
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,889
We just haven't found it in the

1140
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,158
Woods yet.

1141
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,262
Sniff it out.

1142
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,229
Whatcha got, boy?

1143
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,697
Donna is searching one of

1144
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,164
Rand's former campsites with

1145
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,666
Luis Rivera, a retired police

1146
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,201
Officer who helped search for

1147
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,303
Jennifer the day she

1148
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:48,774
Disappeared.

1149
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,976
Find the body, boy.

1150
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:51,810
Find the body.

1151
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,577
Sniff it out.

1152
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,380
Sniff it out.

1153
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,847
One body that I found with my

1154
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,048
Dog was 22 years in the ground.

1155
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,486
So the possibilities are really

1156
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:01,219
There.

1157
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,421
It's just a matter of coming

1158
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,924
Back out, concentrating on small

1159
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,860
Areas at a time.

1160
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,827
Come on, boy.

1161
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,796
Come on, boy.

1162
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:11,762
Sniff it out.

1163
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,798
Find the body, boy.

1164
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,265
Where do you think most of

1165
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,133
These kids are?

1166
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,867
It's hard to say.

1167
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,538
They're buried...

1168
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,840
Somewhere in staten island.

1169
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,475
Detective Frank saez is one

1170
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,075
Of the foremost experts on the

1171
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,677
Cold cases of New York City's

1172
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,678
Missing children.

1173
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,213
I mean, he could come and

1174
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,717
Say, "listen," someday, "I'll

1175
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,485
"Give you the bodies," and take

1176
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,355
You to a location, and you could

1177
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,525
Be shocked where it's at.

1178
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,959
If you look around, you can

1179
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,328
Actually see the perimeter of

1180
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:42,961
This area.

1181
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,094
And this was one of his

1182
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,030
Campsites.

1183
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,197
This did not have a lean-to or

1184
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:49,468
A latrine or anything set up the

1185
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,702
Way the campsite at willowbrook

1186
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,939
Did, but kids did say that they

1187
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,106
Would see him sitting in here.

1188
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,276
So, this was where he lived in

1189
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,645
The warmer months.

1190
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,280
Seek it out.

1191
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,783
Seek it out, boy.

1192
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,017
They say the death of a child

1193
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,920
Is the worst possible crime

1194
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,721
Anybody can ever imagine.

1195
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,857
Absolutely.

1196
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,891
But the missing of a child is

1197
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,826
Even worse, because if your

1198
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,928
Child dies and you bury him or

1199
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,965
Her, then at least you have a

1200
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,932
Place that you can go to.

1201
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,234
When your child disappears and

1202
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,605
You don't know where that child

1203
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,706
Is, to a parent, a child is

1204
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,075
Never dead until an officer can

00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,311
Actually bring the remains to

Them.

1207
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,147
Somebody's using this area

1208
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:37,615
Here.

1209
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,183
See, when you find things

1210
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,821
Like articles of clothing, like

1211
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,358
This is a kid's shoe, shampoo,

1212
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,127
Tape...

1213
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,796
Luis!

1214
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,230
Come on back.

1215
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,232
Okay, there's shoes, duct tape,

1216
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,439
And look how soft the ground is.

1217
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,973
It's real soft.

1218
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:02,340
Yeah.

1219
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,043
Sniff it out.

1220
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,713
Sniff it out, boy.

1221
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:12,250
Dig it out, boy.

1222
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,585
It's areas like this that we

1223
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,952
Would dig, just to see, because

1224
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,286
That looks a little suspicious.

1225
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,223
You never know.

1226
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,898
So, this corrections officer

1227
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,065
Keeps saying on the bus every

1228
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,199
Morning that rand says he's

1229
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,369
Innocent and he didn't do it.

1230
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,439
And the corrections officer

1231
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,740
Says, "then consider yourself a"

1232
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,576
Martyr for the safety of

1233
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:38,477
Children.

1234
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:42,147
"And that's what you are."

1235
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,515
Holly Ann's brother,

1236
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,150
Ed Armstrong, took the stand

1237
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,683
Today.

1238
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,519
He was 14 years old when he last

1239
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,186
Saw his sister on the day she

1240
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,021
Disappeared.

1241
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,490
Since then, he's become a

1242
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,558
Lieutenant in the

1243
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,124
New York police department.

1244
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:55,860
He's also been instrumental in

1245
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,763
Bringing this case to trial.

1246
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,330
If he has any humanity left

1247
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,799
In his soul, you know, maybe

1248
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,400
He'll see that there was an

1249
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,669
Error in his way, and, you

1250
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,271
Know, I could forgive him if he

1251
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,638
Returned the remains of my

1252
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,173
Sister.

1253
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,741
And that's all we ever wanted.

1254
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,276
You know, I didn't care if we

1255
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,778
Ever got a day extra added to

1256
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:13,578
His sentence.

1257
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,980
All I ever wanted were the

1258
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,113
Remains of my sister.

1259
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,783
If he's got anything left, he'll

1260
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:24,254
Do that for us.

1261
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:25,524
Here's holly Ann.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

1266

Searched for her for?

R-u-s-h-a-n.

And he changed it to rand.

1274
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,583
This is one where Jennifer was

1275
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,182
Missing.

1276
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,684
Do you think there's any

Credence in the idea that maybe

1278
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,921
Jennifer was reburied at the

Campsite?

1280
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,224
They found her with the head

Was repositioned.

1284
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,664
So who do you think maybe...

1285
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,897
That's why we thought there

1286
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,033
Might have been other people

1287
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,836
Involved.

1288
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,437
The rumors surrounding the

1289
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,638
Missing children were

1290
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,505
Overwhelming.

1291
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,140
Some believed that rand didn't

1292
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,876
Act alone, that he had help from

1293
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,578
One of the homeless or a former

1294

Patient from willowbrook.

1295
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,714
Others thought he was framed and

1296
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,349
That the real killer was still

1297
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,285
Out there.

1298
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,886
The only person who knew the

1299
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,254
Truth was rand himself.

1300
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,090
For weeks we had been exchanging

1301
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,792
Letters in hopes of getting an

1302
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:38,796
Interview.

1303
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,566
But rand refused to give us any

1304
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:41,398
Information.

1305
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,800
He felt all the unwanted

1306
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,334

I'll never forget it.

We all hopped on the bus.

1354
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:45,563
We didn't know no better.

1355

00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,431
Yeah.

1357
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,700
He said he was just gonna

Take us to the park.

1359
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,637
We wound up in Newark airport.

1360
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,605
So then after that, he took us

1361
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,573
Somewhere in some park, which

1362
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,907
It was pitch-black.

1363
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,508
I think it was willowbrook park

1364
00:42:58,508 --> 00:42:59,277
At the time.

1365
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,044
Pitch-black.

1366
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,478
We were all running around,

1367
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,580
Playing hide and seek and

1368
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,050
Come to find out we were being

1369
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,584
Kidnapped, and we didn't even

1370
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,185
Have a clue what was going on.

1371
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,788
I think he attempted something

1372
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,456
That he couldn't accomplish, and

1373
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,158
I think it, like, dawned on him,

1374
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,792
Like, "I can't do it like this."

1375
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,360
Let me, like, take my steps."

1376
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,996
And I think that's what he did.

1377
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,597
He was like, you know, "let me"

1378
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,598
Work on my prey."

1379
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,067
And that's what he did.

1380
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,501
While some residents were

1381
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,870
Convinced of rand's guilt,

1382
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,105
Others weren't so sure.

1383
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:27,773
Excuse me.

1384
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,407
Do you guys know a Thomas micol?

1385
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
That's me.

1386
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,909
Oh, hey.

1387
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,343
I worked with Andre rand.

1388
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,744
Can we talk to you for a

1389
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,646
Couple minutes?

1390
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:35,213
Sure.

1391
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,648
They say that he was totally

1392
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,015
Framed for that, that they

1393
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,918
Combed that area...

1394
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,920
Like with a fine-tooth comb.

1395
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,955
After they arrested Andre rand,

1396
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,892
They combed it again, and now

1397
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,894
Her body is there, very easily

1398
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:49,860
To be found.

1399
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,095
So you know what?

1400
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,930
I would think that maybe he

1401
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,364
Didn't do it either.

1402
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,234
Somebody who did do it moved

1403
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,136
The body there to frame him.

1404
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,905
I thought they were just

1405
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,773
Trying to pin it on somebody,

1406
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,708
And they were gonna blame him,

1407
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,676
Because he was this loner, and,

1408
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,713
You know, he kind of looked, you

1409
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:09,981
Know, a little scary.

1410
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,581
Searching through old files,

1411
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:12,984
We came across the name of

1412
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,684
Bob Graham.

1413
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,153
The notes had indicated that

1414
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,787
He knew rand and at one time had

1415
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,088
Been an early suspect in

1416
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,423
Jennifer's disappearance.

1417
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,759
He briefly worked at a

1418
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,426
Hamburger joint on forest Avenue

1419
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,928
Called westley's, and when we

1420
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,196
Used to street-race and

1421
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,832
Drag-race back in the late '60s,

1422
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,266
Early '70s, we used to hide

1423
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:28,767
There.

1424
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,335
He had the paper hat on, and he

1425
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,970
Was sweeping up the parking lot,

1426
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,471
Or he was behind the counter,

1427
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,072
You know, putting cheese on the

1428
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:35,941
Burgers.

1429
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,408
And he had this volkswagen that

1430
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:40,510
I noticed was in the weeds

1431
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,146
Behind willowbrook.

1432
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,314
He was living in the car;

1433
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,750
There was a pathway down there.

1434
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,050
And I heard things about the

1435
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,485
Tunnel network under willowbrook

1436
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,254
State school.

1437
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:50,722
It was set up like a hub with

1438
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:51,222
Spokes.

1439
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,622
You could get, say, from the

1440
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,024
Cafeteria out to every ward.

1441
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,393
He could survive down there

1442
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,895
Because he had worked there at

1443
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:57,395
One time.

1444
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,662
So, were there other people

1445
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,563
Living in the woods?

1446
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,766
There's a lot of them out

1447
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:01,631
Here, not just him.

1448
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:02,700
There are a lot of them out

1449
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,272
There's something up there.

1450
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:08,606
Look, maybe this is what

1451
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,673
He's talking about.

1452
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,141
There's a tunnel.

1453
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,211
Goes all the way down here.

1454
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,312
There's a city under a city.

1455
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,881
Between the rats running around

1456
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,315
And the sewer water that had

1457
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,285
Seeped in and...

1458
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,685
The dirty clothes and...

1459
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,090
Racks of clothes, cots.

1460
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,792
It's an old wheelchair.

1461
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,625
Wow. That's pretty crazy.

1462
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,728
Obviously, men, women, and

1463
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,964
Children were living down there,

1464
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,564
Including Andre rand.

1465
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,700
Yeah, he had his own little

1466
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,968
Circle of friends there.

1467
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,437
Look. All these have these

1468
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:40,872
Holes in it, and they're all

1469
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,440
Really clean for people to live

1470
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:42,774
In.

1471
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:43,809
Look at that floor.

1472
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,209
That floor has been totally

1473
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,610
Wiped clean.

1474
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,478
Andre rand had this sort of

1475
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:52,350
Really low-class, white-trash

1476
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,820
Version of Jim Jones going.

1477
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,088
Somehow, he managed to get

1478
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,056
People to follow him.

1479
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,190
Who were they, though?

1480
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,359
Well, he had some other

1481
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,661
Homeless.

1482
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,197
Somebody's been staying here.

1483
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,499
Cream of mushroom soup, old

1484
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:10,335
Dishes.

1485
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,702
Flowers.

1486
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:14,972
I remember one day, we found

1487
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,275
A mattress with men's razors and

1488
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,510
A toothbrush and men's clothing

1489
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,711
With one pair of little girl's

1490
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:22,980
Panties.

1491
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,583
I think that he was passing

1492
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,886
The children around to his

1493
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,487
Friends, who were just as sick

1494
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,890
As him.

1495
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,557
So, do you think rand was the

1496
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,724
Only one responsible?

1497
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:37,161
In Jennifer's killing?

1498
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,628
No, I don't think he could

1499
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,065
Have done it all by himself.

1500
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:41,631
They told us a lot of strange

1501
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,199
Stories.

1502
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,600
They told us strange things

1503
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,169
About Andre we could never prove

1504
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:45,904
Or disprove.

1505
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,305
You're talking about having

1506
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,406
Sex with dead people.

1507
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:49,841
There's a story, whether you

1508
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,241
Heard that one or not.

1509
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,110
The thing that Andre used to

1510
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,013
Do is used to dig up dead bodies

1511
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:58,048
In the cemetery and had sex with

1512
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,284
These bodies.

1513
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,887
Did you find it strange that

1514
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,820
There was kind of this

1515
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,555
Underbelly to staten island?

1516
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,123
I would've never guessed the

1517
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,557
Amount of weirdos living on

1518
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,094
Staten island that I ran into.

1519
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:10,661
You know, why aren't people

1520
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,932
Aware of what's going on here?

1521
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,801
To those who even remotely

1522
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,435
Knew Andre rand, he was a

1523
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,637
Complete mystery.

1524
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,671
The more we tried to learn about

1525
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:23,307
Him, the more bizarre the

1526
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,775
Stories became.

1527
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,177
It was becoming harder for us

1528
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,246
To tell the difference between

1529
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,281
The facts...

1530
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,218
And the folklore.

1531
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,003
In an almost replay of rand's

1532
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,005
First trial, the prosecution is

1533
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,074
Once again relying on eyewitness

1534
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:00,946
Testimony to prove its case.

1535
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,880
Some of those who testified were

1536
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,781
Former alcoholics or drug

1537
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,683
Addicts who now say they can

1538
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,786
Recall the details of that night

1539
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:15,626
Over 20 years ago.

1540
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,362
Burns changed his story back

1541
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,964
And forth, but basically he's

1542
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:19,630
Drinking.

1543
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,730
He sees holly Ann.

1544
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,400
He sees rand talking to holly.

1545
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,034
He was the first witness that

1546
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,736
Put rand next to holly Ann.

1547
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:28,238
So in that 17 years, he never

1548
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:28,940
Came forward?

1549
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,040
Never came forward.

1550
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,375
That was the key part of our

1551
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:31,808
Cross.

1552
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:32,542
That was key.

1553
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,544
Never came forward.

1554
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,981
Other witnesses could provide

1555
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,347
Only the vaguest of details in

1556
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,183
Their testimony.

1557
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:39,917
What was he like?

1558
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,818
Oh, you don't want to meet

1559
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:42,319
Him.

1560
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,454
He was a creep.

1561
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,122
Why?

1562
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,156
'Cause he looked like he was

1563
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,960
A killer.

1564
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,227
I just said what I had to say,

1565
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:50,894
And that's it.

1566
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,030
Did you see anything the

1567
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,930
Night that holly Ann

1568
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,531
Disappeared?

1569
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:54,864
Yeah, I heard a scream, and I

1570
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:57,002
Heard her say, "let me go."

1571
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:59,336
We had people that that held

1572
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,371
Back information that we're

1573
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:02,940
Finding out today that were drug

1574
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,709
Addicts, dope dealers.

1575
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,044
What did you need that you

1576
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:07,712
Didn't have?

1577
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:09,080
We needed to put her in the

1578
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,413
Car.

1579
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,581
To put her in the car?

1580
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,115
Right.

1581
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,250
And you had no actual

1582
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,717
Witnesses to put her in the car?

1583
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,685
Not at that time.

1584
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,053
He pulled up in his little,

1585
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,487
Green car, asked us if we wanted

1586
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,555
Candy.

1587
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,557
She went to go get it.

1588
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,890
She put her arm in the car as he

1589
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,193
Opened up the door, and that's

1590
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:24,262
The last I've ever seen of her.

1591
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,763
In a surprising turn of

1592
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,532
Events, Tanya goodson was called

1593
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:28,398
To the stand.

1594
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,035
A playmate of holly Ann's who

1595
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,401
Was 6 at the time, Tanya

1596
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,004
Testified that she saw rand,

1597
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,505
Wearing a mask and holding

1598
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,174
Candy, pull holly Ann into his

1599
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:36,574
Car.

1600
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,176
So, when you said when he took

1601
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,843
Holly Ann he was wearing a mask.

1602
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:40,944
Tell me about that.

1603
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,480
The mask I don't remember.

1604
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,913
All I know is his face was

1605
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:44,482
Covered.

1606
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,815
I couldn't see his face.

1607
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,417
So it might not have been a

1608
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,952
Mask, just like maybe his hat

1609
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:49,953
Pulled down or...

1610
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,321
No, his whole face was

1611
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:51,888
Covered.

1612
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,390
But when he said, "do you"

1613
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,958
"Want candy?" Did he look that

1614
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,360
Bizarre, with the mask and

1615
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,860
Stuff?

1616
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,129
He looked scary.

1617
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,929
So, you knew Jennifer, and

1618
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,199
You knew holly Ann?

1619
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah. I knew a bunch of them

1620
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,534
That he had kidnapped.

1621
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,371
Did you know Hank gafforio?

1622
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,005
That one I didn't know.

1623
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,840
I knew latisha.

1624
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,408
Tiahease?

1625
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:11,242
Tiahease Jackson?

1626
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:11,675
Yeah.

1627
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,776
All these people you knew

1628
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,011
Growing up on staten island, and

1629
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,080
They all were disappearing.

1630
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,482
What did you think?

1631
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,117
I didn't think anything

1632
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,650
Because I was too young.

1633
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,553
And now that I am older, I came

1634
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,522
Here to do what I got to do, and

1635
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,157
I feel a whole lot better now.

1636
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,663
Mr. rand, what do you have to

1637
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,532
Say to the staten island

1638
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,800
Community?

1639
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,274
[ Camera shutters clicking ]

1640
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,664
And that's 675 tysens Lane.

1641
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,166
This is it, yeah.

1642
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,101
30 years ago.

1643
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:22,279
Alice lived here with...

1644
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,682
Her mother, who had multiple

1645
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,951
Sclerosis, was about 26 years

1646
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,086
Old at the time.

1647
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,354
And, of course, there's

1648
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,921
Andre rand, would stand right

1649
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,591
There all the time, right where

1650
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,392
That door is.

1651
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,925
And he was a maintenance man

1652
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:36,361
Here.

1653
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,961
And where was the father at

1654
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:38,629
The time?

1655
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:39,896
They were separated.

1656
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,465
They were separated for about

1657
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,100
Three years, and that's why the

1658
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,568
Detectives thought that the

1659
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,035
Father might have taken the

1660
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:46,536
Child.

1661
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,071
And so they did not focus on

1662
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,573
The child being kidnapped by

1663
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,508
Some deviate.

1664
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,519
We just want closure, all of us.

1665
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,120
That's all.

1666
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,324
Of course.

1667
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,993
It's been so many years.

1668
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:16,900
It's like everybody forgot.

1669
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,568
He sent a picture of his

1670
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:19,769
Rikers island I.D.

1671
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,571
"Dear Barbara, you know that I"

1672
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,174
Cannot answer many of your

1673
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:24,642
Questions at this time.

1674
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,511
The documentary film you put so

1675
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,446
Much faith into will never stand

1676
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,248
Up to the exculpatory evidence

1677
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,080
In my book.

1678
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,950
You might mean well, but later,

1679
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,752
Other moviemakers will pick up

1680
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:36,019
Where you left off.

1681
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,922
As long as I'm in prison, I will

1682
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,757
Give the moviemakers reason to

1683
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,525
Portray me as an evil person.

1684
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,026
You see, evilness sells.

1685
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,929
"That's the name of their game."

1686
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,163
Rand was right.

1687
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,964
The evil, not hard facts, was

1688
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,267
Pushing this trial.

1689
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,835
But then the coincidences

1690
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,169
Couldn't be ignored.

1691
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,738
We knew we had to get an

1692
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:55,706
Interview, but now, in exchange,

1693
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,342
Rand was pushing for us to

1694
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,609
Proclaim his innocence.

1695
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,478
"Barbara, type me an exact list"

1696
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,180
Of the questions or discussions

1697
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,149
You're going to ask me during

1698
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:09,486
"Your documentary."

1699
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,920
This is, I think, the route

1700
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,324
That he took holly Ann on.

1701
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,460
All the clues led us right along

1702
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,827
Here, right up into

1703
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,230
Baron hirsch.

1704
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,531
So he had a campsite in here?

1705
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,901
We think it was his.

1706
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,304
She could be in one of these

1707
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,238
Graves over here.

1708
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,672
If he had a bar or something,

1709
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,207
He could've moved a lid over,

1710
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,641
Put the body in there with an

1711
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,943
Older body, and covered it

1712
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,512
Back up again, and nobody'd ever

1713
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,111
Find her.

1714
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,680
'Cause a lot of these are loose.

1715
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,180
Right.

1716
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,416
There's a body down below

1717
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:38,816
There.

1718
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,116
I don't know how deep they bury

1719
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,051
Them.

1720
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,788
These are all children.

1721
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,723
At first, we were thinking

1722
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,691
Maybe he sold them to use for

1723
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,760
Cult activities or whatever, you

1724
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,328
Know?

1725
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:51,160
Really?

1726
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,863
You think it's definitely

1727
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,764
Legitimate?

1728
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,164
I wouldn't doubt it.

1729
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,001
I mean, what made you believe

1730
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,403
That that was going on?

1731
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,169
Well, we had the son of Sam

1732
00:54:00,169 --> 00:54:01,406
Out there, you know?

1733
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,106
That goes into cults in a big

1734
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:03,240
Way.

1735
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,909
I guess, only because that's

1736
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,410
Something that people thought of

1737
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,578
Back then, 20 years ago.

1738
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,446
Maybe not today.

1739
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:09,880
They're still thinking about

1740
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,816
It.

1741
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,361
Andre was into the devil's

1742
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:25,363
Cult, and being a native

1743
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:27,432
Staten islander, I really

1744
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:32,002
Couldn't believe how much...

1745
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,170
How big it is on staten island.

1746
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,973
We went to one establishment

1747
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,842
Where the basement was set up

1748
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,609
Like... I guess what they'd

1749
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,546
Call the church, and they used

1750
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,314
To hold their ceremonies on

1751
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,449
Actually the old

1752
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,050
Willowbrook state school

1753
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,750
Grounds.

1754
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,518
So you don't think it was

1755
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,053
Kids?

1756
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,488
Oh, definitely not.

1757
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:51,556
Definitely not.

1758
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:53,558
I think it was adults that would

1759
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:54,992
Hold these ceremonies.

1760
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,861
And I think Andre rand and his

1761
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,261
Crew were part of it.

1762
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,129
Whether initiated or not, they

1763
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,264
Were part of it.

1764
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,166
It's hard for us to believe,

1765
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,834
But if you had to convince

1766
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,771
Somebody that it was real, what

1767
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:09,006
Would you say?

1768
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,809
I would say is get a couple

1769
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,545
Of his friends, sit down, and

1770
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,012
Talk to them.

1771
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,982
And by them just talking, you'll

1772
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,317
Realize how bad it was.

1773
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,919
One time, I was invited to

1774
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,621
The precinct to talk to them as

1775
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,356
They recorded me, and they start

1776
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:26,624
Telling me about devil

1777
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,224
Worshipping on staten island,

1778
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,994
That maybe he was a part of this

1779
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:30,460
Cult.

1780
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,761
And I didn't believe it.

1781
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,398
What did they think was going

1782
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:33,763
On?

1783
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,199
That maybe some of these

1784
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,800
Devil worshippers had something

1785
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,369
To do with the kids vanishing.

1786
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,736
You can paint parallels to

1787
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,270
Anything and say, "oh, yeah."

1788
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,240
You know, I can take a picture

1789
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,910
Of anybody.

1790
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,710
Okay?

1791
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,447
And I can say, "this man is a"

1792
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:52,682
Mass murderer."

1793
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,751
And they say, "yeah, I can tell!"

1794
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,685
I can tell."

1795
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,055
I could say, "this man rescued"

1796
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,089
Six people from a burning

1797
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,125
"Building."

1798
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,360
"I can tell he's a good man."

1799
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,246
In addition to the police

1800
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:24,080
Investigation, other evidence of

1801
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,782
Cult activity had been mailed

1802
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,051
To Jennifer's family.

1803
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,886
A mysterious letter claimed that

1804
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,720
Rand had been supplying children

1805
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,389
To the church of the process,

1806
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,558
The same cult that

1807
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,291
David berkowitz alleged helped

1808
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,760
Him commit the son of Sam

1809
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,428
Murders.

1810
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,295
This anonymous letter was traced

1811
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,197
Back to Veronica lueken, a local

1812
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,866
Woman with her own religious

1813
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,201
Following.

1814
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,803
So basically this group right

1815
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,337
Down over here, you know, they

1816
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:49,607
Wrote these letters from

1817
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,941
10/4/87, which is a couple

1818
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,076
Months after Jennifer

1819
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:52,677
Disappeared.

1820
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:53,877
"I thought I'd write you this"

1821
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,112
Note to try and enlighten you,

1822
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,279
At the same time reassure you

1823
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,548
About the crimes that are being

1824
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:58,583
Committed on the island.

1825
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,749
Well, I did a little checking

1826
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,018
On the recent disappearances and

1827
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,218
Murders of these kids, and it

1828
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,352
Looks like some of them were

1829
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:04,488
Victims of what is called a

1830
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,756
Satanic black mass.

1831
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,257
Andre rand did not kill

1832
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,024
Jennifer.

1833
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,726
All he did was bring her to

1834
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:10,527
The coven.

1835
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,296
Too bad that they covered it

1836
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:13,630
Up, but who wants to admit that

1837
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,999
Staten island is literally going

1838
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:15,500
To hell?

1839
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,600
It is a picnic ground for

1840
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:16,966
Them.

1841
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,201
There are bodies buried that

1842
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,004
"Will never be found."

1843
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,438
Hail Mary, full of grace, the

1844
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,338
Lord is with thee.

1845
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,773
Blessed are thou amongst women,

1846
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,175
And blessed is the fruit of thy

1847
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:25,875
"Womb, Jesus."

1848
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,244
So, can we speak to you for

1849
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:27,877
One minute?

1850
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,013
Can you give me, like, a

1851
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,413
Summation of what she said back

1852
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,516
Then?

1853
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,322
Do you believe it actually goes

1854
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,256
On?

1855
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,162
So, I think it would be great if

1856
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,230
You could speak for your

1857
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,197
Organization.

1858
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:48,566
Okay.

1859
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:49,600
'Cause you're worried about

1860
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,535
Them?

1861
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,442
Do you think they're all

1862
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,245
Around us?

1863
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,812
The lord is with thee.

1864
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,480
This is the transcription

1865
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,683
From an interview that

1866
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,184
Detectives in 1988 did with

1867
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,819
Andre rand while he was up in

1868
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,387
Sing sing.

1869
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:12,557
For the first...

1870
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:15,424
Half an hour, they discuss devil

1871
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,192
Worshipping.

1872
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,862
"So you were camping out when he"

1873
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,329
Told you that there might be

1874
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,630
Satanic goings-on in the

1875
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,631
Willowbrook area?

1876
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,367
Now it's 1987, and you hear

1877
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,701
About this cult operating around

1878
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:25,870

Didn't you say to yourself,

00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:28,806
'Maybe they're the ones that

Well...

It was something that was looked

00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:45,855
Into.

1892

Linked to satanic cults, and the

And he's lived there for a

Long time.

1906

Yeah. I mean, is he just not

Active?

What's that all about?

No, he's not.

1910

Does he deny it, or is he...

I've never interviewed him.

1914

Is there satanic cults, people

That practice?

1916
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,828
Of course there is.

1917
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,296
But it's something that's kept

1918
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:26,963
Very quiet.

1919
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,199
It's something that not many

1920

Departments investigate.

1921

Satanic worship is satanic

Worshippers.

1923
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,307
It's like being a catholic.

1924
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:40,309
You believe in God, and you

1925

Believe in Jesus.

They believe in Satan.

1927

So, are you in houses, or are

1929

You could be in houses.

You could use them.

And do they use kids?

1935
00:59:57,526 --> 00:59:59,462
I'd rather not answer that.

1936
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:11,040
Basically, this is the area

1937
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,977
Known as the farm colony, and

1938
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:16,947
This is where they said a lot of

1939

Imaginations.

1945
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:34,999
I mean, it's scary because

1946
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,532
You don't know who can be here.

1947

But there's no devil

Wasn't she slow?

2023
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:44,829
Maybe the reality that a

Person can kill a child is too

2025

Much for some of us to bear, and

2026

Very disappointed to say.

It seemed like he was wanting

2031
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:09,518
To divulge information, of

2032
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,055

2035
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,593
Like a good sign to people who

2036
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,128

2049
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,246
On the stand?

2050
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,048
Andre didn't have too much to

2051
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:43,520
Add, and he has a criminal

2052
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:43,988
Record.

2053
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,188
And a criminal record would

2054
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:49,526
Distract from this case.

2055
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:50,961
The jury will be handed the

2056
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,362
Case Monday, and if convicted,

2057
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,864
Rand could face an additional 25

2058
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:55,164
Years to life on top of the

2059
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,600
Sentence he's already serving.

2060
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,501
On staten island,

2061
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:01,038
Amanda farinacci, ny1.

2062
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:09,812
Good?

2063
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,348
Rand had been upset about not

2064
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,816
Taking the stand and wanted the

2065
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,318
Chance to defend himself.

2066
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,153
After months of letter-writing,

2067
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:18,021
He finally decided to give us an

2068
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,288
Interview.

2069
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,058
It was time to confront rand

2070
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,162
Face-to-face to get some answers

2071
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,097
Once and for all.

2072
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,530
He did the same thing to me.

2073
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,432
'Cause after that initial

2074
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:03,900
Interview that we had with him,

2075
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,435
We had written to him.

2076
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:09,940
We went back up, and he said,

2077
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,540
"Sure, no problem."

2078
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,041
Come back up.

2079
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:11,608
We'll talk again.

2080
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,377
But you'll come to my house.

2081
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,045
You can't move me.

2082
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,647
I won't talk to you unless you

2083
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,584
"Speak to me in my home."

2084
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,087
And we went up there, and

2085
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:25,789
He told the correction people,

2086
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,656
"I changed my mind.

2087
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,592
I don't want to talk to him."

2088
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:37,101
He wouldn't talk to us, so...

2089
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:41,938
We're gonna go back home.

2090
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,839
It's a game for him.

2091
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,143
To me, he's a very smart man.

2092
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,578
He knew how to commit the crime

2093
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,214
And not get caught.

2094
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:53,349
And like he said to me, "why"

2095
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,184
Is it that you guys don't find

2096
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:58,622
"The real killer?"

2097
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,024
"It is your sins that make"

2098
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:01,390
Him hide his face so that he

2099
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,691
Will not hear you, for your

2100
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:03,960
Hands are stained with blood,

2101
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,494
Your fingers with guilt, your

2102
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,963
Lips speak falsehoods, and your

2103
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,500
"Tongue utters deceit."

2104
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,501
Josh and I had decided to hold

2105
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,538
Off on answering rand after his

2106
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,972
Most recent letters.

2107
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,774
They were becoming more and

2108
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:18,808
More bizarre.

2109
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,676
His handwriting had changed,

2110
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,212
And he was now quoting

2111
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:22,979
Scripture.

2112
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,648
"No one brings suit justly."

2113
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,182
No one pleads truthfully.

2114
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,851
They trust in emptiness and

2115
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,617
Tell lies.

2116
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,220
They conceive mischief and

2117
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,488
Bring forth malice.

2118
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,122
They hatch adders' eggs and

2119
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,423
Weave spiders' webs.

2120
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,126
Whoever eats their eggs will

2121
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:36,593
Die.

2122
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,361
If one of them is pressed, it

2123
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,030
"Will hatch as a viper."

2124
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,964
"My stand on deviate sex"

2125
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:42,766
Beliefs.

2126
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,967
Children are emotionally wasted,

2127
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,003
And the land is littered with

2128
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,172
"Broken lives."

2129
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:50,373
Why's he keep focusing on women?

2130
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,542
Maybe he saw things as a child?

2131
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,711
I mean, nobody really knows his

2132
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:55,612
Early childhood.

2133
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,047
In some of the letters to

2134
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,582
You... we have them... it talks

2135
01:06:58,582 --> 01:06:59,448
About her case.

2136
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,417
Father died in 1958.

2137
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,251
When he was 14.

2138
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,053
When he was 14.

2139
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:03,952
His mother was in

2140
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:05,221
Pilgrim state, from what I was

2141
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:09,359
Told.

2142
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,194
Pilgrim state is built exactly

2143
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,896
To the specs of willowbrook.

2144
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,831
Willowbrook and pilgrim state...

2145
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,400
Same type of facility.

2146
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,134
Same type of facility,

2147
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,802
Same type of building, same

2148
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,470
Tunnel system, same kitchen

2149
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,240
Systems.

2150
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,874
Rand writes in his letters

2151
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:27,644
That his mother was committed to

2152
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,011
Pilgrim state asylum in

2153
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:29,812
Long island.

2154
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,447
As a teenager, he would often

2155
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,882
Go there to visit.

2156
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:35,751
With a population that once

2157
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,920
Topped 13,000, pilgrim state was

2158
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,788
At times the largest mental

2159
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,857
Institution in the world, much

2160
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:45,361
Like willowbrook.

2161
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,029
This new connection to rand's

2162
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,832
Family was something we couldn't

2163
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:49,432
Ignore.

2164
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,899
We tried several times to

2165
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:52,602
Contact a woman who we thought

2166
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,737
Was rand's sister.

2167
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,172
Excuse me.

2168
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:56,706
We're doing a documentary, and

2169
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:58,006
We wanted to speak to you

2170
01:07:58,006 --> 01:07:59,375
About... I think it's your

2171
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,909
Brother, Andre rand.

2172
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,614
Right.

2173
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,488
Was there something that

2174
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,122
Happened in his life that you

2175
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,723
Think kind of set him on this

2176
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:15,992
Wrong path?

2177
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,672
Right.

2178
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:29,839
We're not trying to get

2179
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,175
Anybody to confess to anything.

2180
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:32,308
No, it's just a "why?"

2181
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,644
Right.

2182
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,579
Yeah, try to understand why.

2183
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,853
Yeah.

2184
01:08:56,833 --> 01:09:00,270
Received Friday, June 20th.

2185
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,619
[ Receiver clicks ]

2186
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,097
Do you still feel like they

2187
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:30,433
Didn't do enough at the time?

2188
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,867
I don't feel... I think they

2189
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,302
All worked, but I don't feel it

2190
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,672
Was coordinated properly.

2191
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,207
I mean, there's so many things

2192
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:38,574
That are coming out that I

2193
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:39,575
Didn't know about.

2194
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,143
And here they are, and had they

2195
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,712
Been followed up, I wouldn't be

2196
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:43,412
Here today.

2197
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,814
It would've been settled 23

2198
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:45,481
Years ago.

2199
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:46,883
You think he's gonna get

2200
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:47,550
Convicted?

2201
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,885
Not with this evidence,

2202
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,254
Because it's not credible.

2203
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:51,955
You've got 12 people, and

2204
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,622
Some people just could get hung

2205
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,325
Up on something and believe that

2206
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,425
He's guilty or not.

2207
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:58,060
The question of innocence or

2208
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,763
Guilt is more fundamental in one

2209
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:00,230
Case.

2210
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,130
This guy has a track record.

2211
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,200
And that jury, in their hearts,

2212
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,036
They permit this guy to go free,

2213
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,038
Is only gonna see another

2214
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:13,976
Tragedy.

2215
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,244
The jury had taken the

2216
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,680
Weekend to deliberate rand's

2217
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,880
Fate, which gave us the

2218
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,449
Opportunity to seek out one last

2219
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,350
Person... reverend muskett, a

2220
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,151
Storefront preacher who had

2221
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,053
Housed rand in the final days

2222
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:27,524
Before his arrest in '87.

2223
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,025
For months, we had searched

2224
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,493
For his whereabouts until a

2225
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,127
Detective finally revealed his

2226
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:35,098
Address.

2227
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:37,032
[ Knock on door ]

2228
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:38,166
Hey, I'm looking for

2229
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:38,868
Mr. muskett.

2230
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,202
I don't know if he really

2231
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,637
Wants to be involved anymore in

2232
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:42,605
This at all or not.

2233
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:43,907
Maybe you feel like your

2234
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,409
Family got negative attention as

2235
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:46,609
A result of it, I'm sure.

2236
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,576
Yeah, because...

2237
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,812
Well, actually we did.

2238
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:49,313
Yeah.

2239
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:50,747
It's one of the reasons why

2240
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:51,915
We came to Pennsylvania.

2241
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:56,652
Both: Right.

2242
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,254
So, rand was living in your

2243
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,588
House while he was under

2244
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,189
Suspicion for taking Jennifer?

2245
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:02,258
Yes.

2246
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,461
It was at the police's own

2247
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,929
Insistence that we took

2248
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:12,368
Andre rand in.

2249
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,903
They bugged the house, and they

2250
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,073
Had a surveillance vehicle

2251
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,475
Sitting on the corner day and

2252
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,410
Night.

2253
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,357
We couldn't tell the community

2254
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:35,491
What we were doing because,

2255
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,861
Obviously, if we did, he would

2256
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,364
Know and would leave.

2257
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:43,198
So as far as the community knew,

2258
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,902
We were friends of Andre rand.

2259
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,671
Did they physically threaten

2260
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:49,339
You?

2261
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,206
Some people had.

2262
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,042
They didn't view me as a friend.

2263
01:11:54,042 --> 01:12:00,248
But I was a friend of Jennifer.

2264
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,951
Why do you believe he took

2265
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:02,651
Jennifer?

2266
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,320
He told me.

2267
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,324
He told me he took her.

2268
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:12,228
He took her because he thought

2269
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:14,230
That her family didn't want her

2270
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:20,136
And that she was alone, and he

2271
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:23,739
Felt that people that had mental

2272
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,107
Handicaps and that shouldn't be

2273
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,042
Alive...

2274
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:34,182
Not thinking that people would

2275
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:37,353
Appreciate or care for or like

2276
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,522
Someone who has a mental

2277
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:42,859
Handicap.

2278
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:46,062
Andre believed that these

2279
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,865
Young girls came from families

2280
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,468
That they couldn't give them

2281
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,537
Anything, so the best thing was

2282
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:57,040
That they weren't around.

2283
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,542
He seemed to think it was

2284
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:01,511
Part of his mission to cleanse

2285
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:04,380
The world of...

2286
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,915
"Imperfect children" in his

2287
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,618
Eyes.

2288
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,154
Due to the fact that his

2289
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:12,821
Mother had some sort of mental

2290
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,358
Disability and the fact that he

2291
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:17,861
Viewed these other people that

2292
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,263
Were less than perfect, and I

2293
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:22,865
Personally feel that rather than

2294
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:26,234
See them maybe grow up and have

2295
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:28,271
Children, he was sparing them

2296
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:31,339
And taking them out.

2297
01:13:31,339 --> 01:13:33,443
One of my sons is mentally

2298
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:35,712
Retarded, which hung around with

2299
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:36,279
Him.

2300
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,246
His name's chippy.

2301
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:41,951
And that's probably what drawn

2302
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:48,356
Him to...

2303
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:51,461
Well, to us, because of chippy

2304
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:54,797
Being the way he is.

2305
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,933
I think he's possessed.

2306
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,702
I really think that he is

2307
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:03,006
Demonized and possessed.

2308
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,440
We had the same questions

2309
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,341
That you're asking me... why did

2310
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:07,109
He do this?

2311
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,144
What set him off?

2312
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,745
Believe me, we were wide-open

2313
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,080
For any type of motive.

2314
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,516
When we did interview him

2315
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:14,149
Finally, there was gonna be a

2316
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,651
Final interview, and we were

2317
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,385
Gonna take him back through his

2318
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:19,087
Alibi, and that's why we rented

2319
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,923
A hotel room.

2320
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,058
We said, "Andre, look, we got"

2321
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:23,091
This tape of willowbrook.

2322
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,193
Remember you used to work at

2323
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:24,793
"Willowbrook?"

2324
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,894
"Oh yeah, it was terrible."

2325
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,763
I said, "remember how"

2326
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:27,964
Geraldo Rivera did the exposé?"

2327
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,032
He said, "yeah, but I never"

2328
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:29,499
Saw it."

2329
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:30,266
"Well, we have it."

2330
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,399
Would you like to come up and

2331
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:31,800
See it?

2332
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,002
"Cause we have a vcr up there."

2333
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,070
And he said, "you know, I'd"

2334
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,071
Really like that."

2335
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,640
And we're saying, "well, he did"

2336
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,041
Work at willowbrook for two

2337
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:38,542
Years.

2338
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,976
He was a physical therapist.

2339
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,511
Maybe there's something on that

2340
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:46,849
"Tape that's gonna shake him."

2341
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,251
Perhaps the governor can

2342
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,653
Defend and explain away the

2343
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,219
Budget cuts for the department

2344
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:52,756
Of mental hygiene, and perhaps

2345
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,123
Dr. Miller can explain and

2346
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,692
Defend the filthy, dehumanizing

2347
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,292
Conditions we found in this and

2348
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,827
Other buildings, but they won't

2349
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,597
Do it on this program.

2350
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:02,031
What we found and documented

2351
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:03,667
Here is a disgrace to all of us.

2352
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,500
This place isn't a school.

2353
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,435
It's a dark corner where we

2354
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,071
Throw children who aren't pretty

2355
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:08,772
To look at.

2356
01:15:08,772 --> 01:15:10,073
It's the big town's leper

2357
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:12,008
Colony.

2358
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,519
We were sitting on both sides

2359
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,120
Of him...

2360
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,321
And he started to cry.

2361
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,389
He started to cry.

2362
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,856
And he said, "do you see how"

2363
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:28,356
It was?

2364
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:29,357
You see how it was?

2365
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:30,793
"We were victims, too," meaning

2366
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,128
The attendants or the people

2367
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:38,101
That worked there.

2368
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,501
He just sat there, and his eyes,

2369
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,670
Like, rolled, and he just

2370
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,970
Started drooling in the hotel

2371
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,240
Room.

2372
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,273
We could see what was

2373
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:46,576
Happening to him, and it's like

2374
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:47,843
You would kneel right in front

2375
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,813
Of him.

2376
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:50,345
"Say it.

2377
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,479
Tell us the truth now."

2378
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:52,781
You know, "God will forgive"

2379
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,450
You."

2380
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,319
We were so close.

2381
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,320
We thought we had it.

2382
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,390
Then he just started to rock.

2383
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,859
He was that way that whole

2384
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:04,560
Night, the whole next day, and

2385
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,729
He didn't start talking to

2386
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,264
People until two or three days

2387
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,199
Later.

2388
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,012
As much as it had started, in

2389
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,615
The end, it all came back to

2390
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,483
Willowbrook.

2391
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,918
Were the answers to these

2392
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,353
Missing children found on

2393
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,989
Geraldo's tape?

2394
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,523
And if so, had the sins of

2395
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,392
Willowbrook finally come back to

2396
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,863
Haunt the residents of

2397
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:43,331
Staten island?

2398
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,102
All news, all the time.

2399
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,137
This is 1010 wins.

2400
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,373
You give us 22 minutes, we'll

2401
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,974
Give you the world.

2402
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,143
A guilty verdict 23 years

2403
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,010
After 7-year-old

2404
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,478
Holly Ann Hughes vanished from

2405
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,814
Outside of her staten island

2406
01:16:57,814 --> 01:16:58,247
Home.

2407
01:16:58,247 --> 01:16:59,581
This is the heroes right

2408
01:16:59,581 --> 01:16:59,982
Here.

2409
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,284
Heroes, heroes, heroes,

2410
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:01,751
Heroes.

2411
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,550
He's a killer.

2412
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,620
He's a killer and a kidnapper.

2413
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,655
Tell us where she is.

2414
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,124
Tell us where the other kids

2415
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:08,523
Are.

2416
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:09,693
I'll go look for them.

2417
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:10,592
I'll find them.

2418
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,161
The other ones, of course, yes.

2419
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,261
There's speculation.

2420
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,897
But we will make sure that those

2421
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,499
Cases someday come to trial and

2422
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:18,066
That the rest of those families

2423
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,567
Have the same type of justice

2424
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,036
That the schweiger's and the

2425
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,605
Hughes have.

2426
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,008
A lot of weight is lifted off

2427
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:25,709
Me right now.

2428
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:26,541
I feel better.

2429
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,944
Do you feel any closure about

2430
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,412
The verdict?

2431
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:33,782
Well, you know, it...

2432
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:34,850
It's not gonna bring back

2433
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,384
Holly Ann.

2434
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,051
You know that.

2435
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,354
But...

2436
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:39,521
[ Voice breaking ] She's

2437
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,088
Watching.

2438
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:40,857
That's enough.

2439
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,358
Well, the killer had a lot of

2440
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:43,693
Nicknames... the pied Piper,

2441
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,093
Hannibal lechter, the bogeyman

2442
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:45,994
Of staten island.

2443
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,230
His victims were among the

2444
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,096
Most vulnerable.

2445
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,064
They were children.

2446
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,366
And tonight, prosecutors are

2447
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:51,835
Making sure that predator stays

2448
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:52,936
Behind bars.

2449
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:55,304
23 years ago, the entire city

2450
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,673
Was transfixed with the image of

2451
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,008
An innocent 7-year-old girl who

2452
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,245
Disappeared in the blink of an

2453
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:02,812
Eye.

2454
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:04,680
Sadly, holly Ann Hughes has

2455
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,384
Never made it home.

2456
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:12,588
Mr. rand...

2457
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,456
What the conviction today

2458
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,958
Does is assure us that

2459
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,927
Andre rand will die in prison.

2460
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,895
Andre rand was sentenced 25

2461
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,998
Years to life for the kidnapping

2462
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,398
Of holly Ann Hughes.

2463
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,368
He will be eligible for parole

2464
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,737
In 2037.

2465
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:31,106
He will be 93 years old.

2466
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,008
Ooh.

2467
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:32,776
Yeah.

2468
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:35,110
No matter how horrible the

2469
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,713
Allegation was, this case was

2470
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,048
Hardly a case where it was

2471
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:44,052
Proved conclusively that this

2472
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,822
Guy committed this crime.

2473
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:47,924
That just goes to show, when

2474
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,058
It comes to a child is hurt, an

2475
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:53,061
Innocent child is lost...

2476
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,397
You know, people want to

2477
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,563
Basically lynch you.

2478
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:57,165
And if they had an opportunity

2479
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,700
To lynch anybody, they would

2480
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,435
Lynch rand.

2481
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,103
Did you ever think you would

2482
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,807
Get to this day?

2483
01:19:03,807 --> 01:19:06,109
No.

2484
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,043
No, never thought I'd get

2485
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:08,643
Here.

2486
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,746
I don't feel like I got closure

2487
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,447
At all.

2488
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,549
You know, I mean, you never get

2489
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,383
Closure, and that's just a

2490
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,785
Bullshit word, too.

2491
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:18,887
I mean, it happened, and that's

2492
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,656
It.

2493
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:21,791
You got to live with it.

2494
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:22,758
You have no choice.

2495
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,927
I'd just like to find her

2496
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:26,728
Remains and...

2497
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:31,466
Put it to rest.

2498
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,734
Actually, part of the

2499
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,102
Testimony in this case, he

2500
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,703
Claimed that we were looking in

2501
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:36,604
The wrong spot.

2502
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:37,705
Well, you know what?

2503
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:39,207
I'll make sure we look in the

2504
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:39,909
Right spot.

2505
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,143
Where would that be?

2506
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,644
That's willowbrook.

2507
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,547
Now's the time to use what we

2508
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:46,581
Learned from this one to reopen

2509
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,250
Another one of the cases.

2510
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,152
I think he likes playing this

2511
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,387
Little head game.

2512
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,356
I think we're gonna get little

2513
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:58,061
Hints over the next few years.

2514
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,727
You know, he likes to be the

2515
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:01,430
Center of attention, the one

2516
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,131
That holds... the keeper of the

2517
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,766
Secrets, and I think that's

2518
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,402
Gonna play a real important

2519
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:06,802
Part.

2520
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,103
Donna, just say your full

2521
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,471
Name for me, and tell me again

2522
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,906
The title of your organization.

2523
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:11,406
Okay.

2524
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,843
It's Donna cutugno. C-u-t-u-g...

2525
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,389
Was Andre rand convicted on

2526
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:27,490
Fact or fiction?

2527
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,125
We'll probably never know.

2528
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,658
But for the residents of

2529
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,361
Staten island, there was no

2530
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,562
Distinction.

2531
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,932
He was their child murderer,

2532
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:38,166
Their scapegoat, and their

2533
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,735
Bogeyman all tightly woven into

2534
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:45,341
One.

2535
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,674
To some, Andre rand was the

2536
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:48,011
Ringleader to an underground

2537
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:49,545
Community of outcasts who roamed

2538
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,547
The woods.

2539
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,416
To others, he was an unwitting

2540
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,384
Puppet, manipulated by a deviant

2541
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:56,886
Cult that trafficked in

2542
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,055
Children...

2543
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:00,924
Or a delusion murderer, fueled

2544
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:02,558
By our own urban failures,

2545
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,527
Killing those he thought weren't

2546
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:08,263
Worthy of living.

2547
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:09,797
We will never know the real

2548
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:11,500
Story behind Andre rand, so all

2549
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,800
We're left with is our

2550
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,538
Version, that of cropsey.

2551
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,640
But now we've added another

2552
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,009

01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,752

2558
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,689
