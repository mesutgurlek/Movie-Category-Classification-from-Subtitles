First things first, find Sophia.

00:00:01,273 --> 00:00:05,255
Let's start doing this right.

4
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:10,000
There's one other item.
I wrote it down separately.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,409
It's personal. If we could be
real discreet about that.

6
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm not fool enough to think there's
any flowers blooming for my brother.

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,662
But I believe this one
bloomed for your little girl.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,412
Did you find it?

00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:36,930

( Static hisses )

12
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,000
Are we gonna go soon?

13
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,395
I don't know, baby.
I sure hope so.

14
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,042
- I'm hungry.
- I know, Carl. We all are.

15
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,314
Why don't I get
him something to eat?

16
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,452
Ed's into all this
survival stuff.

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,857
We've got enough M.R.E.S
to feed a small army.

18
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:27,349
- I'd sure appreciate it.
- No trouble.

19
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,159
What in the hell
did you tell her that for?

20
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,541
We don't even know
these damn people.

21
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,994
That boy is hungry.
We can spare one box.

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,519
It's called
operational security.

23
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:44,499
How long do you think
this stuff is gonna last

24
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,907
if you keep running your damn
mouth off to everybody we meet?

25
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,413
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

26
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,137
You getting anything?

27
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:59,947
- There's nothing.
- Big surprise there.

28
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,278
No, I mean there's nothing.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,944
Emergency broadcast
system stopped,

30
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:07,958
<i>and that recording about
the refugee center.</i>

31
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,889
It's all gone.

32
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,592
I'm gonna go up the road,
see what I can see.

33
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,496
I'll come with you.

34
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,274
Ed must have forgot
to pack those M.R.E.S

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,599
- I found these in my purse.
- It's all right.

36
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,749
Listen, do you mind keeping
an eye on Carl for a minute?

37
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,567
No.

38
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,607
Shane and I are gonna go
scout up ahead a little bit

39
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,455
and see if we can find someone
that knows what's going on.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,625
- I want to come with you.
- Huh-uh.

41
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,455
Huh-uh.

42
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,092
Hey, we'll be back before you know it.
Okay, little man, huh?

43
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:41,755
Lori: Why would they stop broadcasting
about the refugee center?

44
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,648
- I don't know.
- Think they're turning people away?

45
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:48,159
They're gonna have a riot
on their hands if they try.

46
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:56,484
- Your dad's nice.
- Shane's not my dad.

47
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,831
My dad's dead.

48
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:03,313
<i>( Explosion )</i>

49
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,579
- What do we do?
- Come here.

50
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:11,811
We're gonna do what Rick
would have wanted us to do,

51
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,148
get you and Carl
out of here.

52

You stay with me now.
Come on.

They're dropping napalm

Shane.

60
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:14,559

By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

65
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,945
- Morning.
- Good morning.

66
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,622
I can't believe
I slept in.

67
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,174
You must have needed it.

68
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:34,955
Feeling all right?

69
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,640
Next time wake me, all right?
Especially on laundry day.

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,591
I can manage.

71
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,095
I had an idea
I wanted to run by you.

72
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,147
- What's that?
- That big kitchen of theirs got me thinking.

73
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,820
I wouldn't mind cooking
in a real kitchen again.

74
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,944
Maybe we all pitch in

75
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:53,313
and cook dinner for Hershel
and his family tonight.

76
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,004
Kind of looking for things
to keep my mind occupied.

77
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,665
After everything
they've done for us,

78
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,090
seems like the least
we could do.

79
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,826
You mind extending
the invitation?

80
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,828
Would just feel more
right coming from you.

81
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,712
How so?

82
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:13,350
You're Rick's wife.

83
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,596
<i>It sort of makes you
our unofficial first lady.</i>

84
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:19,397
Morning, guys.
Let's get going.

85
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,673
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

86
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,788
All right, everyone's getting
new search grids today.

87
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,310
If she made it as far as
the farmhouse Daryl found,

88
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,403
she might have gone further
east than we've been so far.

89
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:31,990
I'd like to help.

90
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,192
I know the area
pretty well and stuff.

91
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,731
Hershel's okay with this?

92
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,424
Yeah yeah.
He said I should ask you.

93
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,173
All right then.
Thanks.

94
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:43,209
Nothing about what Daryl found
screams Sophia to me.

95
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:46,034
Anyone could have been
holed up in that farmhouse.

96
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,383
Anybody includes her,
right?

97
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:50,299
Whoever slept in that cupboard
was no bigger than yay-high.

98
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,881
- It's a good lead.
- Maybe we'll pick up her trail again.

99
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,838
No maybe about it.
I'm gonna borrow a horse,

100
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,840
head up to this ridge right here, take
a bird's-eye view of the whole grid.

101
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:00,040
<i>- If she's up there, I'll spot her.
- Good idea.</i>

102
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:02,069
Maybe you'll see your
chupacabra up there too.

103
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,895
- Chupacabra?
- You never heard this?

104
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:08,769
Our first night in camp, Daryl tells
us that the whole thing reminds him

105
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,230
of a time when he went squirrel
hunting and he saw a chupacabra.

106
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:14,779
- ( Laughs )
- What are you braying at, jackass?

107
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,773
<i>You believe in
a blood-sucking dog?</i>

108
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:19,360
Do you believe dead people
walking around?

109
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:23,509
Hey hey.
Ever fire one before?

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,253
Well, if I'm going out,
I want one.

111
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,631
Yeah, and people
in hell want slurpees.

112
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,921
Why don't you come
train tomorrow?

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,248
If you're serious,
I'm a certified instructor.

114
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:34,879
For now he can
come with us.

115
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,961
He's yours to babysit then.

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,901
All right, Andrea, T-Dog,
I want you guys...

117
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,063
( Lightly strumming )

118
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,137
Nice guitar.

119

Dale found it
on the highway.

120
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,558
You know, we still
have 11 condoms.

121
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:16,566
You see 11 condoms, I see 11 minutes
of my life I'm never getting back.

122
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,887
( Chuckles )

123
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:21,140
It wasn't that bad,
was it?

124
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,799
Look, I don't even know
if I like you.

125
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,160
But you're thinking
about it.

126
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:28,195
You should.

127
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,986
You remember the name of that
waitress at the Dairy Queen

128
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:57,629
when we were in high school?

129
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,554
I know you, Shane, well enough
to know that there is only one

130
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,055
sure-fire way of engaging
you in a conversation,

131
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:06,671
<i>and that is to start asking you about
girls you did in high school.</i>

132
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:09,691
I don't want to, but I'll willing
to do it if that's what it takes.

133
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:13,696
Maryanne.

134
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,676
I told you about her?

135
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:17,529
In excruciating detail.

136
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:19,362
Excruciating, my ass.

137
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:22,698
You used to live for those
details back in the day.

138
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,485
- I was impressionable.
- ( Shane laughs )

139
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,787
And I may have been living
vicariously through you.

140
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,494
Why wouldn't you,

141
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,133
with my impressive list
of accomplishments?

142
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:36,137
I was an artist
in his prime.

143
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,971
- A protege.
- You mean prodigy.

144
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,052
Maybe.

145
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:44,175
Is prodigy what you call
a young high school stud

146
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,925
that bangs 30-year-olds
on the regular?

147
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:49,014
What 30-year-old were you
banging in high school?

148
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:54,649
- The P.E. Teacher.
- Mr. Daniels?

149
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,858
Mrs. Kelly.

150
00:09:56,892 --> 00:10:00,080
<i>- The girls volleyball coach? Wasn't she married?
- C'mon.</i>

151
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,330
You know what
I just remembered?

152
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:04,035
Why I never ask you
about this stuff.

153
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:08,194
Why don't we talk about your
high school love life then, huh?

154
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,286
Well, that's
a short conversation.

155
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,247
- It may even already be over.
- That right?

156
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,368
There was Holly, right?

157
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,372
- Nope, that was me too.
- ( Laughs )

158
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,182
Then there was Sheila.
That's the one you lied to me about.

159
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:24,606
I never lied about Sheila.
I just got mixed up about what the bases meant.

160
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,085
Just so you know, a home run,
that usually means a sexual act.

161
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,971
- That's intercourse.
- Yeah, I realize that now.

162
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:33,774
I think what you did was more like
a ground rule double or something.

163
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,590
I'm aware of
the judge's ruling.

164
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:43,146
Shouldn't be talking
about this stuff.

165
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,599
That life, it's gone
and everyone in it.

166
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:49,320
Sheila.

167
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:51,539
Maryanne.
Mrs. Kelly.

168
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:54,161
It's like we're old folk.

169
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,329
All the people in our
stories are all dead.

170
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,949
- We can't just forget them.
- The hell we can't.

171
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,466
It's hard enough accepting
what's happened

172
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:04,503
without digging
up the past.

173
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:06,804
I'll tell you what it is.

174
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,510
It's nostalgia.

175
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,726
It's like a drug.

176
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:13,131
Keeps you from seeing
things the way they are.

177
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:15,427
That's a danger.
You got people depending on you.

178
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:18,067
You think
I don't know that?

179
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,307
I don't know.

180
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,306
What are we doing?

181
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,409
You got every able body
at your disposal

182
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:27,407
out scourging these woods for a little
girl we both know is likely dead.

183
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,414
You think we should
abandon the search?

184
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,862
It's not my call,
is it?

185
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,483
I'm asking.
I'm asking.

186
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:37,036
Survival, Rick.
It means making hard decisions.

187
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,001
But you've got this knack.
You spread us thinner and thinner.

188
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,882
I'm trying
to save lives here

189
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,265
and you're out saving
cats from trees.

190
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,386
Is that what you think
Sophia is, a cat in a tree?

191
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:48,164
Don't do that, man.
Don't twist my words.

192
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,047
How many times we get called up
to look for a missing child, man?

193
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,063
You got 72 hours.
72 hours, and after that

194
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:55,523
you're looking for a body.
And that was before.

195
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:59,151
I mean you honestly think we're
just gonna find Sophia alive?

196
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,782
Are you that sure we won't?

197
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,825
- We being completely honest?
- I'm counting on you to be.

198
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,860
It's math, man.

199
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,372
Love or not, Sophia,
she only matters

200
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,093
to the degree in which she don't
drag the rest of us down.

201
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:17,540
I thought you wanted honest.

202
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,551
If we'd just moved on, man,
we'd be halfway to fort benning

203
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,544
right now and Carl
wouldn't have gotten shot.

204
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,709
You said so yourself.
But we're out here, we're risking lives.

205
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,973
Your own son almost died.
Otis, he paid that bill.

206
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:30,567
What the hell are we
still doing this for?

207
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,426
I had her in my hand, Shane.
She looked in my eyes

208
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,879
and trusted me.
I failed her.

209
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:36,347
If I hadn't,
she wouldn't be out here.

210
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,818
I think she's still alive
and I'm not...

211
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:41,356
I'm not gonna write her off.

212
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,485
( Huffs )

213
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,219
It's blue.

214
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,441
It's Andrea and T-Dog.

215
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,942
Looks like we wandered
into their grid.

216
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,371
<i>( Crossbow twangs )</i>

217
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,137
Sophia!

218
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,709
- ( Birds screeching )
- Whoa. Easy easy.

219
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:42,557
( Kisses )

220
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,683
( Hisses )

221
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,651
- ( Whinnies )
- Whoa whoa whoa.

222
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,326
( Grunts )

223
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,344
Son of a bitch.

224
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,592
( Groans )

225
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,045
( Rustling )

226
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,060
( Groans )

227

( Breathing heavily )

00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,913
( Grunts )

229
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,481
Mind your own
business, Glenn.

230
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,801
You're pregnant.

231
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:14,609
You can't tell
anybody, okay?

232
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,484
You haven't told him yet?

233
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,670
Something wrong?

234
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,678
I just had
a long talk with Shane.

235
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,588
He wants to call off
the search.

236
00:18:57,364 --> 00:18:59,366
What do you think?

237
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,621
What if it was Carl?

238
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,379
Would you want us
to keep looking?

239
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,378
If it was Carl, yes I'd want
to know one way or another.

240
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:09,339
Shane says my good intentions
are making us weaker,

241
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:12,053
that I can't make the hard decisions
for the good of the group.

242
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,364
They're all hard decisions.

243
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,384
But maybe I'm holding on
to a way of thinking

244
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,505
that doesn't make
sense anymore.

245
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,057
He says it's math,
basic survival...

246
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,207
How much fuel, how much food,
how much ammo.

247
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,540
Not much room in that
equation for being soft.

248
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:27,478
It's pretty simple when you start
thinking of life like that.

249
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,983
Hey.

250
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,056
None of us were prepared
to be living life this way.

251
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,786
You are making the best
decisions you can

252
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:36,753
with the information you have.
I don't see soft in that.

253
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:40,367
Mr. Grimes.
My dad wants to talk to you.

254
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,594
( Grunts )

255
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,878
( Panting )

256
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,767
Oh, come on.

257
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,188
You've done half.
Stop being such a pussy.

258
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,259
Come on.

259
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:21,570
( Breathing heavily )

260
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,303
One of my horses
is missing.

261
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,962
Did one of
your people take it?

262
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,168
I was given the impression
you knew about that.

263
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,458
I did not.

264
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,903
I'll have a word with Daryl.

265
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,853
And Jimmy?

266
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,845
You took him out today.

267
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,151
Did he also give you
the impression of my consent?

268
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:02,911
No, he said it outright.
I took the boy at his word.

269
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,687
Jimmy is 17.

270
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:07,573
He's not my kin but I
am responsible for him.

271
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,997
These things need
to be cleared with me.

272
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:13,262
Sounds like we need to work
on our communication.

273
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:14,759
What do you suggest?

274
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,637
Keep it simple.

275
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:20,840
I'll control my people,
you control yours.

276
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:31,281
( Generator humming )

277
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,824
Why don't you pull
that arrow out, dummy?

278
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,718
You could bind
your wound better.

279
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,688
Merle.

280
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:12,255
What's going on here?

281
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,510
<i>You taking a siesta
or something?</i>

282
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,159
A shitty day, bro.

283
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:18,649
Like me to get
your pillow?

284
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,676
<i>- Maybe rub your feet?
- Screw you.</i>

285
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,336
Huh-uh. You're the one screwed
from the looks of it.

286
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,276
All them years I spent
trying to make a man of you,

287
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,906
this is what I get?
Look at you.

288
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,720
<i>Lying in the dirt
like a used rubber.</i>

289
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,476
<i>You're gonna die
out here, brother.</i>

290
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:39,215
<i>- And for what?
- A girl.</i>

291
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,176
They lost a little girl.

292
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,273
So you got a thing
for little girls now?

293
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,121
Shut up.

294
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,861
'Cause I noticed you ain't out
looking for old Merle no more.

295
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,586
Tried like hell
to find you, bro.

296
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,105
Like hell you did.
You split, man.

297
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,125
Lit out first chance
you got.

298
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,990
You lit out.
All you had to do was wait.

299
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,851
<i>We went back for you.</i>

300
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,739
Rick and I,

301
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,066
we did right by you.

302
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,292
This the same Rick that cuffed me
to the rooftop in the first place?

303
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:12,885
<i>Forced me to cut off
my own hand?</i>

304

This him we're talking
about here?

305
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,490
You his bitch now?

306
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,221
I ain't nobody's bitch.

307
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,399

<i>That's all you are.</i>

313

Oh no, I'm sorry.

If I had known
the world was ending,

400

I'd have brought
better books.

401
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:52,111
Dale, you think
Andrea's on her period?

402
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,328
I'm only asking 'cause
it's like all the women

403
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:58,599
are acting really weird.

404
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,022
And I read somewhere
that when women

405
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:05,551
spend a lot of time together,
their cycles line up

406
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:09,554
and they all get super crazy
hormonal at the same time.

407
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,333
I'm gonna advise you

408
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,327
to keep that theory
to yourself.

409
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:19,129
- Yeah.
- Who else is acting weird?

410
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:27,578
- Maggie.
- Ah, Maggie.

411
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,689
<i>She started off
being mean to me.</i>

412
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,358
Then she wanted
to have sex with me.

413
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:33,745
And now she's being
mean to me again.

414
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:36,771
And I don't even want to know
what's going on with Lori.

415
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:38,408
What's going on with Lori?

416
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,023
Nothing.
I don't know.

417
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:46,246
All right, let's take
this back a step.

418
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:52,097
How do you know that Maggie
wanted to have sex with you?

419
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:58,782
Oh, son, you didn't.

420
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:03,981
Did it ever occur to you how her
father might feel about this?

421
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,483
She's 22.

422
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,615
And he is our host.

423
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,842
He doesn't know.

424
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,443
Well, see that it
stays that way.

425
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:19,046
Jesus, Glenn,
what were you thinking?

426
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:21,543
I was thinking

427
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,592
that I might
be dead tomorrow.

428
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,919
Thanks for the book.

429

Unconscious.
You just grazed him.

But look at him.
What the hell happened?

452
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,998
He's wearing ears.

Let's keep that
to ourselves.

Guys, isn't this
Sophia's?

455
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,226
I found it washed up on the
creek bed right there.

456
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,550
She must have dropped it
crossing there somewhere.

457

Cuts the grid

- Yeah, you're welcome.
- How's he looking?

459
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:20,235
I had no idea we'd be going through
the antibiotics so quickly.

460
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,896
Any idea what
happened to my horse?

461
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,494
Yeah, the one who almost killed me?
If it's smart, it left the country.

Can't keep going out there,
not after this.

You'd quit now?
Daryl just risked his life

469
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,738
to bring back the first
hard evidence we've had.

470
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,627
That is one way
to look at it.

471
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:02,635
The way I see it, Daryl
almost died today for a doll.

472
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,446
Yeah, I know
how you see it.

473
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:11,949
I'm not out
to be a hard case.

474
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:13,294
Just being realistic.

475
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,549
( Huffs )

476
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:18,450
He's just got to start
making the tough calls.

477
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,497
You know I'm right.

478
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:22,762
I may not agree with
all of his choices,

479
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:24,814
but I respect him.

480
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,007
I know yours and mine

481
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:29,204
and your way isn't harder.

482
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:33,078
It's the easiest thing in the world
to cut our losses and to not help.

483
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,642
You keep telling yourself
you're making the tough calls.

484
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,203
You're really just trying...

485
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,052
The only thing I care about now
in this world is you and Carl.

486
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:43,165
So I apologize if I
appear to be insensitive

487
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,749
to the needs of others,
but you see

488
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,385
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep the two of you safe.

489
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:51,536
Even abandoning
a lost child?

490
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:54,537
- Really?
- Yeah.

491
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,519
My son and I are not
your problem anymore,

492
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:01,157
or your excuse.

493
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:17,486
- How's he doing?
- He'll be fine.

494
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,984
What about you?

495
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:22,308
I shot Daryl.

496
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:32,511
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

497
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:35,160
We've all wanted
to shoot Daryl.

498
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:50,343
<i>( Lori sobbing )</i>

499
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,662
( Whispers )
Baby, what do I do?

500
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:01,057
<i>( Knocks )</i>

501
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,100
Dinner's ready.
You coming?

502
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,582
Mm-hmm.

503
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:11,405
- You need anything?
- Huh-uh, I'll be right there.

504
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:53,430
Does anybody know
how to play guitar?

505
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,796
<i>Dale found a cool one.</i>

506
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:01,107
Somebody's got to know
how to play.

507
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,140
Otis did.

508
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:10,100
Yes, and he was
very good too.

509
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:57,559
How are you feeling?

510
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:00,974
As good as I look.

511
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,822
I brought you some dinner.
You must be starving.

512
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,992
Watch out,
I got stitches.

513
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,572
You need to know something.

514
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,997
You did more for
my little girl today

515
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:28,125
than her own daddy
ever did in his whole life.

516
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,001
I didn't do anything Rick
or Shane wouldn't have done.

517
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:35,212
I know.

518
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,176
You're every bit
as good as them.

519
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,618
Every bit.

520
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,285
( Sniffs )

521
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:17,650
<i>( Growling, moaning )</i>

522
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,331
You weren't supposed
to see this.
