Rick!

He just snuck up on me!
He clocked me in the face!

00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:10,978
Got his neck broke.

So this is where you
planned to do it...

gonna need you here. <i>( Door opens )</i>

- Did you find the walker that bit him?

No, the weird thing is
he wasn't bit.

And Shane ain't no tracker,

so he didn't come up behind him.
They were together.

Would you please get back out
there, find Rick and Shane

and find out
what on earth is going on?

You guys attacked?

41

I mean, I...
I heard a gunshot,

any walkers nearby.

Maybe they're just passing, like the herd
on the highway. Should we just go inside?

00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,029
Not unless there's a tunnel
downstairs I don't know about.

Did you see Jimmy?

He was in the RV.
It got overrun.

00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,857
The bigger the road,
the more walkers,

319
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,159
mo assholes like
this one. I got him.

328
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,020
We've been riding red

Maggie:
We can't stay here.

Glenn: We can't all
fit in one car.

334
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,349
We'll have to make a run
for some gas in the morning.

00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,318
- Spend the night here?
- I'm freezing.

336
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,354
We'll build a fire, yeah?

337
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,355
You go out looking
for firewood, stay close.

Hershel:
Watch your mouth.

341
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,998
Everyone stop panicking
and listen to Rick.

342
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,866
All right, we'll set up a perimeter.

343
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,002
In the morning,
we'll find gas and some supplies.

344
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,104
- We'll keep pushing on.
- Glenn and I can go make a run now,

345
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:45,206
- try and scrounge up some gas.
- No, we stay together.

346
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,876
God forbid something happens and
people get stranded without a car.

347
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:50,911
Rick, we're stranded now.

348
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:53,781
I know it looks bad,
we've all been through hell and worse,

349
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:56,150
but at least
we found each other.

350
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,886
I wasn't sure...
I really wasn't...

351
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,222
but we did.
We're together.

352
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,524
We keep it that way.

353
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:08,997
We'll find shelter somewhere.
There's gotta be a place.

354
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,336
Rick, look around.
Okay?

355
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:18,005
There's walkers everywhere.
They're migrating or something.

356
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,240
There's gotta be a place
not just where we hole up,

357
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:22,342
but that we fortify,

358
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,912
hunker down,
pull ourselves together,

359
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:27,713
build a <i>life for each other.</i>

360
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,982
I know it's out there.
We just have to <i>find</i> it.

361
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,717
Maggie:
<i>Even if we do find a place</i>

362
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>and we think it's safe,</i>

363
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:37,490
we can never be sure.
For how long?

364
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:39,726
Look what happened
with the farm.

365
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,128
<i>We fooled ourselves</i>
<i>into thinking that that was safe.</i>

366
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,497
We won't make
that mistake again.

367
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:48,802
We'll make camp tonight

368
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:51,572
over there, get on the
road at the break of day.

369
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:55,242
Does this feel right to you?

370
00:31:55,244 --> 00:31:56,544
What if walkers come through,

371
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:57,979
or another group
like Randall's?

372
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:00,381
You know
I found Randall, right?

373
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:02,818
He had turned,
but he wasn't bit.

374
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:08,824
- How's that possible?
- Rick, what the hell happened?

375
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,094
Daryl:
<i>Shane killed Randall.</i>

376
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,462
Just like he always wanted to.

377
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:16,697
Lori:
And then the herd got hi

378
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,608
we're all infected.

379
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,719
- What?
- At the CDC,

380
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,854
Jenner told me.

381
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,526
Whatever it is,

382
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:47,129
we all carry it.

383
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,741
And you never said anything?

384
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,877
Would it have made
a difference?

385
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,446
- You knew this whole time?
- How could I have known for sure?

386
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,915
- You saw how crazy that mo...
- Glenn: <i>That is not your call.</i>

387
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,851
Okay, when I found out about
the walkers in the barn,

388
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,452
I told, for the good
of everyone.

389
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,888
Well, I thought it best
that people didn't know.

390
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,777
I'm sure you had your reasons.

391
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,114
- ( Kisses ) Is there anything that...
- I killed him.

392
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,054
I killed Shane.

393
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,825
He came at me.

394
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,264
He killed Randall
to get me into the woods.

395
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,366
He planned it.

396
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,638
I had...
I had no choice.

397
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,414
I gave him every chance...

398
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:48,053
And he kept
leading me further out.

399
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:54,426
He pushed me, and I let him.

400
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,297
And after awhile,
I knew...

401
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,666
I knew what he was doing,
what he was up to.

402
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,571
And I kept going.

403
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,142
I didn't stop.

404
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,646
I could have, but...

405
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,018
I just wanted it over.

406
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,456
Dogging me
every step of the way.

407
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,661
Acting like I stole
you and Carl, like...

408
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,497
Like I was in the way.

409
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,739
I just wanted it over.

410
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,410
I wanted him dead.

411
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,752
I killed him.

412
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,394
He turned.

413
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,196
That's how I knew Jenner...

414
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,699
Jenner was right.

415
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,275
Carl put him down.

416
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,923
Ooh.

We're not safe with him...

424
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:38,478
Keeping something
like that from us.

425
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:43,117
Why do you need him?
He's just gonna pull you down.

426
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,520
No. Rick's done all right by me.

427
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,623
You're his henchman

428
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,293
and I'm a burden.

429
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,362
You deserve better.

What do you want?

431
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:00,570
A man of honor.

432
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,839
Rick has honor.

433
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,976
I think we should
take our chances.

434

Hershel:
Don't be foolish.

435

There's no food, no fuel,

Could be a raccoon,
could be a possum.

- Beth: Back from where we came.
- Maggie: Yeah.

443
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,534
The last thing we need is for
everyone to be running off in the dark.

444

We don't have the vehicles.

- No one is going anywhere.

- Do something.
- I am doing something!

451

I'm keeping
this group together,

alive.

453
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,659
I've been doing that all along,
no matter what.

454
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,896
I didn't ask for <i>this.</i>
<i>I killed my best friend</i>

You saw what he was like,

00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,280
how he pushed me,

458
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,083
how he compromised us,

459
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,619
how he threatened us.

460
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:27,289
He staged
the whole Randall thing,

461
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,492
led me out to put
a bullet in my back.

462
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,494
He gave me no <i>choice.</i>

463
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,930
He was my friend,
but he came after me.

My hands are clean.

Maybe you people are
better off without me.

467
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:00,121
Go ahead.

468
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,857
I say there's a place for us,

469
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,859
but maybe... maybe it's
just another pipe dream.

470
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,462
Maybe... maybe I'm
fooling myself again.

471
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,699
Why don't you...
Why don't you go and find out yourself?
