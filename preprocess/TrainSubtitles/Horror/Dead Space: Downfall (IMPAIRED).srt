<i>The colony was lost.</i>

<i>It is my belief that the artifact</i>

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,090
Whatever it is, it's just up ahead.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,754
Any idea what it is?

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,990
Not a clue.

19
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,931
This planet is ripe
with unusual seismic activity.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900
Protocol says we're required
to check it out,

21
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,163
so we're checking it out.

22
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,229
All right, heads up.
We've got a small impact crater ahead.

23
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,899
Watch your footing.

24
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,697
Toggle your flares.

25
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,204
Let's take a look
at what we're dealing with.

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,037
[Man] There's something strange
about these walls.

27
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,045
There's evidence of chemical weathering.

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,252
And there's symmetrical
45 degree scarring on these walls.

29
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,421
Anybody else think these marks
resemble the ones made by an E-34?

30
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,497
Well, I would if we weren't
several million light years from home

31
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,260
on a previously unexplored rock.

32
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,791
Yet, we have E-34 drag lines as well.

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,636
Nobody's used an E-34
elephant drilling rig in over 150 years.

34
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,403
Hell, I've only seen them in books.

35
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,135
I'm going to radio the colony.

36
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,182
Somebody's been messing around out here.

37
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,912
Jen, you're going
to want to look at this.

38

Oh, my God.

39
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,508

<i>The captain is ready to see you.</i>

About fucking time.

Lights out.

67
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,917
So I tell her, artifact or not,
in the grand scheme of things,

68
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,155
we are all alone out here.

69
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,293
Might be a long time ago the universe
had all kinds of life, but now...

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,529
You know what I think?

71
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,332
I think the thing is cursed.

72
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,305
I mean look what's happened
since they found it.

73
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,104
I don't remember you getting paid
to think, Jackson.

74
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,973
Now go help secure those gravity tethers.

75
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,808
We've got a whole operation
waiting on this thing.

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,711
Someone or something

77
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,182
put that thing here for a reason,
that's all I know.

78
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,915
It's a good thing no one asked you.

79
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,512
Come on, Collin.

80
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,856
You telling me that the thing
ain't creeping the shit out of you?

81
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,363
I mean, the suicides, the murders?

82
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,422
Seems like everyone on this rock
is losing their shit.

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,697
This is deep space.
Weird shit happens.

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,136
The faster we do our jobs,
the faster we get home.

85
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,299
Your wife discovered it
and she still has no theory

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,967
about where it came from?

87
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,181
The Unitologists seem to have an idea
that this is what created us,

88
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,910
or something stupid like that.

89
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,953
Jen is a geologist and a site surveyor,

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,650
not an anthropologist,
archeologist, or Unitologist.

91
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,023
- [door whirring]
- Besides, she hasn't been well.

92
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,722
That's more the reason to get this thing
aboard ship and go home.

<i>[Man on radio] What the hell

103
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,459
- Captain.
- You wanted to see me?

104
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,091
As chief of security on this ship,
I would like to severely protest

105
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,657
bringing the artifact aboard.

106
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,726
You've already made your protests heard,

107
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,669
and I have already taken them
into account, thank you.

108
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,331
Captain.

109
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,433
You've given me
the incident counts for the colony,

110
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,311
and I say that this colony has been
in operation for two and a half years.

111
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,441
That much time in deep space
is inherently dangerous.

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,249
And the people attracted
to this line of work are, too.

113
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,755
You're forgetting one thing, Captain.

114
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,985
A spike in serious violent incidents

115
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,856
have been reported over the last week.

116
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,364
We pulled that thing up a week ago.

117
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,457
I have my orders and you have yours.

118
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,866
Just tell me this.

119
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,336
Why is this thing so important?

120
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,203
Alissa, don't fight me on this.

121
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,609
Once Kyne has studied the Marker,
you can have your team run a full analysis.

122
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,810
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,139
Gravity tethers full tension
and stable, Captain.

124
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,646
All systems are go, sir.

125
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,342
All right, Mr. White.

126
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,782

You understand?

130
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,686
They need bodies.
They need us to turn.

131
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,698
All right, Mr. Leggio.

132
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,825
Sometimes the sedatives
cause hallucinations.

133
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,596
Just relax, okay?

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,605
Why is this man still awake?
I told you to give him a sedative.

135
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,972
I did. 500 cc's, just like you ordered.

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,798
Hold him still, Nurse.

145
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,748
That should do it.

What the hell just happened?

148
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,747
I've never seen someone resist
a sedative of that quantity.

149
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,382
It's not possible.

150
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,893
I have no idea.

151
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,759
Two weeks ago, this man
was healthy and mentally stable.

152
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,629
Then out of nowhere,
he kills two members of his dig team.

153
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,964
None of this makes much sense.

154
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,971
Some kind of toxin, maybe.

155

Something in the colony?

00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,701
Maybe.

157
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,472
This rash of unusual cases
coming from the planet puzzles me.

158

Yes, Doctor.

Good work, people.
She's coming up nicely.

162
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,079
- [alarms sounding]
- [rumbling]

163
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,593
Normal electromagnetic surges.

164
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,288
The magnetic field of the planet
is bleeding out.

165
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,354
Nothing to worry about.

166
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,706
- [alarm sounds]
- [rumbling]

167
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,849
What's happening?

168
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,894
I'm not sure.
The entire system is rebooting.

169
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,861
Our power cores are shielded.

170
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,090
Yes, I know.

171
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,395
Another wave of disruption just broke
from the surface and smacked into us.

172
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,197
It's a temporary glitch,
not an attack, Alissa.

173
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,329
Down, girl.

174
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,375
- Asshole.
- Break it up, you two.

175
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,103
Chic, can you raise the colony?

176
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,644
Well, things are choppy at best.

177
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,703
We've lost 40% of the comlink signal.

178
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,112
Can you isolate the problem?

179
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,241
I've never seen interference like this.

180
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,153
I have, when I was a pilot back Earth-side
and my radar was being jammed.

181
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,215
You think this is intentionally
directed at us?

182
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,193
That's a dead planet
and we're the only people out here.

183
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,493
How in the hell is something
intentionally jamming us?

184
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,032
I'm just saying what it looks like.

185
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,433
It could just be excess magnetic feedback
from the planet crack.

186
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,300
Chick, get me Foreman Barrow.

187
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,567
I want to know what's happening down there.

188
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,040
<i>Captain, I don't know</i>
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

189
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,373
<i>but we must have pulled</i>
<i>too closely to the core.</i>

190
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,379
<i>Things are shaking</i>
<i>like a mother down here.</i>

191
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,436
<i>We've got heavy interference.</i>

192
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,379
Over.

193
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,146
You reading me, <i>Ishimura?</i>
Nothing.

194
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,915
<i>Barrow, come in.</i>

195
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,718

196
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,452
<i>Barrow, this is the captain.</i>
<i>Report in.</i>

197
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,460
<i>Barrow.</i>

198
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,927
[roaring]

199
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,259
[groaning]

200
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,828
- The planet is pushing back.
- What?

201
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,568
Something I read about the danger
of harvesting planets.

202
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,076
You got another line of work
you're looking to get into?

203
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,375
It says that the planet cracking procedure
is extremely dangerous

204
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,812
to the overall harmony of the universe.

205
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,249
What a bunch of Unitologist bullshit.

206
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,753
The only planets we ever found
in all of space are dead.

207
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,220
Earth was a fluke.

208
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,145
It's a ghost town in here.

209
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,408
Where the hell is everybody?

210
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,723
I'm going to check on Jen.
Catch you later.

211
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,009
[woman screams in distance]

[panting]

217
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,938
Jen?

218
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,812
Where are you?

219
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,163
What the fuck?

220
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
These symbols are the same as...

221
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,155
Honey, what are you doing?

222
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,096
They want our bodies.

223
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,068
This is mine...

224
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,732
my flesh, my bone, and my blood.

225
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,372
No!

226
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,481
No, no, no!

227
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,584
Jen?

228
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,119
Oh, baby.
Fuck. Why?

229
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,189
Jen.

230
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,743
My last analysis of the Marker
suggests a psychosomatic energy field

231
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,611
unlike anything I've ever seen.

232
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,776
This interference is rising from the planet.

233
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,479
The Marker's not the problem here.

234
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,180
I know, it... it's just...

235
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,950
Just what, Doctor?

236
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,254
- [computer beeping]
- Something's not right.

237
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,851
Communications just came back up.

238
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,624
I'm reacquiring the colony's signal.

239
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,725
We're pulling scattershot low-res images
from the personal cams.

240
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,797
- [gasps]
- What the...

241
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,807
Put it on the main monitors.

242
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,114
We need to send a security team
down there now, Captain.

243
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,682
Captain, I'm getting
multiple flat lines across the board.

244
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,127
[alarms beeping]

245
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,666
Good God,
they're being slaughtered.

246
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,795
- By what?
- I'm going down there now.

247
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,736
Not until I know what the hell is happening.

248
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,570
Chic, get someone on the com.
I want a sit-rep ASAP.

249
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,809
[panting]

250
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,501
Hold on, baby.

251
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,444
We're going home.

252
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
[engines whirring]

253
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,793
I've raised one of the dig crews.

254
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,930
Ishimura, <i>can you hear us?</i>

255
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,409
<i>Something's down here,</i>
<i>killing everyone.</i>

256
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,173
<i>My dig crew has changed.</i>

257
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>I think there's something down...</i>
<i>Help us, God damn it!</i>

258
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,645
This is <i>Ishimura.</i>
We are reading you.

259
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,084
Who is killing everyone?

260
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,781
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>
<i>- [creature roaring]</i>

261
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,027
Dig team, come in.
This is <i>Ishimura,</i> come in. Over.

262
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,222
Start scanning frequencies.

263
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,393
Don't fuck with me right now.

264
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,594
Get on the horn and get me the colony.

265
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,301
Captain, we need to call for help.

266
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,638
We don't have the forces
to protect the ship.

267
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,371
I don't need to remind you
that this is a restricted system,

268
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,413
and we're not supposed to be here.

269
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,505
You don't.

270
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,482
But the circumstances have changed.

271
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,744
My orders haven't.

272
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,581
Then at least let's contact the church.

273
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,645
- They must know about...
- About what?

274
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,662
The effects of the Marker are like nothing
documented in the religious texts.

275
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,563
And your crew is being wiped out
as we speak.

276
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,468
I have a feeling that we have at least
something very dangerous down there,

277
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,096
and we need guidance.

278
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,698
- Do you think they know?
- Who?

279
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,073
The crew.

280
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,204
Most of the key officers
are sympathetic to the church.

281
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,544
Maybe a third of the crew
are with the church. Why?

282
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:02,815
We're going to abandon the colony
and return the Marker to Earth.

283
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,651
It's the only thing to do.

284
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,987
I cannot afford a mutiny on my ship.

285
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,027
Sir, I need to take a team down there.

286
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,358
At the very least we need to know
what we're dealing with.

287
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,194
Denied. No one is allowed
on or off the colony.

288
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,427
You're condemning innocent people.

289
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,197
You want me to put the entire ship at risk?

290
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,000
Is that your brilliant idea?

291
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,507
Captain Matthius,
we've got an incoming shuttle.

292
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,042
Just picked her up on radar.
She's close.

293
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,543
Lock the bay doors on every level.

294
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,737
They're survivors.

295
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,872
Maybe they can tell us
what's happening down there.

296
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,185
Do what I say, and do it now.

297
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,316
<i>[Man on radio]</i>

Landing, crashing, or shot down.
Pick one.

00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,762
But there's no way in hell we're going back.

305
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,764
Captain, the shuttle just
slipped through Bay 17

306
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,535
before we could secure the doors.

307
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,837
Get down there now.

308
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,105
Arrest everyone on board that shuttle
and quarantine them.

309
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,273
You sure you don't want me

What exactly are we
dealing with here, Vincent?

314
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,180
Asked as if I had a fucking clue.

315
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,156
Clear right.

Jesus, what the hell happened here?

318
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,936
There's a hell of a lot of blood,
but no bodies.

319
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,534
Sounds like one of your parties.

00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,601
Or your sex life.

321
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,908
Cut the chatter, people.

322
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,573
This thing didn't crash itself.

323
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,585
If someone was piloting this bird,
they ain't here.

Blood trails.

325
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,188
Someone got off this shuttle.

326
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,692
Where the hell are they?

327
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,788
We're moving out.

You don't look well.

336
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,098
Vincent's team has secured the dock.

337
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,101
There's no sign of the shuttle crew.

338
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,796
They're beginning a search of the ship.

339
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,429
- And...
- And what?

340
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,872
We've lost all contact with the colony.

341
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,440
I want you to check on the artifact.
Make sure it's secure.

342
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,777
We are in over our heads.

343
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,411
You need to contact Earth and find out
what our next course of action should be.

344
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,479
I think this is a test of our faith.

345
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,545
What?

346
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,794
Nothing.

347
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,023
Just get down there, Doctor.

348
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,404
Get back to your stations.

349
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,168
We have a right to see it.

350
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,539
You can't lock it away.

351
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,976
It's a holy relic.
We have the right.

352
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,514
Clear this area immediately.

353
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,678
This is a secure area,

354
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,618
and Captain Matthius
wants the artifact left alone.

355
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,156
[crowd clamoring]

356
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,281
Excuse me.

357
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,826
I'd like to talk to them.
l... I think I can help.

358
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,259
Who are you?

359
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,297
Samuel Irons, Engineering Specialist.

360
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,799
Are you a rock worshiper, too, Irons?

361
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,234
It may be useful to have
one of their own speaking to them.

362
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,364
Your presence might be
misinterpreted as hostile.

363
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,965
This is me being cordial.

364
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,035
You want to see hostile?

365
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,080
Let the man speak with them.

366
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,310
All right, play the piper
and lead the flock out of here

367
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,319
before someone gets
their nuts stomped on.

368
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,376
Thank you.

369
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,817
Brothers and sisters,
there will be plenty of time

370
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,454
to observe the holy relic
when we return to Earth.

371
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,657
The church must first interpret the markings

372
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,634
if we are to be enlightened by their words.

373
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:03,004
Interfering with the captain's orders
will not help resolve our current crisis.

374
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,339
Right now we must pray
for our fellow pilgrims

375
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,142
on the surface of the planet
whose lives may be in danger.

376
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:15,653
Set the example that we Unitologists
are not hysterical fanatics.

377
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,247
We respect the orders of our captain.

378
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,664
See?

379
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,963
They are reasonable people
when not confronted by violence

380
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,662
and threats of arrest.

381
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,763
Oh, perhaps in light of my help...

382
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,406
You'll get your chance
to see it in due time.

383
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,708
I understand.

384

Hey.

00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,035
What the fuck is going on?

389
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,905
I count 15 sets of footprints,
give or take.

390
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,343
The log says there were 20 corpses
set for chryo-storage.

391
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,509
Maybe they had a miraculous recovery.

392
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,678
Here's a crazy idea.

393
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,879
Don't say it, Dobbs.

394
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,786
Hey, I don't mind shooting
the living dead

395
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,324
as long as I get
to shoot something.

396
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,521
I've got one.

397
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,300
I'm no doctor, but it looks like
something's been chewing on him.

398
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,307
This shit is getting weirder
by the second.

399
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,967
Sounds like a date with Shen.

400
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,442
Fuck you, rookie.

401
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,878
Has it occurred to you jokers that
whatever did this could still be in here?

402
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,508
I'm going to call this in.
Stay sharp.

We're in the morgue, A Deck.

416

We were attacked by something.

I don't know.
Fuck this shit.

You got a job to do.

Get a hold of yourselves.

424
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,550
Whatever these things are,
they're loose on the ship.

425
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,321
Secure this room
and get ready to move.

- We need to talk.
- Not now.

431
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,604
Captain, whatever was on the planet
has made it aboard ship,

432
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,649
and it's somehow connected to the Marker.

433
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,345
I think the church may have been mistaken.

to handle bullets just fine.

But a couple rips
from this bad boy

470
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,520
and they don't get up.

Where'd you get that?

473
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,894
There's a store room down the hall.

00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,296
I busted open a crate.

It was a divine discovery

don't you think?

If these things have spread,
there's no stopping them.

485
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,586
Our job is the safety of the crew.

486
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,889
The way I see it,
we have two options.

487
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,656
Fight or die.

488
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,290
We don't have the luxury of running.

489
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,137
I've lost contact with the bridge.

490
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,467
We're going to head there now.

491
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,474
- [cocks gun]
- Anything gets in our way,

492
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,476
cut first, ask questions later.

493
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,704
Got it?

494
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,008
- Got it.
- Got it.

495
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,982
[beeping]

496
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,385
Sir, systems are failing
all over the ship.

497
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,981
Shipboard communication
is all but down.

498
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,185
Plot a course for Earth.
We're getting the hell out of here.

499
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,386
What?

500
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,292
Lock down any sections of the ship
affected by this disturbance.

501
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,195
I want it contained, do you understand?

502
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,325
We have to get the artifact home.

503
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,699
That is our only mission now.

504
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,933
Captain, listen to me.
We're not in control anymore.

505
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,201
I'm not sure we ever were.

506
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,503
What are you talking about?

507
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,205
The artifact, the mission.
It's a trap. It has to be.

508
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,112
We've brought something aboard
that we didn't understand.

509
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,616
Something alien, and it's trying to kill us.

510
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,812
We cannot bring the artifact to Earth.

511
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,548
Have you lost your mind, Doctor?

512
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,420
The holy artifact must be
delivered to the church

513
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,518
if humanity is to be delivered
into the welcome arms

514
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,119
of the universal awakening!

515
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,867
Keep your voice down.

516
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,369
Don't tell me what to do.

517
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,271
I'm the captain. This is my ship!

518
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,605
You are being irrational.
People are dying.

519
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,109
We are all in danger!

520
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,942
The faithless want to destroy the artifact

521
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,641
because they fear it.

522
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,183
I won't allow it, Kyne.

523
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,513
I will not allow it!

524
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,849
The Marker is making us
paranoid and delusional.

525
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,650
It's the only explanation

526
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,089
for the irrational behavior
that has been plaguing the colony,

527
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,592
the crew, and now the officers.

528
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,995
This is not irrational, Doctor.

529
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,625
This is religious persecution.

530
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,396
And I'm not going to allow you,

531
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,665
or anyone else, to destroy the artifact.

532
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,435
White, have the doctor restrained!

533
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,499
Sir, he's right.

534
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,902
He's speaking heresy.

535
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,380
He's a spy, planted on my ship

536
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,282
to destroy any hope we
have of transcending death.

537
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,813
You need to calm down.

538
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,888
I gave you an order, Mr. White!

539
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,361
Nobody cares if you're a Uni, Cap.

540
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,694
We just want to get out of this alive!

541
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,257
What is that supposed to mean?

542
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,106
Captain, please.

543
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,541
Let me give you a sedative.

544
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,943
Wait a minute.

545
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,346
You... You're all with him.

546
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,214
He's going to poison me, isn't he?

547
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,887
Fuck this, he's lost it!

548
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,188
You'll all be arrested for mutiny.

549
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,788
He's out of his mind, Kyne.
Give him something.

550
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,129
Get your filthy...

551
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,293
Get off of me!

552
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,667
We have to bring the artifact
back to Earth.

553
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,365
The church needs it.

554
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,169
Kyne, you traitor! You're one of us.

555
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,141
You were sent here by the church,

556
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,677
specifically, to retrieve the Marker.

557
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,508
Just like me!

558
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,980
You bastard!

559
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,311
This is a sedative.

560
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,476
Don't fight us.

561
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,713
- It's for your own good.
- Bastard!

562
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,584
[screaming]

563
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,248
Get away from me.

564
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,155
Hold his head.

565
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,887
I'm trying.

566
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,851
My God.

567
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,759
Is he...

568
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,692
The sedative must have
punctured his brain.

569
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,462
You killed him, Doc.

570
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,194
You all saw it.

571
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,602
He killed the captain.

572
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,334
It was an accident.

573
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,000
Arrest the doctor.

574
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,873
[alarm blaring]

575
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,607
Launch sequence
for escape procedure's initiated.

576
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,220
Who is doing this?

577
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,988
I don't know.

578
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,956
Shuttles 1 through 25
have launched.

579
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,503
The shuttles are all empty.

580
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,367
There is only one thing left to do.

581
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,775
Stop the launches!

582
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,977
I'm trying.

583
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,986
Shuttles 26 through 50
have launched.

584
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,715
That's all of them.

585
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,450
All emergency shuttles are gone.

586
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,869
We need another way
up to the bridge.

587
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,807
If there still is a bridge.

588
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,516
There's a utility lift ahead.

589
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,949
We could move up to hydroponics

590
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,815
and cross to the bridge from there.

591
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,466
[pounding on door]

592
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,444
Some time today!

593
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,908
I got it.

594
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,042
Get inside.

595
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,109
Ramirez, slow them down.

596
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,991
- [gun clicking]
- I'm out.

597
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,163
Hansen, come on.

598
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,642
What happened back there?

599
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,409
I don't know what you mean.

600
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,643
You froze up.

601
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,844
Do I need to worry
about you, Hansen?

602
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,047
You falling apart on us, Sarge?

603
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,018
Maybe Irons here can sign you up
with the Unitologists.

604
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,025
They seem pretty at peace
with this bullshit.

605
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,357
I'm okay.
Mind your own fucking business.

606
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,693
[door opens]

607
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,530
Seems quiet enough.

608
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,543
Famous last words.

609
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,942
One way to find out.

610
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,274
Move out.

611
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,075
We're not far.

612
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,255
[whispering]
It's okay, it's okay.

613
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,456
Keep an eye on Hansen.

614
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,860
You can handle it together.
Come on, come on.

615
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,771
- [screaming]
- Shut the fuck up, Hansen.

616
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,110
We don't need
any attention right now.

617
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,375
Fuck you, Vincent!

618
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,780
This is your fault!

619
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,115
You've killed us, you fuck!
We're all dead.

620
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,778
Hansen, shut your fucking mouth.

621
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,283
You've clocked out, man.
Pull it together.

622
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,259
They want our bodies.

623
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,920
And they're going to get them.

624
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,429
- What the...
- [laughing]

625

These guys ain't that tough.

Sorry, boss.

636
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,075
I wasn't fast enough.

637
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,512
Not your fault.

638
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,886
They turn us on ourselves.

639
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,948
If they don't kill us all,

640
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,017
we will kill ourselves.

641
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,329
Let's go.

642
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,936
The captain's body
is secure in the morgue.

643
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,100
What do we do now?

644
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,974
The captain's dead.

645
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,140
We lost control of the ship.

646
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,615
No escape shuttles.

647
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,949
Communication array's
been incapacitated.

648
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,181
There's no way of contacting home.

649
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,191
It's only a matter of time

farther away from the planet.

815
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,479
White? Chic?

816
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,885
Anybody.

817
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,659
Looks like I'm hoofing it.

818
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,544
[creatures snarling in distance]

819
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,841
Great.

820
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,538
What's wrong?

821
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,772
I'm right here!

822
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,327
You can't get close to it, can you?

823
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,765
This is what kept you sealed up
in that God forsaken rock.

824
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:24,009
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Vincent. Vincent.</i>

825
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,418
<i>Boss, you got to wake up.</i>

826
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,873
There's one more thing you got to do.

827
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,409
Finish the job.

828
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,807
Save the ship.

829
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,505
How?

830
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,986
My name is Alissa Vincent.

831
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,621
I was... am the Security Chief

832
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,562
on board the <i>Ishimura.</i>

833
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,600
I may be the sole survivor.

834
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,262
We encountered an alien life form,

835
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,931
they have taken over
the bodies of the crew.

836
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,601
The colony was lost.

837
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,941
My team is dead.

838
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,073
The <i>Ishimura</i> is under their control.

839
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,709
It is my belief

840
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,753
that the artifact we discovered
on the surface

841
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,448
is somehow responsible.

842
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,458
It has driven us mad.

843
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,256
Turned us against each other.

844
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,524
If you find this recording,

845
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,226
the <i>Ishimura</i> and the artifact

846
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,167
must be destroyed.

847
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,296
Tell those on Earth

848
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,135
that many people fought

849
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,869
and died bravely.

850
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,936
Don't let us be forgotten.

851
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,608
This is Chief Alissa Vincent

852
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,674
signing off.

853
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,329

856
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,971
Here we go.
