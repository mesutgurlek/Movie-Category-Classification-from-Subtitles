00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,939
Ah, group laughter.

480
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,026
A sure sign that the worst is behind
us and the movie is just about over.

481
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,862
So, this is the ending?

482
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,938
Um, yes. I'd say they'd be
running the credits about now.

483
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,372
Transport has arrived!

484
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,071
You heard the cat. Let's move.

485
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,411
Thanks, buddy.
Next stop, Billy's house.

00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,414
Here you go, buddy.

489
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,349
Uh, welcome to the
Sleep Well. How may I...

490
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,684
Are you the manager?

491
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,480
Me? (LAUGHS) No,
I'm not the manager.

492
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,274
I'll tell you what.
I'll go get him for you.

00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,906
Told you not to leave
the keys in the car.

497
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,898
We got a runner.
