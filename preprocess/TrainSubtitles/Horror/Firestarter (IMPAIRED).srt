1
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,840
Don't push me.

2
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,120
Stick with him.
Don't let him get too far ahead.

3
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,360
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Yeah, honey.

4
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
There isn't any people on the side streets.
And they're darker.

5
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,240
- That's just what they'd want, honey.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,760
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

7
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,400
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

8
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,239
"(man #1 )" He's seen us.
Whatever you do, no eye contact.

9
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,600
- He can make you do what he wants.
- "(man #2)" Got it.

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,730
"(man #1 )" See him?
He just got lost in that crowd there.

11
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,010
"(man #2)" That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,320
(man #3)
Maybe I can cut him off at the corner.

13
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
Let's get him.

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Daddy, they're coming.

15
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Taxi. Taxi.

16
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,000
Drive.

17
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,680
- Stop!
- Stop the car. Hey, cabbie.

18
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,320
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just drive.

19
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,280
Come on, let's get back to the car.
We can chase them down. Let's move it.

20
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,520
- Hey, mister, where are we going?
- The airport.

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,360
Wait, wait, I can't go to the airport.
It's too far.

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,440
Look...

23
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill. I want you
to take my daughter and I to the airport.

24
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,360
Sure. OK, mister.

25
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,360
(distorted voices)

26
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,720
- "(Dad)" Drive.
- I ain't turning down no $500.

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,480
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,240
Five of these injections will be water.

29
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Five of them will be water mixed with
a tiny amount of a chemical compound

30
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,480
which we call... "lot six".

31
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,440
The exact nature
of this compound is classified

32
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,920
but it is essentially
a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

33
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,320
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

34
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,360
which is to say that neither you nor we
know who has received the clear dose

35
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,520
and who has not.

36
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,880
Until later, that is.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,280
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,480
Are there any questions?

39
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,040
Dr Wanless, is this experiment
being done by The Shop?

40
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
No.

41
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,320
Absolutely not.

42
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
- Yes?
- When do I get my money?

43
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,160
- "(all)" Right on, man.
- That is important.

44
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,960
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

45
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm broke too.

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,960
So, if we may begin
the injections now, please.

47
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
Andy McGee.

48
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little nervous
about this, Andy McGee.

49
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,280
- What if I go on a bad trip?
- We'll probably just get distilled water.

50
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,840
"(Wanless)" Feel any pain?

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,800
(woman)
I feel a pressure. It's a bad pressure.

52
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
"(Wanless)" It will pass.

53
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,320
- How are you feeling?
- When do we start to shrink?

54
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
You believe you're going to shrink?

55
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,800
Sh-ri-nk...

56
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,640
You'll be fine.

57
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,680
We'll be fine.

58
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200
(disturbed voices)

59
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,240
"(woman)" I can't feel my hands.

60
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,040
- Thank you. What a nice compliment.
- I didn't say anything.

61
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,800
You did.

62
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,520
- What'd I say?
- You said my hair is beautiful.

63
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Like copper set on fire.

64
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,840
Yeah.

65
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,160
But I didn't say that. I just thought it.

66
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,920
(Andy thinks) I love you.
I've always loved you.

67
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,400
- I've known you for a thousand years.
- (Vicky thinks) That long?

68
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,280
Yes, I've loved you too.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,880
(commotion)

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,320
(screaming)

71
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,600
Hey, buddy, airport.

72
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,920
- You OK?
- "(groans)"

73
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,920
I got a headache. Wake up, babydoll.

74
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,120
We're here. Come on.

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Where are we?

76
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,760
- Try the airport.
- Roger.

78
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,920
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

79
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,640
What do you call this thing he's got?
How he pushes people.

80
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,560
The Shop figures
he may be running down by now.

81
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,600
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

82
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,760
It's doing something to his brain.

83
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Like what?

84
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,240
Giving himself
pinprick haemorrhages, maybe?

85
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,640
- It could kill him.
- Good, let's hope.

86
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,520
We don't have any more money
and we don't have anything left to sell.

87
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I can't stay here.

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,520
It's not right. It's not right to steal.

89
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Honey, I know, but it's not right
for them to keep coming after us, either.

90
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Now, I explained that to you, Charlie,
at least I tried.

91
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,080
- About the big bad and the little bad?
- That's right. Lesser and greater evil.

92
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,720
- Big bad is what I did to Mommy?
- Oh, darling, please.

93
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't. Don't, baby.

94
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,640
I made Mommy scream.

95
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Shh...

96
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,480
Does your head still hurt?

97
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,600
Poor Daddy.

98
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
Gotta keep a lookout.

99
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
OK.

100
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
"(man)" I don't know
what you're doing here.

101
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,960
I don't want to have anything to do with
you. I told you not to follow me here.

102
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,120
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

103
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,200
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.

104
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm not ready to get married,
so why don't you just get outta here?

105
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,760
- Why don't you just stop bugging me?
- "(Andy)" Come on, Charlie.

106
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,680
"(woman)" You told me you loved me.

107
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,720
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

108
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,080
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
We've been through this 100 times.

109
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm not responsible.
Look, I told you not to follow me here.

110
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,680
"(woman)" But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

111
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,320
- I don't have any money.
- I'm not the only guy you've been with.

112
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,360
"(woman)" That's not true.

113
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,000
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

114
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
"(man)" That's not
what my buddy Al told me...

115
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,280
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

116
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,880
- Ow!
- Hey, hey!

117
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,840
- All right, buddy, come outta there.
- Mind waiting till I put my feet out?

118
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,560
I was coming with you and I saw him and
before I could stop it, it just happened.

119
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,640
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's OK, honey.

120
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,480
- But I set him on fire.
- Charlie.

121
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

122
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,080
I want you to listen to me.
You said it got away from you and it did.

123
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,160
But not like before.
It just got away a little bit.

124
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,240
Charlie, you might've set
that man's face on fire or his hair.

125
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,520
Now, it always goes out
at somebody you don't like.

126
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,120
- But you didn't really hurt that guy.
- Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen.

127
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,880
Baby. Baby, you've got
to stop thinking about that.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
It wasn't you that really hurt Mommy.

129
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
They killed her.

130
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
That's right. That's right.

131
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,680
Now...

132
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
We've got to go on.

133
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,640
Single file. Just like the Indians.

134
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,760
And keep as far over
to the side of the road as you can, OK?

135
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,120
"(man)" I seen them both.
This guy looked kinda sick, or something.

136
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,120
- Are you OK?
- "(Andy sighs)"

137
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,160
- So far, so good, baby. You getting tired?
- Nope.

138
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,520
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

139
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,730
OK. Come on.

140
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,520
OK, sweetheart, come on.

141
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Head up Route 70.

142
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,880
Oh, Daddy.

143
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,160
"- (screams)" Daddy, get up.
- (truck horn)

144
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,360
Daddy, wake up.

145
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
(she screams)

146
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,680
Daddy? Daddy?

147
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Are you all right?

148
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,000
- I thought you were dead.
- Are you kidding?

149
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,880
Think I'd do that to you?
You're all I've got in this world.

150
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,600
But I'm happy about that
cos I'm crazy about you.

151
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

152
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,040
Come on. We gotta find a place to sleep.

153
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,040
We can afford it now.

154
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,760
- I burned him.
- Rest, sweetheart.

155
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,120
You didn't hurt him. You controlled it.

156
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,200
- "(groans)"
- Shh...

157
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,760
(Andy) OK, Charlie.

158
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,760
Now, let it out. Easy does it.

159
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Let it go.

160
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Attagirl.

161
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Attagirl. OK.

162
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,000
Now pull it back.

163
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,120
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

164
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,200
Good Lord.

165
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,440
Now, you've got to learn to control that.
You gotta try real hard. OK?

166
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,400
- I couldn't help it.
- Tomorrow. She's tired.

167
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,680
Time for bed.
You can try again at breakfast.

168
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
- I wanna do that again.
- No, tomorrow.

169
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm not tired. I wanna do it again.

170
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,800
- I said no.
- Again. Now!

171
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,280
(screaming)

172
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

173
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,680
Well, you did it. You hurt your mother.

174
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,320
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- It's all right. Mommy's all right.

175
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Charlie, you have got to control this thing

176
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,040
because it's a bad thing,
you understand me? A bad thing.

177
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,160
- Leave her alone. It's not her fault.
- "(phone rings)"

178
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,640
- Hello?
- Sorry.

179
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,280
(he sighs)

180
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,600
- Hung up again?
- Whoever it is.

181
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,800
We know who they are and they wanna
make sure we're staying right here.

182
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
(Andy) Vicky? Charlie?

183
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm home.

184
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,200
Sweetheart?

185
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
Vicky!

186
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh...

187
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,680
Oh, no.

188
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,080
Oh, no. Please, please, God.

189
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
Please don't be here.

190
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Please don't...

191
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,320
Oh, no! Please, no, no!

192
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Oh, no! Babe! Oh, what did they do?

193
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,120
What did they do?
They put this in your mouth.

194
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
(weeps)

195
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,960
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

196
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,360
Charlie!

197
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
Charlie!

198
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,280
Charlie!

199
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,680
Charlie!

200
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,000
Charlie!

201
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,360
Joan,
by any chance is my daughter with you?

202
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,520
- (Charlie screams)
- (man) Hold her!

203
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
OK, that's far enough.

204
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,320
Drop the gun.

205
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,520
Drop it.

206
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Bring her to me.

207
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,680
You're blind.

208
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,640
"(yelling)" My eyes!

209
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,240
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

210
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,080
"(screaming)" My eyes!

211
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Oh, my God! Leon!

212
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,360
- Andy!
- "(man)" My eyes!

213
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,880
Joan.

214
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,400
Go back inside the house.
You won't remember any of this.

215
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,400
- Leon!
- Oh, God!

216
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,560
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

217
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,360
Can't see!

218
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,120
- Wake up, baby. It's time to move on.
- Morning.

219
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,520
- Elaine. Morning, Josie.
- Good morning.

220
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,800
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

221
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,760
Put him right through when he does.

222
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,080
And Rainbird is in your office.

223
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,240
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

224
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,040
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

225
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Welcome back, Rainbird.

226
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,160
- How was Venice?
- "(he chuckles)"

227
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,120
Sinking.

228
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,440
- Is our problem there solved?
- Our problem there is solved.

229
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,320
- Dr Wanless is here.
- Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

230
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

231
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,360
- Have you caught them yet?
- We'll catch them. What do you want?

232
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,000
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

233
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,000
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

234
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,280
expunge them,
wipe them from the face of the earth.

235
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Andrew McGee and his daughter

236
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,130
constitute the greatest threat
that's confronted this nation.

237
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
- That's a lot of crap.
- You feel guilt!

238
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,520
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

239
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,760
You want to justify your participation.

240
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
You were all in favour of it at the time.

241
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,560
I know.

242
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,760
I didn't realise.

243
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,400
None of us did.

244
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,480
Lot Six was nothing more
than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

245
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,000
- A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.
- For God's sake, Joe, don't start again.

246
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,040
You see...

247
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,720
You see...

248
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,320
This pituitary extract is responsible
for the occasional flashes of psi ability

249
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,280
which most human beings demonstrate
from time to time.

250
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

251
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,160
the kind of domination that this
experiment brought out in Andrew McGee.

252
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,320
What is the point, Doctor?

253
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,040
Since this child was born, her father has
tried to inhibit her use of those powers.

254
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,040
But what if his control
had weakened now?

255
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,960
Why would he lose control now
after all these years?

256
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,160
Ask yourself this question.

257
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,600
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

258
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,000
when this child was an infant?

259
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,000
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

260
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,320
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

261
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,880
bursts into smoky flame.

262
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,440
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

263
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,320
but you're making her sound
like Armageddon.

264
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,960
That's what it might well be.

265
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,560
Suppose lighting fires
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

266
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

267
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,680
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

268
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,640
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

269
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,480
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

270
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,400
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

271
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Suppose we have a child here
who some day is capable

272
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,720
of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

273
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,040
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?

274
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,360
Then allow me to progress
from insanity to utter lunacy.

275
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Suppose there is a little girl out there
somewhere today, this morning,

276
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,840
who has within her,
lying dormant at present,

277
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,640
the power some day
to crack the very planet in two,

278
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,840
like a china plate in a shooting gallery.

279
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,080
What if we could train this little girl?
And others as well.

280
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,160
Could we have more powerful weapons?

281
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,640
No! No more experiments.

282
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't force me to go above your head
because I will if I have to.

283
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,800
I'll have you and this entire establishment
eliminated.

284
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,480
An excitable man.

285
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
Where are we gonna go now?

286
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,760
We have to find some place
to stay for a while.

287
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,760
I don't think anybody'll believe us
but if we send letters to the newspapers

288
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,760
maybe The Shop will have to lay off.

289
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,560
We could go to Granther's.

290
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,200
- What made you think of that?
- I don't know.

291
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,840
Cos I was thinking about your grandfather
not five minutes ago.

292
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,790
We'll check the motel.
I want you to work the road further down.

293
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,800
Well... That's a pretty little miss.

294
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,360
- What's your name, missy?
- Roberta.

295
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,040
Well, Bobby, where are you headed for?

296
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,440
We're headed for Tennessee. Knoxville.
My wife's there visiting her sister.

297
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
- Ran into a little problem.
- Did she?

298
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,080
Yeah, labour. This one's got
a new baby brother. 1.40 this morning.

299
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,720
- His name's Andy. Isn't that a nice name?
- I think it's a corker.

300
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,320
Mine's Irv Manders. Hop in.
I'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville.

301
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,320
(car horn)

302
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,920
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

303
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,760
- No, damn it, it's them.
- Did you get the number?

304
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,440
- Did you see which way they went?
- I didn't even see them check out.

305
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,640
Hey, we got them.

306
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,720
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

307
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,920
- We couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.

308
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,120
- Are you sure you got enough?
- Always, and I'm glad to have you.

309
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,320
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure, Bobby.

310
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,680
It'll be my wife's too
when she gets a look at you.

311
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Always wanted a little girl herself.

312
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,480
But I guess that wasn't to be.

313
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,520
"(lrv)" Got a song for you.

314
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,810
Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg

315
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Finest old hen that ever laid an egg

316
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,880
She laid her eggs all over the farm
Another little drink won't do us any harm

317
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
(laughter)

318
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,520
- Who'd you bring home, Irv?
- This little girl is Roberta.

319
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
This young fella here's her daddy.

320
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,880
I didn't catch his name yet
so I don't know if we're related.

321
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,440
- Frank Burton, ma'am.
- Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

322
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,360
- Hi.
- Hello.

323
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,800
Your husband invited us back for lunch.
Hope you don't mind.

324
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,120
Why, sure. Come on in.

325
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,200
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

326
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,280
(belches)

327
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,000
More room out than there is in, button.

328
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,160
If I eat any more, I think I'll split.
That's what my mom used to...

329
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,840
I mean that's what she always says.

330
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:29,399
Norma, why don't you and Bobby go out
and feed those chickens?

331
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,920
I wanna have a little talk with Frank here.

332
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,360
- Would you like that?
- Do they peck?

333
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,080
Only what they eat, honey.

334
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,680
- Come on.
- OK. Goody.

335
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,520
Want a beer, Frank?

336
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,960
- It isn't Frank, but I guess you know that.
- I guess I did.

337
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,960
- What is your name?
- Andy.

338
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,280
- Well, Andy, what about that beer?
- I guess I could use it.

339
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,360
You got it.

340
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,920
- There you go.
- Thank you.

341
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,200
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right. I know this routine.

342
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,440
- Cops after you, Andy?
- Sort of cops, yeah.

343
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,520
You snatch that little girl from her mother?

344
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,680
No, she's my daughter,
but her mother didn't set the cops on us.

345
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,720
Her mother's been dead for a year.

346
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,680
Don't appear like you got her
against her will.

347
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,040
What do they want you for,
anyway, Andy?

348
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,840
- Who are they?
- Government agents.

349
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,560
- FBI?
- No, The Shop.

350
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,880
The Shop?

351
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

352
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,640
My daughter, Charlene and I, Charlie,

353
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,960
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

354
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,360
Tell me about it.

355
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,720
OK, now go ahead.

356
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,760
Thank you. Do you eat these chickens?

357
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,840
If I can catch one, I might eat one.
We eat the eggs.

358
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
They want to examine her and study her.

359
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,560
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

360
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,920
I think they want to use her
to reactivate the Lot Six programme.

361
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,120
Andy, I think you ought to call the police.
Turn yourself in.

362
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,600
- Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.
- As crazy as anything I've ever heard.

363
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,840
Daddy, I fed the chic...

364
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,960
You told.

365
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,040
Daddy, why'd you tell?

366
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,360
(gasps)

367
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,400
They're coming. They're coming for us.

368
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,960
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

369
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,960
Yes, yes, that's what they wanna do.
They wanna kill you.

370
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,360
Kill you like they did Mommy
and take me away. I won't let it happen.

371
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,200
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

372
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,640
Charlie, now, watch what you're doing.

373
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,120
Is it too late?

374
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,480
Yes, they're coming up the dirt road now.

375
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,040
Daddy, I'm scared.

376
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,880
Charlie, you can stop them.

377
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,480
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

378
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, Charlie...

379
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,560
Of course I'll still love you.

380
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,480
I love you more than anything
in the world, no matter what happens.

381
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,160
I got some tall apologising to do.
There's a line of cars coming up the road.

382
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,160
I'll stand with you if you want.
I'll get my deer gun.

383
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,320
You don't need your gun.

384
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,440
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

385
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,160
- Honey, you don't have to run any more.
- Go away.

386
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,360
Afraid I can't do that, honey.
I have my orders.

387
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,360
No one wants to hurt you or your daddy.

388
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,960
You liar, you're supposed to kill him
and I know it.

389
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,080
I'd advise you do what my daughter says.

390
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,390
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

391
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,160
You men are trespassing.
I want you to get off my property.

392
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
We're government agents, sir.

393
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,800
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

394
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,880
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassination.

395
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,280
- Show me a warrant or get off my land.
- We don't need a warrant.

396
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,840
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

397
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,480
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

398
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,640
Honest to gosh,
there's nothing going on here.

399
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,920
- We know what's going on.
- Please, don't make me do anything.

400
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,480
"(Andy)" Get out! Don't you understand
what she's doing? Can't you feel it?

401
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,040
Don't be stupid.

402
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,960
If we can only discuss this, please.

403
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,480
- Get him!
- Watch it, Andy. Watch it.

404
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,720
Not the girl. Not the girl.

405
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,920
(screaming)

406
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,280
Help! Help!

407
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,880
Help me!

408
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,080
No, don't.

409
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,160
No, don't.

410
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,680
No! Don't!

411
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,760
(screaming)

412
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,160
Now, get out of here.

413
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,280
She's never done anything like this
before. I don't know if she can stop.

414
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
Get out. Get out.

415
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
Go! Go!

416
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,640
Help me!

417
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!

418
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,520
- Charlie.
- "(screaming)"

419
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,520
Stop it. That's enough.

420
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,120
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

421
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,200
Sorry, Daddy.

422
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
(screaming)

423
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,360
Let's get outta here, back to The Shop.

424
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,760
Go, go, go!

425
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,320
Oh, my God.

426
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,600
Andy. There's an old Willy's Jeep
out behind the barn.

427
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
No, Irv, don't get involved any deeper.

428
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,010
Those men came here
without any warrants,

429
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,080
tried to take them off our land,
one of them shot me.

430
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,320
What do you want me to do?
Turn them over to the secret police?

431
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,600
They'll be getting their peckers up enough
to come back. Be a good Nazi?

432
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,400
- I guess not.
- You don't have to do anything else.

433
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,760
No, please, take the Jeep and get away.

434
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,840
Just get away.

435
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Charlie.

436
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,800
There's the lake. We're here.

437
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
(she giggles)

438
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,720
Come on, Charlie.

439
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,160
We got a lot of cleaning up to do.

440
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,920
Nobody's lived here
since your grandfather died.

441
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,800
I hope that key's still here.

442
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,800
Do you think they'll find us here?

443
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,120
After what you did at the farm,
I think they're gonna stay pretty far away.

444
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,280
If they still wanna capture us,

445
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,640
they're gonna have to figure out
a different way to do it.

446
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,920
Well, anyways, we've got us a new home.

447
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,880
Let's go. Let's go.

448
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,560
Don't it look good?

449
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,160
Daddy, will things
ever be the same for us again?

450
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,000
Will I be able to go to school,
and things, again?

451
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,400
Sure you can.

452
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,360
- After you write the letters, right?
- That's right.

453
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,200
Tell the newspapers all about it.

454
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,240
Then the running'll be over.

455
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,120
We'll live normal lives,
like everybody else.

456
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,040
- Can I be...?
- What?

457
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,400
- Like everybody else?
- Darn tootin' you can.

458
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,200
I wanna be.

459
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,520
Look who's here.

460
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,240
- How'd you feel?
- Safe.

461
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,360
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

462
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,320
(mutters)

463
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,560
(clears throat)

464
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,640
Do you have a phone here?

465
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,720
Right over here.

466
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,200
- They're here. They mailed some letters.
- All right, good deal.

467
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,160
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

468
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,200
- Mr McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

469
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,200
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

470
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,080
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

471
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,520
- You know what that little girl can do.
- I know.

472
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,040
That's why I'll bring her here.
So you can do all your tests.

473
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,640
On the condition that you give her to me
for disposal when you're finished with her.

474
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,840
What?

475
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,320
- I want her when you've finished with her.
- You are mad.

476
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,640
How right you are.
So are you, mad as a hatter.

477
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,080
You sit here making plans for controlling a
force that's beyond your comprehension.

478
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,670
A force that belongs
only to the gods themselves.

479
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,960
What the hell are you talking about?

480
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,920
Things I'm sure
you wouldn't want the world to know.

481
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,640
What's to stop me from
having you erased right here and now?

482
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,810
Hmm!

483
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,720
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

484
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,640
The Shop will cease to exist
within six weeks.

485
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,800
And within six months,
you will stand in front of a judge,

486
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,920
awaiting sentence for crimes
serious enough to keep you behind bars

487
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,720
for the rest of your life.

488
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,920
Just... what is it you want?

489
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,640
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

490
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,560
will not end when I bring her here.

491
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,440
That's just the beginning.
We're going to be friends.

492
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,360
- We haven't got her yet.
- We'll have her.

493
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,320
All right.

494
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,640
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

495
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,400
She's very beautiful. She's very young.
Yet inside her is the power of the gods.

496
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,440
We're going to be close, she and I.

497
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, yes.
Gonna be very close.

498
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,440
Reel in some of the slack out of the line.
Real slow, come on in, a little more.

499
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,000
OK, now give it a little tug.
Attagirl, now reel.

500
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

501
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,000
- A real whopper.
- Lookee here. How about that?

502
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,560
(she laughs)

503
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,560
Here he comes.

504
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,680
Saved by the Postal Department.
Am I glad to see you?

505
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,680
I think we got a dead battery.
Could you give us a jump?

506
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,920
- Let's take a look at it.
- Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.

507
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,800
Where will we go now?

508
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,080
Offices of "The New York Times."

509
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,480
- But you sent them a letter.
- Well, they might not have gotten it.

510
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,880
Do you think they took them?

511
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,960
No!

512
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,680
- I'll get it, baby.
- "(yells)" I can do it!

513
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,320
Baby, baby, come on, now.
It's almost over.

514
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,400
"(crying)" It's never gonna be over.

515
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,280
- It's not over.
- Come on.

516
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,120
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Come here.

517
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,200
(she weeps)

518
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,920
- Are you ready to go?
- I guess so.

519
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,720
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

520
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,840
Even if they come
before we can get away.

521
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,720
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

522
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,920
That's OK, Charlie. I can understand that.

523
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,840
OK.

524
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,160
Jump.

525
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,240
That's a big girl.

526
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,400
OK...

527
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,520
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

528
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,040
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!

529
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,680
They shot my daughter! "(echoes)"

530
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,760
Come on out where I can see you,
you son of a bitch.

531
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,890
Baby.

532
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,720
Nothing to it.

533
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,880
Charlie!

534
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,600
She's all right, Mr McGee. Take it easy.

535
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,320
Where is she? I wanna see her.

536
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,040
All in good time. First, let's talk.

537
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,560
Let's get acquainted.

538
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,640
Go to hell.

539
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,400
I tell you, she's gonna be all right.

540
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,480
No. No.

541
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,840
- What do you want with us?
- I told you, Mr McGee.

542
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,400
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other

543
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,360
and I want to introduce myself.

544
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,800
I'm Dr Pynchot.

545
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

546
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,680
Is this The Shop?

547
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,200
This is The Shop.

548
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,080
(bleeping)

549
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,160
Hi, Charlene.

550
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,160
- I'm Captain Hollister. May I come in?
- Where's my daddy?

551
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,360
I brought you some cocoa.

552
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,760
I don't want anything.

553
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,040
There's nothing to be afraid of. Here.

554
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,760
You see? Go on.

555
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,400
Well, maybe later.

556
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

557
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,920
I know you may not believe this
but I've actually begun to think of you

558
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,800
as my own daughter.

559
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,600
- What have you done to my father?
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.

560
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,080
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

561
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,120
and he wants you to cooperate with us.

562
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,360
You're a liar.

563
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:11,359
What kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

564
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,280
- Go to hell!
- Oh?

565
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,280
A very stubborn nice little girl.
That's all right, I understand.

566
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,120
I know you're tired
and you're not sure where you are.

567
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,320
So I just want to ease your mind, Charlie.
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

568
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,360
All right, Charlene.

569
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,440
You are here because I'm very interested
in this ability that you have.

570
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,440
Pyrokinesis.

571
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,640
Yes.

572
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,440
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

573
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,320
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

574
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,050
you'll be doing this great country of ours
a big favour if you cooperate.

575
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,000
I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I wanna see my father.

576
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,560
OK.

577
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,730
Um...

578
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,440
Why don't you drink the cocoa
and get some sleep?

579
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,120
If there's anything you want,
just pick up the phone and let us know.

580
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,720
I know you'll find this
hard to believe now, Charlie, but...

581
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,000
you and me are gonna be pals.

582
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,560
Never.

583
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,480
Never say never.

584
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,560
I'll see you, Charlie.

585
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,560
(bleeping)

586
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,640
Good night, Charlie.

587
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,600
Just back off. Back off.

588
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,000
No!

589
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,080
You're not gonna do it.

590
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,680
Back off!

591
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,520
- Come on, take these pills.
- (he gags)

592
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,600
Come on, swallow.

593
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,440
(swallows, gasps)

594
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,680
- Now we have So Red So Beautiful.
- Look what I have here.

595
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,160
- A wind-up cat doll.
- "(music box plays)"

596
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,960
Listen to that, sweetheart.
Isn't that pretty?

597
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,130
Huh?

598
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,120
Sure you want this...

599
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,520
(video game music )

600
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,680
Hi, kid.

601
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,120
You go ahead with your game.
I'll start in the bedroom.

602
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,920
My name's John.

603
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,840
They call you Charlie, don't they?

604
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,760
Hey...

605
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,760
Hey...

606
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,280
You wanna teach me? I'm terrible
at games. You can beat me all the time.

607
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,450
No.

608
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,360
Where's Charlie?
What are you doing with her?

609
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,720
She's perfectly all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

610
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,080
- Yeah, well, I wanna see her, goddamn it.
- Just behave yourself.

611
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,960
Do as we ask, we'll see.

612
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,920
You bastards.

613
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,600
Are you gonna do the test or not?

614
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,200
Oh, sure. Well, sure.

615
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,080
Good deal.

616
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,480
It's a one-way glass.
You won't see us but we'll see you.

617
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,880
All right, send him in.

618
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,640
- Hi, how are you?
- Having the time of my life. Sit down.

619
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:12,640
Did they tell you anything about what
we're supposed to be doing in here?

620
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,920
All they told me was to come talk to you.

621
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,640
You look nervous.
Thirsty? Want some water?

622
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,200
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

623
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,200
You know,
they mentioned something about a test.

624
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,480
- Uh-huh.
- You want some water?

625
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,560
No, I'll pass.

626
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,600
(yelps)

627
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,960
(groans)

628
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,560
Why don't you put some ink in it?

629
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,920
Put ink in it?

630
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,960
You gotta be crazy.

631
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,040
- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.

632
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,200
He's been on the run too long.

633
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,400
- All those damn pills haven't helped.
- Just give me time.

634
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,880
Rainbird's right.
He's lost it and time won't help.

635
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,080
Increase his medication.
I'll decide what to do with him later.

636
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,200
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

637
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,480
With a little luck, before long,
she'll trust me like a brother.

638
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,640
(thunder)

639
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,120
(bleeping)

640
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,360
Hi, kid, how are you doing?

641
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,520
Why do you come here every day?
I'm not messy.

642
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,280
It's just my job, kid.

643
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,320
Because they're all full of shit. Why else?

644
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,400
(chuckles)

645
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,040
I wanna see my father.

646
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,640
Sure you do.

647
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,120
I wish I could help.
I don't even know where the man is.

648
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,000
This is a big place, Charlie.

649
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,880
They say they'll let me see him if I...
if I do something.

650
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,960
- And I don't want to.
- "(chuckles)" Well...

651
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,250
Can it be that bad,
what they want you to do?

652
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,760
I mean, if just by doing it,
you can get to see your old man.

653
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,840
It is.

654
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,840
(thunder)

655
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,600
Storm's coming on. Sure hope
those lights don't go off altogether.

656
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,880
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.

657
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,360
Hey...

658
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,080
Listen.

659
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,960
Are you scared by my face?

660
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,560
I mean,
I could wear a mask or something.

661
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,960
I've seen worse.

662
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,200
(door rattles)

663
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,560
Kid! Kid, please!

664
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,760
I can't stand the dark. Please, kid.

665
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,920
Kid!

666
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,800
- I gotta get outta here. Help me.
- Use your card.

667
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,760
All the electricity's gone. The card's
no good. Hey, let me outta here.

668
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,080
Hey! Let me out!

669
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,480
- What's the matter?
- Let us out. There's people in here.

670
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,240
- Stop it, we're OK.
- "(he weeps)"

671
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,840
I mean, aren't we?

672
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

673
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:59,160
It's just... the dark. I can't stand it.

674
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,160
It's just like the place they put me
when I was captured.

675
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,640
- Who put you?
- The Cong.

676
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,240
- Who's the Cong?
- You mean to tell me...?

677
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,680
Oh, no, of course not, you're too young.

678
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,400
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

679
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,760
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pyjamas.

680
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,160
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

681
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,160
Only about six of us got out.

682
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,840
We ran.

683
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,840
Went the wrong way.

684
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,120
They caught me.

685
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,360
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

686
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,360
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

687
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
What did you eat?

688
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,560
They threw down rotted rice.

689
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,720
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

690
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,480
Live ones. Big spiders. I'd chase them
around in the dark and eat them.

691
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,520
Gross.

692
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,000
They turned me into an animal.

693
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,600
You got it easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

694
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,000
Like a rat in the trap.

695
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,000
You think maybe they'll get
the lights back on pretty soon?

696
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,200
Doesn't matter. We're together.

697
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:21,920
God, kid. If some day I could help you
the way you're helping me...

698
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:27,080
You could.
You could get a message to my father.

699
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,800
You know, what's it all about? Why do
they have you and your daddy here?

700
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,440
What do they want you to do?

701
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,200
They won't make me take any more pills.

702
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,160
No more pills, you bastard.

703
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,200
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

704
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,720
Listen,
maybe I could get in to see your dad?

705
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,870
- You could? You really think you could?
- I could change with Herbie, an orderly.

706
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,920
I could see your dad, tell him you're OK...
Maybe not tell him, pass him a note.

707
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,280
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Shit.

708
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,280
Maybe you oughta light
the damn fires if you can.

709
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,640
I told you, it's like letting a wild animal
out of a cage.

710
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,920
I promised myself I'd never do it again.

711
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,560
That men at the airport, those men at
the farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

712
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,960
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defence.

713
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,600
Yes, but that's no excuse.

714
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,160
Also sounded like you saved
your dad's life.

715
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,280
Look, if you do what they want you to do,

716
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,160
only as much as you want to do, it might
be the way for you to get out of here.

717
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,280
I'll help anyway I can.

718
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,080
Oh, my! Light.

719
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,160
Hold on here.

720
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,960
I'm sorry you got stuck with me
in here, John.

721
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,480
But I'm awful glad too.

722
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,960
You look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

723
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,080
Attagirl.

724
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,160
There we go.

725
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,920
That's the girl.

726
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,640
You just relax
and you'll be asleep in no time.

727
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,960
And you'll have sweet, sweet dreams.

728
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,320
That's the girl.

729
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,520
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.

730
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,200
Daddy.

731
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,680
Now, Charlie, you know
what you're supposed to do.

732
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:15,080
I want you to go in the other room. I don't
want to have to look at you while I do this.

733
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,000
Something might happen.

734
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,200
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

735
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,720
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

736
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,240
- Everything all right with her?
- Yes.

737
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,840
- You all set in there?
- Ready in here.

738
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,040
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

739
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,160
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

740
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,240
Go ahead, Charlene.

741
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,600
Wood chips. They should've given me
something harder.

742
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,880
Something's happening in there.

743
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,360
- Temperature just jumped ten degrees.
- "(bleeping)"

744
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,280
There it goes.

745
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,560
Her alpha patterns
look like the goddamn Andes.

746
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,560
She did it. By God, she did it
and we got it all on tape.

747
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,320
Back off. Just back off.

748
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,240
Back off.

749
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,320
Look at the tub.

750
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,760
Back off.

751
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,280
Did you see the water boil?
And the temperature?

752
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,520
- Jesus, did we get the audio?
- We got it.

753
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,400
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

754
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,440
My God, is there anyone here that has
any doubt she didn't make that happen?

755
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,040
Not at all, Chief. None.

756
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,600
I knew something would happen
but I had no idea.

757
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,440
That tray flew and she controlled it.
Then she put her power in the tub.

758
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,450
We got all on tape
and it's good enough to stand up in court.

759
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,720
Right up in the Supreme Court.
What are you looking so miserable about?

760
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,440
You got her to do it by promising
she could see her father again.

761
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,520
- She must never see him.
- We never intended to let her.

762
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,280
She'll never stop asking for it. Suppose by
some strange accident they get together.

763
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,160
- Suppose they do.
- She does whatever he tells her.

764
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,000
Suppose he persuades her
to destroy us all.

765
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,720
- No chance.
- There's always a chance.

766
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,480
He's right.
They can never see each other again.

767
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,080
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

768
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,250
Huh?

769
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,390
Your technician must've had
an appointment he forgot about.

770
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,880
He went out of here in a hell of a rush.
He also left the door open

771
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
and your firestarter just walked out.

772
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,880
Christ.
One of you men go and get her.

773
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,080
Go on.

774
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,240
Sure.

775
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,560
Which of you would like
to go and get the little girl?

776
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,840
- (knocking)
- Andy?

777
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,680
Here you go, buddy.

778
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,520
Oh, good.

779
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,560
Listen, Andy,

780
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,920
we've determined that your power
has deteriorated since you got here.

781
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,640
In fact, we've had no positive results at all.

782
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,400
What do you expect with all these drugs?

783
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,280
You expect me to do my best
when I'm stoned?

784
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,080
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could.

785
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,000
Yes, of course I know that you have
and believe me, I appreciate it very much.

786
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,280
In fact, I think you need a rest.

787
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:06,480
Did you know that The Shop has a small
compound on the island of Maui, Hawaii?

788
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,360
How would it be if I sent you there
for the immediate future?

789
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,600
- I still get my medication?
- Oh, sure, all you need.

790
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,080
- Well, that sounds nice.
- All right, good deal.

791
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,360
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

792
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,240
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

793
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,480
(bleeping, door closes)

794
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,160
(groans)

795
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,240
She's so beautiful. What's her name?

796
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:20,360
"(laughs)" Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

797
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,200
What does necromancer mean?

798
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,720
I think it means something like wizard
or sorcerer. Something like that.

799
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,120
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

800
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:39,960
How did I know they were gonna be so
damn stubborn? You have to do it again.

801
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,880
- But when will I ever stop?
- Look, baby.

802
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,720
It's like poker.

803
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,640
If you ain't dealing from strength,
you ain't dealing.

804
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,840
Every time you light one of their fires,
make sure you get something in return.

805
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,280
This is your old Uncle John talking,
you understand me?

806
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,760
OK.

807
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,600
What about this power of yours?
You were awful scared about it before.

808
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,000
How'd you feel about it now?

809
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,920
It's different now. It's a lot stronger.

810
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,720
Yesterday, when I told it to back off, it did.

811
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,400
It was like I let it out
in a single straight line and then...

812
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,640
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no. I put it into the water.

813
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,040
If I pulled it back into myself,
I guess I'd burn up.

814
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,520
When am I gonna get to see my father?

815
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,960
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

816
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,160
Next time, there has to be more water.

817
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,360
Everything all set here?

818
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,880
Tape running? All right, stand by.

819
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,960
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

820
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,880
(cracking)

821
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,800
The temperature
should be -26 degrees Celsius.

822
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,680
Plus or minus five degrees.
It's 40 in there.

823
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,240
- The blocks are starting to burn.
- Cinder blocks.

824
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,840
(cracking)

825
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,040
God.

826
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,400
Back off. Just back off.

827
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,160
Back off. Just back off.

828
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,000
Back off.

829
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,760
I wanna see my father.

830
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,960
You better tell her something.

831
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,880
Soon, Charlie.

832
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,480
When you show us a little more.

833
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:15,160
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

834
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,040
Do you hear me?
I'll make something happen.

835
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,680
(television)

836
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,800
(TV) Time for lunch.

837
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,560
Well, instant banquet.

838
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,320
Nice, table companion.

839
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,400
(Woody Woodpecker laughs)

840
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,650
I'm telling you, we're not through
with testing her.

841
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,160
You saw what she's capable of.
She hasn't even reached her potential.

842
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:04,640
Perhaps Herman would like to see her
blow up a country before he gives in.

843
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,770
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form an opinion

844
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,040
based on two experiments.

845
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,840
I'm satisfied, yes, but only partially.

846
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,480
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

847
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,240
It's all taken care of.

848
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,400
Night, Doc.

849
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,960
Rainbird.

850
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,040
Have you considered what might happen

851
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,750
if that girl found out
whose side you're really on?

852
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,240
Oh, yes, I have.

853
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,880
I'd say you stand a good chance of finding
out what a steak feels like in a microwave.

854
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,320
Would you shed a bitter tear?

855
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,360
No.

856
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,320
No point in lying to you about that.

857
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,200
When we find out
all we need to know from her...

858
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,200
When you give her to me.

859
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,600
What are you gonna do with her?

860
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:31,000
John the friendly orderly will come in.

861
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,120
He will greet her, talk to her,
get her to smile.

862
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,720
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy cos he's the only one who can.

863
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,760
When John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

864
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:51,480
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

865
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,080
and sending bone fragments
into her brain.

866
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:01,400
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

867
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,560
He will know her power.

868
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,600
And when he dies,

869
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,560
which I hope is very soon,

870
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:18,120
perhaps he can take that power with him
into the other world.

871
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,160
You are crazy.

872
01:25:41,071 --> 01:25:47,719
"(Hollister)" I've made all the arrangements
for you to go to Hawaii.

873
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,920
- Good. When am I going?
- Today.

874
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,280
- Today?
- Well, 8.00 this evening.

875
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,480
- How?
- First class comfort all the way.

876
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,960
I mean, what's taking me?

877
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,840
You go from here
by helicopter to the base,

878
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,640
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

879
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,960
Hmm.

880
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,440
- 8.00?
- 8.00.

881
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,920
You know, that could bite you.

882
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,520
- What?
- That snake you're holding.

883
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,000
Christ, how did that get there?

884
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,360
I guess you just picked it up from a bush.

885
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,160
I want you to contact that helicopter pilot.

886
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,080
No.

887
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,160
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

888
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,680
Contact the pilot
and tell him you'll be coming along.

889
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,840
I won't be coming along.

890
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,040
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

891
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,240
- My daughter will be with us.
- Oh, no.

892
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,000
She can't come. She's far too dangerous.

893
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:26,360
Oh, yeah? Well, who do you think
made her dangerous?

894
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,400
My daughter is coming along.

895
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,560
I don't want you to contradict me again,
do you understand?

896
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,640
Yes, of course.

897
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:52,880
You contact the helicopter and let him
take us as far as the army plane.

898
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,920
There has to be a refuelling stop
between here and Hawaii.

899
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,520
- We'll have to refuel in California.
- Yeah.

900
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,320
OK.

901
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,680
- Do you have paper and a pen?
- Sure.

902
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,960
Here you go.

903
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,320
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

904
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,080
- You're gonna take it to her.
- Yes, of course.

905
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,280
Charlie, love.

906
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,560
First thing, when you finish reading this,
flush it down the toilet, OK?

907
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,880
Second thing,
if everything goes the way I'm planning,

908
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,400
we're gonna be out of here tonight.

909
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:33,080
Third thing,
I want you to be in the stables at 8.00.

910
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,280
I'll arrange for somebody to bring you.

911
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,400
I miss you, Charlie. I love you so much.

912
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,040
(bleeping)

913
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,000
- John!
- Hi, baby.

914
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,040
- I have to talk to you.
- Yeah, what about?

915
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,840
I'll tell you in the hall.

916
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,440
- They listen here.
- Right.

917
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:02,560
My daddy's found a way
for us to get out of here.

918
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,120
I'm supposed to meet him
at the stables at 8.00 tonight.

919
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,840
- That's great. How did he do it?
- I don't know, but isn't it wonderful?

920
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,080
Better. It's a miracle. I'll take you.

921
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:16,600
No, you'd get in trouble.
I wouldn't do that to you. You're my friend.

922
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,840
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

923
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,240
(bleeping)

924
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,560
Hi, Charlie.

925
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:35,040
My name's Mike. Captain Hollister has
assigned me to take you to the stables.

926
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,360
- What time?
- Well, let's see.

927
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,920
I'll be back for you
about quarter to eight this evening.

928
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,160
So, what's going on?

929
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,720
- I asked if I could go riding at night-time.
- Oh?

930
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,920
Sure, kid, anything you want.

931
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,320
- Bye.
- See you later.

932
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,440
(whinneying)

933
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,440
Come to me, Charlie.

934
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,080
OK, let's check you in here.

935
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,200
Hey!

936
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,440
Anybody here?

937
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,480
- You can go now.
- I have the kid with me.

938
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,920
I said you can go now!

939
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,800
- Get out of here.
- Can't do it, Charlie.

940
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,280
Back off. Back off.

941
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,000
Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

942
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,760
Charlie.

943
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,840
Charlie.

944
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,560
John? John?

945
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,800
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

946
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,840
John...

947
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,960
I'm really glad you're here
but if anybody found out...

948
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:35,520
That doesn't matter any more.
The only thing that matters is you and me.

949
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,920
How'd you get Charlie to cooperate?

950
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,920
- Rainbird got her to do it.
- Who's Rainbird?

951
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:45,720
He's an agent, an exterminator. Charlene
thinks he's an orderly named John.

952
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,480
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

953
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,640
- My father should be here any minute.
- I know.

954
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,920
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.

955
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,040
That's it. Come on.

956
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,960
Good.

957
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,280
Good girl. Right...

958
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,750
- "(Andy)" Are you armed?
- "(Hollister)" Yes.

959
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,280
- Charlie?
- Daddy!

960
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,720
Yeah. Oh.

961
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:33,120
- Let me look at you.
- Is it true? Are we really going away?

962
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:37,480
Yes, it's true, we're really going away.

963
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,640
Baby.

964
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,080
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

965
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:50,800
- My friend John is here.
- The orderly?

966
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,800
Yeah, he's up there.

967
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,760
Couldn't we take him with us
if he wants to come?

968
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,840
He's the one that shot us, baby.
He's the one that brought us here.

969
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,000
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

970
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,080
No.

971
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,160
He is with them.

972
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,920
- It isn't true, is it?
- Yes, it's true.

973
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,400
- Where are you, you son of a bitch?
- You tricked me, you lied to me.

974
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:36,560
No, I just mixed up the truth a little,
Charlie. And I did it to save your life.

975
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:41,000
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, cos I can do it.

976
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,160
I know you can.

977
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,240
But if you do, you're gonna burn up
an awful lot of horses.

978
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:51,200
Can't you hear them?
Necromancer's in one of those stalls.

979
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,320
No, I'm not gonna do it.

980
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,280
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

981
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,760
No! Back off.

982
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,040
Please, don't. Back off.

983
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,880
You're not gonna do it.

984
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,840
Don't. Back off. Back off!

985
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,960
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

986
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:42,160
You can't just be let go. I don't think
your father even believes that now.

987
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,640
- You're dangerous and you know it.
- That's not my fault.

988
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,160
I know that. I don't care about that.
I never did. All I care about is you.

989
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:54,160
Now, come up here!
Don't make me shoot your father.

990
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:58,120
- Don't listen to him, Charlie.
- You promise he'll be all right?

991
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,400
- I give you my real word.
- Don't do it, baby.

992
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

993
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,000
Kill him.

994
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,160
Jump.

995
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,080
No.

996
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,760
No!

997
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,560
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?

998
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,720
- Charlie...
- Daddy! Daddy!

999
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,120
- You're bleeding.
- Charlie!

1000
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,730
Daddy!

1001
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,880
- Look at me.
- Go on.

1002
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,880
Charlie, look at me.

1003
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,000
That's it. So I can see your eyes.

1004
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,720
I love you, Charlie.

1005
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,680
I love you.

1006
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,760
(screaming)

1007
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:41,000
(over PA) I say again, Condition
Bright Yellow. This is not a drill.

1008
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,280
Repeat, not a drill.

1009
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:48,080
Converge on stables. Use caution.
It's the girl and she's using it.

1010
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,960
You gotta get away if you can, Charlie.

1011
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:58,720
If you have to kill anybody that gets
in your way, I want you to do it.

1012
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:03,160
You let them know that this is a war,
Charlie.

1013
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,400
You have to get out of here.

1014
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,080
Do it for me.

1015
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,200
Do it for me, baby, do you understand?

1016
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,080
You make it. You make it so they can't
ever do anything like this again.

1017
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,360
You'll have to burn it all down, baby.

1018
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,440
Burn it all down.

1019
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,200
Daddy...

1020
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:41,840
Go on. Get outta here
before it all goes up.

1021
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,160
I can't leave you.

1022
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,280
I can't leave you, Daddy.

1023
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,720
Oh...

1024
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,440
I love you, Charlie...

1025
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,720
Oh, no, Daddy.

1026
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,720
Get the door. Ready?

1027
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,000
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

1028
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,960
(screaming)

1029
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,520
Oh, my God!

1030
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,760
Get her! Get her!

1031
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,760
- Run! Run for it!
- Let's go!

1032
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,600
Come on, let's get out of here.

1033
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,040

No! No!

1037
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,360
(screaming)

1038
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,960
Take cover!

1039
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,480
Take cover!

1040
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,280
No... Stop!

1041
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,720
No! No!

1042
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,440
No! No!

1043
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,600
(man) Attention!

1044
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,000
Stay right where you are.

1045
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:46,160
Do not move. We're coming down.

1046
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,120

For you, Daddy.

1050
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:34,120
- Irv, look who's here.
- Thanks for the ride.

1051
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,320
"(lrv)" You'll be safe now, Charlie.

1052
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,560
I'm doing it, Daddy.

1053
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,640
I love you.
