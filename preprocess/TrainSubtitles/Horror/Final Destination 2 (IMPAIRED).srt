00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,941
HOST:
Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary...

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,027
...since Volee Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed...

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,739
...shortly after takeoff from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,699
It’s a disaster that's affected many.

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,410
None more so than
Mount Abraham High School...

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,702
...which lost 40 students
and four faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,711
But it was the events after the crash...

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,295
...that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,087
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed...

10
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,929
...died soon thereafter in a series
of mysterious and bizarre accidents.

11
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,844
Now, to some,
these deaths are just tragic coincidences...

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,016
...but to others, they're an indication that
there are more sinister events taking place.

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,150
That's the contention of
uh, tonight's guest.

14
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,108
-Thank you for joining us this evening.
GUEST: Thank you for having me.

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,070
Ahem. And I appreciate you using
the word "sinister. "

16
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,825
Most people say "supernatural. "

17
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,158
They think I'm talking about ghosts
and witches and stuff like that.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
HOST: Well, here's your chance
to set the record straight, so ....

19
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,910
GUEST:
Great. Okay, well...

20
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,500
...I believe that there 's a sort of force...

21
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:25,966
...uh, an unseen malevolent presence
that's all around us every day.

22
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,553
And it determines when we live and die.

23
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,811
And some people call this force the devil.

24
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,722
You know, but I think
that whole religious thing is ....

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,983
So I prefer to call it death itself

26
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,440
HOST:
So I'm surrounded by death?

27
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,571
G U EST:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,451
Every day, everywhere, all the time.

29
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,737
And that's what I want people
to understand...

30
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:55,078
...that death has this grand design
that we all Ht into.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,121
So when Alex Browning got off that plane
and took the other survivors with him...

32
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,756
...he basically screwed up death 's plan.

33
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,542
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

34
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:11,182
HOST: And the fact that all of the survivors
have died is your evidence of this?

35
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,474
GUEST: Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died...

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,185
...but it's the way that they died.

37
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:23,903
I mean, there were so many weird, seemingly
random things about the way they died.

38
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,280
Lt just didn't make sense.

39
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,658
You know, that's the proof
that there's something out there--

40
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,162
HOST: Wait, that's not proof l mean,
that is your interpretation of events...

41
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,871
...that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

42
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,956
MALE VOICE:
Kimberly.

43
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,086
GUEST: Yeah, but you should be
more open-minded--

44
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,373
HOST: What happened after
that was just coincidence.

45
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,132
GUEST:
May I finish ?

46
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,132
A mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

47
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,343
But not all of them
including their teachers.

48
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:56,852
HOST: Yes, but people die all the time,
so why should this be any different?

49
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:02,855
Lt forced people to question
these so-called everyday coincidences.

50
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,689
What if they were something more?

51
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,024
-What if you could do something about it?
HOST: Ha, ha.

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,315
Please, are you listening to yourself?
This is crazy.

53
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,031
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

54
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,992
GUEST:
That's exactly what I'm saying.

55
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,747
Exactly it.

56
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,033
And in order to survive...

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,831
...the only way to survive
is to look beneath the visible world.

58
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,921
Because in the end,
no one can escape death.

59
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,304
And today may be your day to die.
