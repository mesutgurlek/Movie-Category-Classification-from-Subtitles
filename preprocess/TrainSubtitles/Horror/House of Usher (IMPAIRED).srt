Sir?

My name is Philip Winthrop.

Miss Usher and I
are engaged to be married.

9

I cannot admit you, sir.

10
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,819
Cannot?
By whose order?

11
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,783
Mr Roderick, her brother.

12
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,653
He has expressly forbidden...
Then I shall speak to him.

13

I insist you announce me.

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,039
Yes, sir.
If you'll just come in.

15
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,423
Your coat, sir.

16
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,351
If you'll just follow me.

17
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,061
Yes? What is it?

18
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,984
Your boots, sir.

19
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,366
What about them?

20
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,362
Do you mind taking them off?

21
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,997

22
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,749
What on earth for?

23
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,167
I'm sure Mr Roderick
will explain it to you, sir.

24
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,550
A strange request.

25

I've ever been...

26
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,592
Sir!

27
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,548
If you'd care to put
these on, sir.

28

29
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,604
Well, if we may go now.

30
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,365
This way, sir.

31
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,401
What is the meaning of this?

32
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,358
I---

33
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,322
This is Mr Winthrop, sir.

34
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,033
How dare you
admit anyone into this house?

35
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,868
WINTHROP:
I insisted, sir.

36
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,579
I felt I had the right.

37
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,870
Well, we can't talk out here.

38

Please come in.

39
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,548
I gather you know who I am, sir.
If you please...

40
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,551
Mr Winthrop, softly.

41
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,268
An affliction of the hearing.

42
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:33,235
Sounds of any exaggerated degree
cut into my brain like knives.

43
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,438
My apologies.

44
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,908
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave, Mr Winthrop.

45
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,448
I've come to see Madeline.

46
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,118
That is quite impossible.

47
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,370
She is confined to her bed.

48
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,459
Mr Usher, your sister
and I are betrothed.

49
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,881
It was a mistake.
I don't believe that.

50
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,130
Please don't argue with me, sir.

51
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,679
You must leave this house now.

52
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,559
It is not a healthy place
for you to be.

53
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,022
Mr Usher...

54
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,151
I have ridden all the way
from Boston to see Madeline,

55
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,694
and I do not intend to leave
without seeing her.

56
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,533
Now, if...
WOMAN: Philip!

58
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,209
Madeline, in heaven's name,
you must return to your bed.

59
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,663
Madeline.

60
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,837
You came all the way
just to see me?

61
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,756
Yes, to see you.

62
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,844
Madeline, I must insist.

63
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,883
We shall talk later, Philip.
Mr Winthrop is leaving.

64
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,428
Leaving?
I'm not leaving.

65
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,057
He must stay, Roderick.

66
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,185
Please let him stay, Roderick.

67
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,397
Very well, he will stay.

68
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,196
Now, for pity's sake,
return to your bed.

RODERICK: What happened?

71
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,072
I think your fireplace
needs a screen.

72
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,444
Does it?

73
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,541
I was just admiring this painting here.
Is it your own work?

74
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,163
It is.
And you also play this lute?

75
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,174
I do.

76
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,880
Mr Winthrop, are you actually
planning to marry my sister?

77
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,807
Mr Usher,

78
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,062
during the time we spent together in
Boston, it never occurred to me that...

79
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,766
and I dare say to
Madeline either,

80
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,815
that we were not destined
for each other.

81
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,486
When she left me, she said to me,
"I will love you forever."

82
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,745
Does it seem so incredible, then,
that I would want to marry her?

83
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,330
If you only knew how incredible.

84
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,917
And I suppose this...

85
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,166
this vision includes children?

86
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,215
God willing.
God willing!

87
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,462
If you knew the nightmare
you are picturing for me, sir.

88
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,009
Nightmare?
That's what I said.

89
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,930
Why shouldn't Madeline marry
and have children?

90
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,598
Because the Usher line
is tainted, Mr Winthrop.

91
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,022
Tainted, sir?
You saw Madeline and you see me.

92
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,937
We are dying, Mr Winthrop.

93
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,483
As you saw her today,
she is and will remain.

94
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,331
Believe me, sir,
I bear you no malice.

95
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,371
Were things otherwise, I should
welcome you into our family joyously.

96
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,216
But under the circumstances
it is quite impossible.

97
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,712
But why do you assume that...
that you are dying?

98
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,890
There are many reasons.

99
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,134
Pray give me one, then.

100
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,062
Madeline and I
are like figures of fine glass.

101
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,732
The slightest touch
and we may shatter.

102
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,992
Both of us suffer from
a morbid acuteness of the senses.

103
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,654
Mine is the worse
for having existed the longer,

104
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,122
but both of us are
afflicted with it.

105
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,664
Any sort of food more exotic
than the most pallid mash

106
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,289
is unendurable to my taste buds.

107
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,965
Any sort of garment other than
the softest is agony to my flesh.

108
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:14,258
My eyes are tormented by
all but the faintest illumination.

109
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,019
Odours assail me constantly.

110
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,643
And, as I've said,
sounds of any degree whatsoever

111
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,518
inspire me with terror.

112
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,987
That's why your servant asked
me to remove my boots.

113
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,148
Yes.

114
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,867
And even so,
I could hear your coming.

115
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,204
Every footstep,
every rustle of your clothes.

116
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,915
I could hear your
horse approaching,

117
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,788
hear the clatter of its hooves
across the courtyard, your knock...

118
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,917
The grating of the door bolt
was like a sword stroke to my ears.

119
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,215
I can hear the scratch of rat
claws within the stone wall.

120
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:03,190
Mr Winthrop, three-quarters of
my family have fallen into madness,

121
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,903
and in their madness have
acquired a superhuman strength,

122
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,111
so that it took the power
of many to subdue them.

123
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,030

00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,284
Nothing too good
for the future Mrs Winthrop.

329
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,115
Mrs Winthrop...

330
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,198
Open your mouth.

331
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,501
I'm not hungry.

332
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,836
Madeline, I'll have
no scrawny woman in my home.

333
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,923
Open your mouth.
Come on.

334
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,263
Madeline, get ready to leave.

335
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,262
I want to, Philip.
Then you will.

336
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,263
I can't.
Why?

337
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,024
Because very soon
I shall be dead.

338
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,064
I forbid you
to say that ever again.

339
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,814
It's true, Philip.
It is not true, Madeline.

340
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,656
You're full of life.

341
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:08,537
Look at me, Philip.
Do I look full of life?

342
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,453
I remember you
as you were in Boston.

343
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,621
Do you remember?

344
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,338
You were exuberant. You were
filled with the joy of living.

345
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,927
That's how you'll be again when you
leave here and become my wife.

346
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,759
I wish you could understand.

347
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,510
Then let me understand, Madeline.
Let me, so that I can help you.

348
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,357
Perhaps you'll feel differently
after you've seen.

349
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,698
(CREAKING)

350
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,842
Where are we going?

351
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,836
You'll see.

352
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,689
Careful, darling.

353
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,420
You don't want to go in there.
I want you to see.

354
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,221
Put your weight against it.

355
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,991
(GATE CREAKS)

356
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,870
Here they all are.
The Ushers.

357
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,924
It's the lack of air in here.

358
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,094
It's the air itself.

359
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,764
Nothing can survive it long.

360
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,978
My great-grandfather.

361
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,701
His wife.

362
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,714
My grandfather.

363
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,686
My grandmother.

364
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,356
My father.

365
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,074
My mother.

366
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,599
This is monstrous!

367
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,061
Whose idea was this?
Your dear brother's?

368
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,350
There's one for him too.

369
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,599
Does that absolve him?

370
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,185
It waits for me.

371
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,608
No, it does not.

372
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,992
They all wait for me.

373
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,119
Oh, Madeline, Madeline,
you must stop this.

374
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,124
Can't you see
what you're doing to yourself?

375
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,712
You don't understand.

376
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,003
I understand, but you must
leave the dead to themselves.

377
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,876
Oh, Madeline,
come away with me now.

378
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,340
(SCREAMS)

379
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,768
What have you done?

380
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,941
Give her to me.

381
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,856
Thank you.
See to the crypt, will you?

382
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,945
Yes, sir.

383
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,084
Well, are you content now,
Mr Winthrop?

384
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,250
It is not I who force her
to live in a cemetery.

385
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,049
Do you think
that I wish her harm?

386
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,337
I think you still
do not understand.

387
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,635
And I think it's time
that you did.

388
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,348
The tarn is very deep.

389
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,271
One of the Usher women
drowned herself in it.

390
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,269
She was never found.

391
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,236
I dare say it's deep enough
to swallow this house entire.

392
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,950
I'm waiting, Mr Usher.

393
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,655
Last night you asked me
about the singular aridity

394
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,783
of the land around this house.

395
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,913
Once this land was fertile.

396
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,713
Farms abounded. Earth yielded
her riches at harvest time.

397
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:43,591
There were trees and plant life,
flowers, fields of grain.

398
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,388
There was great beauty here.

399
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,226
At that time this water
was clear and fresh.

400
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,976
Swans glided
upon its crystal surface.

401
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,731
Animals came to its bank,
trustingly, to drink.

402
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,735
But this was long before my time.

403
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,414
Why do you tell me these things?

404
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,128
And then something crept
across the land and blighted it.

405
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,794
The trees lost their foliage.

406
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,510
The flowers languished and died.

407
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,263
Shrubs grew brown and shrivelled.

408
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,097
The grain fields perished.

409
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:33,398
The lakes and ponds
became black and stagnant.

410
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,937
And the land withered
as before a plague.

411
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,981
A plague?

412
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,780
Yes, Mr Winthrop.

413
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,242
A plague of evil.

414
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,365
Anthony Usher.

415
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,834
Thief, usurer...

416
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,254
merchant of flesh.

417
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,797
Bernard Usher.

418
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,180
Swindler, forger,

419
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,096
jewel thief, drug addict.

420
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,764
Francis Usher.

421
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,983
Professional assassin.

422
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,406
Vivian Usher. Blackmailer...

423
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,152
harlot, murderess.

424
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,656
She died in the madhouse.

425
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,085
Captain David Usher.

426
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,795
Smuggler, slave-trader...

427
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,248
mass murderer.

428
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:47,256
Mr Usher, I don't see that this has
anything to do with Madeline and myself.

429
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,851
I don't believe in the sins of the
fathers being visited upon the children.

430
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,099
You do not, sir?

431
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,403
The House of Usher
seems to you, then, normal?

432
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,367
The house, sir, is neither
normal nor abnormal.

433
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,485
It is only a house.

434
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,159
You are very wrong,
Mr Winthrop.

435
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,250
This house is centuries old.
It was brought here from England.

436
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,745
And with it
every evil rooted in its stones.

437
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,588
You really believe this!

438
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,549
Evil is not just a word,
it is a reality.

439
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:33,101
Like any living thing, it can be created.
It was created by these people.

440
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:42,102
The history of the Ushers is a
history of savage degradations.

441
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,900
First in England,
and then in New England.

442
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,650
And always in this house.

443
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,661
Always in this house.

444
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,661
The pall of evil
which fills it is no illusion.

445
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,876
For hundreds of years,

446
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,713
foul thoughts and foul deeds have
been committed within its walls.

447
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,174
The house itself is evil now.

448
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,218
No, I... I cannot believe this.
But you must.

449
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,343
For Madeline's sake,
you must.

450
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,311
Most of all
does this evil reside in her.

451
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,940
And this is your
dreadful secret?

452
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,601
Mr Winthrop,

453
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,031
do you think those coals jumping from
the fire onto you were an accident?

454
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,869
Do you think that chandelier
falling was an accident?

455
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,363
Do you think that falling
casket was an accident?

456
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,287
Are you trying to tell me that the
house made those things happen?

457
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,784
Yes.

458
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,167
Oh, no, sir.
That's ridiculous.

459
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,465
But even if it were true...

460
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:51,053
even if this house were
full of evil, Madeline is not.

461
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,094
Nor, for all of your talk,
are you.

462
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:58,220
You cannot take my sister
out of this house.

463
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,267
If she were to wed and
bear children,

464
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,517
the Usher evil would spread anew -
malignant, cancerous.

465
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,985
You are mad. I will not listen to you.
Yes, you will.

466
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,275
No, I will not!

467
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,570
I'll tell you what's evil
in this house, sir. You!

468
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,116
I will not let your sickened
fancies destroy Madeline's life!

469
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,743
She leaves with me today.

470
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,384
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

471
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
Who is it?

472
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,342
We're leaving... now.

473
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,760
Philip...
Madeline, you have no other choice.

474
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,015
If you remain here,
this house will destroy you.

475
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,897
Then you know.

476
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,067
Your brother has poisoned you
with his absurdities.

477
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:54,944
This entire atmosphere of sickness
and disillusion is his doing.

478
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:02,284
Madeline, there's nothing wrong with you
that leaving this house won't cure.

479
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,377
Do you love me?

480
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,925
You know I do.
Then leave with me now.

481
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,966
I Will.

482
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,519
Pack just a few belongings.
I'll get my things ready.

483
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,268
How will we go?
You'll ride with me.

484
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,110
Later on we'll get a
coach to Boston.

485
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,736
Oh, Philip, can it truly be?

486
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,076
Darling, within an hour
we'll be away from here.

487
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,072
I love you.

488
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,121

No, I will not listen.

491

I've been here long enough.
Please let me go.

492
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,105
I don't care what you say!
You can't keep me here!

493

Madeline!

502
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,973
What have you done to her?

503
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,114
Madeline?

504

No.

511
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,494
Yes, she's dead.

512
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:48,075
I told you she could
never leave this house.

513
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,248
What did you do to her?
I didn't touch her.

514
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,246
You killed her!

515
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,465
There is no mark on her.

516
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,835
You are the one who killed her.

517
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,131
I...
I told you she was not well,

518
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,508
and yet you persisted.

519
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,933
Her heart could not withstand
the strain you put upon it.

520
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,017
No.

521
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,727
It's no matter now.

522
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:21,032
At least she has been spared
the agony of trying to escape.

523
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,420
One candle left to burn now...

524
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,270
before the darkness comes.

525
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:23,929
At least...
she has found peace now.

526
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,597
Has she?

527
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,305
Why do you say that?

528
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:36,149
Because I do not believe that for
the Ushers there is peace hereafter.

529
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,314
Is there no end to your horrors?

530
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,109
No.

531
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,527
None whatever.

For they are not mine alone.

533
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:51,664
Mere passage from the flesh
cannot undo centuries of evil.

534
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,329
There can be no peace
without penalty.

535
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,753
Yet you wanted her to die.

536
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,373
Wanted?
Yes!

537
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,885
I did not wish her death.

538
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,341
I only knew it was inevitable,
as my death is inevitable.

539
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,353
Our blight must be removed
from this earth.

540

What lies beyond
is something else again.

541

Must you close it now?

542
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,584
She must take her place below
with the rest of the Ushers.

543
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,386
One last look.

544
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,599
I cannot bear to look at her.

545
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,522
I'll carry her with you.

546
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,771
Bristol and I can manage.

547
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,239
I would rather,
if you don't mind.

548
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,364
I'll carry her.

No, thank you.
Some coffee, then?

Yes, a little bit.
Very good, sir.

I don't suppose any of us

Yes, sir?

Do you think it was my coming
that caused Miss Madeline...

Oh, no, sir. Not at all.
Miss Madeline was not well.

Her brother thinks I killed her.

Yes.

You're welcome, sir.

Don't recriminate yourself,
Mr Winthrop.

Miss Madeline's passing
was not your fault.

She was very weak,
poor child.

It was... the Usher blood.

571

There's such a history

Sir?

You said catalepsies?
Did I, sir?

576
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,875
Was Madeline subject
to cataleptic trances?

No, sir.

01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,721
That I heard her breathing
in her casket?

652
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,848
Heard her first gasp
as she awoke?

653
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,562
Her first scream of terror?

654
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,857
Did you know I could hear the scratching
of her fingernails on the casket lid?

655
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,479
You are mad!

656
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,117
Be done!
What?

657
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,328
I think I rave.

658
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:33,039
You said, "Be done."
What did you mean?

659
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,750
Nothing.

660
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,250
Is she still alive?
No.

661
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,252
Is she?
No.

662
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,295
Is she?
Yes!

663
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,923
Yes, even now I hear her.

664
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,929
No.
Yes.

665
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:53,894
Alive, deranged, infuriate.

Can you not hear her voice?

667
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:00,017
Where?
In the name of God, where?

668
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,939
Below.

Twisting,

670
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,150
turning,

671
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,990
scratching at the lid
with bloody fingernails.

672
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:13,364
Staring, screaming, wild with fury,
the strength of madness in her.

673
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:17,789
Can you not hear her voice?
She calls my name.

Give me this.
Wait.

682
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,204
Don't go down there.

683
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,370

Mr Winthrop, please.

688
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,259
Leave her, sir.
Leave her?

689
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,803
But you may never find her.

690
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,178
The house is honeycombed
with secret passages.

691
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,680
She could be anywhere, sir.
I'll find her.

692
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,227
But she's mad, sir.

Mr Winthrop, you must leave.

Where is she?
The outside wall has begun to crack.

Where has she gone?
I don't know. Please, I beg of you.
