1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,206
(Door creaks)

2
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,527
(Cries)

3
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:06,854
(Clattering)

4
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,686
(Whimpers)

5
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:26,854
(Light fixture squeals)

6
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,490
(Sobs)

7
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,932
(Skull cracking)

8
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,486
<i>(Woman) God, watch
over my daughter.</i>

9
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,286
<i>Keep her from the path of sin.</i>

10
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,163
Deliver her from the evil of Satan...

11
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:46,484
...and all his demons.

12
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,811
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

13
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,254
Amen.

14
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,007
<i>(Woman) I wish you didn't
have to go so far.</i>

15
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,326
<i>(Girl) Don't worry,
I'm gonna be fine.</i>

16
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,172
It's just college.

17
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:07,685
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you.

18
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,567
(Knock on door)

19
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,614
(Knock on door)

20
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,492
All right, already, I'm comin'.

21
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,490
- What?
- Erica?

22
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,253
- Yeah.
- I'm Angie.

23
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,252
Your new roommate?

24
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:59,765
Oh, hey. Oh, yeah.
OK, come on in.

25
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,450
I thought you were supposed
to be here tomorrow night.

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,055
Well, I'm pretty sure I
said the twenty-fourth.

27
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:11,326
Doesn't matter. You're here now, right?
Here's the quick tour.

28
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,445
Living room. Kitchen.

29
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,290
Bedroom.

30
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,405
My side. Your side.

31
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,810
And we'll talk about the closet later.

32
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,693
Didn't you say in the email
that there was a bed?

33
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,852
(Yawns) There was. However, the
bitch that lived here before you,

34
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:38,205
decided last minute that she was gonna
take it, even though it wasn't hers.

35
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,769
You'll have to crash on the couch
until you find one.

36
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,612
I don't really have money to buy one.

37
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,089
We'll talk about it tomorrow, OK?

38
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,013
OK.

39
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,766
The apartment is great. Mm-hm.

40
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,413
My roommate?

41
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:59,286
She's, she's really nice.

42
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,891
No, I haven't had a chance to look yet.

43
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,286
I'm sure there's a church close by here
somewhere, yes.

44
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,490
- I promise.
- (Squealing)

45
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,125
Mom, I have to go now.

46
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,291
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

47
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,134
(Squealing)

48
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,887
Sorry.

49
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:34,085
Should watch where I'm goin'.

50
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,484
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Excuse me.

51
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,690
(Whispers) Hail Mary full of grace.

52
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,774
Be careful.

53
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,851
That's so sad.

54
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,294
Yup.

55
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,769
Table... Desk...

56
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:22,964
Motorcycle.

57
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,007
Sell your eggs.
Where are all the friggin' beds?

58
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,647
What do you think happened to her?

59
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,732
Who knows?
Last year, this girl went missing.

60
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:33,164
Her mom was on the news,
the police did a full manhunt.

61
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:36,764
Turns out she moved to Colorado with
her boyfriend and just didn't tell anyone.

62
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,294
It happens all the time.

63
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,732
Course, they did find some girl
down in Redding all hacked up last month.

64
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,652
Did they ever catch the guy?

65
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,334
I never heard anything
about it if they did.

66
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,684
Not one fucking bed -
are you kidding me?

67
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,090
Every time I come up here,
there's like a million of 'em.

68
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,008
- You find one?
- No, it's for a job babysitting.

69
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,888
- That's a Montague area code.
- What does that mean?

70
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:03,005
It's out in farm country.
It's the boonies.

71
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,808
Oh.
Well, I'm gonna check it out anyway.

72
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:09,814
Suit yourself. There another one of
these boards on the other side of campus.

73
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,607
Let's go see if there's any beds on it.

74
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:23,884
(Teacher) Now, here we have a painting
by Hans Aachen,

75
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:27,291
entitled Saint George Slaying the Dragon.

76
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:30,850
Now, Saint George
is the patron saint of England,

77
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:36,686
and is venerated throughout Christendom
for his example of bravery,

78
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:39,124
in the defence of the poor
and the downtrodden.

79
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:43,168
Keep in mind that during
this era of religious artistry,

80
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:48,335
that dragons were not just
the mere machinations of evil

81
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,764
derived from the minds
of simple village folk,

82
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:56,287
but were in fact, symbolic
representations of the devil himself.

83
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,170
In this particular picture,
Saint George slays the dragon.

84
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:05,527
Once again,
displaying the classic archetype

85
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:11,047
that good will defeat evil
and God will defeat... Satan.

86
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:15,293
Good. Now, on to the works
of Evelyn Munyan.

87
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,530
Hi, I was calling about
the babysitting job.

88
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:22,774
Seven twenty-four Lancaster Road.

89
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,493
Got it.
OK. I'll see you in a few.

90
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:02,053
(Coughs)

91
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,369
Hey, there.
You must be Angie.

92
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,730
- Angie, I'm Jim Stanton.
- Hi.

93
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,767
We appreciate you coming out here.
Know what a long drive it is.

94
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,965
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.
- (Door opens)

95
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:21,291
You made it. (Laughs)

96
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,803
Hi. Violet Stanton.

97
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:28,323
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,094
And this... must be Sam.

99
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:34,207
He's a little shy at first,
but that's just till you get to know him.

100
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:37,372
- Isn't that right, Sam?
- That's quite a cowboy outfit you have there.

101
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:41,294
Yeah, he never takes the thing off.
He even sleeps in it most nights.

102
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,087
- Mm-hm.
- Really? (Laughs)

103
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:47,208
Well, if I had a cool cowboy hat like that,
I probably wouldn't take it off either.

104
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:51,134
I did the same thing when I was his age.
I had this ballerina outfit I wore all the time.

105
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:53,689
- (Laughs)
- Oh, I love ballet. Do you still dance?

106
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:56,932
Actually, I never danced.
I just liked to wear the outfit.

107
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,408
- (Laughs)
- Oh. (Laughs)

108
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:02,243
So, um, on the phone, you said something
about needing a sitter for a gathering?

109
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:05,446
Oh, yeah. Well, the gathering is when
all the local ranchers get together,

110
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:08,373
and help each other sort out
the new calves and brand 'em.

111
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,088
- Then they get vaccinated and wormed.
- Oh, wow.

112
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,445
We mostly work weekends, so that's when
we'd need you to watch Sam the most.

113
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,974
That's perfect.

114
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,051
You'll have to forgive the disaster zone.

115
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:21,326
We are under construction, as you can see,
so we're a little upside down.

116
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,128
- Would you like some homemade lemonade?
- That'd be great.

117
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,006
OK. Be right back.

118
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,892
So, are you restoring the entire house?

119
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,284
Uh, one room at a time.

120
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,293
I really didn't think
it was gonna be this much work.

121
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,485
Hm. How long have you been doing it?

122
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:44,607
I thought we were gonna be finished
with the whole house in two months,

123
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:50,525
but with plumbing and foundation, let's
just say we're going on just over a year now.

124
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,133
- Wow.
- I know. (Laughs)

125
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,164
Thank you.

126
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:56,127
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

127
00:12:56,175 --> 00:13:00,487
I'm eighteen. I'm in my first year
at Adams Community College.

128
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,253
Oh, great. What are you studying?

129
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:05,173
- Art history.
- Nice. Where are you from?

130
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,331
I just left Bakersfield
for the first time.

131
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,287
Bakersfield. Don't they have
a community college in Bakersfield?

132
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:15,250
Oh, yeah, they do. Um, but the art
history programme is better here.

133
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,083
Really?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

134
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,534
No, just me and my mom.

135
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,213
Mm.

136
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,325
Hm.

137
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,365
- May I use your restroom?
- Oh, sure. Of course.

138
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,612
The sink is broken in the one downstairs,
so use the one at the top of the stairs.

139
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,448
(Gasps)

140
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,008
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

141
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,853
No, not at all.
I just wasn't expecting...

142
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,289
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's no problem. (Laughs)

143
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:50,008
Hey, honey, you know
where those small bungees are?

144
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:04,087
(Sighs) Get a grip, Ange.

145
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,413
Hi, Sam.

146
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,608
(Whispers) I think she's great.

147
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,931
Oh, hi.
So, we have talked it over,

148
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,854
and decided that we would love
for you to watch Sam on Friday night,

149
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:33,284
- if that's OK with you.
- Yeah, Friday will be fine.

150
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,407
Terrific. I'd like to take my
beautiful wife out on the town

151
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,923
before things get a little
bit busy around here.

152
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,694
Are you stalking me?

153
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,329
- Excuse me?
- I'm the guy you ran into the other night.

154
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,854
Oh. Hi.

155
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,726
Looks like we're neighbours.

156
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:10,165
I live in the building next door.
I'm Rick.

157
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:11,204
Angie.

158
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,449
Nice to meet you, Angie.

159
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,723
You, too.

160
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:18,085
Hey, uh, maybe we could get a
bite to eat later or something.

161
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,727
- I have to study.
- Ah.

162
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:23,211
That's cool. I probably should, too.
Maybe some other time.

163
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,485
Hi.

164
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:41,332
Hey!

165
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,491
Angie, this is Hal.

166
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,093
Yeah.

167
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,284
It's nice to meet you.

168
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,291
(Sighs) Have a seat.

169
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,364
Hey, you want some?

170
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,935
No. I'm OK, thank you.

171
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:02,844
So, uh, you need a bed, huh?

172
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,489
- Yeah.
- You can totally have mine.

173
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:10,294
Absolutely.
It's like the coolest bed ever.

174
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

175
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:17,925
That bed has seen more action
than you could believe.

176
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:21,172
It's like good luck
or something like that.

177
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,604
That's... That's great. (Laughs)

178
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:29,844
You can come over to my place on
Saturday, and I'll help you move it.

179
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:32,614
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

180
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:37,649
- Oh. Who the...
- You dropped some on your shirt. (Laughs)

181
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:41,813
- (Erica laughs)
- Are you sure you don't want some?

182
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:46,212
Really, thank you. But um,
I have to get going. I'll see you later,

183
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,927
and thanks again for the bed.

184
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:51,449
(Laughs)

185
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:27,374
(Door opens)

186
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:35,010
Twelve years of Catholic school,
church every Sunday.

188
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,684
Altar boy - the whole shebang.
Couldn't get out of it if I tried.

189
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:41,044
(Tyres screeching)

190
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:45,527
D'you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

191
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,167
Depends on the question.

192
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,248
Why are you always so jumpy?

193
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:54,247
I don't know. I'm not usually like this.

194
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:58,447
It's just... Do you ever feel
like someone's watching you?

195
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,173
What, do you mean like a guardian angel?

196
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:05,925
No, like... like someone's stalking you.

197
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:10,884
But...
Someone's stalking you?

198
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:16,923
You've been here for what, like a week and
you already have a stalker? I'm so jealous.

199
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:20,684
(Laughs) I don't know.
It just feels like someone is.

200
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,728
Maybe it's just being away from
home and all, that's got me nuts.

201
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,448
It sounds like you've
got a lot on your mind.

202
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,963
Yeah. I guess I do.

203
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,404
- How's your vanilla?
- It's good.

204
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,286
Yeah?

205
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,767
Nah, chocolate's still better.

206
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,289
Well, my stalking duties end here.

207
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,247
Wait. I thought I was stalking you.

208
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:50,287
Right.
Sorry, I keep getting that part mixed up.

209
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,334
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

210
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,286
Oh, I have to work.

211
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:01,447
Maybe, um, maybe we could do something
on Saturday, though?

212
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,888
I'd like that.

213
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,174
Well, good night. (Laughs)

214
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,648
Good night.

215
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,771
- Angie, you are the... twenty-seventh?
- That's right.

216
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:51,364
...female student that we've spoken to
since Rebecca Miller went missing,

217
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,610
and you all have
every reason to be concerned.

218
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,964
Now, we've put extra squad cars
on the streets,

219
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:59,371
and I know that campus security
is very aware of the situation.

220
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,007
Why would someone put this on my door?

221
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,728
People have been putting
these things up everywhere.

222
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,289
My door was the only one
in the entire building.

223
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,252
Let me give you my card.

224
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,084
If this guy tries anything, you call
me up and we'll come straightaway.

225
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,410
- Thank you.
- OK.

226
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:50,526
(Engine fails to start)

227
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:54,332
(Sighs) No!

228
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:58,770
Come on!

229
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,367
(Gasps)

230
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,371
- Car trouble?
- Yeah, kind of.

231
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,252
Pop the hood. I'll take a look at it.

232
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:12,173
Geez, I am gonna be so late!

233
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,648
- (Sighs)
- I'll tell you what.

234
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,767
I'll give you a ride, and then I'll
come back and take a look at your car.

235
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:20,490
- Are you sure? It's kinda far.
- It'll be my pleasure.

236
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:31,566
You weren't kidding
when you said this place was out here.

237
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:34,209
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate you doing this.

238
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:37,088
Don't be sorry. I'm happy to do it.

239
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,853
Thanks.

240
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,328
You're welcome.

241
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:55,726
So, uh, call me in a few, and I'll let you
know if you need to take it to a mechanic.

242
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,367
You're sweet.

243
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,925
- Remind me to offer to fix your car more often.
- (Laughs)

244
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,451
- Hi, Mr Stanton.
- Hi, Angie.

245
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:17,609
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No, just a friend.

246
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:20,249
I had a little car trouble,
so he gave me a ride.

247
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,489
Huh. Nice friend.

248
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:23,332
Yeah. He is a nice friend.

249
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,605
- Hm.
- (Honking)

250
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:33,488
Is there any chance
you could give me a ride home?

251
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:34,934
I don't see why not.

252
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:38,324
Psst. (Come on up.)

253
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,969
- Ah, here. I'll take that.
- Thanks.

254
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,365
You weren't kidding
about the cowboy outfit.

255
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,610
Like I said,
he never takes the thing off.

256
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,294
You wouldn't believe what a pain it is
to get him to take a bath.

257
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,848
(Laughs)

258
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:03,887
Sam couldn't stop talking about you
after you left the other day.

259
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,369
Really?
I wasn't sure he even liked me.

260
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,406
- Oh, no, no, no, no, he loves you.
- Oh.

261
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:11,367
It's just, you know, he gets very quiet
when he first meets people.

262
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:12,643
Oh.

263
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,892
OK, so let me just show you
a few things.

264
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,926
Here is the TV remote.
Sam is a heavy sleeper,

265
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,205
but you might want to keep it low,
just in case.

266
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:23,884
And here is the phone with all the contact
numbers that you could possibly need.

267
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,290
- Keys to the Jeep, in case you need it.
- Got it.

268
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,803
Help yourself to anything
in the refrigerator,

269
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,244
but the bottom row is Sam's.
He's on a special diet,

270
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,889
so don't feed him anything
that's not in those containers,

271
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:35,448
just in case he wakes up hungry.

272
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:37,053
So, we all set?

273
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:39,768
I think so. Are you sure
you don't have any questions?

274
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:41,214
Oh, come on. She's fine.

275
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,405
- We're running late anyway.
- OK, OK.

276
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,333
- Do you have any idea when you'll be back?
- We shouldn't be gone

277
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,128
more than three or four hours.
Just make yourself at home.

278
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,927
- We'll see you later.
- Have a good night.

279
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:53,091
- OK, thanks.
- Don't forget to call.

280
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,571
(Electrical static)

281
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:51,487
(Electrical buzzing)

282
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:02,613
(Flips switch on and off)

283
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:09,486
Don't start playing games with yourself.
It's just an old house.

284
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,454
(Beeps)

285
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,685
- There's a heart attack waiting to happen.
- (Microwave pings)

286
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,407
(Phone)

287
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:12,806
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

288
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:16,734
Hey there, me. How's the babysitting going?
The kid driving you crazy yet?

289
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,767
- No, it's like he's not even here.
- <i>I guess that's good, right?</i>

290
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:22,887
(Laughs) I just wanted to let you know
you don't have to come get me.

291
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,493
Mr Stanton's gonna give me a ride.

292
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:27,288
Oh. I was actually looking forward to it.

293
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:32,726
In fact,
you called right at the moment of truth.

294
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,174
(Engine starts)

295
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,251
Oh, I'm good.

296
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:40,527
<i>Your starter connection was bad. I took it apart,</i>
<i>put it back together and reconnected it.</i>

297
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:42,133
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

298
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,972
So, uh, I'll see you later?

299
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:45,448
<i>OK, I'll see you later.</i>

300
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,573
(Phone)

301
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:02,132
- Stanton residence.
<i>- (Crackling/opera singing)</i>

302
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:04,530
- Hello?
<i>- (Opera singing)</i>

303
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:07,726
- Rick, is that you?
<i>- (Opera singing/crackling)</i>

304
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,484
I'm sorry. Whoever this is, I can't hear you.
I'm gonna hang up now.

305
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,212
(Ringing)

306
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,285
- Hello?
<i>- (Crackling/opera singing)</i>

307
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:35,734
<i>(Opera singing)</i>

308
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:40,847
(Dial tone)

- (Ringing)
- <i>That was fast.</i>

310
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,534
Did you just try calling me?

311
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,088
No.

312
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:54,410
- <i>Oh. OK.</i>
- Are you OK?

313
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,527
I'm fine. Someone just tried calling,
and I thought it might be you.

314
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,054
No, wasn't me.

315
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,245
OK, well, I will call you later.

316
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,694

<i>Thank you...</i>

321
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:34,163
It would be a good idea
not to leave it on at full volume,

322
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:36,854
if you don't want it played too loud.

323
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:39,125
I hope that didn't wake him.

I'm sorry, did I wake you up?

Hungry.

336

Oh. OK, let's go get
you something to eat.

337

Your mom said you can
only eat the food on the bottom...

You want me to heat some of this up?

339
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:46,011
Diced red meat.
Very rare diced red meat.

340
00:30:47,015 --> 00:30:48,926
Let's get a different one.

341
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,489
I guess it's diced rare meat.

OK.

Good evening, Montague Dispatch.

00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,094
One moment, please.

358
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,335
Chief... Line one.

Oh, yeah.
Hi, Angie, how you doin'?

361
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:08,530
<i>I'm not sure. I'm babysitting at
seven-twenty-four Lancaster Road.</i>

362
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:12,170
- That's the Stanton place. I know it.
- I think there's someone outside the house.

363
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:13,443
<i>Did you see someone?</i>

364
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,963
Not exactly.
I just keep hearing strange noises,

365
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,734
and I keep getting
these phone calls where no one talks.

366
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:22,085
- How would you describe the noises?
- I don't know. Like locks rattling,

367
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,968
- like there's someone outside the door.
- Angie, calm down.

368
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,324
Now, did you see someone outside?

369
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,331
No, it just feels like there is.

370
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:34,130
OK, well, I'm just about to make my rounds,
so I will swing by and check it out, OK?

371
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,574
Thank you.

372
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:45,327

Sam, are you getting back in bed?

377
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:24,286
I think you should brush
your teeth... first.

378

Sam?

379
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:46,648
Where are you?

380
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:03,527
Are you playing a game with me?

381
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:17,647
Come on, Sam! I need you to get back
in bed before your parents get home.

Sam!

Sam, I'm done playing now, OK?
You have to get in bed.

388
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,526
I'm serious. This isn't funny.
You need to go to sleep.

It's past your bedtime.

393

Your mommy is gonna be
very, very upset with you.

394

00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,530
Son of a bitch,
this is Father Nicoletta!

473
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:48,487
- Thought I killed that fucker in Romania.
- Well, I guess you didn't.

474
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:50,014
You are one tough old bastard.

475
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:53,491
Last time I saw you, you had an axe
stickin' out of the top of your head.

476
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:55,890
- Jim, how did he find us?
- I don't know. Goddamn!

477
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,926
(Groans)

478
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:01,172
Oh, oh, that's just great.
He's still alive. Just great!

479
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:04,525
- (Moans)
- Come on, baby, let's get out of here.

480
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,611
- (Groans)
- (Whimpers)

481
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:10,844
Well, he's dead now.
They're like fuckin' rats.

482
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,015
- (Whimpers)
- Ohh!

483
00:49:16,055 --> 00:49:18,489
Hold on there, Missy.

484
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,446
You're not going anywhere.

485
00:49:22,975 --> 00:49:24,374
Sorry.

486
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,083
(Thud)

487
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:28,526
(Scrubbing sound)

488
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,085
Vi... Stop.

489
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:37,690
We covered our tracks so well.

490
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,774
How did he find us, Jim?

491
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:48,172
I don't know. I don't know. But where
there's one, there's gonna be more.

492
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,287
- I thought we finally had a home for once.
- (Sighs)

493
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:55,604
- (Sighs)
- (Sighs)

494
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:05,807
There's only one thing we can do.
We have to leave tonight.

495
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:08,005
And go where?

496
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:11,604
We have people in Colorado. We can
stay with them till we get our place set up.

497
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:15,773
Hon... Listen, it's gonna be OK.

498
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:19,854
(Sighs) OK.

499
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:23,171
I'll pack our things and you go
prepare Sam's food for the trip.

500
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,493
OK. Wait, there's only one thing -
the girl we bagged tonight,

501
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,253
she's still got the drugs in her system.

502
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:33,083
Do your best to bleed her out.
We need both of them.

503
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:38,330
We can't leave a trail of dead bodies
all the way to Colorado.

504
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:42,894
OK.

505
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,694
Come here, honey.

506
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,695
(Grunts)

507
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:33,733
(Moans)

508
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:39,124
- (Door opening)
- (Footsteps)

509
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:41,052
(Sighs)

510
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:47,334
Ah!

511
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:49,568
Yeah.

512
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,334
(Sighs)

513
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,286
One hell of a night, huh?

514
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,933
Let me guess.

515
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,284
You're probably wondering
right about now...

516
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:15,006
...what the hell's goin' on. (Laughs)

517
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:17,091
Bottom line, Angie...

518
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:20,812
...we gotta feed Sam.

519
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:23,894
Only problem is...

520
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:30,328
...he only likes female flesh.

521
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:36,451
And it can't be any female flesh -

522
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:40,090
it has to be good, clean
wholesome female flesh -

523
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:44,686
which, as you can imagine,
is not that easy to come by.

524
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:52,968
Ah.

525
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,367
And you can't just go around
grabbing up a whole flock of girls,

526
00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:02,488
cos then the local people start gettin'
suspicious. Then you gotta move again.

527
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:18,454
Last time we went out...
we took Sam with us - big mistake.

528
00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:24,530
Had to grab
a local girl named Rebecca.

529
00:53:25,935 --> 00:53:28,847
You know, I really hate to do that.

530
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:43,694
That is why we had to
get you to baby-sit.

531
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:48,288
Then eventually, of course,
you'd have to find out about Sam.

532
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:54,290
But then again, you're a nice
clean girl, aren't you, Angie?

533
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:56,690
(Jim laughs)

534
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:02,925
You know... (Laughs) It is so nice
to have somebody out here to talk to.

535
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:06,490
(Laughs) I'm always out here alone
doing this. Always.

536
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:12,284
My father...
used to have a meat packing plant.

537
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:19,092
Every summer I worked there
till I turned eighteen.

538
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,285
Yeah. (Laughs)

539
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:27,653
You know, I haven't really gotten used to
slaughtering human beings, though.

540
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,163
Hence the cut marks.

541
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:01,091
You know what Sam's
favourite cut of meat is?

542
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:06,528
No? The latissimus dorsi.

543
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:10,807
Can you believe that? Yeah, most people
would think it'd be the gluteus maximus,

544
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:13,244
cos of the high fat content,
but no, no,

545
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:17,447
he has to have this little
thin slice of beef right here.

546
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:18,894
Go figure.

547
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:24,893
Never tasted either one of 'em myself, so I
couldn't really tell you if they're any good or not.

548
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:35,085
Goddamn it, I hate giving 'em drugs like that.
Fuckin' pisses me off.

549
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,365
This is not the way I do things,
Angie, normally.

550
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:42,364
I take the girls, I give 'em health food,
put 'em away for a couple days. Lots of water.

551
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,124
Flushes all the drugs right out of
their system. Now, that is good food.

552
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:51,295
But, I gotta get on the road, so...
Not that it really affects him that much.

553
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:56,734
(Sighs)
But nothin' seems to affect him much.

554
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:01,287
Well... priests and churches.

555
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:05,294
But then again,
he's not eatin' them, is he?

556
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,207
All right.

557
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:15,254
There.

558
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,294
(Girl screams)

559
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,534
Oh, come on.

560
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:34,773
Oh, hey. No, no, no.

561
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,648
- (Whimpers)
- You don't have to worry. No, listen.

562
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,687
I'm gonna hit you right here
in the forehead, right here.

563
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:43,454
It's only gonna hurt for a split second.

564
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:45,690
See, it kills the brain,
leaves the heart pumpin'.

565
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,771
That way, I can drain
all the blood outta you.

566
00:56:47,815 --> 00:56:49,214
(Whimpers)

567
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,127
(Screams)

568
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,686
(Skull cracking)

569
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:09,168
(Screams)

570
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,887
Aw, no, no, no, no.

571
00:57:10,935 --> 00:57:13,654
No dying on me yet. Go ahead, breathe.

572
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:16,971
- Oh!
- You son of a bitch! I hope you rot in hell!

573
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:19,290
What the hell was that?
You know what?

574
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:24,204
I said it was nice to have you out here.
Guess what? It's not that nice. Jesus Christ!

575
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:27,247
Try to be a nice guy,
and that's the thanks I get.

576
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:32,970
Are you happy? She's probably
already started to coagulate!

577
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:36,604
(Hacking sound)

578
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:39,770
(Whimpers)

579
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:43,568
(Thud)

580
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,848
(Thuds)

581
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:55,007
(Slashing sounds)

582
00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:00,325
(Squeaking)

583
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:19,854
(Grunts)

584
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:22,329
(Sobs)

585
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:24,934
(Clatter)

586
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:34,053
(Trickling)

587
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,494
(Sobs)

588
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:39,484
(Sighs)

589
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:43,733
You know, this part used to bother me too,
when I first started.

590
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:45,208
(Footsteps)

591
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,246
What are doing talking to her?

592
00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:49,251
- I thought you liked her.
- Are you serious?

593
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:52,526
Well, it's not like I'm out here
having sex with her or somethin'.

594
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:55,533
I didn't say that you were.
It's just you have to kill her in a minute.

595
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:57,611
Why talk to her - what is the point?

596
00:58:57,655 --> 00:59:00,533
Hey, I have asked you many times
to come out here and help me.

597
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:05,046
- Each time, your response has been, "No."
- You know that is not my thing.

598
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:08,246
Oh, and... and cutting girls
into. bite-sized pieces is my thing?

599
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,048
Look, I just came out here
to tell you that I'm done packing

600
00:59:11,095 --> 00:59:13,325
and whenever you're finished here,
we can leave.

601
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,684
Hey. (Sighs) Come here, Vi.

602
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:18,407
What?

603
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:23,931
I'm sorry, OK?
This night has just got me all worked up.

604
00:59:23,975 --> 00:59:26,569
- Kiss?
- Hm.

605
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:35,323
(Sighs) OK, back to work.

606
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:45,288
(Slicing)

607
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:28,130
- (Sawing)
- (Tearing sounds)

608
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:36,934
(Sighs)

609
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,767
(Sighs)

610
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:42,294
One down, one to go.

611
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:46,535
You know, we really did like you
as a babysitter, Angie.

612
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:53,971
Hell, you saved Sam from that priest
while we were out gettin' him more food.

613
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:56,051
Not a lot of people would've done that.

614
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,804
Course, you didn't know Sam was the son
of the devil at the time, I'm assuming.

615
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:03,574
You didn't know, right?

616
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:07,253
I didn't think so.

617
01:02:12,655 --> 01:02:14,452
(Sighs)

618
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,974
(Clattering)

619
01:02:37,095 --> 01:02:40,883
Well, Angie... It's about that time.

620
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:45,289
Once again, I'm really sorry about this.

621
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:50,046
- (Whimpers)
- Don't move.

622
01:02:50,095 --> 01:02:54,805
Cos if I don't hit you right in the centre
of the forehead, I'm gonna injure you,

623
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,608
- and I really don't want you to be in any pain.
- (Whimpers)

624
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:05,734
(OK.)

625
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,454
(Siren)

626
01:03:15,535 --> 01:03:18,686
What the hell?
Did you call the cops?

627
01:03:23,015 --> 01:03:27,133
Don't make a sound, you understand me?
Cos I don't want to kill him,

628
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:29,928
and I really don't want to do you
without the hammer.

629
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:44,934
Good evening, Officer.

630
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:47,091
- How you doin'?
- OK.

631
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:48,568
How can we help you?

632
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:50,094
Sorry to bother you guys so late,

633
01:03:50,135 --> 01:03:54,925
but, um, I got a call from uh, the girl
who was babysitting for you, named Angie.

634
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:56,374
(Screams)

635
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:00,974
(Muffled cries)

636
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:03,131
- She left about a half an hour ago.
- Mm-hm.

637
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:04,608
She in some sort of trouble?

638
01:04:04,655 --> 01:04:08,728
Well, she had called earlier and said
there was someone outside the house.

639
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,812
Really? That's funny. She didn't
mention anything to us about it.

640
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:14,050
- She mention it to you, honey?
- No, not at all.

641
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:15,653
(Whimpers)

642
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:23,207
(Grunts)

643
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:30,414
(Grunts)

644
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:35,847
Guess it was a false alarm.

645
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:38,129
You folks have a good night.

646
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:40,131
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Thank you.

647
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:42,006
(Faint scream)

648
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:55,334
(Grunts)

649
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:01,534

01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,933
(Sighs)

651
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:36,334
He knows.

652
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,445
All right, calm down.
He doesn't know anything.

653
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,367
Dispatch, can you run a plate for me?

654
01:05:47,975 --> 01:05:49,852
(Grunts)

655
01:05:51,215 --> 01:05:52,614
(Grunts)

656
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:57,694
What is he doing?

657
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:02,483
Probably trying to find out
what doughnut shop to go to. (Laughs)

658
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:07,288
- (Sighs)
- See?

659
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:08,563
OK, OK.

660
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:11,288
I'm gonna finish the second girl.
Now, have Sam ready to go, OK?

661
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,212
- All right. OK.
- All right?

662
01:06:15,495 --> 01:06:17,087
(Grunts)

663
01:06:17,135 --> 01:06:18,534

(Groans)

667
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:40,491
You bitch! You cut me!

668
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,730
How does it feel, asshole!

669
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,254
(Groans)

670
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:45,808
Ow!

(Groans)

672
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:03,892
(Groans)

673
01:07:05,895 --> 01:07:08,728
Come on, Angie...
there's nowhere to run!

674
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,094
(Groans)

675

(Shrieks)

678
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:20,652
It's all over now, Angie.

679
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:22,208
(Screams)

680
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:24,648
Angie!

681
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:28,089
You're really making this harder
than it needs to be.

682
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,888
(Grunts)

683
01:08:36,975 --> 01:08:38,374
(Grunts)

684
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,093
Come on, Angie!

685
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:10,291
I didn't ask for this life, Angie.

686
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,286
It was set upon me.

687
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:17,212
(Grunts)

688
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:21,168
You've seen the boy. You know the truth.

689
01:09:22,175 --> 01:09:23,767
(Sighs)

690
01:09:26,015 --> 01:09:29,291
How can you be in his presence
and not believe?

691
01:09:33,855 --> 01:09:36,085
Did you find your boyfriend, Angie?

692
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:41,284
It's too bad he had to die for no reason.

693
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,892
Sam just won't eat male flesh.

694
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:56,814
(Screams)

695

Oh... Fuck.

706
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:16,810
I think you cut through a tendon.

707
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,254
(Sighs)

708
01:11:22,055 --> 01:11:23,886
Wake up!

709
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:26,966
- I want you to feel this!
- (Fuck you.)

710
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,085
Good, you're awake.

711
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:34,174
(Laughs)

712
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:36,445

(Grunts)

715
01:11:44,215 --> 01:11:47,571
Tried to be a nice guy,
but you didn't like nice, did you?

716
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:50,004
(Whimpers)

717
01:11:50,855 --> 01:11:52,846

(Panting)

721
01:12:01,695 --> 01:12:04,653
Good. Now the other one.

722
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,413
No. (Cries)

723
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,764
- (Gun hammer click)
- Drop it, asshole!

724
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:12,494
(Clatter)

725
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,571
You got any more weapons on you,
son of a bitch?

726
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:16,651
- (Groans)
- Get on your knees, now!

727
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:18,287
- Get on your knees.
- (Gasps)

728
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,246
How you doin', Chief?
All the way down.

744
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:55,124
- (Sobs)
- It's OK, it's OK. They're dead. They're dead.

745
01:13:58,295 --> 01:13:59,694
Come on.

746
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,291
My car's parked up on the main road.

747
01:14:12,335 --> 01:14:14,769
There's, there's keys in the truck.

Hold on, I'll be right back.

751
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:50,046
Where are you going?

752
01:14:50,095 --> 01:14:52,165
- The kid's inside. I gotta go get him.
- No!

753
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:55,810
Aargh! Don't worry, I'll be back.
It'll just take a second.

754
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:57,732
No, he's the devil!

755
01:14:58,775 --> 01:15:00,652
Angie, it's gonna be OK.

756

Let me out of here!

Sam, look.

See?

781
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:41,685
Sam, you don't have to eat me.

782
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:46,327
Sam?

01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:56,286
(Horn blaring)

796
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:03,090
- (Siren)

(Horn)

799
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:25,051
(Man 1) How's she doin'?

800
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:26,813
(Man 2) She's lost a lot of blood.

801
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:29,527
- And she's in a coma.
- Uh-huh.

802
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:33,966
You know, I, uh,
I don't know when she'll come out of it.

803
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:35,414
OK.

804
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:37,366
But when she does, you let me know.

805
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:43,603
Goddamn slaughterhouse out there.
We need some answers.

806
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:46,294
Doctor, look, she's awake.

807
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:53,773
Angie... Can you blink for me?

808
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:56,489
Good.

809
01:19:56,535 --> 01:19:58,765
Can you see better now?

810
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,330
Angie?

811
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,969
No! No! No!

812
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:08,327
Angie, it's OK. It's OK, you're safe.
Nurse! Nurse!

813
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:10,764
You're safe. You're safe.

814
01:20:10,815 --> 01:20:11,884
Rick?

815
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:13,084
Yeah.

816
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:16,571
Oh, God, Rick.
Oh, please don't leave me.

817
01:20:16,615 --> 01:20:18,890
No, I'm not going anywhere.

818
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:24,130
Angie, I'm gonna
have to ask you a couple questions.

819
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:25,847
Can't you give her a little time?

820
01:20:25,895 --> 01:20:27,647
No, son, I'm sorry, I can't.

821
01:20:27,695 --> 01:20:31,005
Now, Angie, your friend here said
you were babysitting. Is that correct?

822
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:33,171
Yes.

823
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:35,445
Can you remember
what happened to the child?

824
01:20:35,495 --> 01:20:37,053
What do you mean?

825
01:20:37,095 --> 01:20:38,574
We couldn't find him.

826
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:39,650
What?

827
01:20:39,695 --> 01:20:41,970
We found Chief Dinneli,

828
01:20:42,015 --> 01:20:43,414
the parents,

829
01:20:43,455 --> 01:20:46,253
and 20 female bodies
buried in the backyard.

830
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:47,933
None of them were children.

831
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:51,251
But he was in the barn.
He was in the barn!

832
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,292
Angie, try and remember exactly...

833
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:56,291
- Let her be.
...where you last saw him.

834
01:20:56,335 --> 01:20:58,690
- Miss, can I help you?
- I'm her mother.

835
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:02,171
- Mom!
- It's OK, baby. I'm here now.

836
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:10,091
- I'll be outside if you need anything, OK, Angie?
- No, Rick, stay. Please, stay.

837
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:15,126
We need to pray.

838
01:22:14,335 --> 01:22:16,690
(Engine starts)

839
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:17,691
