00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,945
(MAN) Hello, I'm Ronald Merrick,

2
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,490
and I'm here to invite you
aboard our Starliner.

3
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,994
Yes, it's true! Day-to-day
living becomes a luxury cruise

4
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,790
when you've made your home
at Starliner Tower apartments.

5
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,169
Although downtown Montreal is
only 12 and a half minutes away,

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,589
once you've crossed the
bridge to Starliner island,

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,967
the noise and the traffic of the city

8
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,387
might as well be a
million miles away.

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,889
Leave your car and the
tension of the city

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,977
in a space reserved for you in
our vast underground garage.

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,937
If friends have followed you home,

12
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,939
there's convenient parking for them

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,899
on ground level.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,777
Invite them up to share
the breath-taking view

15
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,697
from your balcony or picture window.

16
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:17,535
Gracious hospitality is easy
in any Starliner apartment.

17
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,620
They all come fully equipped

18
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,707
with the most modern name
brand electrical appliances,

19
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,127
and cable TV is standard too.

20
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,671
Relax by the side of our heated

21
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,548
Olympic-size swimming pool

22
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,508
and watch the Saint Lawrence river

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,177
flow by on its way to the sea.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,471
Exercise the fun way

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,473
on our nine hole golf course,

26
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,268
designed by international golf pros.

27
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,062
Or if tennis is your game,

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:50,067
you won't have to wait for playing time
on our multiple courts, day or night.

29
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,404
Explore our island paradise,

30
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,574
secure in the knowledge
that it belongs to you

31
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,161
and your fellow passengers alone.

32
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,789
Cruise the seasons,
the sun and the stars

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,627
without ever leaving the
great ship Starliner.

And don't forget our own premises

42
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,239
staffed by the world's
finest professionals.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,452

Yes, we are looking
for the rental agent.

No, never had it out of the holster.
A rival company has them,

Ah yes, Mr and Mrs Sviben.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Now, are we talking about
one or two bedrooms?

Hobbes called me.

161
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,406
I thought I was dreaming.
I haven't heard that voice in so long.

162
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,366
He said, "Meet me at apartment 15..."

163
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,701
- ...11.
- Thank you.

164
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,081
"At noon we go out for lunch.
It's time you furthered your education."

165
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,333
How did he sound? Depressed? Nervous?

166
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,919
He sounded fine.

didn't you turn up for lunch.

172
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,400
I know it is not the kind of lunch
that Hobbes had in mind for us,

173
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,612
but it's all I got.
Isn't it beautiful?

174
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,699
This is Hobbes' and my project.

175
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,414
What we were trying to find was
an alternative to organ transplant.

176
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,708
Am I keeping you up?
You're bored, right?

177
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,955
To you, organ transplant is just
yesterday's kishkas, right?

178
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,633
Look. You've got Man, right?

179
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,763
And you've got parasites that
live in, on and around Man. Right?

180
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:21,139
So, why not breed a parasite
that can do something useful?

181
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,067
A parasite that can take over
the function of a human organ.

182
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:32,115
For example, you breed a parasite that
you implant in the human body cavity.

183
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,284
It hooks around the
circulatory system

184
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,537
and it filters the blood
just like a kidney does.

185
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,707
It takes a little blood for itself
once in a while. What do you care?

186
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,627
You've got enough.
You can afford to be generous.

187
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,838
- Huh? Are you following me?
- I am, I am.

188
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,175
Look, you've got a guy
with a bad kidney. Right?

189
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,386
You put the bug in him.
The bug goes to work on the kidney,

190
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,890
dissolves it, so the body assimilates it.
Now, what have you got?

191
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,977
You've got a perfectly good parasite
where you used to have a rotten kidney.

192
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,315
Right? I know you're going to say.
You're going to say it's crazy.

- It's crazy, but who cares?

196
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,538
I mean, look, Hobbes
was a lousy teacher.

197

He was dull, academic, just plain lousy,

198

but he had a genius for one thing...
that was getting grants.

199

He could raise money
for crazy projects.

"that thinks too much.

"that has lost touch with its body and

So what he came up with
to help our guts along

415

was a parasite that's...

- He implanted her with a parasite,

apparently she went berserk.

- so I guess he just had to kill her.

Roger, I had a very

In this dream, I found myself
making love to a strange man.

because he's old, and dying.

He smells bad and I
find him repulsive.

But then he tells me that
everything is erotic.

That everything is sexual.
You know what I mean?

old flesh is erotic flesh.

That even dying is
an act of eroticism.

That talking is sexual.
That breathing is sexual.

That even to physically
exist is sexual.
