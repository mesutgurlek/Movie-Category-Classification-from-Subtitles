2
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:05,807
The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.

3
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,851
Then what's wrong with them?

4
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,318
Those lights don't seem to be
in just the right place.

5
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,948
They're both a bit out of position,
according to this.

6
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,686
Two light buoys mean a safe channel
between the world over.

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,662
"Safe between the world over"
doesn't go in these waters.

8
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,292
Look here. You'll see the water
shoals on the island side...

9
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:28,166
while the deep soundings
run to the mainland.

10

Have any of you seen
the captain today?

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,802
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.

12
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,109
He hasn't left the bridge since you
decided to come through the channel.

What are you driving at?

14
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:43,584
Ever since you gave him those orders
yesterday to cut through these waters...

15
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,814
he's had the jitters.

16
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,882

Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.

[Chuckling]
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?

18
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,997
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.

19
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:58,193
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.

20
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:02,400
Just what you need.

21
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,964
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.

22
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,502
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,483
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.

24
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,487
We're heading straight for the channel
between Branca Island and the mainland.

25
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:23,015
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off,
according to the chart.

26
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,960
The charts are never up to date in this
part of the Pacific. You know that.

27
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,224
I know, sir, but...

28
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,630
Doesn't Branca Island
mean anything to you?

29
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,897
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...

30
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,904
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.

31
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:39,430
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.

What's bothering you, Captain?

36

There are no more coral-reefed,
shark-infested waters
in the whole world than these.

You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.

39

believing it all themselves.

45

I think that Mr. Rainsford
should know...

46
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,010
that the channel lights aren't just
in the position given on the charts.

Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?

on Doc's face, Bill.

60
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,925

than the tiger.

- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?

62
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,990
I'll tell you
what I had on my mind.

63
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,502
I was thinking of the inconsistency
of civilization.

64
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,768
The beast of the jungle killing just
for his existence is called savage.

65
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,174
The man, killing just for sport,
is called civilized.

68
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:29,415
it isn't just as much sport
for the animal as it is for the man?

for instance.

There never was a time
when he couldn't have gotten away.

00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:37,017
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.

72
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,027
He didn't hate me
for stalking him...

73
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,928
any more than I hated him
for trying to charge me.

we admired each other.

with the tiger?

as much sport in the game...

to your room.

154
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:59,657
- Thank you.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.

155
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,323
Thanks a lot.

156
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:06,095
[Speaking Russian]
All pleasure is mine.

157
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:36,827
- [Knock At Door]
- Come in.

158
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,903
- Ready, Rainsford?
- All set.

159
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:47,268
I'm afraid
we have finished dinner.

160
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,072
But I have ordered
something for you.

161
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,079
Thanks. I don't feel
like eating, though.

162
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,947
Oh. Well, perhaps later.

163
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,577
Now, then,
what do you say to coffee...

164
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:00,087
and most charming company?

165
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,891
It is hard to forget
your comrades' fate, I know...

166
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:11,990
but our feminine guest
is easily perturbed.

167
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:15,299
If I could beg you to put
a good face upon the matter.

168
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:18,602
A-Assume a cheerfulness
you may not feel.

169
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,268
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.

170
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:31,379
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr. Robert Rainsford.

171
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,116
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?

172
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,715
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.

173
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,056
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?

174
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:42,791
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?

175
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,958
Indeed we do.

176
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,628
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like
some hot coffee.

177
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:51,002
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.

178
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:53,564
[Speaking Russian]

179
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,576
Vodka, that's the stuff!

180
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,112
One shot'll dry you out quicker
than all the coffee in Java.

181
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,978
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.

182
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,450
Now, Martin, you don't have
to drink it all tonight, do you?

183
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,114
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.

184
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:09,157
Same as Mr. Rainsford.

185
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,887
And if anyone has a right to his liquor,
it's a victim of circumstance.

186
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,895
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.

187
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,898
- You were in a shipwreck too?
- Yes.

188
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,298
Our lifeboat
was the only one saved...

189
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,359
my brother and I
and two sailors.

190
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:24,998
The count found us on the beach with
nothing but the clothes on our backs.

191
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,372
Those channel lights
must have been shifted.

192
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:30,037
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em...

193
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,239
just as soon as we get back
to the mainland.

194
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,839
You see, the count
has only one launch...

195
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,750
and that's under repair.

196
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,685
Russians are not
the best mechanics.

197
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,661
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient
a few days longer.

198
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,689
It's all right with me. I feel as if I
were living on borrowed time right now.

199
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,792
Speaking of that,
perhaps now you'll tell us...

200
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,803
a little bit
about who you are.

201
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:59,830
Just sketchily, you know...
born, married, why I left my last job.

202
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,934
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.

203
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:06,107
Mr. Rainsford need never explain
who he is in my house.

204
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:09,015
We entertain a celebrity,
Miss Trowbridge.

205
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,712
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

206
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:17,124
- I know. Flagpole sitter.
- [Laughter]

207
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,560
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.

208
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,928
If I am not mistaken,
this is Mr. Robert Rainsford...

209
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,229
who hunts big game
so adventurously.

210
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,894
Yeah? Here's to ya.

211
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,167
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little."

212
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,040
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.

213
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,876
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.

214
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:42,145
Only in yours have I found
a sane point of view.

215
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,413
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?

216
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,922
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.

217
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,924
Let me see.
How did you put it?

218
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:53,086
"Hunting is as much a game
as stud poker...

219
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,096
only the limits are higher."

220
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:59,225
- You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?

221
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:04,204
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.

222
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,470
[Laughs] He sleeps all day
and hunts all night.

223
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:10,205
And what's more, Rainsford,
he'll have you doing the same thing.

224
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,839
We'll have capital sport together,
I hope.

225
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,849
Don't encourage him.

226
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,851
He's had our two sailors so busy...

227
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,410
chasing around the woods
after flora and fauna...

228
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,980
that we haven't
seen them for three days.

229
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,492
But what do you hunt here?

230
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,924
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.

231
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,697
I have done a rare thing.

232
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,204
I have invented
a new sensation.

233
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,537
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.

234
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,337
What is this sensation, Count?

235
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,346
Mr. Rainsford,
God made some men poets.

236
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:48,872
Some He made kings,
some beggars.

237
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,885
Me, He made a hunter.

238
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:56,986
My hand was made for the trigger,
my father told me.

239
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,085
He was a very rich man...

240
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:03,723
with a quarter of a million acres
in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.

241
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,326
When I was only still up high
he gave me my first gun.

242
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:11,169
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.

243
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,437
It would be impossible for me to tell
you how many animals I have killed.

244
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,344
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.

245
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,144
[Speaking Russian]

246
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,616
Oh, I'm so sorry.

247
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,779
Count Zaroff
was so interesting...

248
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:29,153
I didn't realize the danger.

249
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,827
Oh, it's all right now. What were you
saying about the revolution, Count?

250
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:38,526
Oh, merely that I escaped
with most of my fortune.

251
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,468
Naturally, I continued to hunt
all over the world.

252
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,707
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo
gave me this.

253
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,709
[Rainsford]
That must have been a close call.

254
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:52,304
Yes. It still bothers me
sometimes.

255
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:56,044
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.

256
00:19:56,118 --> 00:20:00,145
I'd heard that the jaguars there
were unusually cunning.

257
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:03,282
No, no, no.
No sport at all.

258
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,487
Well, conditions
are bad everywhere these days.

259
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,895
One night, as I lay in my tent
with this...

260
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,058
this head of mine...

261
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:16,298
a terrible thought crept like a snake
into my brain.

262
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,535
Hunting was beginning
to bore me.

263
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:22,475
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?

264
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:27,914
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has
been the whip for all other passions.

265
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,315
When I lost
my love of hunting...

266
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:35,119
I lost my love of life...
of love.

267
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
Well, you seem to have
stood it pretty well.

268
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,592
I even tried to sink myself
to the level of the savage.

269
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:49,296
I made myself perfect in the use
of the Tartar war bow.

270
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,566
Tartar which?

271
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,541
Tartar war bow...

272
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,544
That one up there.

273
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,975
It's cute.

274
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,644
Even to this day I prefer
to hunt with it...

275
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,654
but alas,
even that was too deadly.

276
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,623
What I needed
was not a new weapon...

277
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,084
but a new animal.

278
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,859
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.

279
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:19,332
You found one?

280
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:22,660
Yes.

281
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:26,572
Here on my island...

282
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:30,669
I hunt
the most dangerous game.

283
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:35,544
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?

284
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:38,085
Tigers?
[Chuckling] No.

285
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:43,984
The tiger has nothing
but his claws and his fangs.

286
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,625
I heard some queer beast howling back
there along the water. Was that it?

287
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,640
It's no use, Rainsford.

288
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,642
He won't tell.

289
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,440
He won't even let you see
his trophy room...

290
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:09,143
till he gets ready to take you
on a hunt of the great whatsit.

291
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:14,019
My one secret. I keep it
as a surprise for my guests...

292
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:16,387
against the rainy day
of boredom.

293
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,517
You let me in on that game...

294
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:21,154
and I'll bet you
I go for it.

295
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,926
You know, Rainsford,
he hasn't failed yet.

296
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,900
If he says a thing is good,
it is good.

297
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,938
He's a judge of liquor,
wizard at contract...

298
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,701
plays the piano...
anything you want.

299
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:36,210
He's a good host
and a good scholar, eh, Count?

300
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:37,472
Yes, yes.

301
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:41,209
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.

302
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,116
We'll have a big party,
get cockeyed and go hunting.

303
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:46,120
A completely civilized
point of view.

304

Good idea. Play the piano.

Have you asked him

I don't want to treat you
like my other guests.

462
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:46,009
You and I,
we are hunters.

463
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:51,385
So that's
your most dangerous game.

464
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:54,717
[Chuckling] Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night...

465
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,381
but you know, Miss Trowbridge...

466
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:58,118
You hunted him like an animal.

467
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,252
I know what you think,
but you are wrong.

468
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:03,491
He was sober and fit for sport
when I sent him out.

469
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,591
An hour or two strapped up in here
brought him to his senses.

470
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:09,159
You raving maniac!

471
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:12,900
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off...
when we've finished.

472
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:17,934
The stupid fellow tried to escape
through the swamps of Fog Hollow.

473
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,572
You see, when I first began
stocking my island...

474
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,378
many of my guests
thought I was joking...

475
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,318
so I established
this trophy room.

476
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:29,584
I always bring them here
before the hunt.

477
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,125
An hour with my trophies...

478
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,889
and they usually do their best
to keep away from me.

479
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:37,796
Where do you get
these poor devils?

480
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:42,768
Providence provided my island
with dangerous reefs.

481
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:45,305
But there are light buoys
to mark the safe channel.

482
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:49,901
[Chuckles]
They do not always mark it.

483
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:52,446
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.

484
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:54,947
Too bad your yacht
should have suffered...

485
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:57,246
but at least
it brought us together.

486
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,752
You take half-drowned men
from ships you've wrecked...

487
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,755
and drive them out
to be hunted.

488
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:04,348
I give them
every consideration...

489
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:06,689
good food, exercise...

490
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:09,252
everything to get them
in splendid shape.

491
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,595
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.

492
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,158
Oh, I admit,
with this annoying fellow...

493
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:18,433
but usually I give them
hunting clothes...

494
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:21,703
a woodsman's knife
and a full day's start.

495
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:26,008
I even wait until midnight to give them
the full advantage the dark.

496
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,708
And if one eludes me
only till sunrise...

497
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,251
he wins the game.

498
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,121
Suppose he refuses
to be hunted.

499
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,989
Ivan is such an artist
with these.

500
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:46,999
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford,
invariably they choose to hunt.

501
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:49,002
And when they win?

502
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:57,305
To date I have not lost.

503
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:00,404
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find
this game worth playing.

504
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:04,042
When the next ship arrives,
we'll have gorgeous sport together.

505
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:08,054
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter not an assassin.

506
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:11,455
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.

507
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,694
Hunt men?

508
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:18,391
Say you will hunt with me!

509
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,472
No?

510
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,565
What do you think I am?

511
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,969
One, I fear, who dare not
follow his own convictions...

512
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:35,072
to their logical conclusion.

513
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:38,915
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr. Rainsford...

514
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:41,420
you may have to follow them.

515
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,452
What do you mean?

516
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:48,893
I shall not wait
for the next ship.

517
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:53,660
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.

518
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,669
[Speaking Russian]

519
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:01,505
Come, Mr. Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.

520
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:17,657
Ivan.

521
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,860
[Speaking Russian]

522
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,090
Your fangs and claws,
Mr. Rainsford.

523
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,101
[Eve]
Bob! Bob!

524
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,482
Ivan.

525
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,610
Bob! Bob, what are they
going to do?

526
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:48,280
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.

527
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:50,290
Outdoor chess.

528
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,292
His brain against mine.

529
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,160
His good craft against mine.

530
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,996
- And the prize?
- The prize?

531
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,365
You may recall
what I said last evening.

532
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:05,803
Only after the kill...

533
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:09,365
does man know
the true ecstasy of love.

534
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:12,973
Suppose you lose.

535
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:15,948
If I do not...

536
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:18,645
What shall I say?...
find you...

537
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,554
between midnight and sunrise tomorrow,
freedom for both of you.

538
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:26,684
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.

539
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:30,253
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.

540
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,993
If you lose,
I can easily recapture her alive.

541
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,365
All right.
I'll take her with me then.

542
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,234
We'll set him a trail
he'll remember.

543
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,508
It's only fair to advise you
against Fog Hollow.

544
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:52,079
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.

545
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,894
Don't lose your nerve.
We'll beat this thing.

546
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,370
- The others didn't.
- We will.

547
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,082
Come on.
Let's get going.

548
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,845
It seems as though
we've come miles.

549
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:57,646
Yeah, but three hours
doesn't take you far in this jungle.

550
00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:59,652
Come on.
Let's keep going.

551
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,654
Come on.

552
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,097
Just a little more of this,
then easy downhill going.

553
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,158
We'll soon be safe.

554
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,794
No wonder he was so sure.

555
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,558
This island is no bigger
than a deer park.

556
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:46,566
[Sobbing]
Oh, Bob!

557
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:49,669
Come on, now.

558
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:52,639
What are we going to do?

559
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:57,440
We didn't each live through a shipwreck
to let this crazy man hunter worry us.

560
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:01,072
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.

561
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:04,345
Alone? And leave you here
with that savage?

562
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,352
Not a chance.

563
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:11,291
Now we've got to think
of something to worry him.

564
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,328
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.

565
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:16,955
Weapons aren't everything
in the jungle.

566
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:20,865
Say, did you notice
that leaning tree down there?

567
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:24,393
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.

568
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,670
You see? If that supporting branch
were cut away...

569
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,010
this fallen tree would make a perfect
Malay deadfall.

570
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:36,015
A Malay deadfall? What's that?

571
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,517
A man-killing contraption
the natives use.

572
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,679
It would stop that madman,
all right.

573
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,848
Trouble is, it takes
quite a few hours to build.

574
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,857
He said he wouldn't follow
till midnight.

575
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:48,088
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.

576
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:50,426
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.

577
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:57,803
There. Almost ready.

578
00:41:57,872 --> 00:42:00,432
This bracelet of yours makes
a fine guide ring for my necktie.

579
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:03,773
He'll have been on his way
almost an hour now.

580
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:06,039
Look out!
Don't touch that trip line.

581
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:08,411
You'll have a two-ton tree
down on your back.

582
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:11,542
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.
- Will it really work?

583
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,554
I've never known a living thing
to get by one yet.

584
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:17,955
Look here.
You touch that trip line...

585
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:20,118
it'll pull that trigger free.

586
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:23,459
Once that's loose, there's nothing
to keep the log from coming down.

587
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:26,227
It'll crash down
and kill anything underneath it.

588
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:32,038
Look.

589
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:39,273
We're ready.
Let him come.

590
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,660
[Whispering]
Give me that knife.

591
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:50,049
[Gasps]

592
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,585
Come out, Rainsford.

593
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:03,596
Why prolong it?

594
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:05,598
I'll not bungle this shot.

595
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,691
You'll never even feel it.

596
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:12,797
But surely you don't think
that anyone who has hunted leopards...

597
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:15,364
would follow you
into that ambush?

598
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:25,475
Oh, very well.
If you choose to play the leopard...

599
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:28,750
I shall hunt you
like a leopard.

600
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:49,939
[Whispering]
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.

601
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:15,635
Eve.

602
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,214
Why did he go?

603
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:30,750
He's playing with us...
like a cat with a mouse.

604
00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:32,752
What do you mean?

605
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,913
You heard him say he'd hunt us
as he'd hunt a leopard.

606
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,923
That means he's gone
for his high-powered rifle.

607
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:39,824
His rifle?
Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!

608
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:41,828
- Run, quick!
- Eve, wait.

609
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,051
- No, I tell you, no!
- Don't stop! No!

610
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,111
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.

611
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:12,124
- Fog Hollow?
- The swamp where he caught the others.

612
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:14,752
We haven't a chance
of keeping ahead of him there.

613
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:17,558
- But there's no place else to run.
- That's just what he's counting on.

614
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:21,123
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got
to use our brains instead of our legs.

615
