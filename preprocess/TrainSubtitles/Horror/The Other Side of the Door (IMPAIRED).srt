I was born in
a village in South India.

167

Surrounding our village
was a big forest.

And deep within
this forest

169
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,547
there was an abandoned temple.

170

It is said that the line between the
world of the dead and the living

00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,141
is very thin
at this place.

of your son,

00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,489

steps of this temple,

lock yourself inside,

176
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,243
and when night comes,

177
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,329
he will come to you.

178
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,749
And you will be
able to talk to him

179
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,542

of the temple,
