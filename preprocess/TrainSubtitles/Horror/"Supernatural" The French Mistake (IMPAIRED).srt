00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,518
You beat the Devil,
lost your soul,

170
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,103
and got it back again.

171
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:24,438
So tell us, what's next
for Sam Winchester?

172
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:28,393
Look, I... I... I really don't...

173

the question in your answer?

174

freakin' makeup on us!

Those bastards!

- Look, I think I know what this is.
- Okay. What?

180
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:47,095
- It's a TV show.
- You think?

181
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,464
Yeah. I mean, here...
wherever "here" is,

182
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,050
this... this twilight zone
Balthazar zapped us into.

183
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,304
For whatever reason,
our life is a TV show.

184
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,106
- Why?
- I don't know.

185

No, seriously. Why?
Why would anybody want to watch our lives?

186
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,728
Well, I mean, according to that
interviewer, not very many people do.

187
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,947
Look, I'm not saying
it makes sense.

188
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,599
I'm just saying, we...
we landed in some dimension

189
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,151
where you're Jensen Ackles,

190
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,737
and I'm something
called a "Jared Padalecki."

So what, now you're <i>Polish?</i>

I feel sick.

199

I'm gonna be sick.

00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,969
I want to go home.

201
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,522
I feel like this whole place
is bad-touching me.

202
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,474
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

203
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,243
So, what do you think?
Cass?

204
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,362
He's our best shot,
if he's still alive.

205
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,116
Dear Castiel,

206

who art maybe running his ass
away from heaven,

207

we pray that
you have your ears on.

Hey, Cass!

211
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,718
Oh, thank God.

212
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:17,969
What is all this, huh?

213
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,504
W... w... what did
Balthazar do to us?

214
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,644
[As Castiel] To keep you
out of Virgil's reach,

215
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,396
he's cast you
into an alternate reality,

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,615
a universe similar to ours
in most respects

217
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,684
yet dramatically different
in others.

218
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,871
Like... like bizarro earth,
right?

219
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:38,907
Except instead
of having Bizarro Superman,

220
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,792
we get this clown factory.

221
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,911
Um...

222
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,162
Yeah, well...

223
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,331
Anyway, no time to explain.

224
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,467
- Do you have the key?
- Yeah.

225
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:51,586
So, uh, what does
this thing do, anyway?

226
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,138
It opens a room.

227
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,389
What's in the room?

228
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,675
Every weapon Balthazar
stole from Heaven.

229
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,510
He gave it to <i>us?</i>

00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,979
To keep it safe
until I could reach you.

231
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:04,015
With those weapons, I have
a chance to rally my forces.

232
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,384
Oh. Okay, good. Yeah.

233
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:09,554
So, now, uh, what's the deal
with all this TV crap?

234

Pardon?

Yeah. Amen, Padaleski.

- What?

- New what?

240
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,498
I mean, is this some kind
of cosmic joke?

241
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,916
Yeah, 'cause if it is,
it's stupid,

- and we don't get it.
- Yeah.

We finish today in 12 hours
if it kills us all.

497
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,748
Get "A" and "B" Cam
for scene 12.

498
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,133
What is this?

499
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,336
Here for the first run-through,
before anyone else?

500
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,788
Dedication.

501
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,641
Uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

502
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:32,344
Um, we're gonna need
the, uh, set cleared

503
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:35,564
for... safe side,
an hour or so.

504
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,232
You need it cleared.

505
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,350
Yeah.

506
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,436
Yeah. Me and, um...

507
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,739
Jared were gonna do
some actor stuff.

508
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,825
Jensen,

509
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,496
we're thrilled to see you
collaborating so creatively.

510
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,948
And your enthusiasm
is refreshing.

511
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,034
Dean Cain was like that
on "Lois,"

512
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,752
and that man's a real actor.

513
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,672
And we will clear this set

514
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:02,591
exactly when we shoot
the 2 3/8 pages

515
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:05,660
we are scheduled to shoot
on this set.

516
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,797
So you do your "actor stuff"

517
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,000
and we'll do
our "camera stuff" and, uh...

518
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:18,340
Ooh, "priority."
What's in it?

519
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:23,312
I bought
parts of a dead person.

520
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,814
Oh, cool.

521
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:28,484
Uh, so, bad news.

522
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,152
Uh...

523
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:32,371
Looks like we're gonna
have to do a little acting.

524
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,989
[Chuckles] What?

525
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,859
"Supernatural" scene 36,
take 1.

526
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,211
Marker!

527
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,915
Action!

528
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,700
[As Castiel]
Balthazar is no hero.

529
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:48,971
But he knows Raphael
will never take him back.

530
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,550
BOB: Cut!

531
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,939
"Supernatural" scene 36,
take 8.

532
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:07,990
Marker!

533
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,161
Action!

534
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:14,113
Balthazar is no hero.

535
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:17,166
But he knows Raphael
will never take him back.

536
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,598
Dean, grimly.

537
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:35,384
And yet, somehow you got
no problem with it.

538
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:36,084
Cut!

539
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:44,092
Action.

540
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:48,930
That's because...

541
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,869
that's because we have
no other choice.

542
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,588
Don't look at the camera.

543
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:57,656
What?

544
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,608
Look anywhere but the camera.

545
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,966
That's because
we have no other choice!

546
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:09,551
Cut!

547
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:10,586
For the love of...

548
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,838
Action.

549
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:18,010
Cut!

550
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:21,814
If there's a key,

551
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,067
then there must also be a lock.

552
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:25,901
Cut.

553
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,237
Action.

554
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:31,607
If there's a key...

555
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:34,910
...then there has to be a lock.

556
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,528
And when we find the lock,

557
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,113
we can get the weapons,

558
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,332
and then we can have
the weapons.

559
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,501
And the lock. We'll still
have the lock, I imagine,

560
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,503
because we've opened it, and,
of course, the initial key.

561
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,255
[Deep voice] We need to get
all three of that crap.

562
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,322
What?

563
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,590
- That's how he talks.
- Oh.

564
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,160
[Normal voice] Do we really
need all these lines?

565
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,847
I mean, I... I... I... I think
we've covered it.

566
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:56,431
- Right?
- Cut!

567
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:57,933
What is happening?

568
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,668
What's happening?!

569
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,303
What's <i>happening?!</i>

570
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:03,722
An atrocity is happening.

571
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:05,023
Seems like they should stop.

572
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,725
They can't stop.

573
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,943
<i>Nobody</i> stops.

574
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:11,280
Did we get anything we can use?

575
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:15,234
Well, uh, technically,
we have them saying everything

576
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:16,851
in bits and pieces.

577
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:19,071
Could be sort of experimental?

578
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,990
Whatever.

579
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,409
Season Six.

580
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,827
Who wrote this?

581
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:28,330
Nobody says "penultimate!"

582
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:30,082
Gun, mouth.

583
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,166
Now.

584
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,218
[Sighs]

585
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,703
Moving on!
[Bell rings]

586
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,637
Thank God.

587
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,842
[Normal voice] "I-M-H-O,

588
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,646
'J' and 'J' had a <i>late</i> one
last night."

589
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:47,432
All right, damn it.

590
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:49,884
We earned this.

591
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:53,405
"R-O-T-F-L-M-A-O."

592
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,357
SERA:
Spell it out for me, please.

593
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,392
What is our
terror-alert level here?

594
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,244
I don't know, Sera.
Orange, maybe?

595
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,079
They started talking
to each other.

596
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,748
What?!
But that's a good thing.

597
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,032
Right.
I thought so.

598
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,834
But now Jensen's living
at Jared's house.

599
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,753
- That's it?
- Plus, Clif says they're smuggling

600
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:09,838
- illegal stuff in from Mexico.
- That's it, Toto.

601
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:10,923
Misha's celebrity Tweet

602
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,674
says it's a black-market
organ thing.

603
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:13,842
I'm betting drugs.

604
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,577
Anyway, as far as I can see,

605
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:18,630
I think they've lost any
shred of talent they ever had.

606
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,751
[Both groan]
Oh, that one hurt.

607
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,085
Drugs.

608
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,187
[Sam groans]

609
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,941
Maybe we did it wrong.

610
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,109
No.

611
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:33,028
No, that...
that spell was <i>perfect.</i>

612
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:35,314
It should have worked.

613
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,282
What if it can't?

614
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,768
Look, I was up all night,
looking online.

615
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:41,653
There's no sign

616
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,822
that anything like
the apocalypse happened here.

617
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,107
<i>Ever.</i>

618
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,275
And as far as I can tell,

619
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,211
monsters, ghosts, demons...

620
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,629
they're all pretend.

621
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:54,049
- So nobody's hunting them?
- No hunters.

622
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:57,002
Look, maybe that's why our spell
didn't work, Dean, you know?

623
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,805
M... maybe here,
there's no supernatural,

624
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:00,955
no magic.

625
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,809
No demons, no Hell,

626
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,228
no Heaven, no... no God?

627
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,462
Something like...

628
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:09,514
even better...

629
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,267
no angels.

630
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,481
Okay, maybe we can't
get out of, uh, you know,

631
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,598
earth number two right now,

632
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,933
but the least we can do

633
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:43,647
is get the hell out
of the Canadian part of it.

634
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:44,488
[Scoffs] Yeah.

635
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:47,446
I hear one more conversation
about hockey, I'm gonna puke.

636
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,178
Wait a minute.

This way, this way, this way.

No, no, no, no, no.
It's this way.

639
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:53,599
It's this way!

640
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,267
No, Dean, look, I really...
I really think that we should...

641
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:56,468
Dean!

642
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,721
You think you can run?

643
00:26:58,805 --> 00:26:59,555
No!

644
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,678
Sorry, dude.

[Grunts]

647
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:13,452
No magic in the house.

648
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,737
Which makes you
nothing but a dick.

649
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,910
You know,
I oversee all the stunts,

650
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:23,078
coordinate all the fights.

651
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,330
That's exciting.

Is that one of yours, then?

SERA: I'm trying
to understand, Bob.

662
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,793
Well, uh, Sera, we don't really
understand it ourselves,

663
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,431
but, uh, it appears
that Jared and Jensen

664
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:02,467
were seen beating
an extra to death.

665

Huh.

666
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,687
This is Jim here, Sera, and
it wasn't all the way to death.

667
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,355
Only partway, so that's a plus.

668
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,607
He could definitely still run.

669

And we'll certainly
follow up on that,

670
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:13,111
but I think the real issue
here, Sera,

671
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:15,330
is that the boys appear to be

672
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:18,834
on some kind of extended
psychedelic acid trip.

673

I'll fly up and talk to them.

675

You know, I'm not sure
Jared and Jensen...

676

strictly speaking.

No offense.

we might need at this stage

680
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:39,304
is for Kripke
to come up himself.

682

They'll listen to him.

683
