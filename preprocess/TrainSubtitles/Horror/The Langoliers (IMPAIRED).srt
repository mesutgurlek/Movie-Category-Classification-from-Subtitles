00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,100
You're a teacher, aren't you?

158
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,500
That's right, sweetie. The 5th grade.

159
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
How did you know that?

160
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
DINAH:
It's in your voice.

161
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Miss Lee, my teacher
at the blind school,

162
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
sounds just like you.

163
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,500
If you'll excuse me, I think
I'm going forward to join our friend.

164
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,500
I want to know what is going on here

165
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,900
and I want to know right now.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Nor am I a bit surprised.

167
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
You said before
that you had felt someone's hair.

168
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,000
- What did you mean by that?
- Over there on one of the seats,

169
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,300
I felt someone's hair.

170
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
This? This is a wig.

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,300
It's not a human scalp.
Is that what you felt?

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,300
What do you see?

173
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,200
Nothing, just mountains
and darkness.

174
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,000
Hello?

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
Hello. Hello?

176
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,900
What's wrong? The flight crew
disappear with everybody else?

177
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Yeah. No. I don't know.
They're not answering my calls

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,600
- and the door's locked from the inside.
- I was afraid of that.

179
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
Sorry to get your wind up.
Nick Hopewell.

180
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
I am praying, sir, that the pilot's cap

181
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,700
I noticed on one of the first-class seats
belongs to you.

182
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
It does. Captain Engle.

183
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,500
But under the circumstances,
you can call me Brian.

184
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,600
I'll call you saviour if we find
what I expect to find

185
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
on the other side of that door.

186
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,800
Well, let's try and get it open,
shall we?

187
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

188
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
All right, let's see.

189
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,900
How could someone disappear
and leave their hairpiece behind?

190
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,500
That's quite a mystery,
don't you think?

191
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
- God.
ALBERT: Yeah,

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
you're not kidding.

193
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
Somebody's bridge work.

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,800
I was afraid of that.

195
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
What's going on here?

196
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
TOOMY:
Hello, excuse me.

197
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,600
Come out from back there.
Who's back there?

198
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,000
- Hi.
BRIAN: Yeah.

199
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,900
I'd like to know
what's going on, please.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Currently, we're about to break
the cockpit door.

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,900
It seems our crew have abdicated
along with everybody else.

202
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,100
But we're in luck all the same.

203
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
My new acquaintance here
just happens to be a pilot.

204
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Do you work
for American Pride, friend?

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,100
Yes, I do.

206
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,700
- But I think what's important...
- No, I'm gonna tell you...

207
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,700
BRIAN: Excuse me.
- I'm gonna tell you what's important.

208
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
You know what's important?

209
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I have a meeting at Boston's
Prudential Center at 9:00 this morning.

210
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Promptly at 9:00.

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,700
That's what's important.

212
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Now, I booked a seat
on this conveyance in good faith,

213
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,900
and I have absolutely no intention
of being late for that appointment.

214
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Wait, wait, wait.

215
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Now, I have three
questions for you:

216
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,600
Number one, who authorised

217
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
an unscheduled stop for this airliner
while I was asleep?

218
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
[MAN EXHALES]

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,200
Number two,
where was that stop made?

220
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,900
And number three, why?
Why was that done?

221
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,000
You ever watch Mr. Spock
on <i>Star Trek?</i>

222
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
What the hell are you talking about?

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Just that if you don't shut
your cake hole, you bloody idiot,

224
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,300
I'll be happy to demonstrate
his Vulcan sleeper hold for you.

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Don't you talk to me like that.
Do you know who I am?

226
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
Of course I do.

227
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,100
You're an obnoxious twerp who likes
to hide fear behind aggression.

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,300
No harm in that,
but you are in the way.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Listen to me. Listen... Aah!

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
- Aah!
- Whoa, a nose hold.

231
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,300
I can break it.
Easiest thing in the world, trust me.

232
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
TOOMY: Aah!
- I said I could break it.

233
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,600
Do you understand?
Signify if you understand.

234
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Ow!

235
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,900
NICK:
You listen to me,

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
I haven't got time to discuss
your business appointments,

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
therefore I'm gonna send you
to the cabin

238
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
with this gentleman
in the striped shirt.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Don Gaffney.

240
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Mr. Gaffney will be your escort.

241
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,800
Once you arrive in the main cabin,
you will sit down in your seat,

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,500
strap your seat belt firmly around
your middle and keep your mouth shut.

243
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you understand?

244
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,700
Please favour me with a thumbs up
if you understand.

245
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Jolly good.

246
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Now, I'm gonna let go of you
and your nose now.

247
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,300
And when I do, if you so much
as utter a word,

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,800
a syllable, you will be investigating
hitherto unexplored realms of pain.

249
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
- You son of a...
- I wouldn't, mister.

250

This guy means it.

251
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,400
You better come on back with me.

252
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,900

- Oh! Bad idea.

Come on, now.

254

Hey. Come on.

255
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Come on.

256
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Let's see if we can find something
for that nose.

257
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Right, then,

258
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,800
let's get the cockpit door open,
shall we?

259
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
NICK:
Come on...

260
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,300
Whoa.

261
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,100
No one's driving the plane.

262
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
It happened fast, whatever it was.

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Look there.

264
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I mean, look here.

265
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
If you want watches, take your pick.

266
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
There are tons of them back
in the main cabin.

267
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Are there indeed?

268
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,800
ALBERT:
Watches, jewellery and glasses.

269
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,400
Also purses.

270
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,700
But the weirdest thing is,

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,600
there's stuff that we're pretty sure
came from inside of people.

272
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
Like surgical pins, pacemakers.

273
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,500
You know, I've been going on the
same assumption as our rude friend...

274
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, the one I used
the nose lock on?

275
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
- That the plane had landed
somewhere for some reason

276
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,000
and most of the passengers and crew
were somehow offloaded and then...

277
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,800
No, there couldn't have been
a takeoff while we were sleeping.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,700
You can fly that plane on automatic

279
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,800
but you need a human being
to take one up or land.

280
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
So where are the passengers
and crew then?

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I don't know.

282
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
But I plan on finding out.

283
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,100
You wanna hand me that paper,
please?

284
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Well, the altitude is right,
37,000 feet.

285
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,600
We're on course.

286
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900

BRIAN: It means we have no radio.

314

It means we have no Denver
navigational beacon,

315

is peachy keen.

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,800
Why don't you get some sleep?
You'll feel a whole lot better.

470
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
No, I won't.

471
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,800
Besides, I was asleep
and now I'm all slept out.

472

JENKINS:
Do you see anything?

473
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,400
I didn't think so.

474
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,800
May I ask you something?

475
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Did you happen to hear anything
the little girl said earlier?

476
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,900
- No.
- Well, she was telling Miss Stevenson

477
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,600
she didn't think
she could go to sleep

478
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
because she had
already been asleep.

479
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,600
I also had been asleep.

480
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
What about you, dear boy?

481
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,700
What about me what?

482
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
Were you sleeping?
You were, weren't you?

483
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,600
- Well, yeah.
- Yes.

484
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,700
We were all asleep. Everybody.

485
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,400
- Well, maybe.
- Nonsense, "maybe."

486
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm a mystery writer,
deduction is my bread and butter.

487
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,300
Don't you think
if someone had been awake

488
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,000
when all those people
were eliminated,

489
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,500
that that person would have screamed
bloody murder

490
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
and awakened the rest of us?

491
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,500
- Well, I guess so.
- Of course.

492
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,500
So I deduce that everyone
was asleep,

493
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,100
including all those people
that were subtracted,

494
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,900
along with the flight crew,
of course, dear boy.

495
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Could you call me Albert, please,
Mr. Jenkins?

496
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,100
- That's my name.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

497
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Yes, I'm upset, and when I'm upset,
I tend to get a little patronizing.

498
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Please, forgive me. It's just
that I'm trying to figure this thing out.

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
Well, do you have any ideas?

500
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,700
Well, if it were just the plane,
I could easily come up with a scenario.

501
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
What scenario?

502
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,100
Oh, well, let's say, for instance,

503
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,600
that some shadowy government
organization

504
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
decided to conduct an experiment
and we were the test subjects.

505
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
And the purpose
of such an experiment,

506
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,300
given the circumstances,
would be to document the effect

507
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,400
of serious emotional stress
on a number of ordinary Americans.

508
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,200
And the scientist
who designed the experiment

509
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,500
loads the oxygen system
of this plane

510
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,400
with an odourless hypnotic gas.

511
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,400
After this is released into the air,
everyone falls asleep,

512
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
with the obvious exception
of the pilot,

513
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,200
who is breathing uncontaminated air
through a mask.

514
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,800
Then the captain lands the plane
at a secret airstrip,

515
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,000
in Nevada, let's say,

516
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,200
whereupon, with the exception of the
nine randomly chosen test subjects,

517
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,100
all the sleeping passengers
are carefully carried off the plane

518
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,400
and placed aboard
another identical plane.

519
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,500
The captain then gets Flight 29
airborne again

520
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,000
and returns it
to its original altitude and heading.

521
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,100
He activates the autopilot,
he disables the radio systems.

522
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,900
And then as the effect of the gas
begins to wear off,

523
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
the captain hears on his intercom

524
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,300
the voice of the little blind girl
calling for her aunt,

525
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
and he knows
that this will wake the others.

526
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,000
The experiment is about to begin.

527
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,900
Captain Engle is one of them?

528
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,400
Well, in this scenario he is.

529
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,700
If Captain Engle is one of the people
who did this,

530
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,100
we're gonna have to capture him
as soon as we land.

531
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,000
You, me, Mr. Gaffney
and perhaps that British fellow.

532
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
But it doesn't hold up, you know?

533
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,400
- What?
- The scenario I just gave you,

534
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,900
it doesn't hold up.

535
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
- But you just said...
- What I said was,

536
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,800
if it were just this plane,
I could give you a scenario.

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,100
But unfortunately,

538
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,400
it's not just this plane.

539
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,500
The city of Denver is probably
still down there,

540
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,700
but all its lights were off if it was.

541
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,200
And it's not just Denver,

542
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
I can tell you that.

543
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Omaha, Des Moines, St. Louis,

544
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,000
there isn't a trace of any of them
down there either.

545
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,100
Now, what has happened

546
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,000
has not just happened on this plane.

547
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
And that's where deduction
breaks down.

This is American Pride 29, heavy.

science fiction, do you?

as a kid. You?

Yeah, until I was 18 or so.

558

I've been sitting here running
all these old stories through my head.

alien raiding parties.

No, too dangerous.

You can laugh at me if you want.

I'm not laughing, matey.

571

like in a science fiction story.

How do we know
what's down there?

577
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,700
I mean, this Earth could have
the Rockies in upstate New York.

578
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,900
Well, we seem to have the sky
pretty much to ourselves.

579
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Up here, that's true. Down there...

580

...who knows?

581
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,800
And "who knows" is a very
dicey situation for an airline pilot.

Maybe because I'm blind.

I don't know.
But I know you don't lie.

have heard the difference.

How did you come to know him?

Well, that's the embarrassing part.
And that's why I lied.

I've never actually met him before.

We started corresponding
through a personal ad in a magazine

the crew on this flight disappeared,

the ground have disappeared as well.

whatever it was...

have thought that it was spoiled.

don't cross my eyes none.

Flat and tastes just like an old tyre.

- Well, I have an idea.

1107

But before I say anything else,
I'd like you all

1108
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,500
to look around this place
very carefully

1109
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,100
and see if you can
tell me what's different

1110
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,700
about in here than on the plane.

1111
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,700
The rings. The wallets.
The purses. The surgical pins.

1112
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,200
- None of that stuff is here.
- Correct.

1113
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,400
That's 100 percent correct.

1114
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,000
As you say, there's
none of that stuff here.

1115
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:32,700
But when we woke up it was
on the plane. Why isn't it here?

1116
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,800
Maybe nobody was here
when it happened.

1117
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,100
No, that's nonsense.

1118

An air terminal is like
a police station or a fire station.

I think I found a fallacy
in our thinking,

and it is this:

1188
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:05,900
We all assumed as we began to grasp
the dimensions of this event

1189
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,800
that something had happened
to the rest of the world.

1190
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,100
But the evidence doesn't bear
that assumption out.

What has happened

1192

as we know it

is ticking along as it always has.
