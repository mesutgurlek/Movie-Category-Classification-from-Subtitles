Henry Sturges.

153
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,859
And where you are
is my home.

154
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,945
And what happened...

155
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,864
I saved your life

156
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,993
during your rather pathetic
attempt at taking another's.

157
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,577
What were you
doing there, and

158
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,579
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?

159
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,251
How?

160
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,879
I watched this boy carry out his
first long-awaited mission.

161
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,299
Drunk, might I add.

162
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,720
And I think, "You have wasted your
time watching this one, Henry."

163
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,639
"He's not
a promising recruit."

164
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:30,894
"He is just a selfish boy with
his heart set on vengeance."

165
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:36,400
And I realized, "This boy
is a goddamned idiot!"

166
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,946
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire."

167
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,282
A vampire?

168
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,493
Yes. Immortal,
blood-sucking demons.

169
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,579
Fortunately for you,
Mr. Lincoln,

170
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,706
hunting them is
something of a hobby.

171
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,292
But vampires
are just myths.

172
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,418
Myths don't
beat you senseless

173
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,254
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.

174
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,339
Thank you.

175
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,799
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.

176
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,261
They exist in every city
and every state

177
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,263
in the Union.

178
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,768
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

179
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,269
I could pay you
to kill him!

180
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,438
My services
are not for sale.

181
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,357
And the word you are
looking for is "destroy."

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,444
It is quite a feat to kill
that which is already dead.

183
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,949
But you don't understand.

184
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,285
My mother was murdered.

185
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:33,290
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer,

186
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,959
so what?

187
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,213
How will that
honor her memory?

188
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,883
How will that benefit the next
boy whose mother is taken?

189
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,219
If vengeance is
all you seek,

190
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,970
seek it elsewhere.

191
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:51,266
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.

192
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,269
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance

193
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,480
and commit to
the life of a hunter?

194
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,607
You will have
no friends,

195
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,110
no family.

206

which one
takes your fancy?

207
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,936
Actually, I haven't had the best
of luck with shooting irons.

209

I was a rail splitter.

210
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,205
I would like you to chop this
tree down with a single swing.

211
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,832
That tree?

212
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,293
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

213
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,794
But it isn't a tree.

214

00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,215
So, tell me,
Mr. Lincoln,

216
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,884
what do you hate?

217
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,262
I hate Jack Barts.

218
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,723
Then strike him down.

219
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,064
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

220
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,484
Tell me what you hate.

221
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,445
I hate that my mother
was taken away.

222
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,823
Inadequate.

223
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,742
I hate that
we were afraid.

And?

225
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,622
That my mother and father,

lived in fear.

227

Pathetic.

228
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,335
I hate that
I was too small.

229
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,337
Too weak.
Yes.

230
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,172

Yes!

I go out

461
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,421
Well, how do you
hunt these vampires?

462
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,882
With an ax.

463
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:27,220
A special silver ax,
of course.

464
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,513
Of course.

465

And how many would you

Five. No, six.

496
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,118
What's the law for free
slaves in the North?

497
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,704
According to the Fugitive
Slave Act of 1793,

498
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,914
enforcing Article four,
section two,

499

of the United States
Constitution,

500
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,836
"All runaway slaves must be
returned to their owners."

501
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,463
However, personal
liberty laws state that

502
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,132
"Anyone who is
born free"

"cannot be taken

"Until all men

00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,535

Make a truce with Adam.

917
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,508
We must stop this war. Willie's
death is just the beginning.

918
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,427
Don't you dare
say his name.

919
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,429
I warned you.

920
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,013
You didn't heed me.

921
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:28,517
How many more boys will have to
die before you listen to me?

the troops back.

924
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,411
Abraham, this war has
cost us countless lives,

925
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,371
not to mention
millions of dollars.

926
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:52,082
I thought we were going to
make this country great,

927
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,959
not tear it apart.

928
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,755
This is the only way we can
save the country now, Speed.

929
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:02,509
Send in troops.

930
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,478
Union troops are
flooding onto the field.

931
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,314
We are now
outnumbered

932
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:18,525
and ill-equipped
compared to the North.

933
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,904
We will support you,

934
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,574

need to support us.

Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.
