a man came up to her

960

really homo right about now.

That guy's going to kill her.

01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,081
Yeah, she looks to be liking it, then.

992

No, man. Listen,
you don't understand!

Security is a little lax since everybody
got their throat torn out.

1001
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,442
You, too? Has he turned you?

1002
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,369
Check your monitor, man.

1003
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,880
I don't know if Amy's alive
or dead or turned, but he got her.

1004
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,468
I'm going to end him,
or he's going to end me.

1005
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,887
That's how it's going to be,
and you're gonna come with me.

1006
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,311
Don't you understand this yet?
There will be no fighting.

1007
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,639
There will only be surviving.

1008
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,232
- Maybe.
- Really?

1009
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,817
You think if you live and we all die,

1010
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,565
you'll be able to
get us out of your head?

1011
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:19,653
No, I know I won't.
I never could after the first time.

1012
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,743
So I told myself I made it up.

1013
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,245
I was a kid. Figured it was easier
to believe in monsters.

1014
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,869
Made what up?

1015
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,421
The vampire that killed my parents,

1016
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,714
but not me.

1017
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,173
You think I collected all this stuff
because it was bitching?

1018
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,852
Come with me. We'll go in at dawn.
He's got to rest some time.

1019
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,607
The only reason I survived the last time
is because I had the sense to hide.

1020
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,604
If you want to be a dead hero,
good for you. I'm out.

(SCOFFS)

1022
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,779
You think I'm a coward.
I'm not. I'm a realist.

1023
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,578
So you just bail on people.

1024
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,121
Hey, I get it.
My dad was like that.

1025
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,628
But I don't want to live till tomorrow
if you're the kind of man I'm going to be.

1026
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,469

supposed to change his victims back.

1031

You got a plan?

1032
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,571
There's no guarantee he'll be sleeping.

1033
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,827
To stake him, you got to get close.

1034
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,661
Torch him.

1035
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,415
A vampire on fire
is not thinking clearly.

1036
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,804
If he's on tire, how do I get
close enough to stake him?

1037
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,970
Fuck.

1038
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,054

Hello?

1150
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,164
It's me. Just checking in.
What are you up to?

1151
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:21,965
Nothing, nothing.

1152
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,929
- What are you doing?
- Just did a little shopping

1153
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,924
- for the new house.
- Shopping? Nice.

and I have to go.

Yeah, monster free.

01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:37,727
Good. Monster free is good.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

Okay, bye.

If you're naked,
I'm absolutely going to look.

Dude! Dude!

1162
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:49,414
I know. Sorry. I left my phone.

I'm not looking. I promise. See?

1164
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:55,955
I can't see a thing. All right.
That's it. I'm out of here.

1165
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,464
It's all yours.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1166
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,292
That doesn't narrow it down.

There's, like, mini golf and sushi.
Carry on!

Will you promise me,
now we'll finally be alone?
