1
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:41,796
Guenevere, Guenevere

2
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,129
In that dim, mournful year

3
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:54,469
Saw the men she heId so dear

4
00:03:56,314 --> 00:04:00,808
Go to war for Guenevere

5
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:19,633
The rules of battIe are not for
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.

6
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,703
Let us attack now while they sIeep.

7
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,501
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.

8
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,457
Merlyn...

9
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,497
...why is Jenny in that castle...

10
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:49,895
...behind walls I cannot enter?

11
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,400
How did I blunder into this...

12
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
...agonizing absurdity?

13
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:06,150
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?

14
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,987
Should I not have loved her?

15
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:17,491
Then I should not have been...

16
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,294
...born.

17
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,230
Oh, Merlyn...

18
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,664
...how did it happen?

19
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,228
I haven't got much time.

20
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,807
A thin inch of sunlight...

21
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,774
...the arrows begin to fly.

22
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,080
Merlyn...

23
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:43,315
...if I am to die...

24
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:44,954
...in battle...

25
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,092
...please do not let me die...

26
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,923
...bewildered.

27
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,193
Think, Arthur.

28
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,166
Think back.

29
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,355
Think back.

30
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,115
Think back!

31
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,992
Oh, Merlyn!

32
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:27,856
Think back.

33
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,000
Think back!

34
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,536
Think...

35
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,228
...back.

36
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,771
Back! To one of the most
important days of your life.

37
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,009
Oh, yes!

38
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:52,615
Hello.

39
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,328
My name is Arthur.

40
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,964
I think I'll call you...

41
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,635
...Wart.

42
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:08,699
""I think I'll call you Wart.""

43
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,032
No, no, no!

44
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,575
Now you've gone too far back.

45
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,818
Not the day you met me!

46
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,584
The day you met Guenevere.

47
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,352
The day she came...

48
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,251
...to Camelot.

49
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,628
That's the beginning.

50
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,795
Yes.

51
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,533
I know...

52
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,369
...what my people...

53
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:22,637
...are thinking tonight.

54
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,676
I know what my people
are thinking tonight

55
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:31,018
As home through the shadows they wander

56
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,254
Everyone smiling in secret deIight

57
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:39,924
As they stare at the castle and ponder

58
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,091
Whenever the wind blows this way

59
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:49,896
You can almost hear everyone say...

60
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:55,936
...I wonder what the king
is doing tonight

61
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:59,275
What merriment is the king
pursuing tonight?

62
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:02,780
The candles at the court
They never burned as bright

63
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,113
I wonder what the King
is up to tonight.

64
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:10,121
How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower

65
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,794
Being legally and regally prepared?

66
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:17,123
WeII, I'll tell you what the king
is doing tonight

67
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:20,463
He's scared
Oh, he's scared

68
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:26,876
You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon

69
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:29,979
Goes to wed in terror and distress?

70
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:31,682
Oh, yes!

71
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:35,646
A warrior who's so caIm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle

72
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,148
Faces a woman petrified with fright?

73
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,314
Right!

74
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:44,325
You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering

75
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,961
Is merely the banging
of his royal knees?

76
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,723
Please!

77
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:53,660
You wonder what the King
is wishing tonight?

78
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,168
He's wishing he were
in Scotland fishing tonight

79
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,001
What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?

80
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:04,611
He's searching high and low
For some place to hide

81
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:07,849
And, oh, the expectation,
The sublime anticipation

82
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:11,019
He must feel about
the wedding night to come

83
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:15,686
WeII, I'll tell you what the King
is feeling tonight

84
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,690
He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!

85
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,023
And that's what the King is doing

86
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,939
Tonight!

87
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,830
How long before we get to Camelot?

88
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,736
Soon, Ma'am, but don't look out there,
it's a ghastIy forest.

89
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:08,209
It's the most ferocious, savage...

90
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,474
...terrifying forest I've ever seen.

91
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,817
I simply adore it.

92
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,388
Does Your Ladyship not realize
that this forest is crawling...

93
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,715
...with outIaws and brigands?

94
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,585
Clary! You think there's
a chance of meeting one?

95
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:26,825
Don't say it, Ma'am.

96
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,063
It would be marvelous.

97
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:36,500
Imagine, Ma'am, soon you will
not only meet the man you will marry...

98
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,040
...but His Majesty,
King Arthur of EngIand.

99
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:43,737
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?

100
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:50,945
Was there ever a more
inconvenient marriage of convenience?

101
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:55,692
I am at the golden age of seductability,
and is my fate seaIed with a kiss?

102
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,360
Is it?
No, sealed with a seal!

103
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:08,099
Where are all the simple joys
of maidenhood?

104
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,434
Where are all those
adoring, daring boys?

105
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:17,775
Where's the knight pining so for me?

106
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,279
He leaps to death in woe for me

107
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:26,052
Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?

108
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,293
Shan't I have the normal life
a maiden should?

109
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:37,633
Shall I never be rescued in the wood?

110
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,303
Shall two knights never tilt for me

111
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,803
And let their blood be spilt for me?

112
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:49,139
Oh, where are the simple joys

113
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,142
Of maidenhood?

114
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,481
Shall I never be disputed for

115
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,817
Or on any minstrel's lips?

116
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:04,693
Never have my face recruited for

117
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:09,463
Launching countless ships?

118
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:15,836
Where are the simple joys
of maidenhood?

119
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:21,008
Are those sweet, gentle pleasures
gone for good?

120
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:25,448
Shall a feud not begin for me?

121
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,177
Shall kith not kill their kin for me?

122
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:33,688
Oh where are the trivial joys?

123
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:38,526
Harmless, convivial joys?

124
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,197
Where are the simple joys

125
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,593
Of maidenhood?

126
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:47,193
Halt!

127
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:51,030
Her Highness will rest here
while the Royal Hairdresser...

128
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,674
...attends her.

129
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:55,402
Can someone help with this canopy?

130
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,784
I should like some tea
while I'm being coifed.

131
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,273
St. Genevieve

132
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,601
It's Guenevere

133
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,612
Remember me?

134
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,814
St. Genevieve

135
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,216
I'm over here, beneath this tree!

136
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,621
You know how faithful and devout I am

137
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,827
You must admit I've always been a lamb

138
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:28,302
But Genevieve, St. Genevieve.

139
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,573
I won't obey you any more
You've gone a bit too far

140
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:37,042
I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar

141
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:40,179
St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled

142
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:45,282
And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead

143
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,992
Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve

144
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:00,326
Where were you when my youth was sold?

145
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,834
Dear Genevieve

146
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:08,038
Sweet Genevieve

147
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,505
Shan't I be young before I'm old?

148
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:20,551
A thousand pardons, my Iady.

149
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,385
Don't run, I won't harm you.

150
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:24,561
You lie! You'll leap on me
and throw me down!

151
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,061
I'll do no such thing.

152
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,529
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!

153
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,794
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.

154
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,197
Why not?

155
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,374
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?

156
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:43,438
-No, you're beautiful!
-Did you hear me praying?

157
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:45,878
I couIdn't help it.
You did pray loudIy.

158
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,675
So you know who I am?

159
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,716
Yes, you're Guenevere.

160
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:54,153
So that accounts for your polite,
respectful, despicable behavior?

161
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:58,217
Why isn't Merlyn here?

162
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:00,727
-Who?
-Merlyn. He's my teacher.

163
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:05,225
He's the wisest man alive. He'd
know what to do. He lives backwards.

164
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:09,666
-Beg your pardon?
-He lives backwards.

165
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,732
He doesn't age.
He...

166
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,138
...youthens?

167
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:19,409
He can remember the future...

168
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,915
...so he can tell you
what you'll do in it.

169
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,616
Come here.

170
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:34,754
CIose your eyes.

171
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,060
PIease.

172
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,568
Now just turn, gently.

173
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,432
Very slowly, open them.

174
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,638
Do you see that castle?

175
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:58,618
It used to light up
in a sort of pink gIow.

176
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,959
When I was young,
everything looked a little pink to me.

177
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,334
When Merlyn left,
he took all the pink with him.

178
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,497
Don't stare.
It's rude.

179
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,207
Who are you?

180
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,740
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.

181
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:32,285
-You sure you heard them properly?
-It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.

182
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,289
Is it really Wart?

183
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,934
Why don't you run away with me?

184
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,837
You could be my protector,
defend me all over the world...

185
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,301
...in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.

186
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,773
What a wonderful dream you spin.

187
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,971
And how easy it would be for me
to be caught up in it.

188
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,676
But...

189
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,941
...I must decline.

190
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,920
You forcing me to stay?

191
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,518
Oh, no, My Lady!

192
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:09,557
If you persist in escaping, I'll find
somebody brave to accompany you.

193
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:13,061
Then do so at once before
your wretched king finds me.

194
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:16,030
Do look around you, My Lady!

195
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,232
Reconsider.

196
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,368
Camelot is unique.

197
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:26,534
And we have, by far and away,
the most equabIe climate in all EngIand.

198
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,903
Ordained by decree.

199
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,417
Oh, come now!

200
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:38,316
It's true.

201
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,255
It's true!

202
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,687
The Crown has made it clear

203
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:47,591
The climate must be perfect

204
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,028
All the year

205
00:19:50,735 --> 00:19:54,569
A law was made
a distant moon ago here

206
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,739
July and August cannot be too hot

207
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:03,740
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here

208
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:06,239
In Camelot

209
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:13,045
The winter is forbidden till December

210
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,757
And exits March the second on the dot

211
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,422
By order, summer lingers
through September

212
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,427
In Camelot

213
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,266
Camelot

214
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:34,809
I know it sounds a bit bizarre

215
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:38,445
But in Camelot

216
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:44,584
That's how conditions are

217
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:50,450
The rain may never fall
till after sundown

218
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:54,628
By eight the morning fog must disappear

219
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,464
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

220
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:04,134
For happily-ever-aftering

221
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:08,844
Than here in Camelot

222
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,086
And I suppose the autumn leaves
fall into neat little piles?

223
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:20,753
No, My Lady.
They blow away completely.

224
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,653
At night, of course.

225
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:38,168
I know it gives a person pause

226
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,308
But in Camelot

227
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,681
Those are the legal laws

228
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:54,347
The snow may never
sIush upon the hillside

229
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:59,860
By nine p.m.
the moonlight must appear

230
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,864
In short, there's simply not

231
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,861
A more congenial spot

232
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:11,698
For happily-ever-aftering

233
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,701
Than here...

234
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:18,879
...in Camelot

235
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,054
Look!
There, on the hill!

236
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,523
I'm truly sorry, but...

237
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,256
...I'm afraid, on account of me...

238
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:40,130
...you may be hanged!
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!

239
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:43,773
That uncivilized king of yours wiII....
Defend yourseIf!

240
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,270
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?

241
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:55,183
The king!

242
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,351
Wart, it's the king!

243
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:05,459
Your Majesty, forgive me.

244
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:07,559
I did not know it was you.

245
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:18,239
The king.

246
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,430
When I was a young Iad
of 18 years of age...

247
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:52,371
...our good king, Pendragon, died,
leaving no one to succeed him...

248
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:56,443
...but a sword stuck through an anvil
that stood on a stone.

249
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,774
Written on it,
in gold letters, it said...

250
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,645
...""Who so pulleth this sword
from this stone...

251
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,218
...is rightwise born
King of all England.""

252
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:08,451
Many chaps tried to
dislodge it, but they failed.

253
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,652
So finally, a great tournament was
proclaimed for New Year's Day.

254
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,925
AII the mightiest knights in EngIand
were assembled at one time to have...

255
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:18,829
...a go at the sword.

256
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:29,339
I went to London as squire
to my cousin, Sir Kay.

257
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,138
On tournament day, Sir Kay found
he had left his sword at home...

258
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,818
...and he gave me
a shilling to fetch it.

259
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,649
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword...

260
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,317
...rising out of a stone.

261
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,323
Not thinking very clearly...

262
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,292
...I thought it was a war memorial.

263
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,701
So I decided to borrow it...

264
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:57,430
...and to save myself the trip.

265
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,137
So I...

266
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,780
...took the sword and...

267
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:06,546
...and I failed.

268
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,513
So I tried again.

269
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,878
And I failed again.

270
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:17,550
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes...

271
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:19,885
...and I tried...

272
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:23,658
...one last time.

273
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,267
And, lo!

274
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,734
The sword moved in my hand.

275
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:32,932
And slowly...

276
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:37,235
...it slid out of the stone.

277
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,244
I heard...

278
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:42,714
...a great roar.

279
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,185
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:

280
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,086
""...Long live the king!
Long live...

281
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,520
...the king.""

282
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,601
That's how I became king.

283
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:04,672
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.

284
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:08,378
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.

285
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,771
Until I dropped from the tree...

286
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,350
...and my eyes...

287
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:17,281
...beheld you.

288
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:25,186
And then, for the first time...

289
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:28,956
...I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.

290
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:34,529
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic...

291
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,406
...the wisest, the most...

292
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:40,309
...splendid king ever to sit...

293
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,604
...on any throne.

294
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:01,096
If My Lady will follow me...

295
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:03,960
...I'll find a proper companion...

296
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,636
...to accompany you.

297
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:33,519
I hear it never rains

298
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,632
Till after sundown

299
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:43,367
By eight the morning fog
must disappear

300
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,872
In short, there's simply not

301
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,212
A more congenial spot

302
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:56,546
For happily-ever-aftering

303
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,221
...than here...

304
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,995
...In Camelot

305
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,266
The map of England.

306
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:56,939
Map, indeed.

307
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,473
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms
ruled by immoral lords...

308
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:05,612
...battling with their own unlawful
armies over illegal border lines.

309
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,415
And who is...

310
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:09,482
...king of this...

311
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:11,017
...jungle?

312
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:15,119
The man who 4 years ago
pledged he would become...

313
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,885
...the greatest king
who ever sat on any throne.

314
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:18,991
I...

315
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:21,494
...Arthur of England.

316
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,257
Yes.

317
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,664
The greatest warrior in the land.

318
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:29,062
For what purpose?

319
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:31,297
Might...

320
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:34,375
...doesn't always mean right.

321
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:38,913
What are you saying? To be right
and lose couldn't possibly be right.

322
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,442
Merlyn...

323
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:43,582
...used to frown on battles.

324
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,721
Yet he always...

325
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,253
...helped me win them.

326
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:48,481
Why?

327
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:55,758
Proposition:

328
00:30:57,234 --> 00:31:00,897
Is it far better to be alive than dead?

329
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:02,501
Yes, far better.

330
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,667
If that is so...

331
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,310
...then why do we have wars...

332
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:11,275
...in which people can get killed?

333
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:13,176
I don't know, do you?

334
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,645
Yes.

335
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:17,918
Because somebody attacks.

336
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:19,755
Why do they attack?

337
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,561
Did I ever tell you...

338
00:31:31,768 --> 00:31:35,033
...how Merlyn taught me how to think?

339
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,494
No.

340
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:40,107
By changing me into animals.

341
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,635
Oh, really! Arthur!

342
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,783
Jenny, I mean by making me believe...

343
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:53,119
...he had changed me into animals.

344
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:57,588
For instance, when a hawk
is up there Iooking down at the world...

345
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:00,854
...there are no boundaries.

346
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,129
Right?

347
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:09,505
Yet boundaries are what
somebody aIways attacks about.

348
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:13,733
And you win by pushing them
back across something that...

349
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:16,479
...that doesn't exist.

350
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,673
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?

351
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,819
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor....

352
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,487
That's it, Jenny.

353
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:27,884
Jenny, that is it!

354
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:29,352
It's the armor!

355
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,221
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.

356
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:37,593
OnIy the knights are rich enough
to have armor. The foot soIdiers....

357
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,166
WeII, they have nothing.

358
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:42,603
So, aII that can happen
to a knight is...

359
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:44,467
...an occasionaI...

360
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:46,264
...dent.

361
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,271
Proposition:

362
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:50,569
Right or wrong...

363
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,272
...if they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're aIways right.

364
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:56,748
That's wrong.
Right?

365
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:12,329
I'm here.

366
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,571
Suppose we create
a new order of chivaIry?

367
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:24,142
A new order where
might is onIy used for right.

368
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:27,845
To improve instead of to destroy.
We'II invite aII knights...

369
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:31,782
...and kings of aII kingdoms to Iay down
their arms to come and join us.

370
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:33,282
Oh, yes, Jenny.

371
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:34,985
And we'II...

372
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,289
...take one of the Iarge rooms
in the castIe...

373
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:41,589
...put a tabIe in it
and aII the knights wiII gather at it.

374
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,092
And do what?

375
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,724
TaIk across it.

376
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,967
Debate.

377
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:50,533
Make Iaws.
PIan improvements.

378
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:55,376
But, Arthur, do you think
aII the knights wiII ever want to...

379
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,580
...to do such a ridicuIousIy
peacefuI thing?

380
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:01,947
We'II make it a great honor.

381
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:05,180
Very fashionabIe.
Everyone wiII want to join.

382
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:06,883
OnIy now...

383
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,782
...the knights wiII whack onIy for good.

384
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,325
Might for right.

385
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,164
Might for right.

386
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:22,629
Might...

387
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,636
...for right!

388
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:26,497
That's it, Jenny!

389
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:30,343
Might....

390
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:34,373
No, not might is right!

391
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:36,674
Might...

392
00:34:37,854 --> 00:34:39,014
...for...

393
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,147
...right!

394
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:44,451
It's very originaI.

395
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:47,625
And civiIized, Jenny.

396
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:50,163
It wiII have to be
an awfuIIy Iarge tabIe.

397
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:54,827
What of jeaIousy? AII wiII cIaim
superiority and want to sit at the head.

398
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:56,937
We'II make it...

399
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,331
...a round tabIe.

400
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,476
So there is no head.

401
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:04,346
A round tabIe!

402
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:20,056
My father's got one
that wouId be perfect. It seats 150.

403
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:23,630
He had it as a wedding present
and he never used it.

404
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:29,068
We'II send the heraIds
Riding through the country

405
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:34,737
TeII every Iiving person far and near

406
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:38,407
That there is simpIy not

407
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:41,410
In aII the worId a spot

408
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:46,749
Where ruIes a more respIendent king

409
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:50,359
Than here

410
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,088
In CameIot

411
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:52,708
CameIot

412
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,212
In far off France
I hear you caII

413
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:13,195
To you aIone I'II give my aII

414
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:19,402
I know in my souI
what you expect of me

415
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:23,572
And aII that and more
I shaII be

416
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:28,907
A knight of the tabIe round
ShouId be invincibIe

417
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:33,287
Succeed where a Iess fantastic man
WouId faiI

418
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,424
CIimb a waII no one eIse can cIimb
CIeave a dragon in record time

419
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:42,754
Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron maiI

420
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:47,926
No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceabIe

421
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:52,764
ImpossibIe deeds
ShouId be his daiIy fare

422
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,604
But where in the worId

423
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:58,607
Is there in the worId

424
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:03,282
A man so extraordinaire?

425
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,617
C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit

426
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:16,295
'Tis I
I humbIy repIy

427
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:19,798
That mortaI who these marveIs can do

428
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,264
C'est moi, c'est moi
'Tis I

429
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:27,502
I've never Iost
In battIe or game

430
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,941
I'm simpIy the best by far

431
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:35,045
When swords are crossed
'Tis aIways the same

432
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:38,718
One bIow and au revoir

433
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:42,886
C'est moi, c'est moi
So admirabIy fit

434
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,890
A French Prometheus Unbound

435
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,223
And here am I
With vaIor untoId

436
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,563
ExceptionaIIy brave

437
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:58,067
AmazingIy boId

438
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:01,908
To serve at the tabIe round

439
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:06,375
The souI of a knight
ShouId be a thing remarkabIe

440
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:10,608
His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew

441
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:15,721
With a wiII and a seIf-restraint
That's the envy of every saint

442
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,551
He couId easiIy work a miracIe or two

443
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:25,166
To Iove and desire
He ought to be unsparkabIe

444
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:30,066
The ways of the fIesh
ShouId offer no aIIure

445
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:35,070
But where in the worId
Is there in the worId

446
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:38,411
A man so untouched

447
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:41,148
And pure?

448
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:51,090
C'est moi
I bIush to discIose

449
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:54,919
I'm far too nobIe to Iie

450
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:59,200
That man in whom
These quaIities bIoom

451
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:02,929
C'est moi, C'est moi
'Tis I

452
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,241
I've never strayed
From aII I beIieve

453
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:10,776
I'm bIessed with an iron wiII

454
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:14,982
Had I been made
The partner of Eve

455
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:18,620
We'd be in Eden stiII

456
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:23,124
C'est moi, c'est moi
The angeIs have chosen

457
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:26,955
To fight their battIes beIow

458
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,297
And here am I
As pure as a prayer

459
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:35,604
IncredibIy cIean

460
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:39,034
With virtue to spare

461
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:43,702
The godIiest man I know
C'est moi!

462
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:15,801
Oh, King Arthur!

463
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:18,776
What caIiber of man you must be...

464
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:22,342
...to have envisioned
a new order of Iife.

465
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:25,680
I worship you before knowing you.

466
00:42:51,514 --> 00:42:53,175
Don't run away, coward!

467
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:55,613
Come back and fight!

468
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,644
The swine!

469
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:31,081
-Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
-Fine.

470
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,621
PIease!

471
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:43,529
The next time you traffic with me...

472
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:47,725
...remember, you chaIIenge
the right arm of King Arthur.

473
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,101
ReaIIy?

474
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,372
I am King Arthur.

475
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:01,339
What?

476
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:04,446
You...

477
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:07,779
...are the king!

478
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,221
Yes, aImost the Iate king.

479
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:14,686
And I struck you?

480
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,594
Your Majesty!

481
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,563
I'm LanceIot du Lac.

482
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:29,040
In France I heard of your new order
and came to join.

483
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,403
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.

484
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:34,009
Not because I deserve it...

485
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:36,617
...but because by forgiving me...

486
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:38,116
...I'II suffer more.

487
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:40,048
But, reaIIy, dear chap...

488
00:44:40,256 --> 00:44:42,816
...I don't want you to suffer at aII.

489
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:46,953
I want to congratuIate you.
PIease rise. You, too, squire.

490
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:48,923
I can't, mon roi.

491
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:52,999
-I'm too ashamed to Iift my head.
-WeII, then I command you.

492
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:56,266
I have never feIt
a bash in my chest quite Iike it.

493
00:44:56,472 --> 00:44:59,202
It was most spectacuIar.
Where did you Iearn to do it?

494
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:02,973
My skiII comes from training, mon Roi.

495
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:06,110
My strength from purity.

496
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,250
WeII, that's a unique recipe.

497
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:14,045
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.

498
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:18,159
At the age of fourteen
he couId defeat any jouster in France.

499
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:21,358
His father, King Ban,
made me his squire.

500
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:23,088
King Ban?

501
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,524
In France?

502
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:28,329
What did you say your name was?

503
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,198
LanceIot du Lac, Your Majesty.

504
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,709
You're LanceIot?
I was toId you were coming.

505
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,047
You were toId?

506
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:45,247
By MerIyn, the court magician.

507
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:46,819
He said to me one day...

508
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:52,253
...""Keep your eye out for a Frenchman
caIIed LanceIot du Lac.

509
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:55,919
He wiII come to the court of CameIot
and he wiII be....""

510
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,024
What was it now?

511
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:00,494
""He wiII be....""

512
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:03,933
Your aIIy, if you'II take me.

513
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,608
Your friend, who asks no friendship.

514
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,073
Your defender when you need one...

515
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:11,769
...whose body is your sword to brandish.

516
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,472
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?

517
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:17,244
For aII that, I am.

518
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:19,614
ReaIIy, my dear feIIow...

519
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:22,586
...this is far more
than I couId wish for...

520
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:25,423
...or even ask.

521
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:28,126
Then you wiII accept me?

522
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:30,458
Without hesitation.

523
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,567
-We wiII arrange for your knighthood.
-Oh, thank you!

524
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:41,276
We must arrange for
your knighthood immediateIy.

525
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:44,503
No, Your Majesty.
AII you know of me is words.

526
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:47,444
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.

527
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,947
-Now?
-This moment.

528
00:46:49,151 --> 00:46:52,279
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?

529
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:55,685
Some enemy I can battIe?
Some periI I can undertake?

530
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:59,756
WeII, actuaIIy,
there's not much going on today.

531
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:04,231
It's the first of May. The Queen and
some of the court have gone a-Maying.

532
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:07,029
Gone a-Maying?

533
00:47:07,436 --> 00:47:09,734
Yes, it's a sort of...

534
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,841
...picnic?

535
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:17,009
They eat berries
and chase young girIs around--

536
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:21,147
It's a custom we have here.

537
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,784
This is EngIand, you know.

538
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:26,648
And this is the season
for gathering fIowers.

539
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:29,117
Knights gathering fIowers?

540
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,657
WeII, someone has to do it!

541
00:47:33,362 --> 00:47:35,626
And besides, it's....

542
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:38,626
It's civiIized.

543
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,734
And civiIization shouId have...

544
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:44,929
...a few gentIe hobbies.

545
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:48,139
Come.

546
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:51,808
I want you to meet the queen.

547
00:47:54,283 --> 00:47:57,218
Dap, take the horses and feed them.

548
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,054
By George!

549
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:13,361
I suddenIy remembered
what MerIyn said of you.

550
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,464
How strange!

551
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:20,134
He said that you wouId be the
greatest knight ever to sit at my tabIe.

552
00:48:20,643 --> 00:48:22,907
That was Iong before
I thought of a tabIe.

553
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:25,672
So he knew it wouId exist.

554
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:30,183
Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining tabIe.

555
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:31,978
But he meant this.

556
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:33,655
The Round TabIe!

557
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:36,848
And I have stumbIed on my future.

558
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,458
I've done...

559
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:40,322
...the right thing.

560
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:43,290
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?

561
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:45,124
Of course.

562
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,558
OnIy fooIs...

563
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,294
...never doubt.

564
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:52,566
WeIcome, LanceIot.

565
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,677
BIess you for coming.

566
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:58,039
WeIcome to my tabIe.

567
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,916
It's May

568
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,559
It's May

569
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:51,360
The Iusty month of May

570
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:55,837
That IoveIy month

571
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:58,736
When everyone goes

572
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:03,272
BIissfuIIy astray

573
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:07,609
It's here, it's here

574
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,248
That shocking time of year

575
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:13,649
When tons of wicked IittIe thoughts

576
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:15,653
MerriIy appear

577
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,016
It's May!

578
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:20,991
That gorgeous hoIiday

579
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:25,957
When every maiden itches for fun

580
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:28,793
WhoIesome or ""un""

581
00:50:29,138 --> 00:50:30,628
It's mad!

582
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:34,636
Depraved in every way

583
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:39,471
Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks

584
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:42,443
Everyone makes divine mistakes

585
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:46,018
The Iusty month of May

586
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:52,920
The Iusty month of May

587
00:50:53,295 --> 00:50:56,264
That darIing month when everyone throws

588
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,399
SeIf-controI away

589
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,897
It's time to do

590
00:51:01,537 --> 00:51:03,732
A wretched thing or two

591
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,003
And try to make each precious day

592
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:09,676
One you'II aIways rue

593
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:15,011
The month of ""Yes, you may.""

594
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,242
A time for every

595
00:51:18,454 --> 00:51:19,751
FrivoIous whim

596
00:51:20,189 --> 00:51:22,851
Proper or ""im.""

597
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:24,284
It's wiId!

598
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:26,126
It's wiId! It's gay!

599
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:29,896
A IibeIous dispIay

600
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:32,193
The birds and bees

601
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:35,859
WiII aII of their vast
Amorous past

602
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:39,370
Gaze at the human race
Aghast!

603
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,270
The Iusty

604
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,877
Month of May!

605
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:06,824
Now then...

606
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:08,996
...which way to go?

607
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:10,324
North.

608
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:13,558
No, no, that's north.

609
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,928
No, that's north.

610
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:22,273
I'm compIeteIy Iost.

611
00:53:23,178 --> 00:53:25,339
Who's that rusty oId feIIow?

612
00:53:25,781 --> 00:53:28,716
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.

613
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:31,282
Offer him assistance.

614
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:37,451
That mountain seems famiIiar.

615
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:39,826
Let's see.

616
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:41,827
Good day, my Iord.

617
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:46,456
How do you do, young man.
The name of King PeIIinore here.

618
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:49,226
You are a king, sire?

619
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:53,098
Of what country?

620
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:57,771
I don't know.
I Iost my kingdom.

621
00:53:58,647 --> 00:53:59,773
To whom?

622
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:03,179
WeII, I misIaid it.
I Ieft it somewhere and I....

623
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,480
I can't find my way back.

624
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:09,922
-Why, I beIieve him.
-Your Majesty!

625
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,991
Your Majesty?

626
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:17,097
Yes, my Iord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of EngIand.

627
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:20,730
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?

628
00:54:21,837 --> 00:54:24,601
Forgive me, Ma'am.
The beastIy hinges need oiIing.

629
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:27,603
Be at ease, my Iord.
WeIcome to CameIot.

630
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,675
Haven't I been here before?

631
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:38,512
Yes, years ago. I spent a joIIy
fortnight with a fine IittIe feIIow...

632
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,518
...caIIed Wart.
Ever met him, Ma'am?

633
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:44,119
ConstantIy.
He's my husband.

634
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,622
King Arthur of EngIand.

635
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,128
The King? Is he?

636
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,833
WeII, weII! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!

637
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:57,301
That's what I caII weII done.
Imagine. The king!

638
00:54:59,141 --> 00:55:02,042
And he knows the name
of what he's king of.

639
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:06,002
Arthur wouId be pIeased to see you.
WouId you care to spend the night?

640
00:55:06,882 --> 00:55:09,874
What, in a bed?
In a reaI bed?

641
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,313
Damnation, I'd Iike that.

642
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,853
I haven't put spine to feathers
since I Ieft....

643
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:16,649
Since I Ieft....

644
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:22,460
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castIe.

645
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,896
I'm very gratefuI to you, Ma'am.

646
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,397
Thank you, very much.

647
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,419
I want to present to you
LanceIot du Lac.

648
00:55:47,623 --> 00:55:50,319
He's come aII the way from France
to join our TabIe.

649
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,596
This is the LanceIot
that MerIyn used to speak of.

650
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:57,560
You're most weIcome.

651
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,334
I'm honored to be among you, miIady.

652
00:56:00,636 --> 00:56:05,164
And aIIow me to pIedge my eternaI
dedication to this nobIe cause.

653
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:08,172
Thank you, monsieur.
Arthur, I met this strange man--

654
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:11,642
This spIendid dream
must become a universaI reaIity.

655
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:12,905
What?

656
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:15,583
AbsoIuteIy. It reaIIy must.

657
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,409
I have assured the king
he may caII upon me...

658
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,885
...at any time to perform any deed,
no matter the danger.

659
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,024
Thank you, monsieur.
That's most comforting.

660
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,660
I'm aIways on duty.

661
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:28,326
Yes, I can see that.

662
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,395
I wouId Iove to come to Iunch...

663
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,000
...but I want to Iisten to the pIans
that we have been discussing.

664
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:36,133
ExpIain it.

665
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:40,575
-To the queen, sire?
-Yes, of course.

666
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,267
WouId not Madame find it tedious?

667
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:47,075
I have never found chivaIry tedious.

668
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:49,216
So far.

669
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:51,252
May I remind you...

670
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:55,184
...that the Round TabIe happens to be
the idea of my husband.

671
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,085
My husband's idea.

672
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:02,562
Any idea, miIady...

673
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:05,824
...however exaIted, couId be improved.

674
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,702
-ReaIIy?
-Of course.

675
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:11,930
I've suggested that we create
a training program for knights.

676
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,598
-Isn't that a marveIous idea, Jenny?
-A training program?

677
00:57:17,846 --> 00:57:20,713
The Round TabIe must have a standard.

678
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:24,212
A standard physicaI
and a standard moraI.

679
00:57:24,553 --> 00:57:27,545
And whose abiIities wouId serve
as a standard, monsieur?

680
00:57:27,756 --> 00:57:29,621
Oh, certainIy not mine, miIady.

681
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,323
It wouId not be fair.

682
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:33,187
Not fair? In what way?

683
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:37,593
I wouId never ask anyone to Iive
by my standards, miIady.

684
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:39,527
To devote your Iife...

685
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:44,502
...to the tortured quest
for perfection in body and spirit.

686
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:47,107
I wouId not ask that of anyone.

687
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:48,804
No, nor wouId I.

688
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:51,605
And have you achieved perfection,
monsieur?

689
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,439
PhysicaIIy, yes, miIady.

690
00:57:54,883 --> 00:57:59,252
But the refining of the souI
is an endIess struggIe.

691
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:03,824
I dare say. I do daresay.

692
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,552
Do you mean you've never been
defeated in battIe or in a tournament?

693
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:11,229
No, Your Majesty.

694
00:58:13,235 --> 00:58:14,463
And I gather...

695
00:58:14,669 --> 00:58:18,400
...you consider it unIikeIy
ever to happen in the future?

696
00:58:18,907 --> 00:58:20,772
HighIy, Your Majesty!

697
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:24,905
How was the channeI, LanceIot?
Was it a good crossing?

698
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:30,309
TeII me a IittIe of your struggIe
for the perfection of the spirit.

699
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:34,147
Have you jousted with humiIity IateIy?

700
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:36,949
""HumiIity,"" miIady?

701
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,559
HumiIité.

702
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:42,389
Or isn't it fashionabIe
in France this year?

703
00:58:43,465 --> 00:58:47,401
We had best discuss the program
eIsewhere. You Iook too beautifuI...

704
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:51,538
...to have anything on your mind
other than froIic and fIowers.

705
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:55,768
Have a IoveIy day.
Same to aII of you.

706
00:58:55,977 --> 00:58:57,569
Come aIong, LanceIot.

707
00:58:57,779 --> 00:58:59,144
Come quickIy.

708
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:00,974
Good day, my queen.

709
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:08,383
-Mon dieu, he's unpIeasant.
-And so poisonousIy good.

710
00:59:08,824 --> 00:59:11,224
He probabIy waIked across the channeI.

711
00:59:18,967 --> 00:59:20,559
Sir Dinadan?

712
00:59:24,072 --> 00:59:26,302
When is the next tournament?

713
00:59:26,808 --> 00:59:29,106
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.

714
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,809
And who are the 3 best jousters we have?

715
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:36,580
Sir LioneI, Sir Sagramore...

716
00:59:38,086 --> 00:59:40,680
...and with aII humiIitay...

717
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,890
...I, Your Majesty.

718
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:47,595
ReaIIy?

719
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:05,710
Sir LioneI?

720
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:13,145
Do you recaII the other night
That I distinctIy said you might

721
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:16,119
Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?

722
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:19,950
WeII, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in pIace of you

723
01:00:20,295 --> 01:00:23,628
Someone who pIainIy is
Beyond compare

724
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:27,466
The Frenchman's power is more tremendous

725
01:00:27,802 --> 01:00:31,135
Than I have ever seen anywhere

726
01:00:31,473 --> 01:00:34,806
And when a man is that stupendous

727
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:38,476
He, by right, shouId take me
To the fair

728
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:42,314
Your Majesty, Iet me tiIt with him
And smite him

729
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:45,976
Don't refuse me so abruptIy
I impIore

730
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:49,821
Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him

731
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:54,155
And GauI wiII be divided
Once more

732
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:58,289
You wiII bash and thrash him?

733
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,563
I wiII smash and mash him!

734
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,003
You'II give him troubIe?

735
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,174
He wiII be rubbIe.

736
01:01:07,642 --> 01:01:09,041
A mighty whack?

737
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:12,304
His skuII wiII crack!

738
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,341
Then you may

739
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:21,349
Take me to the fair

740
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:25,023
If you do aII the things
You promise

741
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,353
In fact, my heart wiII break
ShouId you not take me

742
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:32,189
To the fair

743
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,627
Sir Sagramore?

744
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:44,042
I have some rather painfuI news
ReIative to the subject who's

745
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:46,874
To be beside me at the next court baII

746
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:51,178
You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it shouId go

747
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:54,219
To the unquestioned champion
In the haII

748
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:58,383
And I'm convinced
That spIendid Frenchman

749
01:01:58,893 --> 01:02:02,727
Can easiIy conquer one and aII

750
01:02:03,698 --> 01:02:07,532
And besting aII our IocaI
Henchmen, he

751
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:10,566
ShouId sit beside me
At the baII

752
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:14,342
I beg of you, Ma'am
WithhoId your invitation

753
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:18,403
I swear to you this chaIIenge
WiII be met

754
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,806
And when I have finished up
The operation

755
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:26,582
I shaII serve him to Your Highness
En brochette

756
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:30,216
You'II pierce right through him?

757
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:33,184
I'II barbecue him!

758
01:02:33,395 --> 01:02:35,090
A wicked thrust?

759
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:37,492
It wiII be dust to dust.

760
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:39,894
From fore to aft?

761
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:41,329
He'II feeI...

762
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:43,197
...a draft.

763
01:02:47,008 --> 01:02:48,339
My goodness!

764
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:51,609
You may sit

765
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:54,907
By me at the baII

766
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:58,279
If you demoIish him
In battIe

767
01:02:58,887 --> 01:03:02,618
In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me

768
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:05,619
At the baII

769
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:10,924
Sir Dinadan?

770
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:22,104
Didn't I promise that you may
Guide me to London on the day

771
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,801
That I go up to judge
The cattIe show

772
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,983
As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side

773
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,652
Who'II be defending me
From beast and foe

774
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,653
So when I choose whom I prefer go

775
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:38,651
I take the strongest knight I know

776
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:44,222
And young du Lac seems strongest
Ergo

777
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,124
He shouId

778
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:49,269
Take me to the cattIe show

779
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:52,663
Your Majesty can't beIieve
This bIustering prattIe

780
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:56,172
Let him prove it
With a sword or Iance instead

781
01:03:57,112 --> 01:04:00,081
I promise you when I'm done
This gory battIe

782
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:04,207
His shouIders wiII be Ionesome
For his head

783
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:07,551
You'II disconnect him?

784
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,819
I'II vivisect him!

785
01:04:10,425 --> 01:04:11,949
You'II open wide him?

786
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:14,354
I'II subdivide him!

787
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:20,028
Then you may guide me
To the show

788
01:04:20,602 --> 01:04:23,867
If you can carry out
Your program

789
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:28,200
In fact, I'd grieve inside
ShouId you not guide me

790
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:31,034
To the show

791
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:34,880
MiIady,
We shaII put an end to

792
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:38,875
That GaIIic bag of noise
And nerve

793
01:04:39,387 --> 01:04:43,050
When we do aII that we
Intend to

794
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:47,054
He'II be a pIate of French
Hors d'oeuvres

795
01:04:47,729 --> 01:04:51,062
I do appIaud your nobIe goaIs

796
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,563
Now Iet us see if you
Achieve them

797
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:59,405
And if you do
Then you wiII be the three

798
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:02,743
Who wiII go to the baII
To the show

799
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:04,408
And take me

800
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:08,682
To the fair

801
01:05:38,913 --> 01:05:40,005
My Iords!

802
01:05:40,281 --> 01:05:43,910
Have you seen the Iatest edict?
Tis the finaI straw.

803
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,447
Knights who refuse to Iay down
their arms wiII be attacked...

804
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:49,282
...as if they were serfs.

805
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:52,483
We're not onIy to kiII foot soIdiers,
but knights as weII.

806
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:54,889
We know aII about it, Dinadan.

807
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:01,569
But these other knights...

808
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:06,402
...if they fight back...

809
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,033
...we couId be kiIIed.

810
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:12,847
What's the sense of being born
in the upper cIass...

811
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:15,481
...if you can get kiIIed
Iike the Iower cIass?

812
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:19,510
It has the stink of French cooking.

813
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,585
After Saturday...

814
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:27,022
...we shaII be back
on Yorkshire pudding.

815
01:06:29,264 --> 01:06:31,027
PeIIy, why don't you...

816
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:34,029
...give up searching for your kingdom...

817
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:36,465
...and come settIe down
with us for good?

818
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,037
That's joIIy kind of you, Arthur.

819
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:41,367
I mean, I Iove the bed and aII that...

820
01:06:41,609 --> 01:06:45,306
...but the truth is I don't find things
too restfuI around here.

821
01:06:45,513 --> 01:06:47,981
I can't heIp wishing
that you'd stop...

822
01:06:48,182 --> 01:06:49,547
...thinking...

823
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:51,651
...and Ieave weII enough aIone.

824
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:55,345
I'm aII against
these new ideas of yours.

825
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,820
Any new ideas.

826
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:02,957
Best peopIe whacking best peopIe.
That's not right. That's not.

827
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:06,657
The chaps downstairs,
they're gnashing mad.

828
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,161
Gnashing.

829
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:13,366
It's aII his fauIt, you know.

830
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,706
Emperor CharIemagne there.

831
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:19,242
He has no activities,
that's his troubIe.

832
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:21,915
No secuIar pIeasures.

833
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:23,873
Quiet, PeIIy!

834
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:33,252
But do you not have any activities?

835
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:36,419
Any hobbies? Any...

836
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:38,697
...chambre à coucher?

837
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:42,163
No, PeIIinore.

838
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,803
There, you see.
Do you see?

839
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:47,736
Now why can't he be Iike the other chaps
instead of Iike himseIf?

840
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:51,002
Why can't he come home of an evening,
hang up his shieId...

841
01:07:51,212 --> 01:07:53,703
...and do something
that he can be ashamed of?

842
01:07:56,017 --> 01:07:57,678
You sure he's French?

843
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,283
I'm afraid my Iord is right.

844
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,861
AII fanatics are irritating, PeIIinore.

845
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:15,365
And I am a fanatic.

846
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:20,464
And I don't enjoy it
any more than you do.

847
01:08:28,783 --> 01:08:30,842
Didn't you have a change to suggest?

848
01:08:33,187 --> 01:08:37,055
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you wiII excuse me.

849
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:51,294
WhiIe I was napping, did I miss
any improvements in chivaIry?

850
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:56,502
No, miIady.
If you wiII excuse me--

851
01:08:56,911 --> 01:09:00,347
Monsieur, when you're arranging things
with God tonight...

852
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:03,642
...do be sure to give us
fine weather tomorrow.

853
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:14,692
Good night, sire.

854
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,158
Good night, PeIIinore.

855
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:18,855
Good night.

856
01:09:25,273 --> 01:09:29,107
Heard the Iatest? He beIieves
his purity gives him miracuIous powers.

857
01:09:31,012 --> 01:09:34,379
He was undoubtedIy referring
to his physicaI prowess.

858
01:09:34,582 --> 01:09:36,209
Which is vast, indeed.

859
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:39,118
We'II see about that tomorrow.

860
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:43,279
Sagramore, LioneI and Dinadan
have aII chaIIenged him to a joust.

861
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:45,118
Three damn strong men!

862
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:49,188
-AII three in one day?!
-Quite, exactIy.

863
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:51,490
Isn't it marveIous? MarveIous!

864
01:09:51,699 --> 01:09:53,166
ExactIy, yes!

865
01:09:53,468 --> 01:09:55,493
I teII you, Arthur.

866
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:58,263
I've never met anyone Iike him.

867
01:09:58,473 --> 01:09:59,599
I mean...

868
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:01,536
...he has no Iady.

869
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:04,440
TaIks to no one but you and God...

870
01:10:04,645 --> 01:10:07,978
...crammed fuII of reIigion,
an aII-around unpIeasant feIIow.

871
01:10:08,182 --> 01:10:11,083
I can't wait untiI tomorrow.
It'II be a joIIy massacre.

872
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:13,853
Good night, Ma'am.

873
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:19,352
I'm reaIIy Iooking forward to it.
It's going to be marveIous.

874
01:10:22,396 --> 01:10:24,864
A note of thanks from Sir LioneI.

875
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,536
I've promised he can carry
my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.

876
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:35,834
I wouId be most gratefuI if you...

877
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:39,103
...wouId withdraw your permission
from Sir LioneI.

878
01:10:39,747 --> 01:10:42,614
I don't think I couId.
It wouId be rather awkward.

879
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:46,150
Then aIIow LanceIot
to carry it against Sagramore.

880
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:49,279
-I've promised my kerchief to him.
-Then against Dinadan?

881
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,824
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettiIy, I couIdn't refuse.

882
01:10:54,028 --> 01:10:55,154
This is appaIIing!

883
01:10:55,863 --> 01:10:58,957
It wiII seem to the court
that you are championing his defeat.

884
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:03,001
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked
you unconscious. You became friends.

885
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:06,571
He may knock them out,
and they'II aII take a house together.

886
01:11:06,774 --> 01:11:09,504
I reaIize he's having
a difficuIt time adjusting.

887
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,177
But he's a stranger.

888
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:14,075
He's not even EngIish.
He's French.

889
01:11:14,282 --> 01:11:16,250
WeII, he suffers in transIation.

890
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:17,948
I ask you--

891
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:22,486
I beIieve you're jeaIous of the knights
and their attentions to me.

892
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,920
JeaIous?
What absoIute rubbish!

893
01:11:25,126 --> 01:11:27,959
You know I am deIighted
the court adores you so.

894
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:30,130
I trust you as God above.

895
01:11:30,765 --> 01:11:34,030
You have dragged me off the subject
and I want you back on it.

896
01:11:34,235 --> 01:11:36,726
WiII you withdraw those kerchiefs?

897
01:11:36,938 --> 01:11:38,735
OnIy if you command me as king.

898
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:43,536
If I do...

899
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:45,839
...wiII you forgive me?

900
01:11:46,814 --> 01:11:47,974
Never.

901
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:52,175
Then, if I ask you as a husband,
wiII you as a favor?

902
01:11:52,386 --> 01:11:55,878
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.

903
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:59,389
Can we not stay on the subject?

904
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:01,721
There's nothing more to be said.

905
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,494
If the king wishes me to withdraw
what I have given...

906
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,866
...Iet him command me
and Yours HumbIy wiII graciousIy obey.

907
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:40,161
BIast you, MerIyn!
This is aII your fauIt!

908
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:43,928
You swore that you had taught me
Everything from A to Z

909
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:46,231
With nary an omission in between

910
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:49,807
WeII, I shaII teII you what
You obviousIy forgot

911
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,571
That's how a ruIer ruIes a queen

912
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:00,211
And what of teaching me
By turning me to animaI and bird

913
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,514
From beaver
To the smaIIest boboIink?

914
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,953
I shouId have had a whirI
At changing to a girI

915
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,720
To Iearn the way the creatures think

916
01:13:15,703 --> 01:13:17,830
But wasn't there a night

917
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:21,236
On a summer Iong gone by

918
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:25,203
We passed a coupIe
WrangIing away

919
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,847
And did I not say

920
01:13:28,049 --> 01:13:31,610
MerIyn
What if that chap were I

921
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:35,880
And did he not give counseI
And say

922
01:13:38,192 --> 01:13:39,716
What was it now?

923
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:42,896
Oh, my mind's a waII

924
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:46,956
Oh, yes! By Jove!

925
01:13:47,802 --> 01:13:49,292
Now I recaII

926
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:54,801
How to handIe a woman

927
01:13:56,143 --> 01:14:00,375
There's a way
Said the wise oId man

928
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:05,316
A way known by every woman

929
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:10,321
Since the whoIe rigmaroIe began

930
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:15,151
Do I fIatter her
I begged him answer

931
01:14:16,163 --> 01:14:19,496
Do I threaten or cajoIe or pIead

932
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:24,661
Do I brood or pIay the gay romancer

933
01:14:25,506 --> 01:14:29,909
Said he, smiIing
No, indeed!

934
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:35,949
How to handIe a woman

935
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,343
Mark me weII
I wiII teII you, sir

936
01:14:42,356 --> 01:14:46,349
The way to handIe a woman

937
01:14:47,528 --> 01:14:49,519
Is to Iove her

938
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,830
SimpIy

939
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:55,434
Love her

940
01:14:58,372 --> 01:15:01,535
MereIy Iove her

941
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:05,372
Love her

942
01:15:20,928 --> 01:15:23,453
What's wrong, Jenny?

943
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,864
Where are you these days?

944
01:15:31,038 --> 01:15:32,869
What are you thinking?

945
01:15:37,378 --> 01:15:39,539
I don't understand you.

946
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:43,949
But no matter.
MerIyn toId me once...

947
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:48,815
...""Never be disturbed if you don't
understand what a woman is thinking.""

948
01:15:49,023 --> 01:15:50,957
""They don't do it very often.""

949
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:54,758
But what do you do
whiIe they're doing it?

950
01:16:00,768 --> 01:16:03,760
How to handIe a woman

951
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:09,270
Mark me weII
And I'II teII you, sir

952
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:15,779
The way to handIe a woman

953
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:19,780
Is to Iove her

954
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:24,117
SimpIy

955
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:25,792
Love her

956
01:16:28,796 --> 01:16:32,789
MereIy Iove her

957
01:16:34,635 --> 01:16:36,626
Love her

958
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:41,538
Just...

959
01:16:42,409 --> 01:16:43,842
...Iove her.

960
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:33,626
Here comes Sir LioneI.

961
01:18:30,517 --> 01:18:31,506
One.

962
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:40,759
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers
his horse. It's extraordinary.

963
01:18:59,313 --> 01:19:02,680
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenIy....

964
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:08,611
How cIever!

965
01:19:08,822 --> 01:19:11,916
He maneuvered his horse
right out from under himseIf.

966
01:19:12,126 --> 01:19:13,650
What controI!

967
01:19:24,038 --> 01:19:25,471
Two, Jenny.

968
01:21:36,403 --> 01:21:37,734
He's dead, Jenny.

969
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:44,161
PIease!

970
01:22:50,344 --> 01:22:51,504
Live!

971
01:22:52,179 --> 01:22:53,168
Live!

972
01:22:57,551 --> 01:22:58,984
I beg you.

973
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:40,758
He Iives!

974
01:26:27,327 --> 01:26:29,795
I'm trembIing with fear.

975
01:26:36,236 --> 01:26:37,601
And the strength...

976
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:40,637
...has Ieft my arms.

977
01:26:42,142 --> 01:26:44,508
And terribIe feeIings...

978
01:26:45,178 --> 01:26:46,907
...burn within me.

979
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:49,375
TeII me.

980
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:53,178
You're oIder than I.

981
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,388
You know this earth...

982
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,251
...better than I.

983
01:27:02,596 --> 01:27:04,996
I onIy feII upon it...

984
01:27:05,398 --> 01:27:07,127
...a few hours ago.

985
01:27:09,636 --> 01:27:12,230
What are you taIking about?

986
01:27:15,175 --> 01:27:16,642
Guenevere.

987
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:32,356
Wait, PeIIy.

988
01:27:35,262 --> 01:27:37,992
You've never been in Iove...

989
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:39,631
...have you, PeIIy?

990
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:41,322
Once.

991
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:45,596
But not IateIy.
Now I'm not young enough.

992
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:47,700
Or not oId enough.

993
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:51,907
And I'm too young and too oId.

994
01:27:52,712 --> 01:27:55,010
Too oId not to know that fears...

995
01:27:55,215 --> 01:27:57,376
...can be imaginary.

996
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:02,085
And too young not to be...

997
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:05,122
...tormented by them.

998
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:24,969
Forgive me, miIady,
for disturbing you.

999
01:28:27,013 --> 01:28:29,982
CIarinda toId me
Arthur was expected here.

1000
01:28:31,017 --> 01:28:32,245
Yes, he is.

1001
01:29:22,769 --> 01:29:24,100
I Iove you.

1002
01:29:30,443 --> 01:29:32,001
God forgive me...

1003
01:29:32,212 --> 01:29:33,509
...but I do!

1004
01:29:38,785 --> 01:29:41,310
Then God forgive us both, Lance.

1005
01:29:45,325 --> 01:29:47,054
What a gIorious day!

1006
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:49,361
This is your day, Lance.

1007
01:29:50,196 --> 01:29:51,925
And at Iast you shaII receive...

1008
01:29:52,132 --> 01:29:55,260
...your earned and proper knighthood.

1009
01:30:03,543 --> 01:30:07,070
UnfortunateIy,
sainthood is not in my power.

1010
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:14,346
Before the ceremony, we three
wiII have a nice quiet drink together.

1011
01:30:16,289 --> 01:30:18,120
It was on such a day as this...

1012
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:21,817
...that the idea of the Round TabIe
was given birth.

1013
01:30:22,862 --> 01:30:24,261
Remember, Jenny?

1014
01:30:36,543 --> 01:30:38,374
To the Round TabIe!

1015
01:32:35,695 --> 01:32:37,026
To be invested...

1016
01:32:37,697 --> 01:32:40,689
...Knight of the Round TabIe
of EngIand...

1017
01:32:42,268 --> 01:32:45,032
...of the CastIe of Joyous Gard...

1018
01:32:45,805 --> 01:32:48,296
...LanceIot du Lac.

1019
01:33:57,477 --> 01:33:58,501
ExcaIibur.

1020
01:34:11,891 --> 01:34:13,188
Arise...

1021
01:34:13,459 --> 01:34:15,825
...Sir LanceIot.

1022
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,719
Proposition:

1023
01:35:49,622 --> 01:35:51,351
If I couId choose...

1024
01:35:51,557 --> 01:35:54,890
...from every woman
who breathes on this earth...

1025
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:57,619
...the face I wouId most Iove...

1026
01:35:57,997 --> 01:36:02,229
...the smiIe, the touch, the heart...

1027
01:36:02,635 --> 01:36:05,069
...the voice, the Iaugh,
the souI itseIf...

1028
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:09,935
...every detaiI and feature
to the Iast strand of the hair...

1029
01:36:10,376 --> 01:36:12,276
...they wouId aII be Jenny's.

1030
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:14,678
Proposition:

1031
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:19,415
If I couId choose from every man
who breathes on this earth...

1032
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:21,985
...a man for my brother...

1033
01:36:22,188 --> 01:36:24,088
...a man for my son...

1034
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:27,316
...and a man for my friend...

1035
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:31,156
...they wouId aII be Lance.

1036
01:36:32,198 --> 01:36:33,688
I Iove them.

1037
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:38,933
I Iove them
and they answer me with pain...

1038
01:36:39,372 --> 01:36:41,169
...and torment.

1039
01:36:41,808 --> 01:36:44,777
Be it sin or not sin...

1040
01:36:44,977 --> 01:36:48,469
...they have betrayed me
in their hearts...

1041
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:50,876
...and that's far sin enough.

1042
01:36:51,184 --> 01:36:55,985
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feeI it when they speak.

1043
01:36:56,189 --> 01:36:59,215
And they must pay for it
and be punished.

1044
01:36:59,726 --> 01:37:03,753
I shaII not be wounded
and not return it in kind.

1045
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,360
I'm through with feebIe hoping.

1046
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,328
I demand...

1047
01:37:12,538 --> 01:37:16,531
...a man's vengeance!

1048
01:37:30,823 --> 01:37:32,120
Proposition:

1049
01:37:34,627 --> 01:37:36,151
I'm a king...

1050
01:37:39,465 --> 01:37:40,796
...not a man.

1051
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,093
And a very civiIized king.

1052
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,164
CouId it...

1053
01:37:46,072 --> 01:37:48,404
...possibIy be civiIized...

1054
01:37:49,509 --> 01:37:51,807
...to destroy the thing I Iove?

1055
01:37:52,912 --> 01:37:57,542
CouId it possibIy be civiIized
to Iove myseIf above aII?

1056
01:37:59,085 --> 01:38:01,519
What about their pain...

1057
01:38:03,055 --> 01:38:05,046
...and their torment?

1058
01:38:08,561 --> 01:38:11,359
Did they ask for this caIamity?

1059
01:38:12,932 --> 01:38:14,832
Can passion...

1060
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:16,934
...be seIected?

1061
01:38:23,075 --> 01:38:25,703
Is there any doubt...

1062
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:29,773
...of their devotion to me,
and to our TabIe?

1063
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:47,128
By God...

1064
01:38:48,267 --> 01:38:51,464
...I shaII be a king!

1065
01:38:54,307 --> 01:38:58,004
This is the time of King Arthur...

1066
01:38:58,211 --> 01:38:59,542
...when we shaII...

1067
01:39:00,546 --> 01:39:02,639
...reach for the stars!

1068
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:05,215
This is the time of King Arthur...

1069
01:39:05,418 --> 01:39:09,684
...when vioIence is not strength,
and compassion is not weakness.

1070
01:39:10,623 --> 01:39:13,592
We are civiIized!

1071
01:39:15,962 --> 01:39:17,953
ResoIved:

1072
01:39:19,165 --> 01:39:23,465
We shaII Iive through this together!

1073
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:25,837
ExcaIibur!

1074
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,433
They...

1075
01:39:29,275 --> 01:39:30,469
...you...

1076
01:39:30,676 --> 01:39:32,075
...and I.

1077
01:39:34,013 --> 01:39:36,038
And may...

1078
01:39:36,315 --> 01:39:39,512
...God have mercy on us aII.
