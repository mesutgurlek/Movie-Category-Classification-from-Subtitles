00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,027
The voyage should take me
3 months at the least.

Senor Columbus,
you have one night at best!

Have it your way.
I'll go west to go west.

309
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,368
Narrator: He asked Easter Bunny
to gift-wrap a truck.

310
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:03,771
His paws were too small.
He was having no luck.

311
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:06,574
So he painted and dyed it
in purples and pinks.

On an egg, this looks good.
