1
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,120
I need backup.

2
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,292
Time out.

3
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,634
[Imitating gunfire]

4
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,102
Dude, I said, "time out."

5
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,977
Oh, what's up, dude?

6
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,477
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

7
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,080
I had a feeling
you'd be coming over...

8
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,649
And I already unlocked
the piano for you.

9
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:23,415
Serious?

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,984
Thanks, Pete, you're the best.

11
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,203
I know.

12
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:29,387
Time in.

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,324
[Imitating gunfire]

14
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,758
[Sighs]

[Orchestra tuning up...]

00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:47,536
[Voices vocalizing faintly...]

17
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,403
On my way

18
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,534
Though I don't know
where I'm going

19
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,045
On a road that's dark

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,217
And long

21
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:34,319
On my way

22
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,222
But I'm fearful that
I could be lost

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,562
That the path I have chosen

24
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:47,065
Might be wrong

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,568
When will it be clear

26
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:55,108
Boy: that I
made the right choice?

27
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:58,576
When can I be sure

28
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,207
Boy: that I know
my own voice?

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,586
Both: dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

30
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:10,857
And faith wins out

31
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:15,094
And I overcome my fear

32
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,586
Boy: clear.

33
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,409
[Song ends]

34
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,049
What are you doing?

00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,791
[Gasps and laughs]

36
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,525
You scared me, I...

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,225
I'm Madison Huxley...

38
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,619
Did you hear that?

39
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,054
I'm Madison Huxley,
my father owns this mall.

40
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,333
Oh, yeah, yeah, I totally
know who you are, I'm Ally...

41
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,503
last I heard, this piano
was for official mall use only.

42
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,839
Oh, yeah, I just... I practice.

43
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,341
When there's nobody around,
'cause of the acoustics.

44
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,266
Well, I'm around

45
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,513
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,307
I'm getting security to
lock this thing back up.

[Door slams shut]

48
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,789
When will it be clear

49
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,725
That I made
the right choice?

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,668
When can I be sure

51
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,673
That I know my own voice?

52
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,011
Dream of a day

[Song ends]

57
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,962
Boy: she wrote another song?

58
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,714
Is this one finished?

59
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,031
Don't you know by now?

60
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,167
She never finishes any of it

61
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,667
Even half-finished...

62
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,567
her songs are better than
anything I could ever write.

63
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,904
Hey, maybe she's got A.D.D.

64
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,443
I got A.D.D., it can
really impede on one's ability
to complete tasks.

65
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,274
Yeah, and, uh,
one's ability to shut up.

66
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,448
All I'm saying is you should
make your move soon, man.

67
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,885
I sang with her last night.

68
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,720
[Laughs] all right, dude,
so you finally talked to her?

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,584
Oh, Joey, man, this is
getting pathetic, dude.

70
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,629
You're, like, playing
the phantom of the mall.

71
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,265
Yeah, dude, rock stars
aren't all timid and shy

72

It wasn't the right time, Ricky

73
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,434

It's time we got it going

79
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,759
And I can see myself,
I'm a star in a rock band

00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,878
Signing all them autographs

someone's changing the world

see it, see it in my mind

It's the matter of time
(time, time, time)

And it takes blind ambition

To rock the industry

92

some real instruments...

hey, give it time,
man, give it time.

, you can at least open up
the store on time.

It's not like we got them
busting down the door
to buy stuff.

122
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,713
Just because
it's been a little slow...

123

"slow" would be an improvement,
Mom, it's like...

[yawns] we went out of business,

doing our job.

Not that anyone cares.

127

piano lessons booked today.

So far, all it's done
is make me want to pee.

132
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:26,191
Maybe I'll put you out
in the mall with a hat
to sing for spare coins.

133
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,458
Yeah, right,
why don't you do it?

134

who's a professional singer.

Yeah.

You're got your father's talent
with numbers, god rest his soul.

You'll get into
your first choice.

143

Huh, uh, yeah, yeah, um...

144
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,790
Ohio's got a great, uh,
business department.

Welcome back, Mr. Huxley.
[Laughs]

146

Oh, it must bring back
a lot of memories being
back at your very first mall

147
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:09,419
After having been
away for so long.

Hard at work on
your retail empire.

Huxley: I suppose so.

And how gratifying,
your daughter following
in your footsteps.

She's a, uh, Two-For-One split
off the old stock. [Laughs]

Huxley: Max Huxley.

153
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:22,915
Ok, that wasn't funny.

154
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,645
That's ok.

155
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,053
What are you doing?

156
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,892
[Tearfully]: I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

157
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,558
I'm a stress eater

158
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,165
Well, my staff is required
to be a size zero.

159
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,463
Or under, preferably, under.

160
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,033
So you choose,
meaningful employment...

161
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,433
or candy-Coated cellulite?

162
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,045
There's my beautiful
college graduate.

163
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,083
Daddy... [laughs]

164
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,450
I'm so glad you're here, ok,
I've got our day together
all planned out.

165
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,921
You're gonna see my little
presentation first...

166
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,293
and then I made reservations
for us at that chic, new sushi
restaurant I was telling you...

167
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,328
Maddy, I'm sorry, but
I can't spend the day with you.

168
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,031
I have to leave in
a few minutes.

169
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,497
Oh.

170
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,056
An opportunity popped up
for me to acquire another mall

171
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,433
And as you know,
business is war.

172
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,638
How 'bout I fly in
next week to make it up to you

173
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,508
We'll have a very special
dinner, just the two of us.

174
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:23,974
Ok.

175
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,081
Um, you can still see my
presentation, though, right?

176
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:29,877
Hit me with it.

177
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,641
Ok, ok, um, wait there, um...

178
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,921
[Woman whispering]: Madison.

179
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,625
Madison: you'll find
only the best pieces

180
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,058
From the most
exclusive designers.

181
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,427
[Woman whispering]: Madison.

182
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,430
Demonstrating the most
discerning eye for fashion.

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,791
Madison...

184
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,569
expensive, refined, Madison.

185
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,709
So what do you think?

186
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,534
It was nice.

187
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,879
"Nice"?

188
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,683
I'm in stores every day,
all over the country.

189
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,184
And yours looks like
a lot of them.

190
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,710
If you want to succeed in
retail, you have to be
different, unique.

191
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,189
I know that.

192
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,728
I mean, that's why
I did all of this.

193
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,696
I wanted to show you ordinary.

194
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,163
That was ordinary.

195
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,225
Madison's is going to be
cutting-edge.

196
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,638
So you have a plan?

197
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,005
Madison: totally.

198
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,507
You just have to
give me a chance.

199
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,034
I'm sorry, but if you're gonna
a make this meeting,
we have to go.

200
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,213
Daddy?

201
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,182
[Breathes deeply]

202
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,053
Dori, give Madison whatever
she needs to make this happen.

203
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,121
Dori: yes, sir.

204
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,155
Thank you. [Laughs]

205
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,688
I have to go.

206
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,707
Madison: you won't

207
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,691
I know I won't

208
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,228
Um, I'll see you next week
for our special dinner.

209
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,719
Huxley: you will.

210
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,773
[Mouths silently]

211
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,740
Owen.

212
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,778
This, we're playing this.

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,658
That's a pretty tune.

214
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,559
Uh...

215
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,425
yeah.

216
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,154
I thought he was in a hurry.

217
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,309
Mom, don't look at me
like that, please.

218
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:41,779
Come on, give me a chance.

219
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,283
Can never get through to
that woman.

220
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,753
I don't want to talk about it,
what's going on in your life?

221
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:55,294
Not much, except that I just had
a really weird moment
with Max Huxley.

222
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,081
Oh, and last night,
I had a run-in with Madison.

223
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,833
Uh, she said my outfit
looked like baby vomit.

224
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,852
She's obnoxious,
spoiled, narcissistic...

225
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,113
and she has perfect hair,
I hate her.

226
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,304
[Laughs] control
your hair envy, please.

227
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,331
Before Miss Buzzkill even
showed up, I heard a voice.

228
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,845
Uh, there's medication
for that, bubo.

229
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,836
I'm serious

230
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,781
This guy, I have no idea
who he was, but...

231
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,121
he was somewhere in the mall and
he was singing words to my song.

232
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,155
And they were good?

233
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,688
Yeah.

234
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,190
Yeah, they were, they were good.

235
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,878
It was like he was in my head
reading the lyrics

236
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:33,532
That were just floating around
that I can't.

237
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,760
Get out.

238
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,672
Wow, he really got to you.

239
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,138
A voice, huh?

240
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,633
I usually go for a nice butt,
but whatever toasts your bagel.

241
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,047
Girl: please, stop, stop,
please?

242
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:53,018
Please, No-No-No, stop, stop.

243
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,952
Ugh.

244
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,477
[Screaming]

245
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,483
Put me out of my misery.

246
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,531
On the house.

247
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,563
No, Ben.

248
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,701
No-No-No-No-No-No,
one of the many perks
of my new power position.

249
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,235
Assistant manager.

250
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,668
What?

251
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,672
Yeah, and my parents
were worried about my future
after high school.

252
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,731
Girl: at least
you're making progress.

253
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,745
Look, Kira's 15 and she's
already got her own boutique.

254
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,212
Ally: that girl's 15?

255
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,649
I know, and I can't even
get my mom to let me
design for the shop.

256
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,786
I mean, I'm going to
the fashion institute
for a reason, right?

257
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,856
Ben: why, you're 18
and already over the hill.

258
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,323
[Coughs]

259
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,861
My mom's excuse is that
I don't know anything about
plus-sized women's bodies.

260
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,328
And I'm like, " hello.

261
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,432
Inside of every skinny girl,
there's a fat chick just
screaming to come out."

262
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,832
You gotta tell her how you feel.

263
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:46,236
Says the girl whose mom still
thinks she's going to college
to be an accountant or whatever.

264
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,074
Hey, backspace, that's not fair

265
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,632
I'm waiting.

266
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,577
I mean, what if I don't
get into Ohio State College.

267
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,477
Then maybe my mom will let me
go to New England Conservatory?

268
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,373
To study music? [Laughs]

269
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,054
Are we still talking about
your mother, right, Mia?

270
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,756
Mia?

271
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,389
What?

272
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:10,020
Sorry, I was checking out
the summer crop of newbie guys.

273
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,764
There's my future Ex-B.F. Now.

274
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,931
Do you know that guy?

275
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,499
No.

276
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,297
But I'm going to.

277
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,270
[Mia grunts]

278
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,307
Ooh, take a number, "next."

279
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,341
[Sighs] whatever.

280
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,544
There's no other cute guy
s here today, anyway.

281
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,977
Hello, what about me?

282
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,779
Whoa, backspace.

283
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,247
Girl: now that's what
I'm talking about

284
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,451
Mia: who are they, why have
we never seen them before?

285
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,475
Ben: they're the night crew

286
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,409
Mia: janitors?

287
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,686
Girl: dirty.

288
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,588
I think they prefer to be called
custodial engineers.

289
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,587
Mia: mm, I call the one
in the garbage can.

290
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:49,199
[Laughs] I never imagined myself
with a guy who handles
trash for a living.

291
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,468
Me either, but I am now...

292
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,339
you realize that would make
both of you two trash, right?

293
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,108
Whatever, I buy lunch
and I'm ignored

294
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,641
We're not ignoring you

295
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,312
You know, you're
one of the girls.

296
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,779
What?

297
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,280
Whatever, I'm leaving

298
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,783
Ally: Ben, Ben,
come on, come on.

299
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,183
You know how Mia gets.

300
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,953
The only reason she even
works here is to shop for boys.

301
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,753
Mia: hey, look.

302
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,291
People come to the mall
to shop for all kinds of
things, all right?

303
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,121
Why not boys?

304
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,642
The minute I walk in,
there is so much to see

305
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,144
I check out the boys
who are checking out me

306
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:39,852
Every shape and size,
and I want to sample them all

307
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:43,487
I see dazzling designs
when I open my eyes

308
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,650
Baby, I can change my world
with these hot dogs and fries

309
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:53,532
All: stop and take a look,
something special behind
every wall (wall)

310
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,532
At the mall...

311
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,730
hangin' out with your friend,
at the mall...

312
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,499
circulate and spend

313
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,507
You can be real,
loosen up, what's the deal

314
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,579
Hit your stride as you glide
down the hall

315
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,166

So the square footage isn't
quite what you asked for, but...

383

then I want that space too.

the mall's original tenants.

It's gonna be hard to
convince 'em to vacate, so...

Yeah, anyway, I'm gonna
knock out this wall

kick you out, it's just...

you're late, we have a problem.

If you agree to vacate now,
we can offer you a little
compensation.

00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,589
Well, yeah, it's.

480
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,169
But it's not just yours
it... it's my job

481
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:02,073
They were in the trash
for a reason.

482
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,940
But they're good

483
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,306
I mean they're really good

484
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,146
I just, I sang with you
that night when I heard you play

485
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,995
I just, I couldn't help myself

486
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,810
And you wrote words to my song?

487
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,985
No, I don't know, it was just
like, in me, I guess.

488
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,787
I heard your music and then I...

489
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,191
it was like you saw what
I was trying to say.

490
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,216
...saw what you were
trying to say.

491
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,825
Yeah.

492
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,698
I'm Joey

493
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,533
Oh, Ally.

494
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,098
Hey.
Hey.

495
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,098
[Clears throat]

496
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,085
You know, I practically
grew up in this mall

497
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,577
But I've never
been in here before.

498
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,059
It's the secret underbelly.

499
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,097
There's lots of places in
the mall that regular people...

500
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,133
aren't allowed to see.

501
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:06,603
Yeah, I bet.

502
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,906
You want to see my favorite?

503
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:15,246
So the guys and I,
we put this band together.

504
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,715
We were just about to
get our big break

505
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,384
Like, with this big A&R guy.

506
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:22,385
Everything got stolen.

507
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,390
Guitars, our amps, everything.

508
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,461
You know my mom's store
has got all that kind of stuff.

509
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,452
Yeah, I know. [Laughs]

510
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,989
We've had our nose
s pressed against your window
since we started working here.

511
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,966
[Laughs]

512
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,981
We're just trying to
save up enough.

513
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,962
I can tell it's pretty
important to you.

514
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,945
Yeah.

515
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,246
Also, I really owe the guys,
'cause it's kind of my fault
that everything got stolen.

516
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,244
Oh, how?

517
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,725
I was stupid.

518
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,764
Trusted the wrong people.

519
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,300
Boys are dumb.

520
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,291
Yeah.

521
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,106
I want to show you something.

522
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:36,349
Ooh, yeah

523
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,830
When gray

524
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,932
Meets light

525
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:48,006
It creates new colors that

526
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,726
Stay lost

527
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:53,376
Inside

528
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,480
Till they find each other

529
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:02,953
A world that you
never seen before

530
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:08,326
Starts moving in slow motion

531
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,329
Both: am I living now?

532
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,198
Out loud

533
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:24,908
I'm not afraid somehow

534
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,810
To let you see
right through me

535
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,146
Yeah

536
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,150
I must be dreaming

537
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:35,142
Wide awake

538
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,587
This world

539
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,534
So real

540
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,562
Like a kaleidoscope
made clear

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,976
To touch

542
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,979
To feel

543
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,306
What if it
made it disappear?

544
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:11,714
With just a chance that
you might change

545
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:17,695
I'd rather
breathe this moment...

546
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,697
am I living now?

547
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:23,267
Out loud

548
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,842
And I'm not afraid

549
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:33,910
Somehow

550
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,813
To let you
see right through me

551
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:42,411
Wait, I must be dreaming,
wide awake

552
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,890
Yeah...

553
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,427
yeah, yeah, yeah

554
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,632
Wide awake, wide awake

555
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,124
Yeah...

556
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,537
yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah

557
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,309
Yeah, yeah

558
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,300
Oh

559
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,981
Am I living now?

560
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:13,317
Out loud

561
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,591
And I'm not afraid
(I'm not afraid)

562
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,060
Somehow (somehow)

563
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:28,132
To let you see
right through me, no

564
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:31,135
Am I living now?

565
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,832
Out loud

566
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:44,439
And I'm not afraid somehow

567
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,652
To let you
see right through me

568
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:54,692
I must be dreaming wide awake
(I must be dreaming)

569
00:34:54,727 --> 00:35:00,255
I must be dreaming
wide awake.

570
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,534
[Song ends]

571
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,407
Pete: dudes?

572
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:16,607
Come on, man,
if Dori catches you,
she'll put my butt in a sling.

573
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,769
It's cool, man

574
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,486
Sorry, Pete.

575
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,988
Yeah, I'm sorry too, you know.

576
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:31,017
Guys... Joey...
oh, not funny, man.

577
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,238
So...

578
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,577
so, I'll, um, see you tomorrow?

579
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,566
You know where to find me.

580
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,676
Yeah, going through
my trash. [Laughs]

581
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:57,986
Bye.

582
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,690
All right. [Chuckles]

583
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,717
Actually, wait, um...

584
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,246
[Sawing and hammering]

585
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,351
[Sighs] and you know that
she's only doing it
to force us to leave.

586
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,619
What a total jerk.

587
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,818
What are you gonna do?

588
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,537
I don't know, I mean,
it's becoming serious.

589
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:08,222
People are starting to
cancel their lessons.

590
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,593
Sorry, what did I miss?

591
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,628
Ben: what took you so long?

592
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,914
Finally, gosh.

593
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:15,058
Hey, guys.

594
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:17,133
Hey.
Hey.

595
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:21,706
You're been intentionally tryin
to accidentally run into those
janitor guys again, haven't you?

596
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:22,939
Yes.

597
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,975
Well, did you see 'em?

598
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,844
Oh, my god, I look too fierce...

599
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:27,401
hey.

600
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,911
Oh, my gosh,
it's a hot janitor guy.

601
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:29,946
Hi.

602
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,113
Hey, Joey.

603
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,818
Uh, could we join you guys?

604
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,151
Yeah.

605
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,450
Cool.

606
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,789
What, Joey, what?

607
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,815
Oh, my gosh, he is so hot.

608
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,327
Wait, have you been
holding out on us?

609
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,293
Hey.

610
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,763
I don't think he's all that hot

611
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:46,696
Well, he is.

612
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,232
You need to tell me everything.

613
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,517
Is he a good kisser?

614
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:50,768
How big are his hands?

615
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:51,767
Mia...

616
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,292
these are the guys.

Hey.
Hey.

Guys, you can sit.

621
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,468
Yeah, sit.

622
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:09,987
I'm Mia

623
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,990
Well, I guess
I'll get back to work.

624
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,184
Yeah, ok.

625
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
What's your name?

626
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,333
[Whispers]: dude...
she scares me.

627
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,172
Mind hanging out of
a spare guitar string?

628
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,173
In case yours breaks?

629
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,975
Mm-Hm.

630
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,708

[Grunts]

Wow, you're, uh, a real rocker.

634
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,723
Sounds a whole lot
better than my mop.

635
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,715
Some critics might disagree.

636
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,756
Let's see what the critics
have to say about this.

637
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,339
Let's go

Everybody caught up in
the wheel of fortune

639
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,885
Virtual life, well,
it can get so boring

640
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,423
Isolation, suffocation,
we all need a big vacation

641
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,221
Just get lost
in the wall of sound

642
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,663
Music makes us
come together now

643
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,968
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

644
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:34,070
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,241
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

646
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:41,526
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

647
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:45,777
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on...

648
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,108
yeah, whoo.

649
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,861
Don't you know it's all about
the liberation?

650
00:39:56,896 --> 00:40:00,229
Gotta use it or lose it,
no hesitation

651
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,934
Take a lesson,
stop the stressing, here'
a cure for your depression

652
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,139
Just get lost
in the wall of sound

653
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:09,605
Alexa?

654
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,308
...us come together now

655
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,980
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

656
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,248
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

657
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,653
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

658
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:27,425
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on...

659
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,645
everybody got
their own music

660
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,796
Playing 'round in their head

661
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,601
But when we all
bring it together

662
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,337
Ain't nothing better

663
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:41,038
Ain't nothing better...

664
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:42,571
oh, oh, oh

665
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,107
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

666
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:49,180
Get what you want,
come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

667
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:52,172
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

668
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,318
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

669
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,523
Don't you want to get it,
gotta get it before it's gone

670
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,458
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

671
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,030
Don't you want to do it,
gotta do it,
that's what you want

672
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:09,134
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

673
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:12,604
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

674
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,774
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

675
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,111
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on

676
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,413
Come on, come on,
get your, get your rock on.

677

[Song ends, cheering]

678
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,714
[Screams]: what is
going on in here?

679
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,421
They're all ruined.

680
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,856
Do you know how much these cost?

681
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,893
Yeah, I was the one
who tagged the prices.

682
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,993
Don't be smart.

683
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,098
You have to start thinking about
the consequences of what you do.

684
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:44,135
Life is not all
singing and dancing, Ally.

685
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,102
Mom, we, we were just
trying to... help.

686
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,241
I mean, did you see all
the people that their music
brought into the store?

687
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,232
Oh, did any of those
people buy anything?

688
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,407
Exactly.

689
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,910
Well...

690
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,694
I'm really sorry if
we upset your mom today.

691
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:14,131
No, it's, it's not
you guys, it's the store.

692
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,098
Yeah.

693
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,102
And me. [Chuckles]

694
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,641
She tried doing the whole music
thing when she was younger.

695
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,143
Be a professional singer, but...

696
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,134
it didn't work out.

697
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,115
And now we're barely
getting by, and...

698
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:36,085
she told me that, um...

699
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,111
well, what does that
have to do with you?

700
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:45,846
Deep down, I think that she
knows that I want to do it too.

701
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:51,068
And I kind of sort of got into
new england conservatory.

702
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:54,805
What, are you serious?

703
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,472
That's awesome

704
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,542
To you, yeah, but...

705
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,180
I'm terrified as to
what she's gonna say
when she finds out.

706
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:04,780
I mean...

707
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,783
she wants me to go to
Ohio State College for Business.

708
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,822
I don't even really know what
studying business means, like...

709
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:13,789
[sighs]

710
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:18,295
But just 'cause she didn't?
make it doesn't mean that
you're not going to, you know

711
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,730
You're not her

712
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:28,694
Plus, you're...
You're pretty talented

713
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,213
I'm sorry, that was way too...

714
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:38,181
no, no, it, no...

715
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,358
step out of the car
with your hands up.

716
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,397
Joey: Pete,
you're killing me, dude.

717
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,434
Dude, you're killing me

718
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,453
If Dori catches you...

719
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:00,437
Ally: I'm sorry, Pete.

[Mouthing silently]

[Phone rings]

722
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,161
Hi, daddy.

723
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,400
Ok, so I was gonna wait
and talk to you about this
at our special dinner...

724
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:32,236
but I just can't wait, I'm gonna
tell you right now, ok.

725
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:34,872
So what do you think about
putting a Madison'

726
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,905
In every single one
of your malls?

727
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,609
That way we could spend
so much more time together.

728
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:41,578
That sounds great, sweetie.

729
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,014
You're not coming
for our dinner, are you?

730
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,484
They rearranged my schedule,
and I can't change it.

731
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,220
You're not mad, are you?

732
00:44:49,255 --> 00:44:50,886
No, I know you're busy.

733
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,481
Business is war, Maddy,
and battles rarely happen
when you want them to.

734
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,357
Man: here you go, sir.

735
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,562
I'm coming to the summer slam
and for your big launch,
I'll take you to dinner then.

736
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:00,346
I promise.

737
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,095
Ok, bye.

00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,092
[Screams]

739

Why is it taking you so long
to get me what I want?

740
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,576
I am.

741
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,078
It's only been...

742
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,581
uh, please don't call
your father.

743
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,576
Do I have to do
everything myself?

744
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,563
[Gasps and sniffles]

745
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,700
Surprise.

746
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,601
I thought they took it away.

747
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,405
It was supposed to be
shipped to the main warehouse.

748
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,309
But it got lost in translation.

749
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:47,209
He means lost in transit.

750
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,305
And you know, I thought
you could use a pick me up.

751
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,317
Ally: yeah.

752
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,487
What's all this for?

753
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,958
Uh, the, uh, Huxley mall
summer slam...

754
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:03,194
Hey, what's it called, anyway?

755
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:05,395
The Huxley mall summer slam.

I've already got the toy number
worked out, I'm the star.

758
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:12,936
I should enter my designs,
that'll show my mom.

759
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,703
Awesome, hey, I'll model

760
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,505
Yeah, you're really
good at wearing clothes.

761
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,475
Yeah, it's just
the walking you're gonna
have to worry about.

762
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,478
Dude, drummers just
have to sit down.

763
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:22,446
I can have time
to practice walking.

764
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:22,969
That's right.

765

Skylight tonight?

766
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:37,111
10:00?

767
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:39,261
10:00.

768
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,866
Hey, you know,
you guys should totally perform
at the summer slam.

769
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,119
You know, everyone loved it
when you rocked out at Ally'

770
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:47,302
Yeah, they should, as a part of
the "stay tuned" submission.

771
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,607
Get people grooving,
maybe inspire someone
to buy an instrument.

772
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,877
Take up lessons,
bring in business,
yeah, that's a great idea

773
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:58,143
Yeah, and we could totally
play one of your songs too.

774
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,017
One of our songs.

775
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,914
Joey?

776
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,431
Yeah.

777
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,968
Dori: you're needed
up in store number 63.

778
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,471
Look, can someone else do it,
I, I got plans.

779
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,305
No.

780
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,343
It's kind of
a job security thing for you.

781
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:27,244
And for me.

782
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,629
What?

783
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:29,945
Nothing.

784
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,948
Just... get up there.

785
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,369
You're here.

786
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,471
Yeah, so where'd the emergency?

787
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:01,178
Well, I'm sure you're heard
about my plans for my new store.

788
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,514
Well, this store needs a face.

789
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:05,781
A face for all of our ads.

790
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:10,120
A face that makes women
think, "I want that."

791
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,220
Mm-Hmm.

792
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,874
You're that face.

00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,178
Yeah, I don't know
what you're drinking here

795
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:19,863
But maybe you should
take it easy, you know?

796
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:20,562
Eat some bread or something.

797
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:25,159
"Some bread,"
[laughs], you're funny.

798
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,673
Look, I've heard you sing.

799
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,140

In every mall
across the country.

That kind of exposure's gonna
a get you and your band noticed.

You'll play in front of

Technically, it's yours
and Joey'

1118
01:06:20,094 --> 01:06:22,376
Al, let, please, let me explain.

1119
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,011
You add in a couple of
nursery school rhymes

1120
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,014
And you think that gives you
the right to steal my song?

1121
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,249
That's not how it is.

1122
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,583
Oh, well, then,
tell me, how is it?

1123
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,755
I happen to think that
Joey's lyrics elevated
what was a mediocre tune.

1124
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,623
Maddy, would you cut that out?

1125
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,525
[Laughs] what, it's true.

1126
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,326
You gave it soul.

1127
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,479
Ally: he has no soul to give.

1128
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:42,563
He's already sold that off.

1129
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:46,068
Um, I'm pretty sure she just
called you the devil.

1130
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,070
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

1131
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,537
[Sighs]

1132
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,639
Ok, look, I'm gonna give you
some advice.

1133
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:56,212
You're never gonna get
anywhere in life unless you can
see an opportunity and take it.

1134
01:06:56,247 --> 01:06:58,748
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

1135
01:06:58,783 --> 01:07:01,250
I would never step on someone
when they were down.

1136
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,787
Well, that's exactly why
I'm successful...

1137
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:06,288
and you're stepped on.

1138
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:09,689
[Sighs]

1139
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:13,894
Ally, wait.

1140
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,932
Joey, just... let her go.

1141
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:21,003
She's gonna calm down
and she'll realize this is
what's best for everyone

1142
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:24,438
Herself included... ok?

1143
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:29,968
Ok, let's take it again
from the top.

1144
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,473
Hello, from the top!

1145
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,014
[Sighs]

1146
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,053
[Sighs]

1147
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,836
[Sighs]

1148
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:08,773
I just woke up from
a fractured fairy tale

1149
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:17,316
I bought the dream but
didn't read the small details

1150
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,495
On which road I should take

1151
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,868
I thought I could see
yet you led me astray

1152
01:08:25,903 --> 01:08:28,705
And now I feel cheated

1153
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,507
I let you break my heart

1154
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:34,999
Invaded my power

1155
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,567
But I finally learned that
I hate to lose

1156
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:45,488
Now there's something
I've gotta prove

1157
01:08:45,523 --> 01:08:49,755
I'm a survivor (survivor)

1158
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,988
Scream it loud and strong

1159
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:59,468
I'm a survivor (survivor)

1160
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:04,538
That's right, bring it on

1161
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:11,312
I'm taking back the part
I gave away, yeah

1162
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:18,515
And I'll never do it again
unless it's an even trade

1163
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,488
Oh

1164
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,792
Oh, I opened my heart,
like a fool

1165
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:27,062
I trusted the light
in the dark

1166
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:29,897
Until you unplugged it

1167
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:33,702
No, left a mark,
but I rise above it

1168
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:38,572
I know it (know it)

1169
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:42,444
Every mistake
that I ever made

1170
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,382
Made me who I am today

1171
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:49,919
I'm a survivor

1172
01:09:49,954 --> 01:09:51,318
Yeah...

1173
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:55,874
scream it loud and strong

1174
01:09:55,909 --> 01:10:00,361
I'm a survivor (survivor)

1175
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:04,800
That's right,
bring it on, yeah

1176
01:10:04,835 --> 01:10:09,138
Princess opens up her eyes

1177
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:12,606
Without a kiss

1178
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:17,112
And that she won't forget

1179
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,607
Pissed...

1180
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,689
holy smokes!

1181
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:33,128
Every mistake that
I ever made

1182
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:37,567
Made me who I am today

1183
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:41,936
I'm a survivor, yeah

1184
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,805
Scream it loud and strong

1185
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:50,813
I'm a survivor (survivor),
I'm a survivor

1186
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:54,615
That's right, bring it on

1187
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:59,955
I'm a survivor,
I'm a survivor, yeah

1188
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,790
Scream it loud and strong

1189
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:07,863
I'm a survivor,
I'm a survivor, yeah

1190
01:11:07,898 --> 01:11:10,933
That's right, bring it on.

1191
01:11:10,968 --> 01:11:12,919
[Song ends]

1192
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:14,835
[Phone rings]

1193
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,872
Excuse me, I think that's mine.

1194
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:17,838
No, I think it's mine

1195
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,875
Oh, maybe it's my ex,
do you think he wants me back?

1196
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:25,404
[Phones ringing...]

1197
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,285
[Ratcheting noise]

1198
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,222
Madison: ok, people,
let's get a move on.

1199
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,959
30 minute warning, people,
30 minutes till curtain.

1200
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,363
Madison: oh, no, that's gotta
come down a whole half an inch.

1201
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,899
That's way too high,
you've got...

1202
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:44,865
Oh, hi, Daddy.

1203
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,391
This is looking good.
Thank you.

1204
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,906
We're doing so great,
we are right on schedule
for my big grand opening.

1205
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:51,872
That's my girl.

1206
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,410
The next step is just to
get them to move out.

1207
01:11:54,445 --> 01:11:55,876
Then we're gonna
knock down that wall

1208
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,310
And we're gonna open up
a big Mega-Madison's

1209
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:11,443
Hey, dude, does this outfit
make me look fat?

1210
01:12:11,478 --> 01:12:14,963
Oh, no, dude, uh,
your fat makes you look fat.

1211
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,431
Ow.

1212
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,199
What, fat, portly?

1213
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,201
I brought you a little memento.

1214
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:24,740
It's so you'll always
remember this special night.

1215
01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:26,935
Open it.

1216
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,307
See, it's for you to wear
tonight after the show.

1217
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,752
Thanks.

1218
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,221
Oh, you're welcome

1219
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:44,817
I better go get the show started
before the natives get restless.

1220
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,734
[Applause]

1221
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:54,601
Thank you.

1222
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:57,604
Hi, everyone,
I'm Madison Huxley.

1223
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,574
Welcome to the Huxley mall
Summer Slam.

1224
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:11,085
[Laughter]

1225
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,754
All right, fellows,
they're out there.

1226
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:17,092
Four major record label
guys here... to see us play.

1227
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:18,459
Awesome.

1228
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,946
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

1229
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:23,399
Hey, I want to see.

1230
01:13:23,434 --> 01:13:25,866
Ugh, bucket?

1231
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,166
No, drew-fus, the A&R guys,
would you come on, let's go

1232
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,413
Joey, you coming?

1233
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,715
No, I'll catch up with you.

1234
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,151
Hey, one of you guys got a mint?

1235
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,817
[Sighs]

1236
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,124
[Sighs]

1237
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,630
I'm sorry I can't save

1238
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:34,670
A heart when it breaks
and scatters

1239
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:39,640
In the wind

1240
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,643
How can two words

1241
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,637
Cover the healthy others

1242
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,619
They're living in...

1243
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:54,089
oh, I never believed

1244
01:14:54,124 --> 01:14:55,823
Mm, mm

1245
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:59,393
I'll never need

1246
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,948
any more than I did before

1247
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:06,433
When sorry's not enough

1248
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,972
There's nowhere left to turn

1249
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:12,439
Too much to forgive

1250
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:15,961
Tell me where is the answer?

1251
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:19,448
How do you
find the strength?

1252
01:15:19,483 --> 01:15:22,451
The strength to let it go

1253
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:25,420
You need to just to live

1254
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:29,389
Oh, just to live

1255
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:34,987
And sorry's not enough...

1256
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,951
oh, oh, oh

1257
01:15:39,986 --> 01:15:43,370
Joey: mm-Mm

1258
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,474
Love can fall hard

1259
01:15:45,509 --> 01:15:47,641
Fall hard

1260
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,979
Leaving a scar
that remembers

1261
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,727
How bad it burns

1262
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,440
Ooh-Ooh (oh-Oh)

1263
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,686
We won't pretend

1264
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,623
Where next time begins

1265
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,328
Makes us live and learn

1266
01:16:06,363 --> 01:16:08,614
Live and learn, no

1267
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:10,866
Only now I believe

1268
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:12,902
Now I believe

1269
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:14,903
I'm gonna say

1270
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,870
Whoa

1271
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,175
Both: little more than
I did before

1272
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:23,410
Sorry's not enough

1273
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,781
There's nowhere left to turn

1274
01:16:25,816 --> 01:16:28,750
Too much to forgive

1275
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,117
Forgive me

1276
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:33,405
Tell me where is the answer

1277
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,658
How do you
find the strength?

1278
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:39,428
The strength to let it go

1279
01:16:39,463 --> 01:16:42,565
You need to just to live

1280
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,632
Oh, just to live, baby

1281
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:50,038
Both: but sorry'
not enough...

1282
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:51,807
no, there's no going back

1283
01:16:51,842 --> 01:16:54,107
No going back

1284
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:56,877
But tomorrow is all...

1285
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:00,182
Is all we could've had,
we could've had

1286
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:04,387
So we will have...

1287
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:08,522
sorry's not enough

1288
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,525
There's nowhere left to turn

1289
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,596
Too much to forgive
too much to, yeah

1290
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:17,867
Tell me, where is
the answer?

1291
01:17:17,902 --> 01:17:21,103
How do you
find the strength?

1292
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,890
The strength to let it go

1293
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:27,402
You need to just to live

1294
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:30,879
Oh, just to live, yeah, yeah

1295
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:36,551
Sorry's not enough...

1296
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:40,406
oh, ooh

1297
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:43,266
Ally: mm.

1298
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:46,091
[Song ends]

1299
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,063
[Cheering]

1300
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,598
I was totally perf

1301
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,368
Is Ally in the audience?

1302
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:55,103
Um, no, I didn't see her

1303
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:57,939
[Sighs]

1304
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,972
[Cheering]

1305
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,716
Watch it, weiner boy.

1306
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,519
Want a bite?

1307
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:16,458
[Scoffs] are you insane?

1308
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,181
[Applause and cheering]

1309
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:25,576
Hey, hot dog, you're up.

1310
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,936
[Applause and cheering]

1311
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,301
That's me.

1312
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,076
Dori: ok, next up...

1313
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:36,445
your lunch.

1314
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,117
[Laughter]

1315
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,369
[Laughter]

1316
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:18,220
I thought we could take a break
and go see the rest of the
summer slam, what do you think?

1317
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:21,223
I think I want to finish here
and then just go home.

1318
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:23,714
That's what I think

1319
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:31,082
And now, fall fashions
from the newest store

1320
01:19:31,117 --> 01:19:34,503
To join the Huxley mall
family... Madison.

1321
01:19:34,538 --> 01:19:36,204
[Applause]

1322
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,646
[Inaudible speaking]

1323
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,491
Woman: ok, guys, you're up next

1324
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:06,401
[Cheering and laughter]

1325
01:20:06,436 --> 01:20:12,806
[Laughter...]

1326
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,707
Are you kidding me?

1327
01:20:14,742 --> 01:20:16,574
[Swallows noisily]

1328
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,515
Well. [Laughs nervously]

1329
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,218
We seem to have
a running theme here.

1330
01:20:23,253 --> 01:20:24,886
All right, you can
do it, dude, totally.

1331
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:25,886
All right.

1332
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,622
Just remember, man,
right-Left, right-Left.

1333
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,324
...the debut collection
by little penny.

1334
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:31,560
Go get ', tiger.

1335
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:36,997
Ow!

1336
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:42,095
[Laughter...]

1337
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,416
This is the last one.

1338
01:20:54,451 --> 01:20:56,383
Wow.

1339
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,919
I had no idea you were
such a master packer.

1340
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,923
Guess neither one of us
knew the other as well as
she thought she did.

1341
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,429
Ally...

1342
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,964
fine, I get it.

1343
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:14,970
You're an adult,
and I have to let you make
your own decisions, I know that.

1344
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:18,974
I should've talked to you first
before selling the store

1345
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:24,980
But you should've talked to me
about new england.

1346
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:26,813
Look...

1347
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,817
you're all I've got.

1348
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,488
And I just want you to be happy.

1349
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:35,979
I know that.

1350
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,396
I know.

1351
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:50,871
[Cheering]

1352
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:57,978
[Applause and cheering]

1353
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:00,247
Yo, Joey, he did it,
man, he actually walked.

1354
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:04,786
[Laughs] I do make
a pretty good supermodel
if I do say so myself.

1355
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,453
Shut up.

1356
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,822
Better put on your jacket, dude.

1357
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:12,127
Yeah, Madison is P.O.'d

1358
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,747
You ok, man?

1359
01:22:14,782 --> 01:22:17,992
Yeah, totally.

1360
01:22:18,027 --> 01:22:21,167
You know you don'

1361
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,970
You don't owe us anything

1362
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:26,875
If you're having
second thoughts about it, man,
just say it, and we walk.

1363
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,672
No.

1364
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,615
Dude...

1365
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,952
we sold out.

1366
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:41,990
Ow, I'm not saying
it's a bad thing, I mean...

1367
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,324
Even green day sold out.

1368
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,562
Yeah, I mean, I mean, everybody
does stuff that they're not
proud of to get what they want.

1369
01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:50,465
Just didn't think the sell-out
phase of our career would happen

1370
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,901
Before the "career" phase
of our career phase happened.

1371
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:55,435
Ow, ow...

1372
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,701
see, it doesn't

1373
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,713
Dude... go.

1374
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,519
[Cheering]

1375
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,019
Joey?

1376
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:16,024
Where's Joey going,
we're on in a few minutes.

1377
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:19,794
Uh, Joey?

1378
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,530
Joey who?

1379
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,400
Joey: hey...

1380
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,937
so you guys are really closing?

1381
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:32,906
Yeah.

1382
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,442
Why don't I just...

1383
01:23:34,477 --> 01:23:36,943
Mom?

1384
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,481
Too bad you missed our, uh,
Going-Out-Of-Business sale.

1385
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:40,982
We were giving out
a lot of great deals.

1386
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:41,948
Ally, please.

1387
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,735
Not that you would
need anything, judging by...

1388
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,487
what I saw the other night
at the rehearsal.

1389
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:47,555
Will you please
just let me explain?

1390
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,024
[Whispers]: Joey?

1391
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:50,423
What are you doing?

1392
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,726
You don't have to, Joey.

1393
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,613
She's beautiful and
influential, I get it.

1394
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:58,431
No, it's not about her,
it's about you

1395
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:02,437
People spend their whole lives
trying to find what we found
in each other.

1396
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:06,441
Some people never do.

1397
01:24:06,476 --> 01:24:08,975
I screwed up.

1398
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,615
Boys are dumb, all right?
[Cheering in background]

1399
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,617
Not that's an excuse
for me, just an apology.

1400
01:24:15,652 --> 01:24:17,669
A lame one.

1401
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:19,652
I know.

1402
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:24,657
Look, I just...

1403
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:29,664
I hope that when,
if you're ready...

1404
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:33,933
Maybe we can start over.

1405
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:40,168
You know, not many people
get a second chance.

1406
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:48,114
So you should get down there.

1407
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:52,020
It's too big an opportunity
for you to pass up,
so play the song.

1408
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:55,290
Seriously, it's ok, it's yours

1409
01:24:55,325 --> 01:24:59,459
Oh, and, uh...

1410
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:03,298
in case yours breaks.

1411
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:04,564
Joey, Joey?

1412
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,468
This is far too important
to screw up.

1413
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,939
Wish I would've
figured that out a lot sooner.

1414
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:13,339
Joey, Joey?
[Cheering in background]

1415
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:17,512
And now, the moment
you're all been waiting for...

1416
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,946
Madison: not yet!

1417
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:24,998
In just a second,
[laughs nervously], so...

1418
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:30,016
...summer slam sounds better
than winter slam.

1419
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:35,563
Look, I know it's not enough
just to say it, but...

1420
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:37,531
I'm sorry.

1421
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,270
What is his problem?

1422
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:44,537
Never mind.

1423
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,574
We'll do it without him.

1424
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,093
Ok, go, go.

1425
01:25:48,128 --> 01:25:49,542
Ok and now...

1426
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,881
the moment you have
all been waiting. [Laughs]

1427
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,147
Hello, places?

1428
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,884
Sorry, toots, no Joey, no, go.

1429
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:56,883
What?

1430
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:59,587
We're a band, babe,
we stick together.

1431
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,322
So we're not selling out?

1432
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,023
Get back here.

1433
01:26:02,058 --> 01:26:02,856
Madison.

1434
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,224
Don't you dare
walk off the stage.

1435
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:09,856
Get back here, do you hear me?
[Light applause]

1436
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,704
Hi.

1437
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,708
Man: where's the band?

1438
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,579
[Whispers]: six, seven, eight.

1439
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:26,548
When gray

1440
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,448
Meets light

1441
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:32,654
It creates new colors that

1442
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,140
Stay lost

1443
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:37,557
Inside

1444
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,361
[Scattered laughter]

1445
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:43,431
Now who's stepped on?

1446
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:45,717
Hey, what's going on?

1447
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:47,411
Train wreck, dude.

1448
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,070
Serves her right.

1449
01:26:49,105 --> 01:26:51,104
Slow motion

1450
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,840
Am I living now?

1451
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,542
[Scattered laughter]

1452
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:05,752
Out...

1453
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:11,125
'cause I can't
hide me from you

1454
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,151
And I'm not afraid

1455
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,641
Some...

1456
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:33,648
[scattered laughter]

1457
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:38,152
Some...

1458
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:50,387
A world that you're never
seen before

1459
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:56,237
Starts moving in slow motion

1460
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:58,306
Am I living now?

1461
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:02,210
Out loud

1462
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:12,385
And I'm not afraid somehow

1463
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,592
To let you
see right through me, wait

1464
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:23,081
I must be dreaming
wide awake

1465
01:28:23,116 --> 01:28:28,536
I must be dreaming
wide awake.

1466
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:32,472
[Song ends]

1467
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:36,374
[Applause...]

1468
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,493
[Sighs]

1469
01:28:41,528 --> 01:28:44,241
Um...

1470
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,721
ladies and gentlemen...

1471
01:28:46,756 --> 01:28:48,621
Ally Shepherd.

1472
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:55,563
[Applause and cheering]

1473
01:28:55,598 --> 01:28:58,531
Hi, uh, everybody.

1474
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:04,572
I guess I'm gonna play a song
that I wrote.

1475
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:06,563
With a friend.

1476
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,550
On my way

1477
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:30,631
Though I don't know where
I'm going

1478
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:34,135
On a road that's dark

1479
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,240
And long

1480
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:42,275
On my way

1481
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,748
But I'm fearful that
I could be lost

1482
01:29:46,783 --> 01:29:50,017
That the path I have chosen

1483
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:55,011
Might be wrong

1484
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,424
When will it be clear

1485
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:03,564
That I made
the right choice?

1486
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:06,466
When I can be sure

1487
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:10,636
That I know my own voice?

1488
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:14,675
Dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

1489
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:19,394
And faith wins out

1490
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:24,078
And I overcome my fear

1491
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:36,493
Joey: here...

1492
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,341
I don't know

1493
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:51,879
I don't know where to
search for answers

1494
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:55,900
In a world that

1495
01:30:55,935 --> 01:30:59,852
Isn't fair...

1496
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:04,657
will I find my strength

1497
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,995
And discover who
I've been, yeah?

1498
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:12,066
Or retreat and pretend that

1499
01:31:12,101 --> 01:31:16,569
I don't care

1500
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:20,006
When will it be clear...

1501
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,045
that I made
the right choice?

1502
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,049
When can I be sure...

1503
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:31,984
that I know my own voice?

1504
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:35,857
Both: I dream of a day
when I'm free from doubt

1505
01:31:35,892 --> 01:31:40,412
When faith wins out

1506
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:44,932
And I overcome my fear

1507
01:31:44,967 --> 01:31:49,596
Clear...

1508
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,907
I've been told

1509
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,411
That we learn from
our mistakes

1510
01:31:57,446 --> 01:32:01,380
But I just don't know

1511
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:06,203
How many mistakes it takes

1512
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,083
Oh, I'm trying so hard

1513
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:14,041
To let down my guard

1514
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:17,965
Maybe right now...

1515
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,637
right here...

1516
01:32:22,672 --> 01:32:26,405
clear...

1517
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,244
that I made the right choice

1518
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:34,247
Sure...

1519
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:38,117
that I know my own voice

1520
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:42,290
Praise the day
when I'm free from doubt

1521
01:32:42,325 --> 01:32:46,294
When faith wins out

1522
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:48,261
And I overcome

1523
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:53,634
My fear... (yeah, yeah)

1524
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:57,400
Clear...

1525
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:03,609
mm-Mm

1526
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:07,895
Clear, yeah

1527
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:12,147
Clear...

1528
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:17,123
[song ends]

1529
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:22,687
[Applause and cheering...]

1530
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:35,865
[Ally laughs] a lot of you
may recognize this next song.

1531
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:38,208
This one's for you, Mom.

1532
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,357
Turn up the volume

1533
01:33:49,392 --> 01:33:52,358
Open the door

1534
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,293
Want a little something

1535
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:56,489
And want a little
something more

1536
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,233
Don't look for easy

1537
01:33:59,268 --> 01:34:01,367
Easy comes hard

1538
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,436
Take the road less traveled

1539
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,406
But don't forget
your own backyard

1540
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:07,874
Rattle some cages

1541
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,728
Don't have to play nice

1542
01:34:10,763 --> 01:34:13,045
Ask a million questions

1543
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,216
Mia: but never ask
the same thing twice

1544
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:20,054
No indecision
that time has passed

1545
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,021
Go a little crazy

1546
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,891
And find a way to
make it last

1547
01:34:23,926 --> 01:34:26,494
You can move right up to

1548
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:29,028
The head of the class

1549
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:33,734
But not if you sit on
your big, fat, whoo

1550
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:36,570
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1551
01:34:36,605 --> 01:34:39,071
Let 'em know you were here

1552
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,609
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1553
01:34:41,644 --> 01:34:43,744
Let 'em know you were here

1554
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,277
If you stop and think

1555
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:48,214
Your chance will disappear

1556
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,918
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1557
01:34:50,953 --> 01:34:53,386
Let them know you were here

1558
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,610
More like you mean it

1559
01:34:59,645 --> 01:35:02,222
Less like you should

1560
01:35:02,257 --> 01:35:04,764
Try a new direction

1561
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:07,134
And that's alright,
that it's all good

1562
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:09,737
No inhibition

1563
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:12,271
Arms open wide

1564
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:13,773
Reach a little higher

1565
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:16,143
Then find some funk down
deep inside

1566
01:35:16,178 --> 01:35:18,612
You might wake up famous

1567
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:20,579
And filthy rich

1568
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:26,220
But not if all you do
is sit around and whoo

1569
01:35:26,255 --> 01:35:28,422
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1570
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:30,222
Let 'em know you were here

1571

Don't hold back,
make some noise

1572

Let 'em know you were here

1573
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:40,501
If you stop and think,
your chance will disappear

1574

Don't hold back,
make some noise

1575
01:35:42,872 --> 01:35:46,170
Let them know you were here

1576
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,777
Don't just stand there

1577
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:56,383
If you don'
like what you see

1578
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:58,751
No-No-No-No

1579
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,138
Change the channel,
change the channel

1580
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,491
Change the world,
change the world

1581
01:36:03,526 --> 01:36:06,828
As long as you try

1582
01:36:06,863 --> 01:36:10,096
You'll be free

1583
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,867
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1584
01:36:12,902 --> 01:36:15,835
Let 'em know you were here

1585
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,705
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1586
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,040
Let 'em know you were here

1587
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:22,174
If you stop and think

1588
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:24,011
Your chance will disappear
(don't hold back)

1589
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:27,281
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1590
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:30,149
Let them know you were here

1591

Don't hold back,
make some noise

01:36:32,688 --> 01:36:34,086
Let 'em know you were here

1593
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:37,191
Don't hold back,
make some noise

1594
01:36:37,226 --> 01:36:39,492
Let 'em know you were here

1595
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:43,898
If you stop and think,
your chance will disappear

1596

Don't hold back
make some noise

1597

Let them know you were,
let them know you were

1598
01:36:50,022 --> 01:36:53,741
Let them know you were,
let them know you were

1599
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:59,613
Let them know you were,
let them know...

1600
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,046
you were here.

1601
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:06,212
[Applause and cheering...]

1602
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:15,262
