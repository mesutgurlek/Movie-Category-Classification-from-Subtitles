1755
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:30,670
¶ Bumping uglies
real hard we did grind,

1756
01:36:32,888 --> 01:36:37,857
¶ With tissue and hand cream
I can try to remember,

1757
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:45,084
¶ How you stuffed this thing,
how you stuffed this thing up my behind.

1758
01:36:48,257 --> 01:36:53,310
¶ With my partner
in bed I am yearning,

1759
01:36:54,025 --> 01:37:00,540
¶ To get pleasure and passion
that's the truth.

1760
01:37:00,542 --> 01:37:07,121
¶ Only thoughts of you
get me burning,

1761
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:14,565
¶ Memories of your beef
make me stew.

1762
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:18,791
¶ If hearts were like chickens,
yours I'd defrost,

1763
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:25,268
¶ To reclaim true love,
what is the cost?

1764
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:29,057
¶ It could be nostalgia
for all that is lost,

1765
01:37:29,222 --> 01:37:32,230
¶ Could it be that our love
is star crossed?

1766
01:37:32,374 --> 01:37:33,703
¶ Whoa-oooo

1767
01:37:33,705 --> 01:37:39,428
¶ I sure miss gettin'
my salad tossed.

1768
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:45,117
¶ 'Cause you are my fries,
and your shake makes me shiver,

1769
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:49,268
¶ You're my Happy Meal
sent from above.

1770
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:52,861
¶ Can this drive-thru called life deliver,

1771
01:37:52,863 --> 01:37:58,035
¶ A heavenly slow,
fast food love?

1772
01:37:58,037 --> 01:38:02,097
¶ Come on, let mine out!

1773
01:38:04,653 --> 01:38:08,587
¶ 'Cause you are my fries,
and your shake makes me shiver,

1774
01:38:08,587 --> 01:38:12,626
¶ You're my Happy Meal
sent from above.

1775
01:38:12,626 --> 01:38:16,210
¶ Can this drive-thru called life deliver,

1776
01:38:16,212 --> 01:38:21,569
¶ A heavenly slow,
fast food love?

1777
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:24,680
¶ I want a piece of you

1778
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:31,964
¶ Shake me hard,
top with flour--
