3
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,602

4
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,387
<i>he called them, someone's</i>
<i>phone rang in the choir room,</i>

5
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:08,872
<i>which means it's somebody</i>
<i>in Glee Club.</i>

6
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:10,441
<i>Sue left McKinley to protect</i>
<i>Becky, which is crazy,</i>

7
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:12,276

<i>New York with Kurt and Rachel,</i>

8
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:14,394

<i>and she doesn't go to NYADA,</i>

9
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,846

10
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,380

Hey, Kitty,
who are you texting?

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,388
Let me see your phone.

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,974
I'm playing 4 Pics 1 Word,
weirdo stalker.

15
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,726
Do I need to get
a restraining order?

16
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,645
Guys, we got a problem.

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,863
Her name is Frida Romero.

18

The Hoosierdaddies have
a secret weapon.

22
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,243
She's a tiny little sophomore,
never competed before,

23
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,361
but her voice

24
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,496
could fill an arena.

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,580
I mean, it's big.

26
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,365
And the only way to beat them

27
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:09,533
is to be huge.

28
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:10,867

FIGGINS:
Children, this power outage

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,017
is not an emergency.

00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,686
(cheering)

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,439
Nor is it an excuse to go
wilding through the hallways.

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,076
While we're investigating
the root of this near calamity,

38
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,412
classes will continue

39
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,064

44
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:54,878
I now have to turn

45
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:57,247
off the P.A. system

46
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:00,934
so I can save
our precious generator resources

47
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,103
for the coffee machine

48
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,806

lower back vibrator.

Okay, that puts a damper

51
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:11,094
on our stadium songs.

52
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:12,613
Time for a new
appropriate lesson.

53
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,814
Ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,225

57
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:22,939
Who? Katie?

58
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:24,908
How do you even know
this person is a she?

59
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,744
Or even a human?
Look, stop, all right?

60
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,962
All I know is I've had this
really amazing connection.

61
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:30,914
You've got to let this go, man.

62
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:32,916
It's crazy.
You don't even know her.

63
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,618
Look, you don't understand,
Jake.

64
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:36,253
I've never felt
so close to someone.

65
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,755
Look, I told her things

66
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,457
about myself, about my past,

67
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:41,925
I've never told anyone.

68
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,143
Ever.

69
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:44,478
If this were to get out...
Wait.

70
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,963
I thought your biggest secret
was dyslexia.

71
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,966
Well, what is it?

72
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,186
(sighs)

73
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,470
I can't.

74
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:54,805
Fine, dude, keep it all

75
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,323
locked away
for a few more years,

76
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:58,141
but it's not going away.

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,860
Maybe you should think
about starting to share

78
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:03,580
your deep, dark secrets
with people you actually know.

79
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,334
(school bell ringing)

80
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,457
Right? I found this
out by the Dumpster.

81
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:14,825
With a little TLC

82
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,294
and three clicks
from Kurt's ruby slippers,

83
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,880
this bad boy
would be salvageable.

84
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,833
Um, can you please take a seat, because Kurt and
I would like to have a conversation with you.

85
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,885
All right, you know what, Rachel,
if you are still obsessing

86
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,386
over what you're gonna sing
at your <i>Funny Girl</i> callback,

87
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,138
may I suggest
your best jam ever,

88
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,339
"Run, Joey, Run."

89
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:30,674
We think you're throwing
your life away.

90
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,659
KURT:
It's bad enough you let

91
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:33,861
those horny tourists
grope you for tips

92
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,679
at that awful Coyote Ugly bar,
(groans)

93
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,180
but Tina just informed me

94
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:40,067
that you are now a bouncer
at a lesbian beer garden?

95
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:42,202
And you're a go-go girl.
A go-go girl!

96
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,872
Oh, yeah, a girl-bar go-go girl.

97
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:47,074
I am a cage dancer...
big difference.

98
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,992
I'm dressed as Barbarella,
and I'm sorry,

99
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:50,994
but some of us actually
need to work for a living.

100
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,496
Okay, that's not the point.

101
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,081
Okay, you're so talented,
Santana.

102
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,666
You're, like,
the most talented person I know,

103
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,217
obviously with the exception
of me and Kurt.

104
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,086
But your voice, it's electric,

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,371
and I would kill for
half of your dancing abilities.

106
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,674
So I'm telling you
what you told me,

107
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,059
which is that you just need to
stop and focus on your talent.

108
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,345
Well, maybe I don't want to be
in <i>Funny Girl,</i> okay?

109
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,899
Or be a singing waiter at
the Fire Island Pancake Shack.

110
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,767
So why don't you just
stop trying to force

111
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,436
all of your creaky
old-time Broadway dreams

112
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,438
on to my amazingly
awesome dream.

113
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,240
And what's that?

114
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:24,228
I am trying to figure that out.

115
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,581
What is so wrong with taking

116
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,199
a little time
to figure things out?

117
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,702
Nothing. But what about doing
something in the meantime?

118
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,253
Like dance lessons?

119
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:34,237
NYADA has a great
extension program

120
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:36,089
for non-students.
Yeah.

121
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,925
Something to keep
your motors revved,

122
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,209
you know...
My "motor"

123
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:41,211
is revved every night
that I cage dance.

124
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,713
And while I appreciate
your pity,

125
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,431
I don't really think
I need to be taking

126
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,433
any advice from TV's <i>Blossom</i>

127
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,219
and Lady Elaine Fairchilde.

128
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,253
Would you take

129
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,255
your chair with you?

130
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:55,642
(school bell ringing)

131
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,110
All right, I know
these conditions aren't ideal,

132
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,763
but I want to thank you guys
for toughing it out.

133
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:02,733
And we have our first volunteer,
who is going to show us

134
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,119
how to get back to basics
and really strip it down.

135
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,322
So, let's give it up for Sam.

136
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,957
(clears throat) Right.

137
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,825
Uh, take it away.

138
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,493
Thanks.

139
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,111
Um, well,

140
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,447
when Mr. Shue started
talking about being big,

141
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,616
I started thinking
about Phil Spector's

142
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:22,135
legendary Wall of Sound,
and how he would use, like,

143
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,503
thousands of instruments

144
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:25,339
so his songs could really
fill a stadium.

145
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,624
And then I started
thinking about stripping,

146
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:28,759
um,

147
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,010
out all that extra noise

148
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:32,262
to get to the essence
of the song.

149
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:35,933
Plus, my mom said that
I was conceived to this song,

150
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,768
so I kind of literally
owe my existence

151
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:38,969
to the Righteous Brothers.

152
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:40,470
Anyways, uh, here it goes.

153
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:43,974
♪ You never close your eyes

154
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:48,161

that we need for regionals.

I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.

190
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,561
I can't do Miguel
without my synth.

191
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,613
I needs my synth!

192
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:47,948
No, you needs to man up.

193
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,933
Excuse me?

194
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,785
You know how often
the power went off at my house,

195
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,121
how many times my dad couldn't
afford to pay the stupid bill?

196
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,289
Relax, dude. I had to entertain
my brother and sister

197
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,791
with just my guitar
and my voice,

198
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,326
and we didn't have any synth.

199
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,946
I mean, like, I saw you
texting during my song,

200
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:04,464
and it's not just you;
It's all of us.

201
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,282
We're so focused
on being plugged in

202
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,968
to the Twitterverse
and the Blogosphere

203
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:11,138
that we don't appreciate what's
actually right in front of us.

204
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:13,456
And I think that that's
just sad and lame.

205
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,627
(school bell ringing)

206
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:20,514
Great, so we'll include
a Blu-ray of <i>Black Swan,</i>

207
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,316
um, in the gift bag and a note

208
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,819
from the director,
"How Ballet Inspired Me."

209
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,521
Oh, that's perfect.

210
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:28,655
Thanks, Darren.

211
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:29,990
I appreciate it.

212
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,608
Oh, and, uh, listen,

213
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,643
you're at my table,
seated next to Christopher.

214
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:35,195
So be nice.

215
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,697
All right, bye.

216
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:38,982
Darren...?

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,034
Aronofsky. Christopher Nolan.

218
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,036
Oh.
You may be seated.

219
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,507
So, first of all,
how is your dad?

220
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,960
Oh, uh, thank you for asking.

221
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,128
He's doing good.

222
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,846
Um, he's back at work,

223
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,848
and all his treatments
seem to be working.

224
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,133
Good, I'm happy to hear that.

225
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,001
I thought you might
have called me in here

226
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,886
because, um,
you were gonna fire me.

227
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:02,222
What? Why would I do that?

228
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,691
When you gave me the internship,
you said it would be 24/7,

229
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,226
and ever since
I got accepted to NYADA...

230
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:07,527
(phone vibrates)

231
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,479
You haven't been coming in
as much.

232
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:10,564
We've noticed.

233
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,848
But quality

234
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:15,202
trumps quantity always.

235
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,653
And though NYADA's gain

236
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:20,023
is Vogue.com's loss,

237
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:24,711
I will never stop anyone
from pursuing their passion.

238
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,029
But I need your help.

239
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,714
You know I'm co-chairing
the gala

240
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,333
for New York City Ballet's
educational programs?

241
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,220
Yeah, it's only <i>the</i> social event
of the performing arts season.

242
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,338
My celebrity wrangler
just canceled.

243
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,873
It was going
to be Anna's daughter,

244
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:40,010
but she got the chicken pox
à la Barbara Walters.

245
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,595
So I need somebody.

246
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,346
I need somebody good

247
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,565
who can dive in ASAP.

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,602
If anyone else does this,
I-I will literally die.

249
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,070
Okay. All right.
Yes.

250
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:52,022
And listen, um,
if you want to draft

251
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,723
a couple of friends
to help you out,

252
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:55,242
that's good, too.
Yeah?

Fact, if I hadn't mistaken you

00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,212
for a butch Israeli girl,

300
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,830
I would've never
let you in here.

301

B, the fact that
you survived my boot camp 101,

00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,470
also known as Sue 90X,
trademark pending,

303
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:33,855
I will allow you to speak.

304
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:34,856
Just don't sing.

305
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,474
I'll admit,

306
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:39,310
I rejoined the Cheerios
with the sole plan

307
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,012
of destroying you
from the inside.

308
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,981
Admirable. But now that
you're gone, I can see

309
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,682
that all the Cheerio girls
are lost without you,

310
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,034
and frankly,
as student council president,

311
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,569
I'm a little worried

312
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,404
about the kind of advice
Coach Roz is giving.

313
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,573
And that is why
you all signed up

314
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:52,907
with Dr. Fong to get

315
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,376
a couple of those fatty ribs

316
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,410
removed for flexibility.

317
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,711
What?

318
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:58,380
You know, I always thought

319
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,914
Becky could look like
a young Dolly Parton

320
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,416
with a couple less ribs.

321
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:02,717
Something went down
at that school,

322
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,502
and it has something
to do with you.

323
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,037
Someway, somehow,

324
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:08,223
the kids are still shaken up.
No one feels safe.

325
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,208
Set the record straight.

326
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:12,427
We need you, Coach Sue.

327
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,902
(school bell ringing)

328
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,887
ARTIE:
Hey.

329
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,273
I was thinking about what you
said, and you're totally right.

330
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,741
I kind of got inspired

331
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,777
when I was rolling down
the hallway in between classes.

332
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,949
(squeaks)

333
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,203
And the sound it made
was almost musical,

334
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,755
and it got me thinking; we don't
have to have electricity

335
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,707
to make music. We don't
even need real instruments.

336
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,209
I didn't say you couldn't
use instruments. I was...

337
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,211
I know, but think about it.
We want to win regionals,

338
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,762
and we're gonna have
to do it as a team.

339
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,448
And imagine how we could get
everybody working together

340
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,550
if we pushed ourselves to
pull off a song with nothing

341
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:56,304
but a water bottle and
pencils and a zipper,

342
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,256
and who knows what else.
You want unplugged.

343
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:00,091
This would be unplugged squared.

344
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,943
(school bell ringing)
I like it.

345
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,928
Ladies?

346
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,281
What is the event

347
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,766
the Big Apple's hoi polloi
must be invited to

348
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:10,151
or they'll pull a Javert

349
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:11,903
and swan dive off the
Chrysler Building?

350
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,238
The New York City
Ballet Gala, duh.

351
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,323
And guess who gets to attend

352
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,792
if they just volunteer a few short hours?
Anne Hathaway?

353
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:19,327
It's us, it's us!
Are you serious?

354
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,496
And just when you thought
it couldn't get any gayer,

355
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,630
it does.

356
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:23,965
Make fun of it all you want,

357
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,483
but the New York City
Ballet Gala,

358
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:27,135
it's a celebration
of a timeless art.

359
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:30,138
If it wasn't for ballet,
I wouldn't be here.

360
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,474
<i>It was my gateway</i>
<i>into show business.</i>

361
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:35,593
<i>My dance teacher told me that</i>
<i>I was a mini Margot Fonteyn.</i>

362
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:37,128
<i>She taught me the power</i>
<i>of music,</i>

363
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,746
<i>and although that dance studio</i>

364
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>was just a tiny,</i>
<i>moldy Lima storefront,</i>

365
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:45,153
<i>to me, it was the most</i>
<i>beautiful place on earth.</i>

366
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,821
KURT:
I started ballet

367
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,940
at the ripe old age of three.

368
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:51,809
<i>My mom enrolled me after</i>
<i>seeing me in front of the TV,</i>

369
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:54,662
<i>jetéing and debouléeing</i>
<i>to the</i> Blues Clues <i>theme song.</i>

370
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:56,831
<i>That ballet class was</i>
<i>one of the few places</i>

371
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,449
<i>that just seemed to fit.</i>

372
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,285
<i>And even when I saw</i>
<i>some of the kids</i>

373
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,619
<i>and their parents</i>
<i>laughing at me,</i>

374
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:02,770
<i>something inside</i>
<i>my little brain said,</i>

375
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,172
<i>"Screw them.</i>

376
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:05,874
<i>Just go for it, Hummel."</i>

377
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,209
<i>My can-do attitude</i>
<i>was born in that room.</i>

378
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,178
And I skipped all that crap

379
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:12,330
to study the timeless art
of crunk.

380
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:14,132
Look, you can tell Isabelle
that I am definitely in.

381
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,000
Not me, count me out.

382
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:18,553
You mean you don't want
to wear a designer dress

383
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,188
from the legendary
Vogue.com vault

384
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:21,806
that you get to keep as a gift?

385
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,725
I'm in.

386
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:24,776
She's in.
She's in.

387
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,028
I know these songs are

388
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,679
supposed to be unplugged,
but I asked Mr. Shue

389
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:29,864
permission to do
a full orchestration.

390
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:30,982
Which I gladly agreed to,

391
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,150
because Ryder eloquently told me

392
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,151
that what he wanted to unplug

393
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:34,736
were his feelings.

394
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,821
I want to really reveal myself
through this song.

395
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,189
And frankly, I think

396
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,874
I kind of need the support
to get there.

397
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,859
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of us,

398
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,045
and for all the slushees...
real and proverbial...

399
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,215
that we've all taken
to the face over the years.

400
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,050

(music ends)

429
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:08,222
That was amazing, Ryder.

430
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,390
You certainly unplugged

431
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,342
whatever you were looking
to let out.

432
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,644
I didn't want
to just get them out.

433
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,346
I wanted to get
in touch with them

434
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:18,349
so I could maybe have the balls
to tell you guys something.

435
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,484
Something that's pretty hard

436
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:21,235
to talk about.

437
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:22,704
It's cool, bro.
You can let it out.

438
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:25,406
I've actually only told
one person this.

439
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:27,191
Not even my parents know.

440
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,194
But...

441
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:33,531
I'm not sure if I could trust
that person to keep it secret.

442
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,084
So before this gets out,

443
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:39,721
I want to be the one
to open the box.

444
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:44,892
When I was 11,
I was molested by my babysitter.

445
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:51,065
She just walked in on me
in the shower,

446
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,518
and she touched me a bit.

447
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:56,053
Wait, hold on.
Did you just say "she"?

448
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,939
Like, as in a girl?
Like, a teenage girl?

449
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,358
Yeah, she was, like, 17, 18.

450
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,442
SAM:
Dude,

451
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:02,777
you were 11

452
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:04,445
and some hot 18-year-old
plays with your junk?

453
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,114
I'd have killed for that.

454
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,199
Why are you ashamed of this?

455
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,951
I don't know, I...

456
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,919
It kind of messed me up a bit.

457
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:13,204
Like, I have trouble
trusting girls

458
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,672
because of it, I think.

459
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,240
Guys, this is not something
to high-five about.

460
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,593
Ryder, I'm sorry,
but I'm obligated to report it.

461
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,044
Whatever,
she already got locked up.

462
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:21,712
She was caught doing it
to some other kid.

463
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:23,747
SAM: Okay, I'm sorry, but
why-why is that a crime?

464
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,383
I mean, it's every
teenage boy's fantasy.

465
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,084
I mean, there's, like, 50
'80s movies about it.

466
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,553
I mean, <i>My Tutor,</i>

467
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:29,887
<i>Private Lessons, Gym Class...</i>

468
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,222
We get it, Sam, thanks.

469
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,257
Guys, this is so uncool.

470
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,642
His truth is his truth,
not yours.

471
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:35,777
RYDER: You know what,
it's cool, okay?

472
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,895
Uh, the guys are right.

473
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,947
I don't know what
I was thinking.

474
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:41,816
Uh, I'm, like,
the luckiest guy in here.

475
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,234
So...

476
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:45,987
You know, yeah.

477
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,605
Good job.
Thanks.

478
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:50,625
I mean, kid clearly has
superior game.

479
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:00,849
You know, I was
sort of surprised when

480
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,684
you asked me to dinner,
'cause I know you're, like,

481
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:04,402
dating Jake's brother
and everything.

482
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,071
Puck and I broke up.

483
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:07,655
He dumped me when he went off

484
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,507
to live at a college
he doesn't go to.

485
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,659
From a distance,
Puck is super hot,

486
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,695
but you don't really realize
until you're right up close

487
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,146
how puffy he is.

488
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:15,780
(chuckles)

489
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,655
Here you go.

490
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,985
I don't know why I have
such terrible luck

491
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:22,921
with guys.

492
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,156
It's probably because I come on
really strong

493
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,674
and pretend to be all slutty,

494
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,159
and then I freeze up right away

495
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:31,429
and get distant
and drop weird hints

496
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:33,431
that my vagina has teeth.

497
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,600
But I didn't come here

498
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,268
to talk about
the razor-sharp barbs

499
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,553
guarding my cervix.

500
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:42,173
I noticed how withdrawn you got
this week

501
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:44,442
in Glee Club after you told
everyone your secret.

502
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,444
It may have seemed
like no one else

503
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,780
in that room understood
what you went through,

504
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,365
but...

505
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,650
I did.

506
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,357
It was, um, my friend
Julie's older brother.

507
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,209
I was in sixth grade.

508
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,211
One night,

509
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,880
Julie had a sleepover,

510
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:09,084
and in the middle of the night,

511
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,803
he came down into the basement

512
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,706
and crawled
into my sleeping bag.

513
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:17,475
At first, I thought
it was a joke.

514
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,710
I didn't know
what was happening.

515
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:23,398
But then he started, um...

516
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:27,402
to feel me in places.

517
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,154
In the morning,
I went straight home

518
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,738
without saying good-bye,

519
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,908
and I couldn't tell my parents
for a while.

520
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,243
I was afraid

521
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,495
of upsetting them or something.

522
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,081
So when I did tell them,

523
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,749
they were really confused.

524
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:45,920
They didn't understand
why I waited so long

525
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,738
to say something about it.

526
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,407
My mom called his parents,

527
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,092
and all I could hear her say

528
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:53,595
was how good of a kid he was
and how she didn't

529
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,131
know how something
like that could happen.

530
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,685
And then Julie
stopped talking to me

531
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,253
and told everyone at school

532
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:04,189
that I was spreading rumors
about her brother.

533
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,107
Then she told all my friends

534
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,358
to stop talking to me.

535
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:08,943
Finally,

536
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:12,280
I just decided it'd just
be easier to switch schools.

537
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,315
So I did.

538
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,486
I understand what it feels like

539
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,288
to have something
like that happen to you

540
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,657
and feel like
nobody understands.

541
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:27,879
I guess I just wanted you
to know that...

542
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,415
I do.

543
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,473
Thanks.

BECKY:
Hi, Coach.

585
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,088
Can I watch it with you?

586
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,740
Jackson, you are out of uniform.

quitting the team.

588

I can't stand how
Coach Roz treats me.

589
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,082
Maybe the fact that you grew
from an itty-bitty fetus

590
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,585
into a full-size adult
in less than a calendar year

591
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,086
has made you cocky,
Robin Sylvester,

592
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:51,189
but around here,
we like our protein shakes

593

you cooked up on

00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:01,265
Well, I have always admired
her run-on sentences.

597
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,434
Coach, please come back.

598
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:05,936
I know you did this
to protect me.

599
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:07,104
I'm sorry.

600
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,823
I miss you so bad it hurts.

601
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,492
Oh, honey, I miss you, too.

602
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,295
But the fact is,

603
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,614
this is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

604
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:19,967
As a trainer,
people take me seriously.

605
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:27,458
95 years I gave those girls,
and what did it get me?

Certainly not their respect.

607
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:33,964

honey, I've moved on,

Becky, you couldn't pay me
to go back to that.

642
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,601
And I don't miss them at all.

643
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,252
Not one bit.

644
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,939
Not at all.

645
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:50,564
Okay, you're on
Rex Reed duty, Kurt.

646
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,849
Keep him away from the open bar.
Gotcha.

647
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,952
Hey, Santana, how do you feel
about Cherry Jones?

648
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:56,353
Whatevs.

649
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,122
Miss Isabelle, I'm sorry,

650
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,290
I know that we're
just volunteers here,

651
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,526
but Kurt and I were wondering
if there was any possibility

652
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:04,745
that we could maybe watch the
performance from the audience.

653
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:07,197
Absolutely not.

654
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:09,366
I'm sorry.

655
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,719
You're gonna be watching
from the wings with me.

656
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:14,755
It's the best seat
in the house.

657
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:15,973
Santana, you want to join us?

658
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,391
Oh, Santana
doesn't like ballet.

659
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,926
She's only here for the gown
and the swag-bag.

660
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:20,377
Oh, I don't believe that.

661
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:23,430
Every little girl,
no matter where she ends up...

662
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:24,815
even at Vogue.com...

663
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,401
starts out wanting to be
a ballerina.

664
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,403
Not Santana.
We've discussed it.

665
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:30,654
Kurt, can I just show you...

666
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,439
Shut up, Berry.

667
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,942
I actually did take
ballet classes.

668
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,326
My <i>abuela</i> put me in them

669
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,111
when I was little,

670
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:39,496
because I was such a tomboy

671
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:40,831
and it really pissed my dad off.

672
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:42,916
I only took a few
lessons, but...

673
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,669
it helped me, uh,
escape a little, you know?

674
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:48,005
It was the first time I danced.

675
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,075
I felt safe there, and...
not different.

676
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:54,744
And part of something...

677
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:57,097

I was born

But... when my father
came to pick my mother up

739
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:11,775
at the hospital, he said,

with my arms up like this.

747
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,900
And in my fantasy,
there was an Indian chief,

748
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:38,968
and he would say to me,

749

want to dance?"

00:34:29,073 --> 00:34:30,373

00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:35,545
It's your problem!

804
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:40,383
(sighs) Becky Jackson,

805
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,002
you can't insult

806
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:46,656
the sultry and mysterious
Coach Roz Washington.

807
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,041
She is

808
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,343
an African-American treasure.

809
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:54,598
I only misbehaved so she'd
send me here to talk to you.

810
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:56,850
Why didn't you just
come here yourself?

811
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:58,435
I didn't think of that.

812
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:04,224
Principal Figgins,
I need to tell you something.

813
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,869
(students cheering)

814
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:17,871
FIGGINS:
Citizens of McKinley,

815
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:20,290
the power has been restored.

816
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:22,542
Congratulations to all of us

817
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:25,262
for refusing to resort
to idol worship

818
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:27,697
and rampant cannibalism.

819
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:30,917
We have discovered
that the blackout occurred

820
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:32,769
when a Mylar balloon

821
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,438
congratulating
my secretary Donna

822
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:37,774
on her successful hysterectomy

823
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:40,227
became trapped in an outlet

824
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:43,380
behind her file cabinet.

825
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:47,317
McKinley Titans,
it is a new dawn.

826
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:51,938
Let us welcome a new era
of peace and prosperity.

827
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:55,108
Yours truly, Principal Figgins.

828
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:03,133
(beep, low whirring)

829
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,584
(school bell ringing)

830
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:07,304
JAKE:
Okay, let's flip some switches

831
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:08,672
and rock out, please.

832
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:09,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, guys.

833
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,091
Don't plug back in just yet.

834
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,475
There's one more thing

835
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,160
this power outage
can really drive home for us:

836
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:15,262
The power

837
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,963
of singing a capella.

838
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,265
I hate whistling.

839
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:20,100
Nothing but our voices
for this next number.

840
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:23,854
No other instruments
or bottles or tools or anything.

841
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:25,856
At the end of the day,
our voices

842
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:27,741
are the only instruments
that truly matter.

843
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,677
So make it count.

844
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:33,663
(school bell ringing)

845
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,482
(sighs)

846
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,853
Hey, son of Frankenteen.
I just started the Subway diet,

847
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:48,738
and it's time for my second
five-dollar foot-long.

848
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:50,190
Want to buy it for me?

849
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:51,858
Um...

850
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:53,193
I'm kidding.

851
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,778
Come on, I'll buy you a sub.

852
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,696
I have, like, 20 more
humiliating stories to tell you.

853
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,015
That sounds awesome,
but... I can't.

854
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,300
Kind of have a date.

855
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:01,351
With who?

856
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:03,920
Katie.
The catfish?

857
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:06,873
How can you pick an online
fantasy over an actual fantasy?

858
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,209
She's not a fantasy.
She's a projection.

859
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:10,460
She's whatever
you want her to be.

860
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:12,212
Why do you think
you get along so well?

861
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,631
You have no real intimacy
with this person.

862
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,549
Stop embarrassing yourself
and come have lunch with me.

863
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,435
Look, I get that
this seems a little kooky,

864
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,253
and part of me
really wants to go

865
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:22,055
with you right now,
but I'm sorry.

866
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:25,091
I don't warm to people
easily, and...

867
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,394
I was really starting
to like you.

868
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,762
Maybe after I find out
who Katie is

869
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,983
and we straighten all this out,
we could go out then.

870
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,767
I don't think so.

871
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:47,213
(school bell ringing)

872
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:52,978
(knocking, door opens)
I hope that...

873
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,149
You're late.

874
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,818
I like to make an entrance.

875
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,602
(chuckles): And if
we're really gonna talk

876
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,037
about late, can you say
something to Gramps right here?

877
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,038
Sit.

878
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,290
(whispers):
Excuse me.

879
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:06,158
This is NYADA Extension.

880
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,461
You sign up,
you pay, you get in.

881
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:10,129
Anyone.

882
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:12,114
And what I was going to say was

883
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:15,117
that I hope none of you
came here expecting

884
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,452
that it would help you
get into NYADA as a student.

885
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,472
Good. 'Cause the last thing
I want to do

886
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:22,457
is pay 30 grand a year to get
a degree for doing something

887
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:24,226
that I'm already
freakin' Wonder Woman at.

888
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,262
Then what are you doing here?

889
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,901
I love to dance.

890
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:33,819
I'm an artist, but...

891
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:37,039
I sort of lost touch
with that part of myself lately,

892
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:41,443
and so I'm here to...
do some reintroducing.

893
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:44,780
I can dig that.

894
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:47,482
Everybody up.

895
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,485
To the bar. Pliés, please.

896
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,654
Two demi, one grand,
port de bras forward.

897
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:55,674
(piano playing quietly)

898
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,645
Don't forget me again, okay?

899
00:40:17,697 --> 00:40:20,015
I won't.

900
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,567
I promise.

901
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,124
I've got you now.

902
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,360
