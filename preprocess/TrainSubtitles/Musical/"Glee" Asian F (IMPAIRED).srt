<i>So here's what you missed on
Glee: Emma's living with Will,</i>

2
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:04,673
<i>which has really been helping
her OCD, which is good, because</i>

3
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:06,925
<i>she's helping Artie and
Beiste direct West Side Story.</i>

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,894
<i>Rachel seems like a shoo-in for Maria,
and Kurt's running for class president</i>

5
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:11,263
<i>so he can get into NYADA. Thank
you in advance for your votes.</i>

6
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,899
<i>But Brittany quit as his campaign
manager so she can run, too.</i>

7
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:17,469
<i>I'm also a unicorn. And
th's what you missed on Glee!</i>

8
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,557
Five, six... ...seven, eight.

10
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,829
You're late.

11
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,698
I know. I overslept.

12
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,450
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

13
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:35,337
My alarm clock went off 30
minutes late this morning.

14
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:37,205
Kind of shifted my whole schedule.

15
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,874
Anyway, what's Santana doing here?

16
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:40,926
I've resworn my
allegiance to the Glee Club

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,011
without telling Coach Sue.

18
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,013
Mercedes, I'll catch you up.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,015
(piano vamping) Five, six, seven.

20
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,802
Five, six...

21
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,806
Mercedes, you okay? My stomach hurts.

22
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,309
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Why are you babying her?

23
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:59,311
I mean, she can't do
three steps without puking

24
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,362
'cause she ate at Quizno's

25
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,980
before she showed up in this joint.

26
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,149
Mr. Shue, you have us scheduled
to the second right now.

27
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,483
With school, Glee Club and Booty Camp,

28
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:06,935
when else am I supposed to eat?

29
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,954
When the rest of us
do. Oh, like you eat!

30
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,906
It's not about eating.
It's about attitude.

31
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:13,825
Sectionals are coming up, and
if we don't give it our all...

32
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,327
I am doing my best.

33
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,162
No, you're not.

34
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:18,547
It's not about doing your best anymore.

35
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,115
It's about doing better.

36
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:26,118

37
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:30,759
Morning, sunshine. Hey.

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,627
Do you want me to iron
some bacon for you?

39
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,764
Um, I was looking for a
fresh box of cornflakes,

40
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:37,816
and I found this

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,485
hidden way back in the pantry.

42
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,187
It's a stash of wedding magazines.

43
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,438
<i>Wedding, Inc.,</i>

44
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,274
<i>Modern Bridal, Marry Me Monthly...</i>

45
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,826
Oh, wow.

46
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,744
Terri must have had a massive
bridal magazine addiction.

47
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:52,414
And an autographed
headshot of Vera Wang.

48
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,916
"To Emma. Always Marry Up!"

49
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:57,085
Right, that's slightly
harder to explain away.

50
00:01:57,152 --> 00:02:01,039
Look, Emma, I'm not scared
of your inner bridezilla.

51
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,258
I mean, that's clearly
the road we're headed down,

52
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,628
and marriage is just one of...

53
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,879
several milestones I look

54
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,130
forward to sharing with you.

55
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,932
But because I don't like secrets,

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,719
I thought I'd share my
secret stash with you.

57
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,471
I was a bachelor for over a year.

58
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:17,806
Kept me off of Craig's List.

59
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:20,275
Okay, we'll just put that over here.

60
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,360
But Emma, I have to ask you a question:

61
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:24,946
if you're serious about you and me...

62
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,314
why haven't I met your parents?

63
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:29,117
Be-because, um, they're dead.

64
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,652
You spoke to them on
the phone last night.

65
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,020
I spoke to their ghosts last night.

66
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,121
I have ghost parents.

67
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:35,573
Okay, can't lie to you. Um...

68
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,493
I-I-I just want to
take it really slowly.

69
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,029
You know, I don't want to rush things.

70
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,464
And-And I feel like meeting

71
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:46,200
my parents right now
would be a bad idea.

72
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,673
(school bell rings)

73
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:54,309
I must say Mr. Mike Chang
Sr., this is highly unusual.

74
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:58,179
I have no grounds to drug
test your son every day.

75
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,381
My grandmother in China
knew three English phrases:

76
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:04,235
"Coca-Cola," "Kiss My Grits"
and "Harvard University."

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,488
Deep in Hubei Province
this old woman knew

78
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,590
the best school in the United States.

79
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,891
That's where my son belongs.

80
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,861
But what makes you think he's on drugs?

81
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,195
He's one of our best students,

82
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,865
a football star, and he
can bust a serious move.

83
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,118
My son got an A-minus
on his chemistry test.

84
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,454
An A-minus is an Asian F.

85
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:25,840
Mr. Chang Sr., I don't want
to get in your business,

86
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,626
as they say, but don't you
think perhaps you're putting

87
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,628
too much pressure on Mike Chang Jr.?

88
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,048
An A-minus won't do.

89
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:33,882
It's the girlfriend.

90
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,784
She's a distraction.

91
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:40,105
Here's where we agree, sir.

92
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,108
Tina Cohen-Chang and her
vampire ways have no place

93
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,359
in this school.

94
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,765
(hisses) (gasps)

95
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,400
Excuse me from gym all year

96
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,703
or I'll drain your spicy
curry blood. (hisses)

97
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,407
It's clear to me that
either Michael is on drugs

98
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,776
or that he's bitten off
more than he can chew.

99
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,079
He needs to quit Glee Club.

100
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,714
Performing is a waste of his time. What?

101
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,248
(whispers): The consultant
we hired said that

102
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,250
it was meaningless on your transcript.

103
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,086
In fact, he said it was a detriment.

104
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,555
I'll do better, Dad. I promise.

105
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:16,007
Get me a chemistry tutor.
I'll pay for it myself.

106
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,526
Just give me one more chance.

107
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:19,844

112
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,823
Number two: the entire
wrestling team has come down

113
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,742
with a flesh-eating staph infection

114
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,910
so, fellas, wash yourselves,

115
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,646
and that includes your bat
caves and your bramble patches.

Number three: Tinsley,

117

Puckerman, Azimio, show me your moves.

118
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,120

Coach, no disrespect, but
my dad, he didn't raise me

124
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,997
In fact, my dad, he
didn't even raise me.

125
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,683

How are we supposed to
learn to dance by Wednesday?

130
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,696

Baby, what was that? What?

133
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,035
You just hugged your arch-nemesis
right before the audition.

134
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,537
You think before I cleat
some dude I hug him?

135
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,973
You think Wonder Woman hugs the
Cheeta before the Amazonian smackdown?

136
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,209
It's not like that.
Rachel and I are friends.

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,394
Not right now you're not.
This is winner-takes-all.

need to be playing that part.

Don't be going crazy now on me, Shane.

140

People are saying that Rachel
Berry's the one to beat.

Why don't you know that

Really. You're so...

194
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,276
Glamorous. Glamorous.

195
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,545
Well, I just wanted you guys to see me

196
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:50,164
the way that I see myself
now: as a leading lady.

197
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,666
Well, it was wonderful. Beautiful.

198
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,566
ARTIE: So good.

199
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,601

200
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,589
I'm so proud of you.

(bell ringing)

202
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,639
Ready for song practice?
Your audition is tomorrow.

203
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:18,092
I'm not auditioning. What
are you talking about?

204
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,644
We've been practicing
your singing every day!

205
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:22,230
This is your chance to
break out and show everybody

206
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,731
that you're more than just
a fleet-footed dance ninja.

207
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:26,034
Riff is perfect for you.

208
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,120
He sings, he dances, he dies.
It's the second male lead, Mike.

209
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:30,771
I'm overwhelmed and losing focus.

210
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:35,076
Football, Glee Club, Booty Camp
so we're ready for Sectionals.

211
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,610
I got an A-minus, Tina.

212
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,912
You got an Asian F?

213
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,247
My dad is all over me.

214
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,498
You shouldn't have to hide your dreams.

215
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,632
Just be honest with him.

216
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,584
Oh, like how you were so honest

217
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:44,986
about pretending to
stutter all that time?

218
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,337
Point taken.

219
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,292
(bell ringing)

220
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,677
With only two days left

221
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:53,895
for people to announce their candidacy,

222
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,096
that leaves me and Brittany

223
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,681
running in this race.

224
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,516
Which is more like me
running, and you know,

225
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,234
Brittany just whimsically
hopping and skipping nearby.

226
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,352
No one takes her seriously.

227
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:02,854
That's so amazing, Kurt.

228
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,022
I mean, you can
practically add the moniker

229
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:08,142
of "President" to your curriculum
vitae now. NYADA is gonna eat that up.

230
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,144
According to the new Jacob
Ben Israel straw poll--

231
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,613
here, take one take one, take... Okay.

232
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:14,815
Um, according to the soft numbers,

233
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,817
I'm ahead by Brit by 11%. Really?

234
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,454
This could be a cakewalk.
SANTANA: Nice blouse, Hummel.

235
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:21,372
Really brings out the
color of your pink eye.

236
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:24,509
So, I assume I can rely on your
vote, Rachel. I'm sorry, Brittany,

237
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,043
but I've already pledged
my fidelity to Kurt.

238
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,880
Oh, so you're cool with flushing
McKinley High's future down

239
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,382
the magical poop-stealing water
chair? Did you know that in six years

240
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,051
at this school, we've only exclusively
had male student council presidents?

241
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:36,437
And yeah, Kurt looks like
Jimmy Fallon's butch daughter,

242
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,306
but a vote for him would only empower

243
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,141
yet another frank and beans.

244
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,893
Yes. Where has that
patriarchy gotten us?

245
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,011
Double-digit inflation,
economic freefall,

246
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,030
oil spills, war in Afghanistan.

247
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,866
I tweeted about Brit's flash
mob pep rally in the gym,

248
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,152
and we're all showing up to
support her with girl power.

249
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,371
Yes, boys have made one
helluva mess in this school,

250
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,407
and there's only one way to clean it up.

00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,206
Mercedes.

315
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,791
I thought Berry had it in the bag,

316
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,743
and then Stealth-Attack Jones came in

317
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,628
and just pancaked me emotionally.

318
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,298
Yeah. I mean, right before our
eyes, Mercedes just transformed.

319
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,533
She had a new maturity, there was

320
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,168
a confidence I've never seen before.

321
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,337
Her performance was so truthful.

322
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,638
I think our little girl's

323
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,090
all grown up.

324
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,426
Wow. I'm so happy to hear that.

325
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,644
I don't know what you're doing,
Schuester, but it's working.

326
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,898
Well, I have been pushing
her pretty hard in Booty Camp.

327
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:51,266
Good. Good for Mercedes.

328
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,268
Yes, but very hard for us.

329
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:54,269
(laughter)

330
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:56,354
I mean, Rachel is Maria.

331
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,388
Isn't she? Yes.

332
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,523
On the other hand,

333
00:13:58,574 --> 00:13:59,524
Mercedes is...

334
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,409
Is the riskier choice, no doubt.

335
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,828
And she might even be
the more exciting one.

336
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,947
It's just too close to call.

337
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:09,334
Well, you know what
you need to do, then.

338
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,753
Let me get this straight.
You can't make up your minds,

339
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,204
so we have to try out again?

340
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,539
In the biz, it's called a callback.

341
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,040
With such an iconic role as Maria,

342
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,592
it can't appear as if they're
just giving me the part.

343
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,294
We'd like you both to come back

344
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,295
on Thursday for

345
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,679
the ultimate Maria-off.

346
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,247
Done. I can't speak for Mercedes,

347
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:26,250
but I'll be singing the timeless
Maria classic "I Feel Pretty."

348
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:27,719
Actually, that's too easy, Rachel.

349
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,888
We've picked a song that
we think has the potential

350
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,306
to show off both of your talents,

351
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,090
in unexpected ways.

352
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,926
"Out Here On My Own" from the seminal

353
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:35,927
<i>behind-the-scenes
musical Fame.</i>

354
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,629
I know it. I lived it.

355
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:38,646
(school bell ringing)

356
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,098
Mercedes!

357
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,319
Look, in the spirit of Broadway
camaraderie, I'd like to

358
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,271
offer you a hug to congratulate
you on your callback.

359
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,107
You know what, Rachel?

360
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,210
Hug me after I get the part.

361
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,050
(school bell ringing)

362
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:02,337
I'm leaving right now to go meet
the Chem tutor at The Lima Bean.

363
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,973
I promise I'll bring my grade up.

364
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:08,176
And, Dad, I'm so sorry
for disappointing you.

365
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:41,876
(grunts)

366
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,801
(panting)

367
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,116
Michael.

368
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,235
We've worked so hard
to get to where we are.

369
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,672
And this, this is how
you waste your time?

370
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,774
Dancing is something
you do at a wedding.

371
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,459
It's a hobby, not a career.

372
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,377
(echoing): There's no future in it.

373
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,299
What happens if you hurt yourself?

374
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,469
You're one injury away
from having nothing.

375
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,337
You will not waste your life.

376
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,348
TINA: So beautiful.

377
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:44,022
You don't talk that much,
you hardly ever sing,

378
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:49,393
but when I see you do
that, it's who you are.

379
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:53,114
It's what makes me feel you.

380
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,751
Mike, you got to know by
now, when I see you dance...

381
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:00,638
...it's why I fell in love with you.

382
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:24,646
ARTIE: Mike Chang?

383
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,484
The kid's never late.

384
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:30,952
He runs like an expensive Swiss watch

385
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,053
reproduced cheaply in China.

386
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,159
Okay, next.

387
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,496
Uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

388
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,414
I'm here to audition for Riff.

389
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:46,384
Uh, Mike, you know that's not
just a dancing part, right?

390
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,087
I do, yes.

391
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,621
I've been working on my singing.

392
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,507
Okay.

393
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,259

ARTIE: Yeah! Wow!

422
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:02,270
BEISTE: Wow, Chang, you must have worked

423
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,688
really closely with my boys there.

424
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,523
That was some really fancy footwork.

425
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,091
I just hope you didn't waste

426
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:08,425
too much of your time.

427
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,594
It's what I love to do.

428
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,830
It's never going to
be a waste of my time.

429
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,366
Good job.

430
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:19,536
+

431
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,985
So no girls have tried out

432
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,486
for your fancy new rogue singing club?

433
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:24,537
Why do you think that is?

434
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,406
Mmm.

435
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,575
Singing's just musical talking.

436
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,326
Well, I guess if I was
a girl in this school,

437
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,412
and I wanted to be in a singing
group, I'd be in New Directions.

438
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,830
Mm-hmm.

439
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,219
Enjoy your enormous bowl
of disgusting creamy pasta.

440
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:40,420
Mm-hmm.

441
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:41,671
Hey, Will.

442
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:44,707
Hey.

443
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,842
What, no chicken?

444
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:49,062
Mm, I'm carbo
- loading, Will.

445
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,181
I got to keep my strength up.

446
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:53,183
I got football, I'm running
the student council elections,

447
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,318
and you got me doing that musical.

448
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,653
Thank God for Emma.

449
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,404
She's a hard worker.

450
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,939
You should be really proud of her.

451
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,108
Yeah, well, I just wish
she was more proud of me.

452
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,276
Mm, come on.

453
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,862
I mean, I know I'm not
a dentist like Carl.

454
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,731
I don't make $80,000 a year.

455
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,784
Punkin, what the hell
are you talking about?

456
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,535
That girl is crazy about you.

457
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,671
She hasn't introduced me to her parents.

458
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,339
Well, introduce yourself!

459
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:18,174
You're a catch, Will.

460
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,543
You got nothing to be nervous about.

461
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,679
You're everything a future
in-law could ask for.

462
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,547
You think so?

463
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,716
You bet your sweet bippy.

464
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,768
Did you know Breadstix delivers?

465
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,586
That's awesome.

466
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,110
The cast list goes up on Friday.

467
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,361
Are you nervous?

468
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,596
A little. I'm trying
not to think about it.

469
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:42,315
I wouldn't be. My mole
in the casting office

470
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,783
says that there's only one actor

471
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,201
they're seriously considering
for the role of Tony,

472
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,620
and his initials are B.A.

473
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:54,127
Kurt, they're beautiful.

474
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:55,945
But what are they for?

475
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,130
You killed your audition, Blaine.

476
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:58,548
If anyone else got Tony,

477
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,416
including me, the Wrath of Sondheim

478
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,718
would fall upon William McKinley

479
00:22:01,785 --> 00:22:04,504
like a plague of Shubert Alley locusts.

480
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:08,007
These are to celebrate... you.

481
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:12,095
You always zig when I
think you're about to zag,

482
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:15,648
and I... I just...
I love that about you.

483
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:19,819
Thank you.

484
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,021
(whispers): Right.

485
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:29,445
Okay, so, before we dive
into today's Booty Camp,

486
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:31,614
I just want to say how
impressed Mike and I have been

487
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:34,534
with everyone's progress. Uh...

488
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:36,169
Brittany, why are you here?

489
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,453
'Cause I intend on, you know,

490
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:39,172
dancing my way into the voters' hearts.

491
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,341
Okay.

492
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,793
All right... everyone up!

493
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:46,262
Now, your homework assignment
was "The Widow Maker,"

494
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,882
perhaps the hardest show
choir dance move ever.

495
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:52,268
Now, when you get it right,
one of us is gonna tap you out,

496
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,269
then you can have a seat.

497
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,971
Uh, five, six, seven, eight!

498
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:57,523
(piano music begins)

499
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:59,058
(speaking indistinctly)

500
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:01,728
Okay.

501
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:06,366
(talking quietly)

502
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,617
You have it. Yeah.

503
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:10,453
MIKE: Come on,
Mercedes-- down, open.

504
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,989
Come on, Finn, you can
do it! No, he can't.

505
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

506
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,875
Come on, Mercedes.

507
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:18,795
Good job, buddy.

508
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:19,629
MIKE: Down... open...

509
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,547
Come on, Mercedes, down...

510
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,384
open... up...

511
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,752
My ankle hurts. Push through it.

512
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,220
I don't feel good. You're fine.

513
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:29,422
No, I'm not!

514
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,842
Look, Mercedes, I want you to
be the best you can be, okay?

515
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:34,260
Did you even practice this?

516
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:35,979
Stop picking on me!

517
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,314
You're always singling me
out, making me look bad!

518
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:39,882
That's crazy. No, you're crazy

519
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,317
for not letting me shine!

520
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,735
Where's Rachel, huh?

521
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,071
I don't see her here,
being a part of the "team."

522
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,105
Rachel practices every night.

523
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,991
No one asked you, Finn.

524
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,075
Everyone knows that
Rachel is your favorite.

525
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,493
That's not true.

526
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,744
No, it's true-- you
give that skinny,

But not anymore!

530
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm done!

531
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,672
You know, I've outgrown you.

532
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,957
I've outgrown all of you.

533
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:07,760

Mom, please don't cry.

625
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,105
Michael,

626
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:58,741
my job is to encourage
you to live your dreams,

627
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:02,061
not mine, not your dad's.

628
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:03,395
I was raised a certain way,

629
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,081
and my parents had expectations of me

630
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:08,584
and I simply was not
as courageous as my son.

631
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:11,037
I let go of my dreams but

632
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,873
I never want you to do that.

633
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,508
Do you hear me?

634
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:16,675
So...

635
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,344
do you know if we earned that part

636
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,295
in the school musical yet?

637
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,133
Well, when you do, we're going
to tell your father about it.

638
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:26,619
Together.

639
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,018
So what dream did you let go of?

640
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,990
Like you, I loved dancing.

641
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:51,460
<i>But your waigong never
let me take lessons.</i>

642
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,965
Some people think I'm
a pretty good teacher.

643
00:28:59,086 --> 00:28:59,969
Okay...

644
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:07,459

646
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,452
Rachel, focus.

647
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,453
You want this more than she does.

648
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,487
I do.

649
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,956
You've earned this.

650
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,374
The part's already yours.

651
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,259
It's been waiting for you,
Mercedes; just take it.

652
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:41,193
I will.

653
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:45,865
Rachel Berry? Mercedes Jones?

654
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:48,167
Go get it, baby.

655
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,691
Ladies...

656
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,526
you're both wonderful.

657
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:00,112
<i>Screw West Side Story,
this is Clash of the Titans.</i>

658
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,614

people are going to be

659
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,482
talking about this face-off
for the rest of our lives.

660
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,366
Heads or tails? Heads. Tails.

661
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:07,519
Heads. Yes!

662
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,654
Rachel?

663
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,522
Mercedes can go first.

664
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:11,540
Okay.

707

Coach Beiste, I have something
very important we need to discuss.

708
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:53,035
+

709
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:11,828
What is this? Are we having
a romantic dinner? Sort of.

710
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,329
I invited your parents over.

711
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,666
Is that my little freaky-deaky?

712
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,802
Okay. I'm gonna say hi in one minute.

713
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,222
One minute, one minute.
Oh, God, oh my God.

714
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,557
Why would you do this? I
wanted to meet your parents,

715
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,626
so I thought I'd take
the bull by the horns.

716
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:29,729
Right, it's okay, because maybe,
maybe we can get them to leave.

717
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,732
I will pretend like, um,
an ovarian cyst burst.

718
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,267
Works every time. Emma,
what is going on here?

719
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,186
Are you ashamed of me?

720
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,188
No.

721
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,306
I'm ashamed of them.

722
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,808
What? Why?

723
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,694
My parents are ginger supremacists.

724
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:47,280
We're not ginger supremacists.

725
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,882
We're more ginger preservationists.

726
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:50,450
We don't hate anybody.

727
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:53,820
We just prefer the company of
other redheads, which is why we

728
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:55,988
enjoy the Red Oaks so
much. What's the Red Oaks?

729
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,874
It's a gingers-only country club.

730
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,926
It's really the only place
I feel I can be myself

731
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,294
and let my auburn hair down.

732
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:03,596
Did you know that if we're not careful,

733
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,049
redheads will be extinct
in 30 years? Extinct?

734
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:09,269
It's a recessive gene. If
we keep heading down the road

735
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:12,722
we're on, with everybody
just mixing with everybody,

736
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:15,642
we gingers will cease
to exist as a species.

737
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:18,895
Not really a separate species. Which is why
I'd really love to hear about your heritage.

738
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:21,397
I have to say, your
hair's a little wooly

739
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,567
for my taste, but those
beautiful blue eyes

740
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:26,519
are a very good sign. Now
Schuester is German, right?

741
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,154
I-I think so.

742
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,455
You're practically a Viking.

743
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,207
Hey. Well, that's a relief.

744
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,209
There's got to be some red
hair in that family tree.

745
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:35,662
Yeah, not like that Carl.

746
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:38,414
Oops. Looks like freaky-deaky's

747
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,200

case of the cleanies.

748
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:44,003
Don't bother trying to stop
her once she starts, Will.

749
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:46,472
We used to tie her thumbs
together, and she'd chew

750
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,508
right through the twine. Adorable.

751
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,394
I think it's weird. I
don't know where she got it.

752
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:54,981
Oh, I'm sorry, Amigo.

753
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,250
You're not our regular waitress.

754
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:58,935
RUSTY: Cindy! ROSE: You
can't be too careful.

755
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:07,660
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be rude, but has anyone

756
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:08,945
ever told you that you're
both a little racist?

757
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,730
I'm sorry?

758
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:12,832
Excuse me, it's not racist
to be proud of the heritage

759
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,901
that you're trying to preserve, Will.

760
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:17,236
Well, maybe it isn't. But all
I know is that if Emma and I

761
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,955
were blessed enough to have a child,

762
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,574
I wouldn't care what he or she
looked like. And you know what?

763
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,527
If my child had OCD, I'd maybe
try to show a little compassion

764
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:26,913
instead of calling her a
name that makes her feel

765
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:28,665
like a freak.

766
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,020
These beans are a disaster.

767
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,589
RUSTY: These beans are what
happens when you sit out

768
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,692
an election, Rose. There
wasn't a ginger candidate.

769
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,777
(school bell rings)

770
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:44,113
I think we should talk, don't you?

771
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:46,933
About the, um, upcoming deadline
for the NYADA applications?

772
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:50,036
About you telling Coach Beiste that
you're running for senior class president.

773
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:53,039
Against me. Kurt, you
saw Mercedes, okay?

774
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,275
I'm not gonna get the part.
So I figured, if I win,

775
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,779
I'll make you vice president, and then
maybe you could just do vice-versa.

776
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,050
Rachel, if you win, yes, it'll better
your chances of getting into NYADA, yes.

777
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:07,420
But if I win, it could make a
huge difference at this school.

778
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,256
Not just for me, but kids like me.

779
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:12,308
Things could actually change for them.

780
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:16,095
So, whatever it takes, I'm winning.

781
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:18,314
Look, I just... I need
something for my senior year

782
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,100
that's gonna make me special,
that's gonna make me stand out.

783
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,152
I thought Maria was gonna
be that. You understand.

784
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,488
You're just as ambitious as I
am; that's why we're friends.

785
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:28,307
Rachel, in ten years, when
you look back on this time,

786
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,743
you're not gonna be thinking
about the clubs you belonged to

787
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,328
or the parts you had.

788
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,864
You'll be thinking about
the friends you had and...

789
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:37,300
and the ones you just tossed aside.

790
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:41,541
+

791
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,768
Please don't tell us that
we have to try out again.

792
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,654
No, we've come to a decision.

793
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,722
It was one of the hardest
decisions of my life,

794
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,358
and that includes when I had to sell

795
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,793
one of my two prize
donkeys to pay my gas bill.

796
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,495
I sold Kim, but I kept Khloe.

797
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:59,532
So, um, in the grand tradition
of the Special Olympics...

798
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,502
everybody wins. We're
double-casting Maria.

799
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,587
What the hell is "double-casting?"

800
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,589
It means that we'll
both get to play Maria.

801
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:09,175
You'll get your well-deserved
standing ovations

802
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,960
on Saturday matinees and
Sunday mornings for the Retired

803
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,430
Lima War Veterans, and I'll do
all the evening performances.

804
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,748
Actually, Rachel, we're adding a week.

805
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,084
You'll both get four
nights and two matinees.

806
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,186
Fair enough.

807
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:23,306
Mercedes, it'll be a pleasure
sharing the spotlight with you.

808
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,309
Are you double-casting any other roles?

809
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,310
No. Just... No. No.

810
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,529
Thank you for your time.

811
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,114
Where are you going?

812
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:33,533
Tell me you were better than me.

813
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,236
Tell me.

814
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,155
(stammers) Why is it that no one
ever wants to hurt her feelings?

815
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,774
You know, it's always been "The
Rachel Berry Show" around here.

816
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,110
But it's not gonna be for
me. No, not my senior year.

817
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,745
Mercedes, don't make
this a stupid pride thing.

818
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,448
Oh, it's a pride thing.
But it's not stupid.

819
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:52,051
Congratulations. You got the part.

820
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,186
I don't want it.

821
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,726
(school bell rings)

822
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,644
I got it.

823
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,397
I got it, like, by default.

824
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,699
They double-cast us, and
then Mercedes turned it down.

825
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:10,236
So... cool. You're gonna... you're
gonna be withdrawing from the race, then.

826
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:12,906
Look, Finn, when Brittany sang
that song about girls changing

827
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:14,941
the world, it got me
thinking, you know maybe...

828
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,994
maybe I can change the world.
By being Student Class President?

829
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,946
Look, make fun of it all
you want, but you need

830
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,981
to start thinking
about your future, too.

831
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:26,319
Oh, did you talk to
Kurt about the election?

832
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,954
Yeah.

833
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,924
He asked me who I was voting for.

834
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:32,876
What did you say?

835
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,295
I said I didn't know.

836
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,354
Emma.

837
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,706
Son of a biscuit. I've lost count again.

838
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,995
(whispers): One.

839
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,030
Two...

840
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,550
Three... I'm so sorry.

841
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,503
I should've believed you when you told me
you didn't want me to meet your parents.

842
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,171
I didn't get it.

843
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,422
Emma, stop.

844
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,407
Please.

845
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:24,978
Come on, let's go to bed.

846
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,714
Wh-What are you doing?

847
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm praying.

848
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,138
I do it all the time in my head,

849
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,906
but right now, it's just not enough.

850
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:41,661
And when I need help, I know
God hears me better on my knees.

851
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,731
Something about the acoustics
of the linoleum or something.

852
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:46,866
(sighs)

853
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,236
I wish I could make
things better for you, I...

854
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,171
I just don't know how.

855
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,551
I don't have any clue what
I'm doing down here... (laughs)

856
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,554
But I'm willing to learn.

Ms. Corcoran, I hear
you're starting a new group.

880
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:12,078
You're going to need some
star power, so here I am.
