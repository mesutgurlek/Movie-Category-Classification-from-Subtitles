1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,616
Thanks for waiting,
Miss Pierce.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,217
Please, just call me Brittany.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:05,202
Brittany,

4
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,370
this is Dr. Leonard Hauptman.

5
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,289
I am Dr. Donald Langdon,

6
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:12,125
the dean of the mathematics
department here at MIT.

7
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,960
Brittany,

8
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,463
when MIT heard about your
near-perfect SAT score,

9
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:17,964
we were a little skeptical.

10
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,299
A 0.2 grade point

11
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,169
is practically unheard of.

12
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:24,871
That means you've
never gotten higher

13
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:25,906
than a D-minus.

14
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,390
Is that why I had to take

15
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,642
that math test this morning?

16
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:33,012
We needed to see for ourselves

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,232
if you were MIT material.

18
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,233
And how did I do?

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,567
You scored a zero.

20
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,903
Brittany, you lack
a basic understanding

21
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:41,755
of even the simplest arithmetic,

22
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,406
and I don't know why
you couldn't have used

23
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:45,024
a number-two pencil,
like we asked.

24
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,661
Filling out the ovals in crayon

25
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,212
broke our Scantron machine.

26
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,164
I'm sorry.
However,

27
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,336
we would like to ask you
about these numbers

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,338
that you scribbled
on the back of your test.

29
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,673
Yeah.

30
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,007
I don't know.

31
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,559
I didn't know any of the answers
on the test, so...

32
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:05,228
I had all these numbers swirling
around in my head,

33
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,397
so I just decided
to write them all down

34
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,099
so my brain would stop
feeling so tickly.

35
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,236
Jill.

36
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:19,192
Brittany, this is no ordinary
series of numbers.

37
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,528
When you start
in the upper left-hand corner

38
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:23,079
and read it from left to right,

39
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,080
it's a prime number.

40
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:25,248
Okay.

41
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:26,733
Normally you'd need
a supercomputer

42
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,201
to find a prime number
that large.

43
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,537
Totes.
But when you start

44
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,622
from the upper right
and read it from right to left,

45
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,457
you get Avogadro's constant.

46
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:36,376
Sweet.
But that's not even

47
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,544
the most amazing part.

48
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:39,462
When you start
in the lower left-hand corner

49
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,631
and read the number
counterclockwise,

50
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:43,550
you get Planck's constant,

51
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,769
which is the fundamental unit

52
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:49,306
of measurement
in quantum mechanics.

53
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,057
We-we don't even know
what it means.

54
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,392
We believe

55
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:55,562
that what we are now calling
the Brittany Code...

56
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,563
The Brittany Code.

57
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:57,614
...will go
down in history

58
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,232
as the most important

59
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,951
scientific breakthrough
of the 21st century.

60
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,453
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,788
That is...

62
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:06,606
totally a-amazing.

63
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,575
I thought you were gonna tell me
that I was an idiot,

64
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,293
and that's bullying,
and I won't tolerate that.

65
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,617
Brittany, it's possible
that you may be

66
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:21,421
the most brilliant scientific
mind since Albert Einstein.

67
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,006
No way.

68
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:24,841
And that is why

69
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,977
we here at MIT

70
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:31,264
would like to present to you

71
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,149
a very unusual proposition.

82
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:02,962
It's finally here.

83
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,130
Regionals.

84
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,348
(cheering)

85
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:06,800
Yeah!
That's right!

86
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,184
WILL:
I just found out,

87
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,203
because of safety concerns
related to

88
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,872
late-season tornados,
Indianapolis has declined

89
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:13,973
to host the competition.

90
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,959
So! As defending champions,

91
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,627
we're having regionals here,

92
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,628
in our auditorium.

93
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:19,712
Did you hear that?
Yes!

94
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:21,965
Home court advantage,
yo! (Whoops)

95
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,084
Now, because of
a sexting scandal

96
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,468
at Our Lady of Perpetual
Loneliness,

97
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,637
their glee club,
the Nun-touchables,

98
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,556
has been excommunicated
by the new pope.

99
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,557
(murmuring)
They've been replaced

100
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,641
by the world-famous

101
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,393
boys of Ziegler Prep,

102
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,727
the Waffle-toots.

103
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:36,646
Like cake farts?
They're very good.

104
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,731
The Hoosierdaddies are still
the odds-on favorite.

105
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,767
I mean, their lead vocalist,
Frida Romero,

106
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,986
is a tiny juggernaut of talent.

107
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,939
We are in for
the fight of our lives.

108
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:48,908
So... let's get real.

109
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,844
<i>There comes a moment</i>
<i>in every performer's life</i>

110
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,529
<i>that defines him or her,</i>

111
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,581
<i>sometimes for</i>
<i>the rest of their career.</i>

112
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,416
This is our moment.

113
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,751
We've struggled, we've endured,

114
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,621
and now we must triumph.

115
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,956
<i>And speaking of that,</i>

116
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,175
<i>I want us all</i>
<i>to just take a moment</i>

117
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,876
<i>to send some positive energy</i>

118
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,261
<i>to one of our very own.</i>

119
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,164
She has her final callback
for <i>Funny Girl</i> today.

120
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,350
Rachel Berry.

121
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,469
We're ready for you.

122
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,771
WILL: <i>So, let's all give a big</i>
<i>round of applause to Rachel,</i>

123
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:20,190
<i>wherever she is.</i>

124
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,859

Hi, I'm Rachel Berry,

126
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,696
and I'll be auditioning for
the role of Fanny Brice today,

127
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,881
and I'll be singing.

128
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,483

We'll let you know.

so it-it has to be perfect.

you know, special.

00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,159
Are you actually talking
about a marriage proposal?

168
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,161
Dude, we're in high school.

169
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,495
You're not ready
to get married,

170
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:30,630
and I'm not letting you.

171
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,298
Well, I'm not asking
for your permission.

172
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,666
I'm already gonna do it.

173
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,802
What I'm asking for is your
help about how to do this.

174
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,053
From my best friend.

175
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,221
Okay.

176
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,672
Then, as your best friend,
I need to remind you

177
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,591
that just a few weeks ago,
you were totally confused.

178
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,309
You didn't even know where
Kurt stood with this Adam guy.

179
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:45,311
Well, I don't remember
you being

180
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,847
this introspective when you were
asking Brittany to marry you.

181
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:51,067
One, I don't even know
what that means, and two,

182
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,268
we thought the world
was ending.

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,736
And when we realized
it wasn't...

184
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:54,904
I regretted it.

185
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,189
Will you listen to yourself?

186
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,241
You sound exactly like
the rest of the world,

187
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,525
saying that
"it's not time yet."

188
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,943
Well, you know what?

189
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,412
People like me
have been hearing that

190
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:04,247
for hundreds and
hundreds of years.

191
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,581
This is happening.

192
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,750
I am gonna ask Kurt
to marry me.

193
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,253
And not only are you
one of my best friends,

194
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:12,922
but I was kind of hoping
that you would be my best man.

195
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,375
So let me know if you,
uh, change your mind.

196
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,380
You know what? Someone has to do the
right thing here. Marley, stop...

197
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:21,547
(whispers indistinctly) Jake...

198
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,883
...six, seven, eight, nine...

199
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,601
Uh, are, are Joe and Sugar here?

200
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,271
Present, Mr. Shue.
(kids cheer)

201
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,056
WILL:
Come on.

202
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,691
Sugar!
Great. Okay.

203
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,227
Guys, I have finalized
our set list.

204
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,279
We are going with "I Love It"
by Icona Pop...

205
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,647
GIRL: I love it!
Yes.

206
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,449
"Hall of Fame" by The Script
and will. I.am.

207
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:40,700
(kids cheer)

208
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,486
And Marley's original song
"All or Nothing."

209
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,288
(overlapping chatter)

210
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,657
Hey, Mr. Shue, what
about <i>my</i> original song?

211
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,658
Do you remember?

212
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,243
♪ My cup, my cup

213
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:51,711
♪ Sayin' "What's up?"

214
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,129
♪ To my cup, my cup

215
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,131
♪ More of a friend...
"My Cup" is one of a kind,

216
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,549
but we're going
with Marley's song.

217
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,301
Oh, come on, boo.

218
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,469
Two thumbs down.

219
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,304
The only way to polish
that turd of a song

220
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:03,055
is with my angelic alto voice.
Whoa.

221
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,142
So I demand to sing it
as a solo.

222
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:09,896
And I demand to sing all
the good songs as solos.

223
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,681
Everyone can snap their fingers

224
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,015
and march around behind me.

225
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,984
Tina, please make
an exact replica

226
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,602
of Jennifer Lawrence's
Oscar dress.

227
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:17,603
Um, no.

228
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:18,938
Um... yes.

229
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,273
Let me break it down.

230
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,741
No one in this musty choir room

231
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:24,327
compares to my megawatt
star power.

232
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,162
Blaine, you're shorter
than your average lawn gnome.

233
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,914
Joe, you look like
a Yucatán spider monkey.

234
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:30,249
Tina is... you know,
she's... Tina.

235
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,250
Wait, baby.
Baby, I love you,

236
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,502
but you're really
out of line, here.

237
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:33,669
And would you stop texting?

238
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,954
I'm trying to talk to you,
it's really rude.

239
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:35,988
(phone rings)

240
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,759
Did you seriously
just break up with me?

241
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:40,793
By a text?

242
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,628
Yeah.
As fascinated as I am

243
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,347
by your down-filled,
pillow-soft lips

244
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:46,349
that are ten times
too big for your face,

245
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,017
I really miss my sweet,
sweet lady kisses.

246
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,852
Sorry/not sorry.

247
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,138
Moving on, I repeat:

248
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,023
I require all the solos.

249
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,058
That's just the way
it's gonna be.

250
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,644
Brittany, why are
you doing this?

251
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,897
Well, I'm just living
your lesson, Mr. Shue.

252
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,148
It's all or nothing.

253
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,834
All or nothing!
(sighs)

254
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,398
(knocking) Come in!

255
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:11,900
(knocking)

256
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,435
I said, come in.
(pounding)

257
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,405
What the hell are you doing?

258
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,707
I'm nailing my 95 theses
to the door.

259
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,242
Your 95 what?

260
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,544
They're 95 reasons
why I'm quitting the Cheerios!

261
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,664
"Number one. It is true
that members of the Cheerios!

262
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,416
"received illegal salaries
and kickbacks.

263
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,252
"Last year alone,
I earned $5,000.

264
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,504
Number two..."
I can read them myself

265
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,006
without you reading them to me
like I'm some idiot.

266
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,724
"Number three."

267
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,394
Last year Sue Sylvester locked
seven Cheerios! In a...

268
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,812
"dog crate in order
to potty-train them."

269
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,563
What are you doing?

270
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,732
I soaked my uniform
in lighter fluid overnight,

271
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,485
and will now solemnize
my departure from the Cheerios!

272
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,772
By lighting it on fire.

273
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,240
(screams) Lord Jesus!

274
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,692
This fool done tried
to set my hair on fire!

275
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,912
Okay, guys, listen up.

276
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,114
Uh, first up, we're gonna tackle Icona Pop.
(phone buzzes)

277
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,667
It's got a unique beat,
but not entire different from...

278
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,168
All right, look.
I'm-I'm sorry.

279
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,753
Excuse me, Mr. Shue,
but I've got to say something.

280
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:05,587
Okay.

281
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,674
(sighs)

282
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,843
Look, so I hate
to pull a Brittany here,

283
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,095
but the bottom line is,
I'm not performing in regionals

284
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,097
until Catfish reveals
themselves.

285
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,800
This whole situation is out
of hand and needs to end.

286
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,519
Hey, look, I'm serious, okay?

287
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,439
I can't take it anymore,
it-it's tearing me apart.

288
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,025
And someone in this room
is playing games with me,

289
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,027
and I want to know who!

290
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,895
Somebody, just say who it is.
I don't think it's any of us.

291
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,481
Pull out your phones! Everybody
pull out your phones right now!

292
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:33,732
Ryder, relax, man.
Dude.

293
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,234
I know this is upsetting, but...

294
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,535
Well, now nobody
is going to admit it

295
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,570
for fear of being murdered.

296
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,072
I've told this person
everything,

297
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,291
and I want to know who it is.

298
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,460
I know you're upset... I want to know...
No, you don't know.

299
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,245
You don't know, okay? Who is it?

300
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,329
It's not me.

301
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,298
All right, fine.
If nobody's gonna say anything,

302
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,500
pull out your phones. And I want
to see all of your phones.

303
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,469
Are you serious?
All of your phones.

304
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,221
Pull out your texts. I'm serious!
Texts! (All shouting)

305
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,923
Whoever it is, just say it.

306
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,041
Who is it?
It's me.

307
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,311
I'm Catfish.

308
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,987
What? What do you...?

309
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,773
No, I-I-I asked you.
You swore to me.

310
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,241
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,194
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

312
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,363
Look, just take it easy,
Ryder, okay?

313
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,998
This was just a little joke.

314
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,500
Things got out of hand.

315
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,368
(scoffs)

316
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:29,588
What, you're-you're
defending her?

317
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,340
Huh? Are you kidding me?

318
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,578
What's wrong with you people?

319
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,681
WILL:
Ryder...

320
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,222
BOY:
Marley, that's messed up.

321
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:49,691
Well, if you were asking me
to marry you,

322
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,393
I'd want that big one.

323
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,112
My fingers are on
the larger side,

324
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,063
and you have to figure,
with my build,

325
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,732
after we have a few babies,

326
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,451
I may put on
a couple of pounds.

327
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,153
Tina, I'm looking
for a ring for Kurt.

328
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,822
He is so lucky.

329
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:06,291
Those are engagement rings.

330
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,994
That's good because I'm looking
to get engaged.

331
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,245
I am constantly

332
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,998
telling my nieces
and nephews to wear condoms.

333
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,917
It's for my boyfriend.
I'm not pregnant.

334
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,001
He used to be

335
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,503
my boyfriend. It was...
the whole thing,

336
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,304
it's very complicated.
I won't get into it.

337
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,639
But basically,
I love him very much,

338
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:23,142
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him,

339
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:25,177
so I'm going to ask
him to marry me.

340
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:26,929
Tell me about your man.

341
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,015
Really?

342
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,684
Is he your soul mate?

343
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,937
Yes, he is.

344
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,111
I met Liz when we were 18.

345
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,280
It was at a Styx concert

346
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:47,366
back when they were doing
hard rock,

347
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,252
not this weird robot stuff.

348
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:53,088
We've been together ever since.

349
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:56,341
Doesn't matter
how young or old you are.

350
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,293
True love is true love.

351
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:01,630
My friends have been
giving me so much flak.

352
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:04,766
If we all had listened,
we wouldn't be moments away

353
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,886
from the Supreme Court
finally telling us

354
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,390
that we are just as crazy
and awesome as everybody else.

355
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,941
Hey, dude.

356
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,776
Don't try to stop me.
I'm doing this, okay?

357
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,862
I love you and I want to support
you, so if you're really

358
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,647
gonna do this, I'm helping
you pick out the ring.

359
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,649
I have, like, the best taste.
Is this him?

360
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:21,950
No. Oh, no.
No.

361
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,052
I mean, he wants to do me,
but we're just friends.

362
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:26,054
Sam.
Jan.

363
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:28,557
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

364
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,558
Yeah, sure.

365
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,092
(hushed):
I don't.

366
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,094
(hushed): You <i>do</i> want to do me.

367
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,398
Forgive me for being pushy,

368
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:39,735
but do you have anyone
to advise you on this?

369
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,954
Someone who would
really understand?

370
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,573
Someone... gay?

371
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,241
Yeah.
Not really.

372
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,244
I just want you guys
to see what's possible

373
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,179
when two people
really love each other.

374
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,916
Sound good?

375
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,784
(school bell ringing)

376
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,124
Brittany, have a seat.

377
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,509
We need to chat.

378
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,795
I thought you were teaching
aerobics to fat soccer moms.

379
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,764
Oh, I just stopped
by the teachers' lounge

380
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,033
to retrieve my baby's
placenta in the fridge.

381
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,485
Brittany, Sue and I are

382
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,937
very worried about you.

383
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,939
And we need to know
what's going on.

384
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:20,025
I refuse to speak to either of
you in this office. It's dusty

385
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,977
and drab and Mr. Shue's
"Teacher of The Year"

386
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,862
picture really creeps me out.
So there's

387
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,313
only one place that I'll talk:

388
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:29,150
My turf, my rules, my <i>Fondue.</i>

389
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:31,119
♪ Fondue for two! ♪
♪ Hey!

390
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,538
♪ Fondue for two!
♪ That's some hot dish!

391
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:35,540
♪ Fondue for two!

392
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,659
Welcome back to <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

393
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:40,345
Tonight's guests are two sworn
enemies who became friends,

394
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,215
then became enemies again,
then became friends again,

395
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,001
then enemies, and then
everybody stopped caring.

396
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,003
Sue Sylvester
and Will Schuester.

397
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,671
It's great to be here.
Yeah.

398
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:50,856
Oh, my goodness,

399
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,841
this fondue smells disgusting.

400
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,860
It's like somebody poured
chardonnay on a homeless woman

401
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,028
who'd been dead several days.

402
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:57,145
Yeah, fantastic.

403
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,815
So, Mr. Shue, is it true
that you and Emma

404
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:00,983
are finally getting married?

405
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah, it looks like it.

406
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,185
Awesome. Do you plan
on having children,

407
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,321
or just continue to have
weirdly intimate relationships

408
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:07,990
with high school students
instead of children?

409
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,408
No, we'd like to have kids.

410
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,376
Speaking of kids,
Sue Sylvester,

411
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:14,913
what if I were to tell you
that I know the true identity

412
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:16,081
of your baby's
celebrity father?

413
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,083
I would say that's highly unlikely.
What if I were

414
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,736
to tell you that I know for a
fact that it's Michael Bolton?

415
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,655
I would say that you have
no proof.

416
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,943
Well, Michael Bolton played in
a concert in Columbus, Ohio

417
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,445
nine months to the day before
your daughter was born.

418
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,165
Also, Robin's birth certificate
says she was born in.

419
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,118
"Ol' Milton Beach," which is
an anagram for "Michael Bolton."

420
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:39,621
Also, Michael Bolton has a new
album out, and track number one

421
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,675
is called "So Proud to Be
Your Father, Robin Sylvester."

422
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,011
Michael Bolton and I met in 1994
in Los Angeles

423
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:48,130
when I punctured his windpipe
with a letter opener

424
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:51,350
at Kate Mantilini's where
he was having lunch and

425
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,435
I just happened
to be doing my taxes.

426
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,271
He choked after inhaling in
a chunk of his own hair,

427
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,057
and I saved his life.
He's owed me a favor ever since.

428
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,610
And just in case
you're wondering,

429
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,062
Michael Bolton
is a fantastic lover.

430
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:06,114
Wow. We did it all night, Will.

431
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,866
We did it every which way.

432
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,401
Cool.

433
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:11,536
(ringing)

434
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,121
Pick up.

435
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,291
I'm sorry, did,
uh, hell just freeze over

436
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,877
or did you just White Chocolate
butt-dial me?

437
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,212
Hey, look,
I need to talk to you.

438
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,748
Sorry, no can do, Trouts,
I just got back

439
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,550
from a dance class and
I'm already five minutes late

440
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,420
for drinks with this insanely
hot off-Broadway <i>choreographer.</i>

441
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,055
It's about Brittany.
Obviously.

442
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,807
Okay, she broke up with me.
Inevitably.

443
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,675
Okay, look, she's been acting
really weird since she met with

444
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,594
those people at MIT, okay? She
even dropped out of regionals.

445
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:37,229
Okay, and are we sure

446
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,815
it's not just Britney 3.0 Week
in Glee Club?

447
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,566
Look, okay, I know I'm not
your favorite person,

448
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,151
but you also know
that I'd help you

449
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,488
if you ever asked me to.

450
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:51,109
Something, something's wrong.
I'm asking you for help.

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,279
It was love at first sticks,

452
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:57,808
that's what we always say.

453
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,427
Well, the irony was that we met
at the concert, you know.

454
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:03,597
We grew up in the same town just a
few blocks from each other. Wow.

455
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,816
We went to the same high school.
You guys are

456
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,184
like a Nora Ephron movie.
Exactly.

457
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,685
Did you go to prom together?

458
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,987
No.
Yeah, well...

459
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,888
Well, we went together
as a group.

460
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,440
We took boys, of course.

461
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,058
Merle and Tommy,
those poor fools.

462
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,494
Merle and Tom. They had no
idea what was going on.

463
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,231
It was different times then,
you know.

464
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,733
There were, there were
no gay clubs at school.

465
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:27,538
You know, nobody talked about
it. We had no representation.

466
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,073
But somehow
we always found a way.

467
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,960
That summer we went on a bus
tour of the United States.

468
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,212
We saw all the sights.

469
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:38,348
And in the end we decided
we liked Ohio the best.

470
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,970
Yeah, yeah, came back,
moved in together,

471
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,390
got each other through college,
and we broke up twice,

472
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,475
and got back
together again twice.

473
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,227
And then we bought
the house in Lima.

474
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,362
What haven't
we seen from our porch?

475
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,864
Nothing.
Hmm.

476
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,265
AIDS.
Yeah.

477
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,067
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

478
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,036
<i>Ellen.</i>

479
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,156
We've seen it all
side-by-side.

480
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,659
Remember when we couldn't even
do this in public, hold hands?

481
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,161
Oh, yeah.

482
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,445
You guys are so sweet.

483
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,165
But you know, when I asked you
"How did you guys meet?"

484
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,250
I actually meant,
"How did you meet Blaine?"

485
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,751
Oh! At the mall.

486
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,620
I was clothes shopping with Tina

487
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,756
and we were at the food court
at Sbarro,

488
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,009
and Jan and I just got
to talking.

489
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,927
And I said,
"Why don't we continue this

490
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,296
over dinner at Breadstix?"
We've been coming here 20 years.

491
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:27,397
Thirty.

492
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,599
30 years? 30. Wow.

493
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,018
We camped out
for the grand opening.

494
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,569
Yes, we did.

495
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,188
Well, I'm glad
you recommended it, Jan.

496
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,440
I mean, it's great and really
inspiring to hear your story.

497
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:39,142
You know, I know I don't, and we
don't really have too many

498
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,311
gay and lesbian role models
to look up to, so...

499
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,447
You guys are a sweet couple.

500
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,866
Thank you.
Oh, we're not a couple.

501
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,036
Would you have married me
if I had asked you?

502
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,787
I mean, if we were allowed to?

503
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:51,821
I always said yeah,

504
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,757
as soon as it's legal in Ohio.

505
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,824
It will be.
Yeah.

506
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,543
Eventually.

507
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,664
But in the meantime, there are still
plenty of places where it's legal.

508
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:05,636
And so, Elizabeth
Margaret Stevens...

509
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,389
...will you legally marry me?

510
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,275
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, oh!

511
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,610
Oh, honey, yes.

512
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,445
(patrons exclaim, cheer)

513
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,449
(whooping)

514
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,620
(school bell ringing)

515
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,188
Hey, can we talk?

516
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,023
Why don't you just text me?

517
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,994
I know it was wrong
and I know you're hurt,

518
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,413
but you're taking it
out on everyone,

519
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:36,083
and that's not fair.
We need you for regionals!

520
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,751
You don't need me, all right?

521
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,703
Jake's a better dancer,
Artie's a better singer,

522
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,870
and Sam's better looking.

523
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,372
Now you're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

524
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,541
We're not competing with
each other, we're a team and...

525
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,976
Why?

526
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,146
Why what? I need to know why.
Okay, you say we're

527
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,048
a team, but you've been lying
to me and messing with my head,

528
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:54,884
and I need some kind of explanation
if I'm gonna go to regionals.

529
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,320
Because....

530
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,241
because I know
I'm not your vision of beauty.

531
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,562
Wait. It-It was...?

532
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,949
Yes, I'm Unique aka Wade,

533
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,734
aka Katie, aka Catfish.

534
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,537
Marley, I love you,
but you don't have to cover

535
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,671
for me anymore.

536
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,974
(voice breaking): It started
off innocent at first,

537
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:20,127
and then he started
telling me things,

538
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,346
and it got way
too deep to stop.

539
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,847
And you don't know how long

540
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,216
it's been since I felt this
close to someone

541
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,751
without all of this

542
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,052
<i>getting in the way.</i>

543
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,308
I know you're probably
gonna punch me in the face,

544
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,478
but the truth is, I reached out
to you because I liked you.

545
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,647
So I got a picture
of a cute blonde

546
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:42,099
to make you like me back.

547
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:46,036
But all the stories,
all the jokes,

548
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,822
the connection that we had,
that was all me.

549
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,375
And that was all real.

550
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,744
I'm sorry I stayed hidden.

551
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:57,113
I didn't do it to hurt you.

552
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,115
I just...

553
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:02,052
I really don't want
to lose what we have.

554
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,458
We don't have anything.

555
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,562
I'm not gonna punch you
in the face.

556
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:18,735
But I'm also not gonna
talk to you ever again.

Seriously, what the hell
is going on with you?

579
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,402
You're acting like a
completely different person,

580
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,237
and it's making me sad.

Sorry... I'm so nervous.

589

I had to ran and got us some
gummy bears to calm my stomach.

590

No wonder you're nervous...
you're wearing white.

um, before we go onstage,

696
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:06,570
I have something I want
to tell you guys.

697
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,542
I got offered
early admission to MIT.

698

(light cheering, applause)

699
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:15,879
I never thought that I would...

700
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:18,181
graduate high school, let
alone go to college, so...

701
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,251
I have to jump on this offer
before it gets taken away.

702
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:22,886
They want me
to leave immediately.

703
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,689
That's why I had that meltdown.

704
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,391
(sighs)

705
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:30,894
Um... my entire life,

706
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:34,731
people have always told me
that I was stupid.

707
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:39,769
And... after a while
I started to believe them.

708
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,740
And it wasn't until...

709
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:46,743
I walked in this room...
(sniffles, sighs)

710
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:48,612
...and I joined this club

711
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,114
that I really started
believing in myself.

712
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:54,668
And as soon as I did that,
as soon as...

713
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:58,672
I started believing that maybe
I was smart after all,

714
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:01,341
I think
the whole world did, too.

729
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,711

730
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:41,465
builds robots in his basement

that I can't handle the pressure

so I told Will,

904
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:57,671
if we're gonna get married, that
I wanted an intimate ceremony

no reception, no planning.

Yeah? Okay.

There was this one day, um,

921
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:15,115
right around the time
that we first met.

922
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,533
Um, out in the courtyard.

923
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,835

to the bottom of my shoe,

and you scraped it off
with a credit card.

926
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:24,541
And whenever things in my head

927
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:27,844
get all gooey and sticky and
messy and I can't get 'em out,

928
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:30,380
you always come along
and you make me feel clean

929

and you make me feel
whole again.

that the sky is blue,

I know that you and I
are meant to be together.

you are my inspiration.

And the day you chaperoned
the field trip to Carmel High.

when you took the team
to their first sectionals.

everything about you.

And I promise you
that as long as you

947
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:26,736
just keep being you
and-and let me love you,

(laughter) We'll see you there.

955
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,667
Emma,

956
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:43,203
do you take Will
to be your husband,

957
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:46,756
to love and honor, forsaking all
others from this day forward?

958
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,759
I do. I do. I do. I do.
(chuckles)

959
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:50,760
Will?

960
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,178
Oh, I definitely do.

961
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:53,596
(laughter)

962
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,598
By the power vested in me

963
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,435
and all the rest, Will, Emma...

964
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:02,605
Wemma... I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

965
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,691
Oh!
(cheering and applause)

966
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:16,736
