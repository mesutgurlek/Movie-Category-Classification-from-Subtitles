      Stop here, please.

17
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,601
       But, Princess, who would
             hold a party here?

18
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,538
          - Witches.
           - Sofia!

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,839
          Hi, Lucinda.

20
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:14,907
        I'm ready for
     your cauldronation.

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,676
               Hmm. Not yet.

22
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,445
              Witch-a-doodle-do.

23
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,917
         Okay, now you're ready.

24
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,352
         ( giggles )
   Oh, look at this outfit.

25
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,354
           So witchy.

26
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,523
      There's still tons
     to set up. Come on.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,327
                Whoa!

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,473
   SOFIA: This looks amazing.

29
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,476
    Thanks, but I think we need
         to put out more newts.

30
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,277
                Lots more newts.

31
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,581
   Oh, they're so... festive.

32
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,915
        I think so, too.

33
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,917
So, I've never been to
a cauldronation.

34
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,652
 What is it exactly?

35
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,921
 It's a really special ceremony

36
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,624
  where I have to prove that
   I'm ready to be a witch.

37
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,392
How do you do that?

38
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,628
  By making a powerful broom
  called the raven catcher.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,963
   Your newt's running away.

40
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,899
Oh... ahhh! Thanks.

41
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,568
  It's taken me a long time
to learn the spells and potion

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,138
 that give the raven catcher
          its magic.

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,906
Sounds like
a lot of work.

44
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,408
It is, but it's worth it.

45
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,910
    If everything goes well,

46
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,979
       when I take off
  on my raven catcher broom

47
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,314
       just as the moon
        rises tonight,

48
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,583
      everyone will see
       I'm not Lucinda
  the little witch anymore.

49
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:35,587
    They will see that I'm
 Lucinda the midnight witch!

50
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,822
   That's what big witches
         are called.

51
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,323
            You must be nervous.

52
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,760
I am, and not just because
I have to make a powerful broom.

53
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,596
Here. Help me hang
these cobwebs?

54
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,200
 What I'm most nervous about
 is picking a witch of honor.

55
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,935
    What's a witch of honor?

56
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,371
 It's a special witch friend
       I have to choose

57
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,640
   to help me make a potion
 at the end of the ceremony.

58
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,176
     I'm trying to decide
       between Indigo,

59
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,777
   my best bad witch friend,

60
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,313
       or Lily, my best
      good witch friend.

61
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,182
Oh. Tough choice.

62
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:07,653
   Especially since Indigo
and Lily are complete opposites.

63
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,288
 I'm afraid they're not gonna
   get along at the party.

64
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,124
     And whoever I don't
choose to be my witch of honor,

65
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,992
      is probably gonna
      get really upset.

66
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,395
       Like, witch upset.

67
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,797
 And ruin your special day?

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,232
              ( sighs heavily )
                         Right.

69
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,001
Well, what if I keep
an eye on Lily and Indigo,

70
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,837
and make sure that
they get along today,
no matter what?

71
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,805
         You'd do that?

72
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,007
        I'd be happy to.

73
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,876
I just want your cauldronation
     to go well, Lucinda.

74
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,711
                  Thanks, Sofia.

75
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,179
                I'm really glad
                   you're here.

76
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,647
     Me, too.

77
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,816
          ( laughter )

78
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,718
       - What was that?
        - More guests.

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,322
Lucinda! Hi, Lucy-woosey!

80
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,458
  That's Lily, my good witch
friend I was telling you about.

81
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,661
Think fast.

82
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,163
          ( laughter )

83
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,765
And I'm guessing that's
your bad witch friend Indigo.

84
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,267
                   Yep.

85
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,738
                       Lucinda!
                 I'm so excited

86
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
               for your big day.

87
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,243
 Wanna see the cauldronation
      present I got you?

88
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,111
          Kitty-ocity!

89
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,347
        Aw, I love it!
        Thanks, Lily.

90
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,283
                      Do I know
        my best friend or what?

91
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,886
      So have you picked
   your witch of honor yet?

92
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,055
          Uh, not yet.

93
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,790
     Then I will make it
        easy for you.

94
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,792
          Pick me, your oldest,
                       bestest,

95
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,561
       and way baddest
           friend.

96
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,730
 The one who knows what type
   of cat you really like.

97
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,098
         Bad-cat-eous.

98
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,233
      - You're welcome.
       - Silly Indigo.

99
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,736
Lucinda's a good witch now.

100
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,872
She prefers cute,
fluffy cat.

101
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,707
               Is that so?

102
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,242
I think both cats
are great,

103
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,910
 so no need to argue, okay?

104
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,312
                    Who are you?

105
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,913
             You don't act like
                   a bad witch.

106
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,949
   And you don't look like
        a good witch.

107
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,450
    This is my friend Sofia.

108
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,152
     I'm just a princess...

109
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,121
     in witches' clothing.

110
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,390
 Oh, that's cute.

111
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,259
I think the ceremony's starting
   soon, isn't it, Lucinda?

112
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,061
Uh, yes, it is.

113
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,064
You two should go find
a good spot by the candles.

114
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,932
Good luck, Lucinda.

115
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,636
I know you'll make
the best raven catcher
broom ever,

116
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,507
and I say that as your
super duper best friend

117
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,776
who'd love to be
your witch of honor.

118
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,577
So pick me.

119
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,513
       Unless you want a really
         wicked witch of honor.

120
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,814
                   Then pick me.

121
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,949
              Let's go, Lucinda.

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,519
     You weren't kidding.
 They really don't get along.

123
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,455
    Oh, maybe I should've
  only invited one of them.

124
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,956
                If they're your
                  best friends,

125
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,992
                 you were right
           to invite them both.

126
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,927
               I won't let them
         ruin your special day.

127
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,595
                   Don't worry.

128
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,930
 Thanks, Sofia.

129
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,965
     WOMAN: Time to start
    the ceremony, witches.

130
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,769
         - Oh, Sofia.
   - Hi. Mrs. Wicked Witch.

131
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,806
          I'm so glad you could
        make Lucinda's big day.

132
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,774
     You ready, honey wart?

133
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,710
As much as
I'll ever be.

134
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,812
           Welcome,
      young witchlings,

135
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,114
  to Lucinda's cauldronation!

136
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,950
    The ritual will begin
    with Lucinda lighting

137
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,186
   the cauldronation candle.

138
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,656
        Okay. Here goes.

139
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,659
                    Fire, fire,
                burning bright,

140
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,861
     ignite the candle's
        light tonight.

141
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,899
    Oh, that's a good shot.

142
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,838
        So is that one.

143
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,707
       Mom! The ceremony.

144
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,242
           In a second, sweetie.

145
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,010
         I just want to capture
            every witchy moment

146
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:19,845
                of this special
                    witchy day.

147
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,680
     Now give me your best

148
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,181
    "I'm almost a midnight
        witch" smile!

149
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,983
                        Perfect.

150
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,686
                 Now then, it's
                  cauldronation
                      tradition

151
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,856
           for everyone to help
              gather straw from
                    a scarecrow

152
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,059
             for Lucinda to use
    in her raven catcher broom.

153
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,429
    To the pumpkin patch,
 you darling doers of magic!

154
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,831
Hey, Luce, I'll pick enough
straw for ten brooms,

155
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,566
   'cause I'm a great friend,

156
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,869
     which means I'll be
   a great witch of honor.

157
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,404
 That's so sweet.

158
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,773
But if I pick more straw,
would that make me

159
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,776
an even better
witch of honor?
Probably!

160
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,077
                  Hey!

161
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,513
        Oh, no, there
        they go again.

162
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,716
             It's okay. I think
                I know a way to
                keep them apart

163
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,785
                 so there won't
               be any problems.

164
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,521
                  Wait. Indigo.
                  Let Lily have
                that scarecrow.

165
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,890
              Then you can have
                that bigger one
               all to yourself.

166
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,526
               It has lots more
                 straw to pick.

167
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,927
         Hm, good idea.

168
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,262
Come on,
girls.

169
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,097
        - Nice going.
          - Thanks.

170
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,100
                  Lucinda dear,
               while everyone's
                 picking straw,

171
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,069
let's set out the ingredients
for your cauldronation potion.

172
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,371
                    Okay, Mom.

173
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,906
I'll go make sure
everything's okay

174
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,174
between Indigo
and Lily.

175
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,711
            Oh, hold that pose.
       I want to get a picture.

176
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,547
              Say rotten cheese.

177
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,382
         Rotten cheese.

178
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,752
      Oh, spider fritters.

179
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,754
          Your eyes were closed.

180
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,656
     Could you pose again?

181
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,558
    And this time, lean in
         a bit closer

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,227
        to that bottle
     of bat sweat, okay?

183
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,397
          ( sighs )
        Rotten cheese.

184
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,902
        So far so good.

185
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,771
   Everyone's getting along.

186
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,739
   My best friend will have
        the best broom

187
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,842
     with all this straw
          I got her.

188
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,911
    Then she'll definitely
 make me her witch of honor.

189
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,881
    Not if I have anything
       to hex about it.

190
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,017
          Wake up-eus!

191
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,891
       Oh, no! Indigo,
       what did you do?

192
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,763
          ( gasps )
 That's rude, Mr. Scarecrow!

193
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,100
              This straw is for
       my best friend, Lucinda.

194
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,538
        You've got to stop this.

195
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
     No, I don't think so.

196
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,175
         Awesome hex.
        Way to go, me.

197
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,780
Aren't you tired,
Mr. Scarecrow?

198
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,818
                Don't you wanna
                      sit down?

199
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,654
  SOFIA: They're heading for
     Lucinda's backyard.

200
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,457
  That scarecrow could wreck
     all the decorations.

201
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,858
                We've got to do
                     something.

202
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,394
  Now say icky, stinky cheese.

203
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,630
      Icky stinky cheese.

204
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,499
 What a darling shot.

205
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,067
Oh, I know the perfect
spot to hang this.

206
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,969
Right by
the broom closet.

207
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,304
                Back in a flash.

208
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,907
            LILY:
    This hay is Lucinda's.

209
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,176
       Enough. It's not
       polite to grab.

210
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,811
             Uh-oh.

211
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,081
    Please, Mr. Scarecrow,
      this is not funny.

212
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,083
 Lucinda's ingredients.

213
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,219
She needs those
to make her potion.

214
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,187
Now unhex that scarecrow.

215
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,090
           Ugh! Okay.

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,000
                 Sorry, Lucinda.

217
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,037
It's okay. I'm just glad
you got it to stop.

218
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,873
I found an even better
spot for the picture.

219
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,075
In the divining room.

220
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,511
    Oh, looky, it's almost
          moonrise.

221
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:43,048
  Come, girls. It's time for
    the broomstick dance.

222
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,350
Bring all the straw
you collected.

223
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,487
 ( frustrated groan )

224
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,460
Did you see the way
that they looked at
each other?

225
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,229
            It was hard to miss.

226
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,865
What are they going to do
when I choose one of them
for my witch of honor?

227
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,701
              Well, whoever you
                   don't choose

228
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,203
     will just have to be
        okay with it.

229
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,205
       Now, my witchlets,

230
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,775
   it's time for you to do
the traditional broomstick dance

231
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,477
     around this broomstick

232
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,646
    while Lucinda recites
          the spell

233
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,382
      that will give her
raven catcher broom its magic.

234
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,653
   Good. Everyone split up
into pairs of two for the dance.

235
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,655
         Pairs of two.

236
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,925
        Lily, Indigo, why don't
        you two dance together?

237
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,660
        Are you serious?

238
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,161
You cannot
be serious.

239
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,630
                      Seriously?

240
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,565
      Keeping them apart
         didn't work.

241
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,634
       Maybe if they do
   something fun together,

242
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,402
     they might get along.

243
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,437
                   I guess it's
                   worth a try.

244
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,907
            Okay, yes. I'd love
     you two to dance together.

245
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,578
          And it is
   my cauldronation, so...

246
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,914
 All right, fine.

247
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,651

            begin!

        Lucinda honey,
  the moon will be out soon.

278
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,211
        Cast the spell.

279
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,746
           Okay, Mom.

280
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,181
       Broom of speed,
       fast in flight--

281
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,617
Oh, Lucy-woosey,
don't you want

282
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,221
your witch of honor
to be a fabulous broomstick
dancer like me?

283
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,424
 You call those dance moves?
         Watch these.

284
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,393
      Cut it out, guys.
  I'm trying to do my spell.

285
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,195
        Lucinda, hurry.

286
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,396
             Okay.

287
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,465
   Whistling thistles, uh...

288
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,900
    bristles of hay... whoa!

289
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,268
      Keep going, Lucinda.

290
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,806
        Full of magic,
        pep and might?

291
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,775
    - Look at me, Lucinda.
      - No, look at me.

292
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,544
  How about we just stick to
 the basic broomstick dance?

293
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,614
     Rise up to the broom
      and stick on okay.

294
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,093
        ( all gasping )

295
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,995
         My broomstick!

296
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,898
    I was supposed to say
     stick where ye may.

297
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,267
Ugh! I said it wrong.

298
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,435
      Now I'm gonna have
   a crooked raven catcher

299
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,238
       for the rest of
           my life.

300
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
 It'll be all right, honey.

301
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,442
I like your broomstick.

302
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,878
         It's unique,
        just like you.

303
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,983
           ( moans )

304
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,919
                     It's okay,
                   Lucy-woosey.

305
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,454
          Yeah, that broomstick
              is pretty wicked.

306
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,257
I don't mean to nudge, but it's
 getting later by the minute.

307
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,626
 I think you should pick your
 witch of honor now, Lucinda.

308
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:52,430
Finally. Okay, Lucinda's gonna
pick her witch of honor now.

309
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,801
                    So, Lucinda,

310
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,204
         who are you
       going to choose?

311
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,538
      I'm... I'm not sure.

312
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,007
         Come on, Lu,
     it's an easy choice.

313
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,443
  Remember all the bad hexes
       we did together?

314
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,846
        But you're a good witch
                  now, Lucindy,

315
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,315
             so you should have
         a good witch of honor.

316
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,116
                     Me!

317
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,586
        - Um, Lucinda.
         - ( gasps )

318
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,556
     - Who's it gonna be?
         - Yes, who?

319
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,325
          Okay, okay.

320
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,260
          I choose...

321
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,663
      - I choose Sofia.
            - Her?
           - Huh?!

322
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,731
              Me?

323
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,499
                       What are
                  you thinking?

324
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,902
   Can a non-witch even be
     the witch of honor?

325
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,874
       Well, nothing in
  the cauldronation handbook

326
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,377
    says a witch of honor
       must be a witch.

327
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,746
        Hm. Sofia it is.

328
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,915
                But Lucinda,

329
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,651
 I don't know the first thing
about being a witch of honor.

330
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,554
     I know, but I didn't
     want Lily and Indigo

331
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,190
     to start the hex-off
       of the century.

332
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,192
          Everyone,
   the moon is on the rise.

333
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,261
               Please head over
               to the cauldron.

334
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,532
  I'm sorry. I really didn't
    think she'd choose me.

335
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,401
          Hm!

336
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,006
 Now Lucinda, with help from
  her witch of honor Sofia,

337
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:11,442
will perform the final
step of the cauldronation.

338
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,578
    They'll brew a potion
      that will complete

339
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,546
    her raven catcher broom.

340
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,249
But first, Lucinda,
let's get one quick shot

341
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,585
of you with your
super special witch of honor.

342
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,022
Oh, spider socks.

343
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,456
 I'm out of canvases.

344
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,926
           There's more inside.
       I'll be back in a jiffy.

345
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,695
 What do I do?

346
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,430
        Start stirring
       with the broom,

347
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,832
           and remember to keep
    stirring as the moon rises.

348
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,775
  Like this?

349
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,410
          Yes. If all goes well,

350
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,412
            the potion will put
       a headpiece on the broom

351
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,447
                in the shape of
            my favorite animal,
                        an owl.

352
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,786
                 Now I will add
      one speckled owl feather.

353
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,455
         Two drops of
         slug slime.

354
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,459
               One wolf whisker.

355
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,062
          A sprig of swamp moss.

356
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,230
            Four knuckleberries.

357
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,468
That princess stole
my best friend.

358
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,004
        You mean my best friend?

359
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,073
      I think it's time
 she goes back to her castle.

360
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,641
         Wait, Indigo!

361
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,012
       Powers that be,
       heed what I say.

362
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,448
      Send that princess
          far away.

363
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,652
      What's happening?
         Get me down!

364
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,789
           - Sofia!
- Time to go bye-bye, princess.

365
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,460
       Indigo, that's Lucinda's
           raven catcher broom.

366
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,663
          Don't worry, Lucindy.
      I'll get it back for you.

367
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,598
      Turn that princess
        right around.

368
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,899
             Help!

369
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,303
       Oh, no, you don't.

370
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,438
   That princess who should
    never have been named

371
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,874
        witch of honor
       is out of here.

372
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,276
     I'm not a real witch!

373
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,379
       I don't know how
     to steer this thing.

374
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,481
      But Lucindy needs
         that broom.

375
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,217
          Get me down!

376
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,619
           Watch out!

377
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,123
      I got more canvases.

378
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,591
         ( screaming )

379
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,927
           - Uh-oh.
         - Watch it.

380
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,031
            Oh, my!

381
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,135
 I'm okay.

382
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,337
  But they're not.

383
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,538
        ( all hooting )

384
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,974
 Ha! You're an owl.

385
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,310
           - Uh-oh.
     - Yep, you are, too.

386
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,179
          ( hooting )

387
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,680
        Great goblins!
          ( hoots )

388
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,916
           Oh, no.
           Oh, no.

389
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,085
          - Oh, no!
       - What happened?

390
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,988
     The potion was supposed to
           put an owl headpiece
                   on my broom,

391
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,590
         not turn everyone
         into owls.

392
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,493
       My cauldronation
          is ruined.

393
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,862
      Now I'll never be
      a midnight witch.

394
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,799
        Lucinda, wait!
       I can fix this.

395
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,604
   If only I could pick up
           my wand.

396
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,040
                     Nice going.

397
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,544
Me? I was trying
to stop you and
your mean hex.

398
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,512
                   Stop. Enough!

399
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,614
                   Both of you,
                   you've spent
                 this whole day

400
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,017
            arguing over who is
     best friends with Lucinda,

401
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,553
       but this is not
    how best friends act.

402
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,856
    - I just wanted to be
     her witch of honor.
          - Me, too.

403
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,393
And all Lucinda wanted was for
her cauldronation to go well.

404
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,029
     If you really wanted
  to act like a good friend,

405
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,364
  you would've thought more
  about what Lucinda wants,

406
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,600
                 not about what
                      you want.

407
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,570
You're right.
We've been so...
so selfish.

408
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,039
        Yeah, I guess
        we kinda have.

409
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
 What's even worse is I know
      the spell to break

410
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,943
      that owl hex, but
     I can't use my wand

411
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,612
     - with these claws.
     - Same goes for me.

412
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,114
            Maybe you can do it.

413
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,748
 But I'm not a witch.

414
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,317
                We'll teach you
                     the spell.

415
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,052
         And show you
      how to use a wand.

416
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,689
All right. I'll try,
but we better hurry.

417
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,725
              It's just an itsy
            flick of the wrist.

418
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,160
           Like this?

419
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,162
 Now repeat after us:

420
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,930
Wolves that howl,
cats on the prowl...

421
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,633
      Wolves that howl,
      cats on the prowl.

422
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,769
Bring back the witches
and be gone all these owls.

423
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,572
    Bring back the witches
 and be gone all these owls.

424
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,616
     - You did it, Sofia!
         - Way to go!

425
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,018
               Good work fixing
            one problem, girls.

426
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,087
        But what about
      Lucinda's potion?

427
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,422
     All the ingredients
           spilled.

428
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,625
Not to mention this mess.

429
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,326
And the moon's
coming out.

430
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,195
   We need a clean-up crew
          over here.

431
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,998
    The rest of us need to
  gather potion ingredients.

432
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,668
   It would be so sweet if
you could go find slug slime,

433
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,504
and can you find some essence
    of toadstool? Thanks.

434
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,973
Now there's only
one thing missing.

435
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,608
            Lucinda.

436
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,681
      I'm sorry, Lucinda.

437
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,117
    I really tried to keep
       Indigo and Lily

438
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,818
     from causing trouble.

439
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
     It's not your fault,
            Sofia.

440
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,856
       Indigo and Lily
  are really great friends.

441
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,192
    They're just terrible
 when you put them together.

442
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,528
    Still, I can't believe
       how bad it got.

443
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,464
   You know, it may not be
     that bad after all.

444
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,033
           How can you say that?

445
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,936
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

446
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,706
        What's going on?

447
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,208
                    Here's some
               crocodile tears.

448
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,176
New batch of
bat sweat for you.

449
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,245
                 I got you some
                     bug broth.

450
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,880
     My potion ingredients?

451
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,181
Your friends
did this for you.

452
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,650
       It was the least
         we could do.

453
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,420
   After, you know, ruining
     your cauldronation.

454
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,256
          We are so,
          so sorry.

455
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,991
   We spent this whole day
        fighting over

456
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,693
         who was your
         best friend,

457
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,229
and that made us act
like really bad friends.

458
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,231
And not the good
kind of bad, just
the bad kind.

459
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,266
    And we feel just awful.

460
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,034
              It's okay.

461
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,769
       But you're both
       my best friends.

462
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,504
       I don't want you
      to fight over me.

463
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,939
         Yeah, we know that now.

464
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,675
      Look, Lucinda, the moon's
           not totally out yet.

465
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,278
          There's still time to
     finish your raven catcher.

466
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,214
   Only if I get help from
     my witches of honor.

467
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,450
       All three of you.

468
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,622
   This, that, a little bit
           of this.

469
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,691
     A bit of bug broth,
       some croc tears.

470
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,893
         Three wolf whiskers.

471
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,894
       A touch of toadstool.

472
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,764
      The spell, honey,
           quickly.

473
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,867
       I raise my voice
  as the potion is stirred.

474
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,670
      Complete this brew
    with my favorite bird.

475
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,088
         - It worked!
         - I did it!
   I made a raven catcher.

476
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,790
     I'm a midnight witch!

477
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,326
       ( girls cheering )

478
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,895
         - Great job!
    - Way to go, Lucinda!

479
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,830
     I'm so proud of you,
         my darling.

480
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,432
               Thanks, Mom.

481
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,834
     And I'm sorry about
   taking all the pictures.

482
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,003
     It's just that, well,

483
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,139
         you won't be
my little witchlet much longer,

484
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,341
      and I... I want to
         remember you

485
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,276
      before you fly off
         on your own.

486
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,011
        It's okay, Mom.

487
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,946
     You can take as many
    pictures as you want.

488
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,650
You know what? There's no way
   I'll forget this moment.

489
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,818
       Ever.

490
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,020
        Nice job being
    witch of honor, Sofia.

491
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:07,825
     You know, you'd make
 a really, really good witch.

492
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,027
      A good bad witch,
          you mean.

493
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,463
   If you ever get sick of
 the princess thing, that is.

494
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,931
Thank. I'll
keep it in mind.

495
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,766
   Ready to take a test ride

496
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,002
   on my brand-spanking-new
        raven catcher?

497
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,804
               So you like that
               it's zig-zagged?

498
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,139
   Yeah. It's one of a kind.

499
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,543
Oh, and you may wanna
hold on tight, Sofia.

500
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:29,146
      Just how fast does
        this thing go?

501
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,683
      ( Lucinda laughing )
