45

00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:51,048
<i>to even look at the suit</i>
<i>I wore to it.</i>

47
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,217
<i>And now back to Lima</i>

<i>"How are you feeling?</i>

00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:13,971

<i>about a 19-year-old who dies?</i>

56
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,507
<i>Everyone wants to talk</i>
<i>about how he died, too,</i>

57
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,942
<i>but who cares?</i>

58
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,510
<i>One moment in his whole life.</i>

59
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:21,145
<i>I care more about how he lived.</i>

60
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,047
<i>And anyone</i>
<i>who has a problem with that</i>

61
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,183
<i>should remember</i>
<i>that he was my brother.</i>

62
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:29,520
<i>I only keep that out</i>
<i>when I know she won't come in.</i>

63
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:32,456
(echoing):
Rachel?

64
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:34,759
I'm going now.

65
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,129
<i>This isn't real.</i>

66
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,730
<i>I'm not going home for this.</i>

67
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,732
<i>He's going to be there.</i>

68
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,436
<i>I'm going to spend</i>
<i>my entire life missing him.</i>

(school bell ringing)

70
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,273
You know, I've cleared
my entire schedule

71
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,175
to provide my services
to students and faculty,

72
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,644
and not a single person's
come in for grief counseling.

73
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,812
Well, maybe that's because

74
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,113
you're not a certified
grief counselor.

75
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:58,115
Maybe that's because
you're just the jittery,

76
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,850
mentally-ill bird lady
they turn to

77
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:02,019
to find out what college
they won't be attending

78
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:03,754
because they missed
the application deadline.

79
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,490
If students wish to mourn
Finn's passing, they're free

80
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,459
to visit the memorial garden
that I erected.

81
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:10,394
I planted a tree in

82
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,396
the exact location
where I caught Finn

83
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,732
and Quinn Fabray fondling
each other's breasts.

84
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,334
Come on, Sue. BEISTE:
How can you even

85
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:18,102
joke at a time like this?

86
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,804
SUE: Oh, take it easy,
Post-Op Michael Chiklis.

87
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,305
I'm grieving.

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,075
And I grieve by insulting those
who mean the most to me.

89
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,210
It's just a coincidence
that it's also what I do

90
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,445
when I'm not grieving.

91
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,548
It just feels so surreal.

92
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:32,149
They don't make 'em like Finn.

93
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,151
He was our quarterback.

94
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:37,321
We honor Finn Hudson by taking
care of the people he loved,

95
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,590
and the way we do that

96
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,525
is by helping them to move on.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,194
How?

98
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:46,764
By not making a self-serving
spectacle of our own sadness.

99
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,499
And I think we can all agree,

100
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,894
that's what Finn
would have wanted.

101
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,572
I'm really glad so many of you

102
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:56,273
could make it back for this.

103
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,708
MIKE: We wouldn't miss it
for anything, Mr. Shue.

104
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,377
The funeral

105
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,279
was for everyone, but I wanted
to do something just for us.

106
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,781
To memorialize him

107
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,584
the only way we know how...

108
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:07,918
by singing.

109
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,787
(sighs) All week long.

110
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,856
Anyone who wants to
can come up and sing.

111
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,225
Maybe a song he sung,

112
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,493
maybe something that
reminds you of him...

113
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,007
Singing isn't going
to bring him back.

114
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,662
No, it's not.

115
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:20,798
Nothing is.

116
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:23,901
Not ever.

117
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,937
But... for two minutes or so,

118
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,974
we can all maybe remember
the best parts of him.

119
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,376
So, think of
what you want to sing,

120
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,345
if you want to sing,
and we'll start tomorrow.

121
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,049
Oh, I-I can't wait
until tomorrow, Mr. Shue.

122
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,384
I've been bawling
for three weeks.

123
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,054
If I don't get this all out now,

124
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:45,423
I don't think
I'll ever stop crying.

125
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:47,391
Sure, Mercedes. Start us off.
Um...

126
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:50,728
I, uh, remember Finn telling me

127
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:54,198
that he sang this song
to his baby's sonogram.

128
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:57,601
Well, he thought
it was his baby.

129
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:02,006
He was the first cool kid
to be nice to any of us,

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,943
and he was...
our leader in here.

131
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:09,280
We love you, Finn.

132
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,618

(school bell rings)

186
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:05,923
Sweet, gentle Porcelain,

187
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,993
I know you were instrumental
in raising the funds

188
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,695
for the tree in the memorial
garden in Finn's honor.

189
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,697
All I did was drive
to Home Depot

190
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,733
and buy a tree
for $20, but, yes.

191
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,768
Well, it looks like
we're gonna have to dip

192
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:19,837
into your West Village Halloween
Parade Assless Chap Fund

193
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,038
once again.

194
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:22,406
Tree is gone.

195
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,209
Someone's vandalized
the memorial.

196
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:26,377
(chain clanking)

197
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,381
(engine revving)

198
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:32,483
I don't understand! Why would
someone do something like that?

199
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,751
Who knows?

200
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,287
Grief can bring out
the irrational in all of us.

201
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,056
<i>Sometimes it makes</i>
<i>people do very strange things.</i>

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,058
<i>Sometimes when people die,</i>

203
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:43,661
<i>we want to hold on</i>
<i>to what's left of them</i>

204
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:46,664
<i>to get us through</i>
<i>the hard times.</i>

205
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:50,401
I'll take that $20
for a new tree, please.

206
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:51,315
I prefer exact change.

207
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:52,970
Thanks.

208
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,239
(school bell ringing)

209
00:09:55,273 --> 00:10:00,044
KURT: I marked these boxes so it'd
be easier to separate things.

210
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:01,979
Thanks, honey.

211
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,415
You don't have to do this now.
It can wait.

212
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,750
There's no timetable.
CAROLE: No.

213
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,986
We should do it now, or...

214
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,388
I'm afraid I'll never do it.

215
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,591
(sighs heavily)

216
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,097
KURT:
Look.

217
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,534
It's the ball from the
first game we ever scored at.

218
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,603
You should keep this, Dad.

219
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:30,574
That was the weirdest
football game I ever been to.

220
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,576
Look, it's the faggy lamp

221
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,578
from my Marlene Dietrich

222
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,780
basement redecoration.

223
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,616
I think he kept it in here
to prove a point to Burt.

224
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:41,085
BURT:
You know, if it's, uh,

225
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,620
okay with everyone, I think
I'd like to keep that lamp.

226
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,123
No. It's not okay with me.
That thing is awful.

227
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,025
BURT:
I need a lamp

228
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,728
in my office at the shop.

229
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,832
I tore into him about this lamp.

230
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,433
You know, I was right,
in principle,

231
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,435
but, you know, come on.
The kid didn't have

232
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,739
a prejudiced bone in his body.

233
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:05,309
I knew what he meant when
he was calling it "faggy."

234
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,311
I wasn't teaching him

235
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,713
a lesson in tolerance,
I was teaching myself one,

236
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,516
and he was just unlucky enough
to be there for it.

237
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,759
CAROLE: Finn knew how you
felt about him, honey.

238
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:23,694
He kind of liked it
when you yelled at him.

239
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,063
Should've hugged him more,
you know?

240
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,833
No, it was always...

241
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:34,605
you know, we'd fist-bump
or we'd high-five, but...

242
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,141
I should've given him more hugs.

243
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,510
You know, the last
time I saw him,

244
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:44,114
he was so bummed out about
some test at school, and...

245
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,116
I just, you know...

246
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:48,986
told him
to get back at it, you know?

247
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,021
He was worth it.

248
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:56,059
(voice breaking): It was
the perfect time for a hug.

249
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:00,264
But for whatever reason,
I just...

250
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:03,534
I gave him a pat on the back...

251
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:05,903
and that's that.

252
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,939
Now he's gone.

253
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:15,846
KURT:
Oh, d-don't.

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,481
I need that.

255
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:18,715
I want it.

256
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:25,722
Seeing him come into the
hallway wearing this...

257
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:29,593
it was like Superman
had arrived.

258
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,842
(sniffles, chuckles):
God, his arms were long.

259
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,914
I always thought
that when I, uh...

260
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,484
(sniffles)

261
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:57,921
How do parents go on
when they lose a child?

262
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:00,190
You know, when I would see
that stuff on the news,

263
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:02,593
I'd shut it off, 'cause it was
just too horrible to think,

264
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:03,994
but I would always think:

265
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,530
how do they wake up every day?

266
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:09,700
I mean, h-h... (gasping)

267
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,469
how do they breathe, honey?

268
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,005
(muffled sob)

269
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,641
But you do wake up.

270
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:20,978
And for just a second,

271
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,013
you forget.

272
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,383
And then...

273
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,586
oh, you remember.

274
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:32,222
And it's like getting
that call again...

275
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:35,626
and again, every time.

276
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,063
You don't get to
stop waking up.

277
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,965
You have to keep on
being a parent,

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,468
even though you don't get
to have a child anymore.

Hi, Santana.

334
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,774
Shouldn't you be with
Tina in Glee Club?

335
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,776
I-I don't mean to pry...
it's just,

336
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,611
I had Tina mourning in song

337
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,280
with the Glee Club
until 10:45 at the earliest.

338
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,249
No, I had to get out of there.

339
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,117
Felt like my head
was gonna explode.

340
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,887
SANTANA:
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

341
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,482
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

342
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,590
Principal Sylvester told us
the candles have to go.

343
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,792
She said she got a call

344
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,593
from the fire marshal.
You cannot let her do this.

345
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,129
Um, he's the janitor.

346
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:28,497
JANITOR:
New Santana Lopez

347
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:31,667
is right, Old Santana Lopez.

348
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:35,337
Under the tyrannical
jackboot of Sylvester regime,

349
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:36,672
I am powerless,

350
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:39,008
and I am too overcome
with Finn Hudson-related grief

351
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,309
to fight back.

352
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,611
Okay, this is...
this is insane.

353
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,447
SUE: Well, Donna,
one of us farted,

354
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,183
and I'm about 60% sure
it wasn't me.

355
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,884
You have no right
to take down that memorial.

356
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,087
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do, Sandbags. I allowed

357
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:53,656
that memorial to remain in the
hallway for over a week. Oh, please.

358
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,990
You wanted that memorial gone

359
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,592
because you're such
a coldhearted bitch.

360
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,194
What did you just call me?

361
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:01,630
A miserable,
self-centered bitch,

362
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,933
who has spent
every waking minute

363
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,969
of the past three years trying
to make our lives miserable.

364
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,337
I'm officially over it.

365
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,272
I don't care for your attitude.
Well,

366
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,908
I don't give a hot wet monkey's
ass what you care for.

367
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:14,176
You are not my principal.

368
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,811
See, I don't go here
anymore, Sue,

369
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,713
and that means
I can finally tell you

370
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,782
exactly what I think of you.

371
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,450
I have hated you

372
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,486
ever since the day I met you.

373
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,621
You are a horrible person

374
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,357
who never had a nice word
to say about Finn Hudson,

375
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,493
so don't you dare think
for a second

376
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,994
that he didn't hate you, too!

377
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,531
If I were you, I would choose my
next few words very carefully.

378
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:37,833
What are you gonna do?
You gonna expel me?

379
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:38,968
You get the hell
out of my office!

380
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,703
How about you make me get
the hell out of your office?

381
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,705
Donna, call the police.
Donna, you pick up that phone,

382
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,907
and I swear to God,
I will shove my foot so far...

383
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:47,009
That's assault!
No, this is assault!

384
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,845
(gasps)

385
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:56,318
(school bell rings)

386
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,520
Tina, I'm really glad that

387
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,922
you took the time
to come talk to me today.

388
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,857
I know a lot of young people

389
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,859
have trouble expressing
feelings of sadness.

390
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,862
I just don't know how
much longer I can do this.

391
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,197
Do what?

392
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,200
I just don't know how much
longer I can wear black.

393
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,870
I feel like this look is
so Tina two years ago.

394
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,373
And I spent so much time
transitioning away from goth,

395
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,142
and look at me... it's, like,
I'm back in that look.

396
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:22,878
Okay, yeah.
I'm just gonna see

397
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,514
what I... have
in my drawer here.

398
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:27,683
Okay. All right.

399
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,752
So, why don't you

400
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,821
have a look at these...

401
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,857
on your way out.

402
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,326
Okay?

403
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,662
Okay.

404
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,430
All right.

405
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, right on time
for your 1:30.

406
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,276
I'm happy some people are
finally coming to you for help.

407
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:50,539
Mm-hmm. But I don't think
I need grief counseling.

408
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,707
Have a seat.

409
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:53,742
(sighs) Come on.

410
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,646
(sighs)

411
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:00,482
Will, I was with you when
you found out that Finn died.

412
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:03,052
Okay? I stood right next
to you at the funeral.

413
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:05,020
And I couldn't help
but notice something.

414
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,288
What?

415
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,724
You haven't cried.

416
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,726
What are you saying, that...

417
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,561
that-that I don't feel anything?
No, that's

418
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:13,996
not what... Of course I
feel something, Emma.

419
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,498
I-I feel...

420
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:20,436
I feel more than I know
how to express. I...

421
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,504
I'm heartbroken.

422
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,139
To be honest,
I don't even know how

423
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,208
we're all supposed to move
forward, but in the meantime,

424
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,676
I have to make sure
that the people

425
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,844
around me are taken care of.

426
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,412
Okay. Okay.

427
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,167
Look, I-I... this... Listen to me.
Listen...

428
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,282
Listen to me; listen.

429
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,750
I love you, okay?

430
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,219
I know. Whatever you feel and
however you want to show it,

431
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:39,154
that's okay.

432
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,522
I just...

433
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,524
I think there's
gonna come a time

434
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,461
when you need to... let it
all out, and I want you to know

435
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,763
that I plan on being here
for you when you do.

436
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,333
I have to get back to class.

437
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,601
Okay.

438
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,908
(school bell ringing)

439
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,052
You're drunk.

440
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,453
You're beautiful.

441
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:07,522
You puke in my locker room,
you're cleaning it up.

442
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,624
Come on...
what's the big deal?

443
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,960
(frustrated sigh)

444
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:16,731
I get needing something to get
through the first few days,

445
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,801
but it's been a month.

446
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:22,837
You don't have to be scared
to have feelings.

447
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,072
That's crap!

448
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:25,440
Of course I do!

449
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,275
Why?
We're all having 'em!

450
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,743
Not like mine!

451
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:30,545
No one understands!

452
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,981
Understands what?
Tell me!

453
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:38,420
That if I start crying,
I don't think I'll ever stop!

454
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,922
(kicks locker)

455
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,892
(panting)

456
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:49,831
Finn would've kicked over
one of my chairs.

457
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,232
Yeah.

458
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,268
That was his specialty.

459
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,504
Sit down.

460
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,175
Come here.

461
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:06,514
(sobbing)

462
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:11,586
(crying):
I can't take it...

463
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,294
What chance do I have
of not being an idiot

464
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:21,129
and hurting people

465
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:24,299
without him around
to remind me who I really am?

466
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,003
You just got to do that
for yourself now...

467
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:30,005
and see yourself
how he saw you.

468
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,040
It's not good enough for me!

469
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:34,042
It's not like when he was alive.

470
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:35,710
(crying):
You got to make it good enough,

471
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,579
because it's all we got left.

472
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:39,414
And I'm telling
you this straight,

473
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:41,149
'cause that's how
you and I talk.

474
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:45,020
(sniffles)

475
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:46,955
He's dead...

476
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:50,258
and all we've got left is
his voice in our head.

477
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,293
(sobbing quietly)

478
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:55,797
I'm sorry, but it's time you...

479
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:58,099
you got to be your
own quarterback.

480

(sighs)

482
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,680
Do you think we could...
retire his number?

483
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,982
Kurt has his letterman jacket.

484
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:16,151
Maybe... maybe we could
frame it or something,

485
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,886
and put it up in here.

486
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,487
Mm.

487
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:21,322
Other kids should
know who he was.

488
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:22,891
Years from now.

489
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,392
Yeah.

490
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,328
I can get that done.

491
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,466
But you got to promise
to put the tree back.

492
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,335
I didn't take the tree.

493
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:36,471
Fine, I took the tree.

494
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:38,106
Mm-hmm.
(sniffles)

495
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,674
It was a garbage tree, though.

496
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,776
It wasn't big enough.

497
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,912

(school bell ringing)

499
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:50,585
Okay, I know that Finn had
his doubts about God,

500
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,087
but I am convinced

501
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:54,155
that Squishyteets is up
in Heaven right now,

00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,214
I couldn't do it.

538
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:00,315
There was only

539
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,616
one more chorus.

540
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,151
No, not the song.

541
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:06,921
I had this whole plan
to surprise everyone

542
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,524
and not be a bitch
for once in my life

543
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:11,626
and say all these
nice things about Finn,

544
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,928
and then, at the last minute,
I chickened out.

545
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,731
I even wrote them all down.

546
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,135
Would you read it to me?

547
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,638
No, I can't.
It's too embarrassing.

548

They're, like, really nice.

549
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:29,677
If there's one thing
I've learned from Finn dying,

550
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:32,780
it's that shame
is a wasted emotion.

551
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:36,050
I'm sure Finn had secrets,
too, but who cares now?

552
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,187
Do you really think,
one day, on your deathbed,

553
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:42,423
you're gonna think, "Oh, good,
no one knew I was kind?"

554
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:47,161

and when I sat on it,

560

"it looked like I
had pooped my pants,

561

I had messed myself."

No.

He was a much better
person than I am.

That is true.

568

But Finn really
cared about you.

569
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,702
And I don't think he would've
done all those things

570
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:30,204

you were decent, too.

you can keep it tonight,

I understand
wanting the jacket, Puck.

And I'm not saying
that you took it.

628

I didn't.
But if you did,

all I'm gonna say is
that all of us want some piece

Have a seat.

634
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,362
Okay, look, all I can say is
that I'm really...

635
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,998
Shut up.

636
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:29,568
You were absolutely right.

637
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:32,972
Everything you said,
you were right.

638
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,241
I was horrible to that kid,

639
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:37,376
and I'm utterly destroyed

640
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,279
that he died
thinking I didn't like him.

641
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:41,981
Well, maybe this, uh,
could be a lesson.

642
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:43,983
You know, maybe
you could start being nicer...

643
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:45,684
Oh, cut the crap, will you?
I don't care about that.

644
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,187
I don't care about people.
I care about him.

645
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:49,888
(sighs heavily)

646
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,924
He was such a good guy.

647
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,562
And I'll never get to tell him.

648
00:31:56,596 --> 00:32:01,634
There's no lesson here,
there's no happy ending.

649
00:32:01,668 --> 00:32:03,836
There's just nothing.

650
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,904
He's just gone.

651
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:07,806
(sighs)

652
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,977
He would have made
an excellent teacher.

653
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:15,214
I thought
I'd spend the next 30 years

654
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:18,817
teaching alongside him.

655
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:21,020
I thought I had all the time
in the world

656
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:22,554
(voice breaking):
to rail against him

657
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:24,223
and his dopey little Glee Club.

658
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,258
(sighs)

659
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:31,764
Oh, it's just so pointless.

660
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:33,766
All that potential.

661
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,268
(sighs)

662
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:37,836
Just...

663
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:55,487
This is sort of cheesy.

664
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:57,890
RACHEL:
No, it's beautiful.

665
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:03,095
I just had to see it.

666
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:06,169
(school bell ringing)

667
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:08,321
Nobody treat me
with kid gloves, okay?

668
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,926
I don't know
what to say, either.

669
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,694
(trembling breath)

670
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,530
(sniffles)

671
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:19,933
(choked-up):
I loved Finn, and...

672
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,735
(takes deep breath)

673
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,804
...he loved me,
and he loved all of you guys.

674
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,641
I know he did.

675
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,547
I like to sing in
the car and, um...

676
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:37,551
(crying): and before Finn,
I used to sing alone...

677
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,021
...and this was

678
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:43,590
the first song that I...

679
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:45,425
sang with him when we would...

680
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,561
drive around together, so...

681
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:49,396
this is for him.

682

That's a pretty hefty reward.

It's not a reward;
it's bait.

727

I'm gonna kick the crap out of
whoever brings that jacket back.

728

And I want it back

Home... here home?

730
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,116
New York.

731
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,185
That's my home now.

732
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,388
I'm not coming back here
for a while.

733
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:02,922
More than a while.

734
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,991
Maybe never.

735
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:07,861
You know, I used
to love coming here,

736
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,896
but now this just reminds me

737
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,732
of everything that I've lost.

738
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:15,168
I understand.

739
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,170
You should go.

740
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:18,271
Well, geez, Mr. Shue,

741
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:20,340
you don't have to rush me
out of the door.

742
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:22,642
(laughs) I'm a teacher.

743
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,110
It's supposed to make me happy

744
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,546
to see my kids grow up
and leave the nest.

745
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,382
Does it?

746
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,751
Well, I can say for a fact that

747
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:34,387
it certainly beats
the alternative.

748
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:37,190
♪

749
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:38,792
(softly):
Hey.

750
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,431
(sighs)

751
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:52,539
What...?

752
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,441
It's root beer.
Oh.

753
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:55,909
(chuckles)

754
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:01,981
Mmm.
Mmm.

755
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:03,917
So, what do you think?

756
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,052
50 years from now,
when this tree 30 feet tall

757
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,021
and the kids come
to make out under it,

758
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,889
will they know
who it was planted for?

759
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,458
Probably not.

760
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:14,260
You know what's tripping me out

761
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:15,595
is this line

762
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,597
between the two years.

763
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:18,832
It's his whole life.

764
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,234
Everything that happened
is in that line.

765
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,236
What are you gonna do
with your line now, Puckerman?

766
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,305
I'm gonna make a man of myself.

767
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,474
(sighs)

768
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:29,709
Figured if I don't have Finn,
I need an army to help me.

769
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,211
Are you serious? The army?

770
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:32,479
Air Force, actually.

771
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,848
Thought maybe I could be
a top gun.

772
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,383
I think they were actually
Naval aviators in that movie.

773
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:41,354
You know, if Finn was around,

774
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:43,723
I'd just keep letting him
point me in the right direction.

775
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,960
Now...

776
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,262
it's up to me
to figure it all out.

777
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:51,564
I'm proud of you.

778
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,233
You know?

779
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,001
Just don't get shot, okay?

780
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,936
Thanks, Coach.

781
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:59,639
(grunts affectionately)

782
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,674
(sighs)

783
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,011
Keep watering that tree.

784
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,779
You got it.

785
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:08,781
Have a good line.

786
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,884
(engine starts)

787
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:25,412
Hey, Mr. Shue.

788
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,314
Hey, Rachel.

789
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,817
I get flashbacks when you walk
in here and say that.

790
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,519
Good ones.

791
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:33,187
How are you doing?

792
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:35,389
Everyone keeps asking me that.

793
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,725
Well, from what I hear,
you've been a rock for everyone,

794
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,827
so I know that that means

795
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,896
that sometimes you don't get
to grieve yourself.

796
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,731
I'm okay.

797
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:46,233
I mean, I'm...

798
00:39:46,268 --> 00:39:47,434
I'm really not okay,

799
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,503
but, uh, yeah,

800
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:51,105
I'm-I'm okay.

801
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,375
More importantly, how are you?

802
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,015
I have no idea.

803
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:03,551
(sighs)

804
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:05,786
I talk to him a lot.

805
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:09,490
I can still see his face

806
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:12,793
and can hear his voice
so clearly.

807
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,796
Do you think
that I'll ever forget it?

808
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,601
'Cause I'm afraid
that one day, I will.

809
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,536
What do you talk to him about?

810
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,204
Anything.

811
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,273
I mean, when we were dating,
it was, you know,

812
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:27,741
pretty much me talking
all the time

813
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,443
and him just pretending
to listen,

814
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:30,678
so it's not really
that different.

815
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:31,745
(chuckles)

816
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,114
I had it all planned out.

817
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,984
(crying)

818
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,554
I was gonna make it big
on Broadway

819
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:44,191
and maybe do
a Woody Allen movie.

820
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:46,794
And then when we were ready,

821
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:49,930
I would just...

822
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:52,666
come back,
and he'd be teaching here,

823
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,768
and I'd walk
through those doors,

824
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:56,470
and I would just say,
"I'm home."

825
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,207
And then we would live

826
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:02,409
happily ever after.

827
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:05,613
It's a good plan.

828
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,615
Did you tell him?

829
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:08,949
I didn't have to.

830
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,884
He knew.

831
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:13,020
And...

832
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,989
now what?

833
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:16,991
I don't know.

834
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:18,258
Something different.

835
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,960
Maybe something better.

836
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:22,863
I just... I don't think
that that's possible.

837
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:26,300
He was my person.

838
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,540
But thank you so much
for doing this.

839
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,777
I felt like I didn't know

840
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:38,545
if I would be able
to sing again,

841
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,016
but now I know that I can.

842
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:46,020
And I know that there have been
a lot of memorials for him,

843
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:48,422
but I had this made,

844
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:50,958
and I was hoping
that we could hang it in here.

845
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,197
(sighs)

846
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,100
Did he really say that?

847
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:01,769
(both chuckling)

848
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:03,404
He was smart, just, you know,

849
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,639
in an... in an untraditional
kind of way.

850
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:06,874
(chuckles)

851
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:11,078
Come on, let's... let's
hang it right over there.

852
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,337
(sighs)

853
