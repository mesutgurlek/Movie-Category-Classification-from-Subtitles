1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,844
(School bell ringing)

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:04,346
Good.
(cymbal crashes)

3
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,722
(Rachel laughs)

4
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:09,309
Okay, everybody,
let's hear it for love!

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,894
Your assignment
for Valentine's week

6
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:15,482
is to find and perform
the world's greatest love songs.

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,775
Now, Regionals
is next week,

8
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,286
and we still need to raise

9
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,987
$250 for costumes
and hair spray.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,531
Oh, God, not another bake sale.

11
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:23,490
WILL:
If any student gives

12
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,242
ten dollars, we will sing these

13
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,910
"world's greatest love songs"
to their Valentine.

14
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,620
We will serenade
each classroom...

15
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,414
- STUDENTS: No!
- Yes!

16
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,999
Two years ago, we went
room-to-room Christmas caroling,

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,959
they threw food.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,336
And shoes.
Yes, Sugar?

19
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,872
Here's a spoonful of Sugar
for you all:

20
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:40,007
Don't sweat the small stuff,

21
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,551
and it's all small stuff
when you're rich.

22
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:44,052
So, here you go.

23
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,304
Uh, Sugar,
I can't take that.

24
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,889
Take it!

25
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,567
Okay.

26
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,393
Everyone, give it up
for Sugar for paying for

27
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:52,436
our FinalNet
and cumberbunds!

28
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:53,768
SUGAR: I love
the sound of applause,

29
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,814
even if I have to buy it.

30
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,192
Okay, everyone, look
under your chairs.

31
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,527
Except you, Artie.

32
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,903
Your chair kept moving, so I hid

33
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:03,344
your surprise
in the wastebasket.

34
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:08,869
I found mine ten minutes ago.

35
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,037
V-Day is my
fave day ever.

36
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,580
And to help me
celebrate, my daddy's

37
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,499
throwing me a huge, ridic party
at Breadstix.

38
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,917
And I'm naming it

39
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,141
the Sugar Shack.

40
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,527
And... drumroll, Rachel...

41
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,174
... you're all invited!

42
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,050
(Students cheer)

43
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,094
But you have to bring a date.

44
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,971
No single people allowed.

45
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:32,476
They're sad and boring and
they don't exist in my world.

46
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,325
Um, but you're single.

47
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,860
Not for long.

48
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,191
(Giggles)

49
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,305
Wait, what are
you doing here?

50
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,707
I got a note that says "Come to
the auditorium now. It's urgent."

51
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,709
Love, Mandy Patinkin."
Yeah, so did I.

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,997
MEN:
♪ Going to the chapel

53
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,749
♪ And we're gonna
get married ♪

54
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,083
Oh, God.

55
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,043
Is that your dads?

56
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,601
♪ Going to the chapel

57
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:03,673
♪ And we're gonna

58
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,907
LeRoy, LeRoy.

59
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,469
Thanks, guys.
Thank you, thank you.

60
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,595
LeRoy, we agreed
to sing it straight...

61
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,278
no vocal runs.

62
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,330
That's how Jennifer Hudson
got kicked off of <i>American Idol.</i>

63
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,332
I would love to hear you
sing something straight.

64
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,311
Dads, what are
you doing here?

65
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,064
Well, a little birdie named
Burt, who owns a tire store,

66
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,482
and his little birdie wife,

67
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,734
who used to wear a lot of denim,
told us

68
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:26,410
that you guys were, uh,
fixin' to get hitched.

69
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,073
So we thought we'd
return the favor

70
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:30,200
and surprise you.

71
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,284
Mr. and Mr. Berry,

72
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,050
I am so sorry.

73
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,412
It's only customary to ask

74
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,455
the bride's father
first, but...

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,588
We wanted to say...

76
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:38,875
congratulations!

77
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,692
And what better place
than on the very stage

78
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,630
on which you shared
your first kiss?

79
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,798
So you're not angry?

80
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,230
Not at you.

81
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,732
I'm angry 'cause
evidently your father

82
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,427
has been having
recurring dreams

83
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:51,638
about Hollywood heartthrob
Tony Danza.

84
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,348
One dream.
I had one dream

85
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,518
that Tony Danza and I
went ice fishing, okay?

86
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,396
We know you two
really love each other.

87
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,147
And if you're
really sure

88
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,233
you want to spend
the rest of

89
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,193
your lives together,
the last thing

90
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,528
we want to do
is stand in your way.

91
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,988
No, we wouldn't do that.

92
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,972
I mean, marrying
in your teens usually,

93
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,077
you know, doubles the likelihood
of divorce...

94
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,954
a fate that befell
Liza and Barbra...

95
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,728
Are you really going to do this
right now?

96
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,348
Oh, why, you know who else
got, uh, just got divorced?

97
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,794
Tony Danza!
Yeah, did you hear that, LeRoy?

98
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,171
Oh! Yeah, he's single now.

99
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,299
Why don't you fire
up those snowmobiles

100
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,689
and give him a call?

101
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,274
It's ice fishing season.

102
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,887
What your dad
is trying to say

103
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,763
is that he's very excited

104
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,114
to start planning
his only daughter's wedding.

105
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,666
I'm so excited, yeah.

106
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,437
But, uh, we are using
the square tables.

107
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,819
Well, we want to start

108
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,609
with a Valentine's Day dinner
at our house

109
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,041
with the Hudson-Hummels.

110
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,626
We're going to be
one big family, so...

111
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:49,863
let's make a milestone
out of it.

112
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,662
You were raised to be proud

113
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,097
of the decisions that you make.

114
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,744
And if this is what
you really want, sweetie,

115
00:03:55,745 --> 00:04:01,472
well, then you need to start
shouting it from the rooftops!

116
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,640
(Vocalizing)

117
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,627
♪ Yeah!

118
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:05,009
I love you both so much.

119
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,694
Ah, yeah.
(chuckles)

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,097
(school bell ringing)

121
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:18,600
I now call this meeting
of the God Squad to order.

122
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,874
Thank you guys
for coming.

123
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,158
Our first order
of business is

124
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,979
to welcome Quinn Fabray back
into the fold.

125
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,628
It's nice to
see you, Quinn.

126
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:25,899
Thank you.
I know it's been a while.

127
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,025
When I was at my lowest,

128
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,985
I turned to prayer.

129
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:31,947
Not even sure who I was
praying to, really,

130
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,788
but it seemed to lead me
on the right track.

131
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,089
Amen.
Praise.

132
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,224
Can I ask a question?

133
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,036
What's with tarantula head
over here?

134
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,537
This is our new member.

135
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,957
This is Joseph Hart,
but you guys can call him Joe.

136
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,583
He just transferred
here to McKinley.

137
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,816
Yeah, I guess I'm a sophomore.
I've been homeschooled

138
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,351
my whole life,
but this past year I realized

139
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:48,296
my best friend
was my mom,

140
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,237
so I decided I wanted to get out

141
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:51,800
and experience the world.

142
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,135
MERCEDES (whispers):
<i>Joseph.</i>

143
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,893
What's with the tats?
Bible quotes.

144
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,098
And each one of my dreads is
named after a book of the Bible.

145
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,641
You have got to be kidding me.

146
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,999
I play guitar, too,
but I only know Christian stuff.

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,604
My dad only listens to talk
radio, and we don't have a TV.

148
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,837
You guys mind
if I take off my shoes?

149
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,650
I'm sort of used to
going to school barefoot.

150
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,986
I'm just glad there's another
dude around here.

151
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,028
I notice that Shane

152
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,761
isn't a member of the God Squad.

153
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,409
- That's interesting.
- Okay, that's enough, Sam.

154
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,516
All right, so
our last meeting

155
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,834
we talked about opportunities

156
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,079
for community service.

157
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,206
Uh, Valentine's Day's
right around the corner,

158
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:25,139
and since the Glee Club
turned it down,

159
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,294
there's an open slot
for singing telegrams.

160
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,461
All four of us sing,

161
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,027
and Teen Jesus
and I play guitar,

162
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,673
so I thought we could
use the money to

163
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:33,216
adopt a highway
and start a shoe drive.

164
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,342
Praise.

165
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,283
It is a religious holiday...
St. Valentine's and all that.

166
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,736
And I'd love to show this school
that it's cool to be Christian.

167
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,639
We aren't all
just door-to-door

168
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,349
Bible salesmen, like my dad.

169
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,790
All right, all in favor?

170
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,294
(School bell ringing)
Righteous.

171
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,784
Wait, which one are you gonna
take to Sugar's V-Day party?

172
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,447
All of them.

173
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,865
The entire sorority?

174
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,589
They don't call them
the "E-Z-Dee-Zees" for nothing.

175
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,758
I got the gig cleaning the
sorority house swimming pool,

176
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,292
then I sawed through
those chicks

177
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:03,677
like a freakin'
sex tornado...

178
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,415
room to room.
You're amazing.

179
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,398
I'm a professional.

180
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,799
Tried the true love thing...

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,462
With a teacher.
(chuckles)

182
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,770
- Wasn't for me.
- Well, it is for me.

183
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,522
And apparently it's
for Blaine, too.

184
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:17,274
Look: even from his sick
bed, he's managed to send me

185
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,743
a new Valentine's Day card
every single day this week.

186
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,614
It says
"From your secret admirer."

187
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,018
(sighs)
So romantic.

188
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,394
Oh.

189
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,937
Ooh.

190
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,670
A gorilla gram?

191
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:30,690
<i>Pour moi?</i>

192
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,789
(chuckles)

193
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
"To Kurt.

194
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,818
From your secret admirer."

195
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,492
Again.

196
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,113
Well, I wonder
who it could be.

197
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,740
Will you tell me who it is,
Valentine gorilla?

198
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:45,413
You see, Puckerman, that's
what you're missing out on:

199
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:46,664
True love.

200
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:48,639
What about you, Rory?

201
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,690
Who are you taking
to Sugar's party?

202
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:50,627
Sugar.

203
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,059
Hold up.

204
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,671
You better have an option "B"
because I'm all over that.

205
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,964
You're going with Sugar?

206
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,257
As soon as I ask her out,

207
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,842
and she says yes,
which I'm sure she will

208
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,637
because... I don't mean this
to sound mean, Irish...

209
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:01,952
but nobody understands
anything you say.

210

Baloney.
Chicks dig accents.

211
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,406
I'm sorry, what was that?
Couldn't quite make it out.

212
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,490
PUCK: Fellas, there's
no need to fight.

213
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:07,875
You can just pick up the girls

214
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:08,978
that fall off
old Puckerosaurus here.

215
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,107
This is a four-leaf clover, kid.

216
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,380
'Cause you're going to need

217
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,651
all the luck you can get.

218
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:16,550
Do you people
just carry those around?

You're giving me your
computer for Valentine's Day?

244
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,148
It's a playlist.

245
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,317
With all the songs
that I hear in my head

246
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,285
when I'm with you
or when I'm thinking about you.

247
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,995
I wanted to make you a CD
for Valentine's Day,

248
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:34,874
but this is as far
as I got without any help, so...

249
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,344
Oh, and I made you a cover.

250
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,088
Brittany.

251
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,132
Thank you.

252
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,634
You're welcome.

I must see you

256
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,188
in my office, right now.

257
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,565
This is such bull crap!

258
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,400
Why can't Brittany and I
kiss in public?

259
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,442
'Cause we're two girls?

260
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:02,869
Please don't make this about

261
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,153
your sapphic orientation.

262
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,406
This is about
public displays of affection.

263
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,283
PDA simply has no place

264
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,493
in the sacred halls
of McKinley High.

265
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,120
We've had complaints.

266
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,580
About us? When?

267
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,290
Most recently...

268
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,001
yesterday, 12:16 p.m.

269
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,837
That?

270
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:23,047
Our lips barely
even grazed.

271
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,208
And by the way, did you get
any complaints about

272
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,477
that hideous display
that started at 12:17 p.m.

273
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:30,096
and lasted for several
uncomfortable minutes?

274
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,769
Believe me, I'd much rather
see you and Santana kiss

275
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,070
than that so-called Finchel,

276
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,230
but if a student
files a complaint

277
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,724
- because, for religious reasons...
- Oh. Great.

278
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,360
So it was some Bible-thumper
that complained.

279
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:45,445
Ms. Lopez, I'm sorry,
but I'm trying

280
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,448
to keep this school from turning
into a volatile powder keg.

281
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry, too.

282
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,536
'Cause all I want to be able
to do is kiss my girlfriend,

283
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,538
but I guess no one can see that
because there's such

284
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,123
an insane double standard
at this school.

285

Artie, four wheels
on the floor, please.

288
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,554
Rachel, you had an announcement?

289
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:11,888
Yeah, actually, Finn and
I have an announcement

290
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,523
we'd like to make.

291
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,027
Finn and I are
proud to announce...

292
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,111
that we're finally
getting married.

293
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,880
What?
Wow!

294
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,816
When's the baby's due date?

295
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,150
Wait, guys, have you both
carefully thought this through?

296
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,269
Yes. And our parents
are totally behind us.

297
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,454
And your plan to stop us
by telling them

298
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,573
totally backfired, Mr. Shue.

299
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:31,774
Actually, I'm the one
who told them.

300
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,376
Because I think you guys
are making a mistake.

301
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,412
A huge mistake.

302
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,297
- When's the wedding?
- The date is TBD,

303
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,781
but I can assure
all of you that

304
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,949
we're gonna have a very simple
and elegant ceremony

305
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,051
at the Justice of the Peace,

306
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,627
which all of you
are invited to.

307
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,220
And we're registered
at Samuel French.

308
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,622
You guys aren't mature enough

309
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,256
or old enough to properly

310
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:48,966
face this type
of commitment.

311
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,427
If you don't support us,
then I feel sorry for you,

312
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,929
and you're not invited
to the wedding.

313
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,931
Which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved

314
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,182
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.

315
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,392
And you as well, Kurt.

316
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,936
I'd be happy
to be a bridesmaid, Rachel.

317
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,187
I'm not sure I'm ready
to get married,

318
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,073
but I do know what being
in love feels like.

319
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,575
- We'll be there.
- Thanks, guys.

And we hope the rest of
you all change your minds,

321

to us if you were all there.

you guys the best
in your marriage.

is rapidly approaching.

So if you'll
excuse me.

328
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,710

505
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,583
(School bell rings)

506
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,353
All right, guys.

507
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,888
We have to have a discussion

508
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,472
and figure out
what the God Squad feels

509
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,024
about singing to gay people.

510
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,525
Well, three of us
are in Glee Club,

511
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,895
so we're pretty much sing
to gay people all the time.

512
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,591
I know we're okay with it,
but Joe may not be.

513
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,032
I try my best not
to judge anybody.

514
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,568
But, honestly, I've never met
anyone who's gay.

515
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,221
Oh, I guarantee you have.

516
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,488
Yeah, they say that one out of
every ten people are gay.

517
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,226
And if that's true, that means
one of the 12 apostles

518
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,742
might have been gay.

519
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,912
And my guess is Simon because
that name's the gayest.

520
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,413
The Bible says it's

521
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,048
an abomination for a man
to lay down with another man,

522
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,950
but we shared tents
in Cub Scouts

523
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,286
and slept next
to each other all the time...

524
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,922
so that would make
Cub Scouts an abomination?

525
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,174
Do you know what else the Bible
says is an abomination?

526
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,558
Eating lobster,

527
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,126
planting different crops
in the same field,

528
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,728
giving somebody a proud look.

529
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,847
Not an abomination? Slavery.

530
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,599
Jesus never said
anything about gay people.

531
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,650
That's a fact.

532
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,101
Well, maybe he wanted to,

533
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,653
but he didn't want
to hurt Simon's feelings.

534
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,805
You guys, we have to figure out
where we stand.

535
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,941
Especially, if we're gonna be
asking volunteers

536
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,309
from my church
to sing backup for us.

537
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,812
I don't want
to hurt Santana's feelings,

538
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:40,163
but I also don't
want to make someone

539
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,582
do something they're not
comfortable with.

540
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,584
So where do you stand, Joe?

541
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,481
I guess I've gotta
think about it.

542
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,256
You know what?
That's totally fair.

543
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,658
You have to look at
the hard topics and dilemmas

544
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,821
and be honest and truthful.

545
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,698
If you ask me...

546
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,681
that's what being
Christian is really about.

547

(School bell rings)

548
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,039
I know it's early, but...

549
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,858
It's a statue
of St. Valentine.

550
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,009
Well, actually,
it's a statue

551
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,394
of one
of the three wise men

552
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,178
I repainted to look
like Saint...

553
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,382
I told Shane about us.

554
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,884
Wow.

555
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,220
Was he mad?
He was sad.

556
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,473
He cried and said it felt like
I punched him in his heart.

557
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,726
I saw this MMA guy get
punched in the heart once.

558
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,769
He died for, like, a minute.

559
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,313
That sucks.

560
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,330
At least it means we can be
together for real now.

561
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,049
Whoa.

562
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,156
What we did... what I
did to Shane was wrong.

563
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,307
I lied, I cheated,

564
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,952
and it makes me feel awful,

565
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:46,513
and I love you, but being with
you just reminds me of that...

566
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:48,083
that I'm not the person
that I thought I was.

567
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,877
We would never do that
to each other.

568
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,985
I thought that I'd
never do that to Shane.

569
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,215
But I have to face
the truth.

570
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:59,026
When it comes to love,
I don't know who I am,

571
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:03,057
and until I find out,
I can't be with anyone.

572
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,283

Rachel Berry.

653
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,944
Thank you, thank you.

654
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,179
Thank you so much
for joining us

655
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,481
in our nightly tradition
of turning

656
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,574
just plain old dinner
into dinner theater.

657
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,535
And now dinner is served.

658
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:15,535
This way.

659
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:16,954
Smells great.
Delicious.

660
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:18,322
LeROY: That was good.
Yeah, thank you.

661
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,415
See, I have a couple of notes.

662
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,042
I said, "LeRoy,
this guy sold us"

663
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,828
the wrong lube."
Yeah.

664
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,879
"That's why
the rubber is squeaking.

665
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,839
"That's why it feels
so weird

666
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,800
when we start going
really fast."

667
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,718
Excuse me, Hiram, what
are we talking about?

668
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,677
We're talking cars.

669
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,871
Yeah, those clowns

670
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:34,846
down at Local Lube...
they don't know

671
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:35,887
how to lube a car.

672
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,766
Hiram, the duck
was divine

673
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,184
and the house is exquisite.

674
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,344
HIRAM:
Thank you, sweetie.

675
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,561
Nate Berkus...
a dear, dear friend.

676
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,397
That's not true.

677
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:45,266
Yeah, no, it's not, no, no,
no, not true, but it feels

678
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,608
like he is, I love his designs

679
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,943
so much.

680
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:50,320
Everything is, you know,
Nate, Nate Berkus.

681
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,823
So, Mr. Berrys,
how did you two meet?

682
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,224
Ooh.
Ah.

683
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,367
Hey, that's a,

684
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:56,952
th-th-that's a funny story.

685
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,830
We were both in the international
supergroup Up with People.

686
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,832
Up with People was a sensation.

687
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,584
Glenn Close, you know, she got
her start on Up with People.

688
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:07,254
Yeah, and we've been together
ever since, which was, uh,

689
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,673
in our late 20s, early 30s
when we got together.

690
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:10,799
Uh, and on that note,

691
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,384
may I make a toast

692
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:17,298
to Rachel and Finn on this
very special Valentine's Day?

693
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,100
Finn, you're a

694
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:23,311
fantastic... husky

695
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:27,808
young man whom LeRoy
and I simply adore,

696
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,775
and it gives us

697
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,694
such joy to see you make

698
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,612
our little
Rachelah so happy.

699
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:35,407
Let me tell you the secret of
a long and happy marriage...

700
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:39,828
never go to bed
without moisturizing.

701
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:40,871
Bet you thought
I was going

702
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:42,272
to say "Never go
to bed angry."

703
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,332
Okay, let's get
back on track here.

704
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,294
A toast to the...

705
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,780
Hudson-Hummel-Berry clan.

706
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:53,751
And to Finn and Rachel.

707
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,178
We love you both
so very, very much.

708
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,596
We sure do.

709
00:29:57,597 --> 00:30:00,307
To Finn and Rachel.
Finn and Rachel. Indeed.

710
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:01,391
HIRAM:
Mmm.

711
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:02,893
Mm-mm-mm!

712
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:04,011
Now dessert.

713
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,228
Oh, you know what we've got?

714
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:07,189
Velvety Viennetta,

715
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,352
and then we're going to commence
with the teenage lovemaking.

716
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:14,404
No, just kidding.

717
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,655
(laughing):
No.

718
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:18,074
We, we don't have Viennetta.

719
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,577
They discontinued
Viennetta years ago.

720
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:21,453
We're gonna go straight
to the teenage lovemaking.

721
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,205
I'm sorry, what?
Yeah.

722
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,456
Wait, w-what are
you talking about?

723
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,833
Your mom packed a bag.

724
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,335
I brought your toothbrush
and your jammies...

725
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:29,836
- your sleepy T-shirt and, and boxers.
- Mom. No, I did, yeah.

726
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:32,214
You're getting married,
you're not kids anymore.

727
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,382
As far as we're concerned,
you're adults,

728
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,760
so knock yourself out. Carole
and I are gonna go catch a movie.

729
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,887
Hiram and I are going
to stay here,

730
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,639
but we'll put on some music

731
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,134
just so you don't think
we're trying to listen in.

732
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:48,439
I can't believe
this is happening.

733
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,724
I love you.

734
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,643
Let's go to bed.

735
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,478
Okay.

736
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,869
I know it's tempting,

737
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,329
but, uh,
no monkey business tonight,

738
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,581
not with my dads
around the corner.

739
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,209
Of course.

740
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,043
Are you, you gonna use
the bathroom first?

741
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:12,546
Yes, if that's okay because
my ritual is pretty elaborate.

742
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:14,422
Okay.

743
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:15,924
RACHEL:
<i>First I shower.</i>

744
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,751
<i>I'm more thorough
than during my morning bath.</i>

745
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,970
<i>The world is
a very dirty place.</i>

746
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:23,181
<i>Brush teeth, eyebrows,
makeup remover, moisturizer,</i>

747
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,975
<i>followed by an ice water
face bath</i>

748
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,744
<i>Ã  la Joan Crawford
in</i> Mommie Dearest... 

749
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,228
<i>the height of glamour.</i>

750
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,263
<i>Find something cute to wear.</i>

751
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,714
<i>Text my dads to let them know</i>

752
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,216
<i>I'm almost ready
for my evening tea...</i>

753
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,734
<i>well, we'll skip
that one tonight.</i>

754
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,443
<i>Then condition
and brush my hair.</i>

755
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:37,737
Hi.
Hi.

756
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:39,907
Hey, I-I kind of need to use the
bathroom; it was a really big meal.

757
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,285
No, you can't do that here.

758
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,411
Where am I supposed to do it?

759
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,538
Um, at your house?

760
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,998
Hilarious... I'm just
gonna jump in beside you.

761
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:48,957
I don't mind if you stay.

762
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,417
Oh, for God's sakes, Finn.

763
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:52,069
Can't you at least try to keep
some sort of mystery

764
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,253
until we're married?

765
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:54,921
What do you think it's gonna
be like in New York?

766
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:56,340
We'll be on opposite
schedules, so, you know,

767
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,875
you can use the bathroom
while I'm at school

768
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,135
and I'll use it when you're
at... when you're working

769
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:01,344
or what-whatever.

770
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,056
What's that supposed
to mean?

771
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,583
You don't think I'm gonna be
doing anything in New York?

772
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,268
You think I'm just gonna be
around to bring you Diet Cokes

773
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:09,311
and cheer you on?

774
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,554
RACHEL (muffled):
I knew it.

775
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,605
I knew one day
you'd be intimidated

776
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,689
by my success,
but I didn't think

777
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,941
it would be before we graduated.

778
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,229
Where are you going?

779
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,763
The bathroom downstairs.

780
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:21,598
I can guarantee one thing
you're not gonna have to add

781
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,450
to your little crazy-town
nighttime ritual...

782
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,152
getting into
bed with me.

783
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,235
(Sighs)

784
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,149
FYI, we got a private
party here tonight, hon.

785
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,720
Oh, I know, I know,
I'm, I'm early.

786
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:47,039
Well, according to
this, I'm, I'm early.

787
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,933
I'm supposed to be
meeting my cutie here

788
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:49,976
for a long overdue
reunion,

789
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:53,438
but I, uh, I guess
he didn't make it.

790
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,514
Wouldn't be too sure
about that.

791
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:01,363
I knew it!

792
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:03,606
Oh, See's candies!

793
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,284
"Dear Kurt,
Happy Valentine's Day.

794
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,661
I think I love you."

795
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:09,746
Wait. You <i>think</i> you love me?

796
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,486
Karofsky.

797
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,550
So, you tormented me,
shoved me into lockers,

798
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:24,552
called me horrible names and

799
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,971
hate-kissed me.

800
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,473
Now, after one conversation

801
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,475
in a bar, you want us
to be together?

802
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,436
When I was at McKinley,
I hated who I was.

803
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,587
I took that out
on you because...

804
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,900
there you were, so proud.

805
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,237
I've wanted to call you since
that night at Scandals, and,

806
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:44,563
look, it's taken me a while,

807
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,682
but for the first time
in my life,

808
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:50,912
I'm trying to be honest
about what I feel.

809
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:54,332
And I'm flattered,
I... I-I really am, but

810
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,584
David, you just think
that you love me.

811
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,128
You don't really love me.

812
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,529
Oh, you've helped me so much,
Kurt, you don't know.

813
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,081
I haven't come out
at school yet,

814
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,449
but maybe I will next year.

815
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,759
David, look,

816
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,470
I am so proud of you for...
for coming so far.

817
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,889
And I want you
to be happy and...

818
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,674
and you will be happy,

819
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,542
but I'm with Blaine.

820
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,714
A-And... I like you.

821
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:20,984
But just as friends.

822
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:22,777
I should go.

823
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:25,554
Wait.
Now, you don't have to go.

824
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,891
I hope you like the candies.

825
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,976
The butterscotch ones
are my favorite.

826
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,457
Mine, too.

827
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,500
Hey, Karofsky.
Nick.

828
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,753
You guys hanging out
for Valentine's Day?

829
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:40,986
No. No.

830
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,555
No, no. We-We used
to go to the same school.

831
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:45,133
We just bumped
into each other.

832
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,260
- That's exactly what it looked like.
- I gotta go.

833
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:50,013
David...
I'll talk to you later.

834
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:52,081
(laughs)

835
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,919
I'm really glad we
kissed and made up.

836
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,637
I mean, it is Valentine's
Day, after all.

837
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,339
Mm-hmm.

838
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,341
This whole living
together thing

839
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,459
and being right on
top of one another...

840
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,096
it's definitely a lot more
challenging than I thought.

841
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:08,564
It's like real
life and stuff.

842
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,932
I know.

843
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,183
I have to be honest.

844
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:13,135
I was a little...

845
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:16,498
afraid of what it would be like
for us to really be married.

846
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:17,740
I don't know.

847
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,250
I think we can
do it, right?

848
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,693
I think we can.

849
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,997
Good.

850
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,482
Mm.

851
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:29,219
Mm.
Mm.

852
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,655
Except for one thing.

853
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:35,600
It's 7:15.
No way.

854
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,259
Yeah.

855
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,346
You want to go to Breadstix?

856
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,048
I was hoping you'd say that.

857
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,216
Let's go.

858
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,737
LeROY:
I like

859
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,531
Carole after three
Chardonnays.

860
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,699
Shh. Listen, listen.

861
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,508
Shh. Listen.

862
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,511
Silence.

863
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:57,956
They're not fighting anymore.

864
00:35:57,957 --> 00:35:59,165
It's not working.

865
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,416
What, is he defiling
our baby?

866
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,701
- Do you need a Xanax?
- I already took three.

867
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,420
This is a stupid plan.
We've never

868
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:05,964
lied to her
like this before.

869
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:08,508
Honesty, respect, dance...

870
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,176
those are the foundations
of the Berry family.

871
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:12,512
These are desperate times.

872
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:13,805
Every teenager does

873
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:16,141
the exact opposite
of what their parents tell them.

874
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:19,394
I don't know where she got
this idea of marriage anyway,

875
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:22,522
but she's not going
to go through with it.

876
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:26,609
She is a little girl
with big dreams...

877
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,570
It's too bad. I like Finn.

878
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:32,282
Nobody is saying that
they have to break up.

879
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,450
They're just too
young to get married.

880
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,537
As long as we continue
to do what we're doing...

881
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:41,106
lying about supporting it
utterly and completely...

882
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,209
she'll come around, and
she'll see it our way.

883
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,836
It's reverse psychology.

884
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,921
- It's the only way.
- RACHEL: Hey.

885
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,506
We're gonna go
go Breadstix.

886
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,758
We decided that we want to just
be with our friends tonight.

887
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,303
And then I'm probably
just gonna go home after.

888
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:54,953
R-Really?

889
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:57,849
Yeah, we thought we heard
you guys squabbling up there.

890
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,226
Cohabitating is
not-not-not so easy, huh?

891
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:02,187
LeROY: I hope this
little experiment

892
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:06,524
doesn't cause you to postpone
the marriage for a few months?

893
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,851
- HIRAM: Right, or years.
- Don't do that.

894
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,195
Actually, it's the opposite.

895
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:11,654
We just decided
that, you know,

896
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,115
since it's gonna take us
a little while to get used

897
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:17,285
to one another, that we might
as well just, you know,

898
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,694
get started.

899
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,262
We're getting
married in May!

900
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:21,456
Right-Right after Nationals!

901
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:22,540
It's gonna be a
spring wedding.

902
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,266
(Rachel laughs)

903
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,319
I'll talk to you guys more about
it when I get home tonight.

904
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,463
I'm so excited.
(Hiram mutters)

905
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,298
- And I love you both very much.
- Love you

906
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:31,606
so much.

907
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:34,385
Okay, well, I'll be
back in a little while.

908
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,078
Bye.

909

914
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,155
Okay.

915

Everyone look under your
chairs, except you, Artie.

916

(Cheering and applause)

925
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:13,889
I would like to thank my daddy
for making tonight possible.

926
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,957
And P.S.:
He is not in the Mafia.

927
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,843
And next up,
straight from heaven above,

928
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:19,555
give it up for the God Squad!

929
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:23,768
(Applause and cheering)

930
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:26,354
Hi. My name's Joe.
Santana Lopez asked me

931
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:27,770
if the God Squad
would sing a love song

932
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,071
for Brittany S. Pierce.

933
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,739
And after thinking
and praying about it,

934
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,068
I knew there was only one
right answer.

935
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:35,744
Absolutely.

936
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:36,945
Love is love, man.

937
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,909
So, here's for Brittany
from Santana.

938
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,869
