Look at me go,

00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:05,575
leading an army of
half-dead zombie warriors

3
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:06,911
on a quest to save a princess.

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,879
Now,<i> that</i> is solid hero stuff.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,115
One of your most heroic scenarios, sir.

6
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,017
- Legendary.
- Totally.

7
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,085
Though you have to admit,

8
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:15,286
when the flesh hits the road,

9
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:17,521
it is feeling just a bit challenging,

10
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:19,090
is it not?

I don't know why I bother.

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,537
I mean, they're basically
useless, aren't they?

18
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,339
Yeah, pretty much.

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,842
Although I have noticed they
are quite drawn to you, sir.

20
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:39,910
Maybe it's because you were
briefly dead. [Chuckles]

21
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,046
Oh, yes, and why was that, Sid?

22
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,247
Why was I briefly dead?

23
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:45,549
I told you how bad I feel about that.

24
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,119
- You ever gonna let it go?
- Oh, you mean like

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,587
when you let go of the sword
and it flew through the air,

26
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,656
sticking into my chest,
temporarily killing me?

27
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,394
So I'll take that as a "no," then.

28
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,800
Right. We're almost to Valencia.

29
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:03,834
I'm gonna scout ahead to that castle,

30
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,202
see if it's truly empty.

31
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:08,339
Wow. Valencia.

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,874
Seems like just yesterday,

33
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,576
I was the worst tyrant
this land has ever seen.

34
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:13,878
That was weird.

35
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,080
Yeah, cuckoo bananas. You
stay here with Roberta.

36
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,950
I think that's a great idea.

37
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,419
Don't you, Richard?

38
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,356
Hey, Galavant, quick
story I want to tell you.

39
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,458
I need your advice.

40
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,561
I really want to kiss Roberta, and stuff,

41
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:31,662
and I think the timing is right.

42
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,097
But did she say she likes me?

43
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:34,231
Get to the point.

44
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,299
Do... do I ask her?

45
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,035
Do I just grab her and kiss her?

46
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:40,137
Sneak up behind her in
dark clothing, shout "boo,"

47
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,272
and kiss her when she's screaming?

48
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,007
What? Look, I would love to help you.

49
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,176
I've sort of got more
important things to do, okay?

50
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:48,446
But, no, no, definitely
don't do the "boo" version.

51
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,214
It's sort of frowned upon, okay?

52
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,215
I've got to go.

53
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,550
No "boo" version. Good to know.

54
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:57,321
[Groaning] Look, guys, guys, guys!

55
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,389
Stop! [Groaning stops]

do a secret castle scout.

00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:21,378
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Come on.

[Groaning resumes]

65
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,018
So...

66
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,188
Uh, Bobby, I meant to ask you...

67
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,257
Hey, what's your favorite tree?

68
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,426
Because kids these days are all into oaks,

69
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,593
but I like a spruce, and...

70
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:40,965
Mmm!

71
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,132
Oh, my God.

72
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,068
That was wonderful.

73
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,572
[Roberta laughs]

74
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:52,510
So, we'll just stand here

75
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,912
and listen to this happen, then, I guess.

Super poor form to kill us!

Will you stop it?

83

You're making us look like tools.

We are tools... Tools that will be used

swords dull... with murder!

Sorry. When I'm nervous,
my jokes get kind of weird.

We'll be fine.

Sure, we can't beat the Valencians

with my cousin's toy army,

90

but terms of surrender are
always offered before a battle.

Easy-peasy, pudding and pie.

We're gonna pudding and die.

00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:32,162
I'll try and pull it together.

94

This was such a good idea.

95
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:37,235
I think getting out of the
castle was great for us,

96
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:38,503
you know?

97
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,405
There's nothing like a good old war camp.

98
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,340
Fresh air, sounds of nature.

99
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,242
And the promise of getting to kill people.

100
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,678
It just really gives a man
a lift, you know what I mean?

101
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,513
Yeah. It's nice.

She's probably come to
discuss terms of surrender.

I don't want her to
surrender. I want to kill her!

Hmm?

112
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,509
Sorry. It's pretty tense in here.

113
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,611
I thought we might discuss terms,

114
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,579
avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

115
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,681
Well, I kind of am here for
the unnecessary bloodshed.

116
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,183
The rules of war dictate that...

117
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,918
God, you're going to be
lame about this, aren't you?

118
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,454
Fine. Here are my terms.

119
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:30,622
Complete surrender.

120
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,757
Hand over your castle, your gold,

121
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,959
your jewels, your livestock.

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,027
I think that's a bit extreme.

123
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,429
Not done.

124
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,832
All the men of fighting age will
be conscripted into our army.

125
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,035
Oh, and I want all the children
to put their toys in a pile.

126
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,071

Your terms are monstrous, but I think...

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,786
Oh, and one last thing.

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,657
I want you to be my new handmaiden.

136
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,666
Your main duty will be cleaning my crown.

That is not your crown.

That is the official crown
of the Queen of Valencia,

192
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,144
You challenged this giant army to a fight,

193
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:07,512
and you told them you have the bearer

194

of the sword of the one true king,

195
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,348
which, I might add, we don't.

196

You heard Madalena's terms.

00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:18,656
We have to fight. And we will win.

201
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:20,658
How, exactly? Our army has no weapons.

202
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:21,926
We'll improvise.

203
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:24,329
Tell the people to gather
anything we can use as weapons.

204
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,464
- And we will make our stand.
- All right.

205
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:28,132
I just wish you hadn't riled up Madalena.

206
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,767
She seemed really pissed.

207
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,837
Queenie, relax. Everything's fine.

208
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,137
Relax?

209
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,275
If the one true king is really on her side,

210
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,911
that's bad news.

211
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:42,447
The prophecy says he who
pulls the sword from the stump

212
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:45,149
will unite the kingdoms
under his glorious rule.

213
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,286
The prophecy's never
wrong. That's just science.

214
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:49,754
Look, I trained this army.

215
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:51,155
And they're more than capable

216
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:54,324
of handling some stupid
king with some fancy sword.

217
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,962
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you should worry.

218
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,798
But luckily, we have a
secret weapon on our side,

219
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:04,269
and that secret weapon is...

220
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,203
Moi.

221
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:06,604
- What?
- Prat.

222
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:09,240
Not only am I the most respected
wedding planner in the land,

223
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,176
I'm also a practitioner of the dark arts.

224
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:15,847
A master of the D'Dew.

225
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,448
What's that?

226
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,884
"Dark, dark evil way"... The D'Dew.

227
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,686
Shut up, Barry.

228
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,621
But what he said is right.

229
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:25,690
Why do you call it "the D'Dew"?

230
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,859
Wouldn't it be simpler
just to say "The Dew"?

231
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Good point.

232
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:31,362
No, no, no. The way isn't just dark.

233
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,830
It's<i> dark</i> dark.

234
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:40,171
D'Dew is the most powerful
force to ever exist.

235
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:42,440
With it, you can control events,

236
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:43,941
bend them to your will,

237
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,909
and turn everything to your favor.

238
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,148
It's also helped me with
my stubborn tummy fat.

239
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,749
So, all we have to do is
eat this, and we have magic?

No, no. Oh, sorry.

Yeah... oh, good. Barry, order the bowls.

Come on, Gareth. Let's do D'Dew.

253
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,011
Can I have a word with you for a minute?

00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,111
What? Why?

I don't know.

258

- Yes.

win the battle without it?

262
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:40,931
Positive.
