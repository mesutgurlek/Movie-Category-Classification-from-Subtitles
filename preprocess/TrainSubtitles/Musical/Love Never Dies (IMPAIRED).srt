327
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,276
RAOUL: What is it, anyway?

328
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,946
I don't know, it was
just here on the piano.

329
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,864
Well, it hurts my head.

330
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,160
<i>Please, let's not fight, dear</i>

331
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,247
<i>I'm sure Mr. Hammerstein</i>
<i>never intended a slight, dear</i>

332
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,334
<i>How dare he patronize us?</i>
<i>We should never have accepted</i>

333
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,630
<i>We need the money, that's all</i>

334
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,882
<i>That's why things haven't been right, dear</i>

335
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,137
<i>Why doesn't it surprise me</i>
<i>that I get the blame here?</i>

336
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,015
<i>Let's leave tonight, dear</i>

337
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,605
<i>if that would serve to
ease your troubled mind</i>

338
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:50,363
<i>Leave the hurt behind</i>

339
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,867
<i>Father, dear, come over here</i>

340
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,495
<i>and look at what they gave to me</i>

341
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:04,502
<i>Wind it up and, Father, see</i>
<i>Look, it plays a melody</i>

342
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,181
Raoul.

343
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:17,891
(KNOCKING)

344
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,475
What's this?

345
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,275
What is it?

346
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,028
It's from Hammerstein.

347
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,989
He wants to meet me in
the hotel bar. Alone.

348
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,700
Alone?
Well, he may lack courtesy,

349
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,368
but he does show a certain savoir faire

350
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,995
in choosing a business rendezvous.

351
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,955
Raoul, please.
Please what?

352
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,999
Nothing.

353
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:52,967
<i>Father never plays with me</i>

354
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,304
<i>Doesn't he love me?</i>

355
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,847
Oh, darling.

356
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,644
<i>Love's a curious thing</i>

357
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:07,774
<i>It often comes disguised</i>

358
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,654
<i>Look at love the wrong way</i>

359
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:19,118
<i>it goes unrecognized</i>

360
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,915
<i>So look with your heart</i>

361
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,834
<i>and not with your eyes</i>

362
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,587
<i>The heart understands</i>

363
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,840
<i>The heart never lies</i>

364
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,718
<i>Believe what it feels</i>

365
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,055
<i>and trust what it shows</i>

366
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,516
<i>Look with your heart</i>

367
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,271
<i>The heart always knows</i>

368
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:51,609
<i>Love is not always beautiful</i>

369
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:56,572
<i>not at the start</i>

370
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,076
<i>So open your arms</i>

371
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,371
<i>and close your eyes tight</i>

372

<i>Look with your heart</i>

<i>your heart will be right</i>

375
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:18,261
<i>Learn from someone who knows</i>

376
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:23,599
<i>Make sure you don't forget</i>

377
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:28,271
<i>Love you misunderstand</i>

378
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:35,069
<i>is love that you'll regret</i>

<i>Look with your heart</i>

<i>The heart can't be fooled</i>

382
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,791
<i>The heart is too wise</i>

383
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,461
<i>Forget what you think</i>

384
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,339
<i>Ignore what you hear</i>

385
00:27:54,423 --> 00:28:00,303
<i>Look with your heart, it always sees clear</i>

00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,613
Time for bed now, Gustave.

394
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,662
I'll be in in a minute.

395
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,072
(GASPING)

396
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,912
<i>So it was all an empty lie?</i>

397
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,042
<i>One final lie to fool us all?</i>

398
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:40,421
<i>To make your death our story's end?</i>

399
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,259
<i>To put your life beyond recall?</i>

400
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:50,431
<i>How dare you come and claim me now</i>

401
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:55,603
<i>invade my life, ensnare my voice?</i>

402
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,691
<i>If you could know the pain I've known</i>

403
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:05,988
<i>then you would know I had no choice</i>

404
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,950
<i>My Christine</i>

405
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,077
<i>Your Christine</i>

406
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:16,874
<i>I was yours one brief night long ago</i>

407
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,751
<i>Long ago</i>

408
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:24,131
<i>with a man that I no longer know</i>

409
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,509
<i>Ah, Christine!</i>

410
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:32,515
<i>You came and found where I hid</i>

411
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,645
<i>Don't you deny that you did</i>

412
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:44,652
<i>that long ago night!</i>

413
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:53,160
<i>Once, there was a night</i>

414
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:58,332
<i>beneath a moonless sky</i>

415
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:03,713
<i>too dark to see a thing</i>

416
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>too dark to even try</i>

417
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,848
<i>I stole to your side</i>

418
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,519
<i>tormented by my choice</i>

419
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,899
<i>I couldn't see your face</i>

420
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:30,197
<i>yet trembled at your voice</i>

421
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:35,661
<i>and I touched you</i>

422
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,788
<i>And I felt you</i>

423
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:42,460
<i>And I heard those ravishing refrains!</i>

424
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,422
<i>The music of your pulse</i>

425
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,259
<i>The singing in your veins!</i>

426
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,219
<i>And I held you</i>

427
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>And I touched you</i>

428
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,555
<i>And embraced you</i>

429
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
<i>And I felt you</i>

430
00:32:55,724 --> 00:33:00,186
<i>And with every breath and every sigh!</i>

431
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,273
<i>I felt no longer scared</i>

432
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:08,611
<i>I felt no longer shy</i>

433
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:13,449
BOTH: At last,
<i>our feelings bared</i>

434
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:19,872
<i>beneath the moonless sky</i>

435
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:25,252
<i>And blind in the dark</i>

436
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:30,091
<i>as soul gazed into soul</i>

437
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:35,596
<i>I looked into your heart</i>

438
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:41,185
<i>and saw you pure and whole</i>

439
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,856
<i>Cloaked under the night</i>

440
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,985
<i>with nothing to suppress</i>

441
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:56,325
<i>a woman and a man</i>

442
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:01,664
<i>no more and yet no less</i>

443
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,418
<i>And I kissed you</i>

444
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,378
<i>And caressed you</i>

445
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,841
<i>And the world around us fell away</i>

446
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,761
<i>We said things in the dark</i>

447
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,306
<i>we never dared to say</i>

448
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,058
<i>And I caught you</i>

449
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,184
<i>And I kissed you</i>

450
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,228
<i>And I took you And I begged you</i>

451
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,149
<i>With a need too urgent to deny</i>

452
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,445
<i>And nothing mattered then</i>

453
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:36,532
<i>except for you and I</i>

454
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,661
<i>Again and then again</i>

455
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:47,501
<i>beneath the moonless sky</i>

456
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,966
<i>And when it was done</i>

457
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,721
<i>before the sun could rise</i>

458
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:04,977
<i>ashamed of what I was</i>

459
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:10,524
<i>afraid to see your eyes</i>

460
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,904
<i>I stood while you slept</i>

461
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:19,575
<i>and whispered a goodbye</i>

462
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:26,540
<i>And slipped into the dark</i>

463
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:33,088
<i>beneath the moonless sky</i>

464
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:38,552
<i>And I loved you!</i>
<i>Yes, I loved you!</i>

465
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,807
<i>I'd have followed anywhere you led</i>

466
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,102
<i>I woke to swear my love</i>

467
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,648
<i>and found you gone instead</i>

468
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,483
<i>And I loved you!</i>

469
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,651
<i>I loved you!</i>

470
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,653
<i>And I left you!</i>
<i>How I loved you!</i>

471
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,656
<i>And I had to, both of us knew why</i>

472
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,074
<i>We both knew why</i>

473
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,994
<i>And yet I won't regret</i>

474
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,541
<i>from now until I die</i>

475
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:13,003
<i>the night I can't forget</i>

476
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:19,802
<i>beneath a moonless sky</i>

477
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,514
<i>And now?</i>

478
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,599
<i>How can you talk of now?</i>

479
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,103
<i>For us...</i>

480
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,772
There is no now.

481
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,462
<i>Once upon another time</i>

482
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:02,469
<i>our story had only begun</i>

483
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,390
<i>You chose to turn the page</i>

484
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,812
<i>and I made choices, too</i>

485
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,191
<i>Once upon that other time</i>

486
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,740
<i>we did what we thought must be done</i>

00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,744
<i>And now, we have no choice</i>

488

<i>Just one little thing, an aria</i>

650
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:26,236
<i>Christine, it's a thrill just
to share the bill with you</i>

651
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,989
<i>My dear old friend</i>

652
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,783
<i>it's becoming clear, old friend</i>

653
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,703
<i>someone's overlooked his leading act</i>

654
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,163
<i>Well, double booked to be exact</i>

655
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:43,003
<i>Now, my old friend</i>
<i>Can you clarify, old friend</i>

656
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,755
<i>this Mr. Y
with whom we've signed</i>

657
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,550
<i>who hides behind the pseudonym?</i>

658
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,135
<i>You haven't guessed?</i>

659
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,095
<i>I've no idea</i>

660
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,847
<i>It's him!</i>

661
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,973
<i>Him?</i>

662
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,391
<i>That's what I said</i>

663
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,726
<i>You work for him!</i>

664
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,227
<i>Now you do, too</i>

665
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,605
<i>And my poor wife, we thought him dead!</i>

666
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,106
<i>She'll be appalled!</i>

667
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,358
<i>Unless she knew</i>

668
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,614
<i>Darling, please, are you all right?</i>

669
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:14,659
<i>Tell me now, this music!</i>
<i>Who was its creator?</i>

670
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:19,623
<i>Darling, please, don't squeeze so tight</i>

671
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:23,293
<i>Something's going on here</i>
<i>I'll deal with you later</i>

672
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,628
<i>What's this about?</i>

673
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,920
<i>I wish I knew</i>

674
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,673
<i>The truth will out before we're through</i>

675
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,426
<i>My dear old friend</i>

676
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,262
<i>Can't believe you're here, old friend</i>

677
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:35,597
<i>My dear Christine</i>

678
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,848
<i>My dear vicomte</i>

679
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,141
<i>What does this mean?</i>

680
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,517
<i>What does he want?</i>

681
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:44,689
<i>My grand old friend</i>
<i>I don't understand, old friend</i>

682
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,651
<i>Maybe it's a joke!</i>
<i>Some silly game!</i>

683
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,403
<i>And what his aim is in the end</i>

684
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,365
<i>I couldn't claim to comprehend</i>

685
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,200
<i>Old friend!</i>

686
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,409
<i>It isn't fair!</i>

687
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,869
<i>We need to think</i>

688
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,120
<i>I need some air</i>

689
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,330
<i>I need a drink</i>

690
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:06,044
<i>My poor old friend</i>
<i>Isn't this a bore, old friend?</i>

691
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,420
<i>I'm still amazed</i>

692
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,755
<i>I'm still confused</i>

693
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,173
<i>I'm feeling dazed</i>

694
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,633
<i>I'm feeling used</i>

695
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:16,763
<i>And yet, old friends let's
not get upset, old friends</i>

696
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,223
<i>We can sort this out</i>

697
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,683
<i>I'm sure we will</i>

698
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,059
<i>Without a doubt</i>

699
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,644
<i>Because we're still</i>

700
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,313
<i>such grand old friends</i>

701
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,066
<i>such devoted, grand old friends</i>

702
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,735
<i>Back again at last with everyone</i>

703
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,738
<i>Isn't it great?</i>
<i>Won't this be so much fun?</i>

704
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:38,743
<i>With two old friends trustable
and true, old friends!</i>

705
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,453
<i>Let us raise a glass</i>

706
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,705
<i>To times gone by</i>

707
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,206
<i>To Mr. Y</i>

708
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,418
<i>To happy ends</i>

709
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,170
<i>To such sincere</i>

710
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,965
<i>and very dear</i>

711
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:58,763
<i>old friends</i>

712
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:06,271
<i>Old friends</i>

713
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,569
No offense, but I need
something stronger. Raoul!

714
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,321
Madame, I shall see you
tomorrow night at the concert,

715
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,867
where I am sure you will
both surpass yourselves.

716
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,078
Good day.

717
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,831
Raoul! Please.

718
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,291
I can explain!

719
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:28,918
I'm sorry.

720
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,005
Meg, I wonder would
you mind... Gustave?

721
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,341
What's wrong? My son. He was with...

722
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,427
Gustave! Gustave!

723
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,636
MEG: Christine, wait!

724
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,365
<i>Come along and follow us</i>

725
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,368
<i>Come and follow faster</i>

726
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,497
<i>Come along and follow us</i>

727
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,541
<i>Come and meet the master</i>

728
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,586
<i>Hurry up and follow us</i>

729
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,631
<i>Hurry if you care to</i>

730
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:18,009
<i>Soon the dark will swallow us</i>

731
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:23,640
<i>Follow if you dare to</i>

732
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,231
<i>What is this place?</i>

733
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:39,239
<i>This is my realm, illusion's domain</i>

734
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:45,495
<i>where music and beauty and artifice reign</i>

735
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,958
One moment, little vicomte,
while I prepare our adventure.

736
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,125
May I?

737
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,255
Does the young vicomte play?

738
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,881
(PIANO PLAYING)

739
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,348
What's this?

740
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:11,855
<i>Just a song in my head</i>

741
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,565
Go on.

742
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,614
<i>I think it's beautiful</i>

743
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:26,786
<i>Hear how each note seems to float?</i>

744
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:32,250
<i>Hear how they all die and fall?</i>

745
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:37,130
<i>Just like the night</i>

746
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,550
<i>It's beautiful</i>

747
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,634
This boy...

748
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,554
<i>So very beautiful!</i>

749
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,597
This music...

750
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,059
<i>Music that comes uncontrolled</i>

751
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,644
He plays like me...

752
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,900
<i>Haunting and lovely and bold</i>

753
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:02,614
<i>He's just 10 years old</i>

754
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,074
<i>Ten years</i>

755
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,159
<i>old!</i>

756
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:19,839
My God!

757
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,607
Come with me.
I need to show you something.

758
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,653
Follow me. I want to
know what you think!

759
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,983
<i>Have you ever yearned to go past
the world you think you know?</i>

760
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,987
<i>Been enthralled to the call</i>
<i>of the beauty underneath?</i>

761
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:28,199
<i>Have you let it draw you in past
the place where dreams begin?</i>

762
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,662
<i>Felt the full breathless pull
of the beauty underneath?</i>

763
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,833
<i>When the dark unfolds its wings</i>

764
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:40,795
<i>do you sense the strangest things?</i>

765
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:45,049
<i>Things no one would ever guess?</i>

766
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:49,762
<i>Things mere words cannot express?</i>

767
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,847
Yes!

768
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,892
<i>Do you find yourself beguiled
by the dangerous and wild?</i>

769
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,938
<i>Do you feed on the need</i>
<i>for the beauty underneath?</i>

770
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,026
<i>Have you felt your senses surge
and surrendered to the urge?</i>

771
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:07,238
<i>And been hooked as you looked
at the beauty underneath?</i>

772
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,617
<i>When you stare behind the night</i>

773
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:15,788
<i>can you glimpse its primal might?</i>

774
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,751
<i>Might you hunger to possess</i>

775
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:25,048
<i>hunger that you can't repress?</i>

776
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,632
Yes!

777
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,512
<i>It seems so beautiful!</i>

778
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:35,183
<i>So strange yet beautiful!</i>

779
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:41,355
<i>Everything's just as you say!</i>

780
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,985
<i>And he's so beautiful</i>

781
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,572
<i>Perhaps too beautiful</i>

782
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:55,787
<i>What I suspect cannot be</i>

783
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,708
<i>And yet somehow we both see</i>

784
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:05,588
<i>the very same way!</i>

785
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,673
<i>Is there music in your head?</i>

786
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,759
<i>Have you followed where it led</i>

787
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,846
<i>and been graced with a taste</i>
<i>of the beauty underneath?</i>

788
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,932
<i>Does it fill your every sense?</i>

789
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,934
<i>Is it terribly intense?</i>

790
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,936
<i>Tell me you need it, too</i>

791
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,271
<i>need the beauty underneath!</i>

792
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,526
<i>When it lifts its voice and sings</i>

793
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,655
<i>don't you feel amazing things?</i>

794
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,575
<i>Things you know you can't confess?</i>

795
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:40,540
<i>Things you thirst for nonetheless?</i>

796
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,377
<i>It's all so beautiful!</i>

797
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,628
PHANTOM: Can it be?

798
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:49,632
<i>Almost too beautiful!</i>

799
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,221
<i>Do you see what I see?</i>

800
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,305
Heavenly!

801
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,725
<i>To him, it's beautiful!</i>

802
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:03,479
<i>My world is beautiful!</i>

803
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:09,569
<i>How can this be what it seems?</i>

804
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:16,736
<i>All of my most secret dreams</i>

805
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:22,498
<i>somehow set free!</i>

806
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,628
<i>You can feel it?</i>

807
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,754
Yes!

808
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:29,839
<i>Come closer</i>

809
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,923
Yes!

<i>Ten dark years of toil and tears</i>

910
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,201

One more.

01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,239
Ah, buddy, don't you think you had enough?

922
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,365
It's practically morning already.

923
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,991
One more, I said!

924
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,703
All right.
All right.

925
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:25,749
My shift is over anyway, so
let's settle the bill, okay?

926
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,220
Jeez, you're in a bad way, ain't ya?

927
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,305
Worse than most that wind up here.

928
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,728
Here's the morning shift. Maybe
he'll know what to do with you.

929
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,895
(SCOFFS)

930
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,689
Yes.

931
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:53,652
Yes, what to do with me.
That's the question, isn't it?

932
01:07:55,196 --> 01:08:00,117
That's always been the question,
ever since the beginning.

933
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,123
<i>She looks for sympathy</i>

934

01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,717
<i>She asks for honesty</i>

<i>She needs my tender kiss</i>

<i>She begs it of me</i>

01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,277
<i>I give her ugliness</i>

<i>Why does she love me?</i>

941
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,872
<i>She yearns for higher things</i>

942

<i>Things I can't give her</i>

943
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,005
<i>The rush that music brings</i>

944
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,384
<i>I can't deliver</i>

945
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,430
<i>And even when she sings</i>

946
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,892
<i>And soars above me</i>

947
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:10,729
<i>I try to clip her wings</i>

948
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:16,568
<i>Why does she love me?</i>

949
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,156
<i>One more drink, sir</i>

950
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,034
<i>That's what I need, don't you think, sir?</i>

951
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:31,083
<i>Leave the hurt behind...</i>

952
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,215
Did you hear me?
Another drink!

953
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,597
<i>She wants the man I was</i>

954
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:50,227
<i>Husband and father</i>

955
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,273
<i>At least, she thinks she does</i>

956
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:58,485
<i>She needn't bother</i>

957
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:02,573
<i>Beneath this mask I wear</i>

958
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,868
<i>There's nothing of me</i>

959
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:09,955
<i>Just horror, shame, despair</i>

960
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:15,252
<i>Why does she love me?</i>

961
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,006
<i>How 'bout you, sir?</i>

962
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,010
<i>Tell me, what am I to do, sir?</i>

963
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:29,474
<i>Leave the hurt behind</i>

964
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,856
<i>Morning, Bernie Coffee, please</i>

965
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,399
<i>Hurry up before I freeze</i>

966
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,484
<i>I'll just take it black</i>

967
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,906
Vicomte.
Fancy meeting you here.

968
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,407
Miss Giry.

969
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,327
Drowning your sorrows, are you?

970
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:54,249
On the contrary, I'm celebrating
a reunion with old friends.

971
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,337
Friends I had long thought dead and buried.

972
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,840
And you?

<i>This town is coarse and cold and mean</i>

Miss Giry?

986
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,401
What do you think will happen, Vicomte?

987
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,070
At the concert.
Have you thought?

988
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:09,616
When he hears her sing
again? When she sings...

989
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,702
Miss Giry, I wish I knew.

990
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:15,122
But I'm afraid her music has always
been somewhat of a mystery to me.

991
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,290
But there's more to this
than the music, monsieur.

992
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,501
Believe me. I saw it.

993
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,963
There's something...
I don't know.

994
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,508
Just take her away. Now.

995
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,885
For all our sakes.

996
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,263
<i>Sail across the sea</i>

What are you talking about?

1001
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,283
Trust me, monsieur.
Don't let her sing.

1002
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:56,788
Once he gets into her soul, there's
nothing she won't do for him.

1003
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,543
<i>Leave this place behind</i>

He's not Mephistopheles, you know?

1006
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:12,179
When it comes down to it, he's
just another circus freak.

1007
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,346
I'm not afraid of him.

1008

No. It can't be!

1009

Not afraid of me, you say?

1010

Stay back! Or I'll kill you, I promise you.

Insolent boy.

1012

You think you own more
of her soul than I do?

1013
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,653
She is my wife!

1014
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,114
Your music may speak to her,

1015
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,576
but her heart will always follow me.

1016

In just a few moments, Christine Daaé,

the world's most celebrated songbird,

1154

will be making her American debut.

1155
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,391
<i>Mother, did you watch?</i>
<i>Everything is solved</i>

1156
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,686
<i>Mother, can you tell? The
new routine it went so well</i>

1157
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,355
<i>I was worried just a touch</i>

1158
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,148
<i>That it might've been too much</i>

1159
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:04,901
<i>Just a bit Well, rather free</i>

1160
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,986
<i>But just listen to that crowd</i>

1161
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,989
<i>Why, they've never been so
loud Screaming only for me</i>

01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,115
Meg...

1163
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,954
<i>And the master must have heard
Every note and every word</i>

1164
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,081
<i>Mother, tell me, did he see?</i>

1165
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:19,290
Meg, stop it.

1166
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,835
<i>Even he will now concede</i>
<i>I'm the only one he'll need</i>

1167
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:27,298
<i>Meg, sweet fool You did all that you could</i>

1168

<i>Charming, bright And yet still not enough</i>

1169
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:32,303
What do you mean?

1170
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:36,057
<i>How you danced!</i>
<i>They're all entranced</i>

1171
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:40,144
<i>Yes, all but the one whose
entrancement we sought</i>

1172
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,521
He wasn't even there?

1173
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,149
<i>Where, poor girl, do you think that he was?</i>

1174
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,903
<i>Yes, that's right, in with her all along</i>

1175
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:49,988
With Christine?

1176
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,533
<i>Dreaming of their son, their love</i>

1177
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:56,619
<i>Too smitten to spare you</i>
<i>one moment of thought</i>

1178
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:57,745
Their son?

1179
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,081
<i>All that you gave him has all been a waste</i>

1180
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,249
No, you're wrong!

1181
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,251
<i>All that you've done It has all been erased</i>

1182
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,335
Don't say that!

1183
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,337
<i>Now he has them</i>

1184
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:12,468
<i>As for us We have both been replaced</i>

1185
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,346
No! No!

1186
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:22,520
Gustave, could you hand me those earrings?
The sapphires on the left.

1187
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:30,486
There!

1188
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:33,156
How do I look?

1189
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:37,493
<i>You look so beautiful</i>

1190
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:42,040
<i>So very beautiful</i>

1191
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,253
<i>Like a queen in a book</i>

1192
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:52,342
<i>You, too, are beautiful</i>

1193
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,971
<i>So very beautiful</i>

1194
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:02,894
<i>Once this performance is through</i>

1195
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:09,442
<i>We'll spend some time, just us two</i>

1196
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,488
<i>Won't that be fun?</i>

1197
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,660
Father! Doesn't Mother look lovely tonight?

1198
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,828
Indeed she does.

1199
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:23,081
As lovely as she looked the very first time

1200
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,666
I came to her
dressing-room door.

1201
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,292
And look at you, Raoul.

1202
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:29,253
You look just like that
handsome boy in the opera-box,

1203
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:33,174
the one who would always
toss me a single red rose.

1204
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,511
<i>Please, Gustave If you don't mind</i>

1205
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,181
<i>Would you wait outside a while?</i>

1206
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:44,018
But when's Mother going to sing?
We don't want to miss it.

1207
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:46,604
<i>Go and wait backstage, my dear</i>

1208
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,565
<i>Soon Papa will fetch you there</i>

1209
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,110
You can both watch from the wings.

1210
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,868
<i>Since our wedding day</i>

1211
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,746
<i>Things have gone astray</i>

1212
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:04,872
Raoul...

1213
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:07,041
<i>I'm not proud of the way that I've acted</i>

1214
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:08,167
We've both been...

1215
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:12,880
<i>The demands I've made All our hopes mislaid</i>

1216
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,259
<i>I'm aware of the price they've exacted</i>

1217
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:20,847
<i>Though I've no right to ask you to</i>

1218
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:25,143
<i>There's one thing more I'd have you do</i>

1219
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:32,942
<i>If you love me as I love you</i>

1220
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:34,986
Anything, darling.

1221
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,864
<i>Don't sing the song, dear</i>

1222
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,031
What? But...

1223
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:42,076
<i>You have to know something's
terribly wrong, dear</i>

1224
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,080
<i>But I have to do this</i>
<i>It's what we agreed to</i>

1225
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,333
<i>That hell-spawned demon</i>

1226
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,754
<i>He's had us playing</i>
<i>his game all along, dear</i>

1227
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:56,340
<i>Let me just get through this</i>
<i>Listen, please I need to</i>

1228
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:03,806
<i>You need so much, it's true</i>

1229
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,561
<i>And I've denied you</i>

1230
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:13,691
<i>You need the man you knew</i>

1231
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:18,112
<i>Back here beside you</i>

1232
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:23,367
<i>You'll have him back, I vow</i>

1233
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,829
<i>Just ask it of me</i>

1234
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,708
<i>But we must leave here now</i>

1235
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:37,715
<i>If you still love me</i>

1236
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,970
But, darling, I'm due
on stage in 10 minutes.

1237
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,765
How can I possibly...
I beg you please. Please.

1238
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:49,227
I have a passage for three to
Cherbourg on the Atlantic Queen.

1239
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:53,064
It leaves tonight. Let's be
on it, for both our sakes.

1240
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,315
And for Gustave.

1241
01:25:55,526 --> 01:26:02,240
<i>Leave this place behind</i>

1242
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:06,869
Go and find Gustave.

1243
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:10,790
Tell the stage manager not to disturb me.
I need some time.

1244
01:26:56,295 --> 01:27:01,465
<i>You know his love is not enough</i>

1245
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:07,930
<i>You know it isn't what you need</i>

1246
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:13,352
<i>You know you're made of finer stuff</i>

1247
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:20,568
<i>I think on that we're all agreed</i>

1248
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:26,574
<i>It's time to leave him in the dust</i>

1249
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:32,288
<i>It's time to be who you should be</i>

1250
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:37,752
<i>It's time to do now as you must</i>

1251
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:45,259
<i>And set the music in you free</i>

1252
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,931
<i>In moments</i>

1253
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,475
<i>Mere moments</i>

1254
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,436
<i>Drums will roll</i>

1255
01:27:56,021 --> 01:28:02,777
<i>There you'll stand Just like before</i>

1256
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,947
<i>The crowd will hush</i>

1257
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:10,993
<i>And then in one sweet rush</i>

1258
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:16,040
<i>I will hear you sing once more</i>

1259
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,293
<i>And music, our music</i>

1260
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:22,630
<i>Will swell and then unwind</i>

1261
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:26,258
<i>Like two strands of melody</i>

1262
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:30,179
<i>At last entwined</i>

1263
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:32,765
<i>Fulfill us</i>

1264
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,642
<i>Complete us</i>

1265
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:38,270
<i>Make us whole</i>

1266
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:45,277
<i>Seal our bond forevermore</i>

1267
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,947
<i>Tonight, for me</i>

1268
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:53,369
<i>Embrace your destiny</i>

1269
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:58,165
<i>Let me hear you sing</i>

1270
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:04,797
<i>Once more</i>

1271
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:08,592
STAGE MANAGER:

<i>Twisted every way What answer can I give?</i>

1273
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:40,374
<i>I know I can't refuse</i>
<i>And yet I wish I could</i>

1274
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,792
<i>Oh, God</i>

PHANTOM: But every hope

<i>Will she sing?</i>
<i>Will she flee?</i>

1284
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:04,166
<i>What is she thinking now?</i>

1285
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:07,461
<i>Is it him?</i>
<i>Is it me?</i>
