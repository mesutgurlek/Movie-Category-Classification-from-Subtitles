A wallet.

You know it.

206
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,425
Reverend, I believe this is the
young man you were looking for.

207
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,910
You've made a mistake.

208
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,024
I was told to expect my grandson...

209
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,742
not some pickpocket, so
anxious to transgress that...

210
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,864
rather than wait for his
grandparents as instructed...

211
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,100
he'd run off and violate
the first law he could.

212
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,919
I ain't no damn pickpocket.

213
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,591
I wasn't lifting the guy's
wallet, I was giving it back.

214
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,629
This kid jacked my backpack
and took all my money.

215
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,463
I was trying to call you.

216
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,706
No one pressed charges. So, we're
releasing him into your custody.

217
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,622
Welcome to New York, young man.

218
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,144
Apparently I'm your grandfather.

Where are we?

220
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,310
125th Street.

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,391
The main street of Harlem.

be a lamppost in Harlem...

224
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,982
than the governor of Georgia.

225
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,511
What are you doing?

226
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,184
- Hey, Rev.
- Maria.

- Nice to meet you.

let's do it. Come on.

I'm saying hi to the Rev.
You're embarrassing.

your visit. Oh, you poor thing.

Fortunately, Officer Mac is a
good friend of the church.

It never hurts to have a friend

Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to Thy service.

246
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,629
And make us ever mindful of the
needs of others for Christ's sake.

247
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,946
Lord Jesus, today we are mindful
of the needs of this youth...

248
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,943
our grandson, whom Thou, in Thy
infinite wisdom, has sent to us.

249
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,548
And be he troubled and
in need of guidance...

250
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,785
or simply a belt to hold his
loose-fitting pants up...

251
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,146
allow us the fortitude and
patience to set him straight.

252

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,387
lead this boy not into temptation,
but deliver him from evil.

255
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,479
And allow him to walk in Thy steps

256
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,311
down the path of righteousness...

257
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,066
and with Your help, obedience.

258
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,399

Where is she working these days?

267
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,868
She tends bar Monday through Thursday,
and does checkout weekends.

268

She used to work for the
city, but they laid her off.

Does she have anyone to help her...

thing about us, do you?

This place, it's like
a museum up here.

A black people museum.

we've come from...

get us where we are.

That's me there.

The year that King died...

295
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,028
he asked a few of us children...

to come speak at his
church in Atlanta.

I was the youngest.

Dr. King felt I spoke so
eloquently, he sent me this watch.

you could ever get in a store.

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,902
No, I'm good. Thank you.

Anything you can
think of, I got it.

Yeah, whatever.

490
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,346
It's about time. Your grandmother's
been waiting for you.

Is it ready?

492

Tastes good to me.

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,185
Okay. You put that there
and pour it into the crust.

Mrs. Cobbs?

I don't really know
what to call you.

496

Oh, well...

497

Okay.

503

My mom ran away because
she got pregnant, right?

504
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,265
That's why she and
the Rev don't speak?

505
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,341
Because of me?

506
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,742
No, baby, not because of you.

510

He had it rough.

When he was with us, he'd
show us his sweet side.

the devil had his name.

Your grandfather is very proud,
in case you hadn't noticed.

514
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,279
Being a prominent minister, he
was more than just embarrassed

515
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,144
that his daughter was with child.

<i>She was only fifteen.</i>

517

I was just taking a walk.

646
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,500
A walk?

647
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,799
Well, since you feel like
stretching your legs,

648
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,346
let's walk to church.
It's not that far.

649
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,267
Grandma, what happened to my
father? Is he dead or alive?

650
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,944
Somewhere in between, I expect

651
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,864
The guy at the pawnshop
said he knew him.

652
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,105
Pawnshop? What on earth
were you doing in there?

653
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,025
I was getting a present for my mom.

654
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,469
I told the guy I was your grandson
and he said he knew my father.

655
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,783
A lot of shady people
hang around pawnshops...

656
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,024
that one in particular.
You stay away from there.

657
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,551
You can't tell me what to do.

658
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,465
Listen to me. You're my
grandson and I love you.

659
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,067
The Reverend and I would
do anything for you.

660
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,065
And your mother.
All she has to do is ask.

661
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,304
She won't ask. You know she won't.

662
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,461
It's fine. We'll manage.

that all were called

I get my help from

My lovely wife, who

And all went to be taxed,
each to his own city.

743
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,502
And Joseph went up from Galilee...
