00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,477
I got to meet a gang of people
at my mother's saloon.

2
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,112
You want to come? It's a
party for me, honest.

3
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:17,014
- I'd love to.
- Really? You mean it?

4
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,015
Why? Have you changed your mind?

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,583
No, no, I mean, I-I know

6
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,285
it isn't every day that a
glorified ziegfeld girl

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,553
like me asks you out.

8
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,148
Man: Thank you, Rachel,
that was lovely.

9
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:26,524
That's it?

10
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:28,793
All I needed to see.

11
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,001
It was a pleasure
reading with you.

12
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:38,703
And I loved you as Lancelot.

13
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:41,005
I saw the revival
of <i>Camelot</i> three times...

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,340
four, if you
include the bootleg

15
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:44,308
that my friend Kurt has, so...

16
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:45,276
(Clicks tongue)

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,311
Thanks.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,501
Well, Paolo,
you're our Tony winner.

19
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,036
What did you think?

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,437
Aw, she's charming.

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,640
And she certainly looks
right for the part.

22
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:17,275
I just fear that
she's too young,

23
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,276
you know, too green?

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,810
That was my concern as well.

25
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,312
Lack of experience.

26
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,848
She'd be a discovery,
but it's such a risk.

27
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,917
Paolo: I mean, that
part, it's a mountain.

28
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,718
At her age, I never
could have pulled it off.

29
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,021
Now, where did we leave it
with Claire Danes' people?

(All whooping, cheering)

76
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:23,988
I don't think
we've ever spent two weeks

77
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,029
on an assignment, Mr. Shue.

78
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:26,230
Hey, the Beatles are so epic

79
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,798
that we need two weeks
to do them justice.

80
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,901
This week is all about the
early years of the Beatles,

81
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,969
when all they had was
a belief in each other

82
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,172
and a belief that together
they could do anything.

83
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,326
(Groans) The school year seems
like it's never ending,

84
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,742
and now we're wasting
two whole weeks

85
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,577
on a band from the 1940s?

86
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,812
Seriously, can anyone
still relate to the Beatles?

87
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,880
Pretty much the entire world.

88
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,948
Yeah, I can
definitely still relate.

89
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:44,749
Kitty:
Why?

90
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:45,783
Were the Beatles dyslexic

91
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,784
and cat-fished

92
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:47,885
by transsexuals?

93
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,754
And you wonder
why everybody hates you.

94
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:50,955
Marley:
When George Harrison was a kid,

95
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,890
he was made fun of 'cause
his dad was the bus driver.

96
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,392
Jake: John Lennon's dad
wasn't even around.

97
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,527
He walked out of John's
life when he was five.

98
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,397
I don't really know the Beatles;
I'm a little on the black side.

99
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,765
Artie: And Ringo starr was
a sickly little kid,

100
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,868
which probably means
he was sitting down a lot.

101
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,736
Will:
And they decided to form a band.

102
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,071
Which changed the world.

103
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,339
Now, you guys are
really gonna have

104
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,440
to challenge yourselves
this week.

105
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,708
Bring your a-plus games.

106
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:11,909
Perform these classic songs

107
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,311
in new and exciting ways.

108
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,946
If we can push ourselves
to a whole new level,

109
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,481
like the Beatles did constantly,

110
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,749
we can win back-to-back
national championships

111
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,718
and form
a new directions! Dynasty.

118
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,265
Your chariot awaits.

119
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,702
Okay, we're moving
slower than Jonah hill

120
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,270
trying to get out
of the bathtub.

121
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,072
And everyone is staring.

122
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,341
Yeah, at our hotness.

123
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,609
You know, I never thanked you

124
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,377
for making me come
clean with my mom.

125
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,846
I'm going to the Brooklyn
film academy because of you.

126
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,650
And to thank you, I want
to take you to Breadstix.

127
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:55,286
Besides, we both know
that the raw, animal attraction

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,521
between us is undeniable.

129
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:58,289
Did you really just say that?

130
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,957
No wonder Tina
broke up with you.

131
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,026
And Brittany and sugar and
the girl in the wheelchair

132
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,594
with the disturbingly
massive boobs.

133
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,596
And ps, I hate Breadstix.

134
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,266
Okay, well, there's
a carnival in town.

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,367
That could be fun.

136
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,635
Yeah, if you want
to trust your life

137
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,570
to toothless carnies
who operate the rides.

138
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:15,306
Okay.

139

into me head-on.

paralyzed me.

179

My bad.

180

I'm Bree, spelled with two es.

181

182

Artie.

183
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,550
You two were so cute,
all snuggly

184
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,419
and cuddled up
in that teeny, tiny car.

185
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:42,820
Are you two going out?

186
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,088
Nope. Just friends.

187
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:45,456
Well, you should.

188
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,725
You look really sweet together.
I hope you don't mind.

189
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,461
I took a couple of pictures
and instagrammed them.

190
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,431
Anyway, have fun.

191
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,832
She seems nice.

192
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,001

00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,509
Okay.

195
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,179
You and me...

196
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,247
We're more than "just friends."

197
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,616
What if we go out...

198
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,718
But we do it on the down-low?

199
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,987
You know, like secretly
gay conservatives do.

200
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,889
It'll make everything
all fun and forbidden.

201
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,991
So you like me...

202
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,293
But you don't want
to be seen with me.

203
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,463
I need status at this school
to survive.

204
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,433
Yeah, right.

This was a mistake.

209
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,721
Okay, no, Rachel, you
are not backing out.

210
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,523
I basically had to show
Gunther my left side boob

211
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,659
to get you this job.

212
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,631
Here, put this on.

213
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,433
Look, santana,
while I really appreciate

214
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,469
you freely prostituting
yourself for me,

215
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,070
that was before my
world came crashing down

216
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,006
and I totally blew my
<i>funny girl</i> chemistry read.

217
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,008
You're late, Lopez!

218
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,677
Yes, yes, I know,
sorry, Gunther.

219
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:13,678
Is that her?

220
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:14,746
Yes, this is her.

221
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,047
Rachel, that's Gunther.

222
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,216
Don't tell him if
you're Jewish or black.

223
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,650
Listen.

224
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,786
You said it yourself
a bazillion times.

225
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,354
You want to get to Broadway,
you have to pay your dues.

226
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,489
(Shrieks)

227
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,591
Well, I mean,
I guess that's true.

228
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,160
Patti Lupone was a waitress,
<i>Pre-Evita.</i>

229
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,062
And, you know, this is
the spotlight diner,

230
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,231
and it's on Broadway, and
waiters get to sing and dance.

231
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,665
Plus my dads would pay
my rent till I died,

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,234
and I don't want that anymore
because I want to be

233
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,137
grown up and living
and making it on my own.

234
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,539
We're basically
working actresses.

235
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,778
Blaine: So, you excited
to go back to school?

236
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,413
Kurt:
Yeah, fashion week is coming up.

237
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,481
But this farewell picnic's
been perfect, though.

238
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,851
What's the story
with this New York guy?

239
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,254
There's no story.

240
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,323
He was nice and people liked
the idea of us as a couple,

241
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,060
but never got serious.

242
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,428
All right,
let me break it down for you.

243
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,696
All right,
the last time we tried dating,

244
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,297
and I was in New York
and you were here,

245
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,398
you cheated on me.

246
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,433
All right, unacceptable.

247
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,467
We've been through this.

248
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,902
I thought you were done with me.

249
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,270
I thought it was over.

250
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,272
I thought I was completely
out of the picture in your life.

251
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,073
Look at me in the eyes
when I say this.

252
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,442
I'm being beyond serious.

253
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,178
I will never, ever...

254
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,815
Ever cheat on you again.

255
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,185
I'm gonna need you to sign one
of those non-cheating contracts.

256
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,253
You know, you can get one
on Oprah's web site.

257
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,755
I will sign whatever you want.

258
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:34,158
Just please say that you and I
can be boyfriends again.

259
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,994
What?

260
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,063
I don't know
if relationships actually work.

261
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,166
I mean, weren't Bethenny and
Jason supposed to be forever?

262
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,968
For every Bethenny and Jason,

263
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,970
there is a Will and a Jada,

264
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,439
and a-a Kurt and a Goldie.

265
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,475
Come on, can we at least

266
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,977
just give it a try?

267
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,313
But I'm Goldie, of course.

268
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,281
Of course you are.

269
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,817
I-I can't believe
we're gonna do this again.

270
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,387
I was hoping you would say yes.

271
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,855
Actually I was kind
of planning on it,

272
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,623
which I why I sort of, um,
put something together

273
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,458
to try to convince you
to stay a little longer.

274
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,393
Uh, no, no, no,
that's not gonna happen, okay?

275
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,628
I-I'm not sitting down

276
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,662
and listening to you
sing to me anymore.

277
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,665
Okay.

278
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,967

00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:55,568
What's going on?

328
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,203

Roberts:
Our hands are tied, Mr. Figgins.

345
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,897
Where am I supposed to go?

346

What am I supposed to do?

347
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,435
Well, superintendent
Harris, I have to say,

348
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,737
I'm truly humbled.

349
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,806
We're in a pinch here, coach,

350
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,674
and you're a proven champion.

351

You've led the school before
as interim principal,

and if all goes well
after a few months,

353
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,649
I see no reason
why this position

354
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,417
shouldn't become permanent.

Blaine has a very special
announcement to make.

That's right.
(Clears throat)

398
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,454
So, as most of you know already,

I know,
but what most of you don't know,

402
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,265
and this is top secret,

403
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,270
is that I'm going
to ask Kurt to marry me.

404
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,139
Yeah, guys, come on!

Get up! Come on, guys!

406

He's my best friend.

Gay marriage... good.

00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:58,078
It's good, it's good things.

409
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,512
They're all happening so fast.

410
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:02,082
- Let's go!
- Sam, not now.

411
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:04,885
Anyway, I want this proposal
to be just incredible,

412
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,853
so I'm asking for
all of your help,

413
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,856
but I'm also asking for some
of our competitors' help.

414
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,725
Like the warblers
and vocal adrenaline

415
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,279
and the Haverbrook
school for the deaf.

416
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:15,128
(Scoffs)
Vocal adrenaline? No, ma'am.

417
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,563
The warblers are
evil incarnate little craps.

418

Are you crazy? Are you insane?

419
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,099
Good God,
have you lost your mind?

420
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,934
Tina, everybody,

421
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,636
hear him out.

422
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,340
Look, I want this to be more
than just an ordinary proposal.

423
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,543
I want this
to be a cultural statement.

424
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,810
Sure you do.

425
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:34,147
Hey, our generation
is at a turning point.

426
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:37,784
People everywhere...
except, like, Russia...

427
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:41,421
are beginning to see
that it doesn't matter

428
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:43,857
who you are
or where you're from

429
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,393
or even what God you believe in.

430
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,161
They're beginning to see
that people

431
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,663
really aren't
all that different.

432
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,265
And honestly, if we can get a
bunch of cutthroat show choirs

433
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,167
to stand side-by-side

434
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,369
and unite in something,

435
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,004
then anything is possible.

436
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,907
Okay, okay,
but Blaine is just using

We need an official vote,
but in the spirit of brotherhood

489
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,424
and cleaning up
our tarnished reputation,

490
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:33,160
I think we'd all be happy
to help.

491
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:36,563
Uh, Trent, we said
I'd do the talking.

492
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:38,231
All in favor of helping Blaine?

493
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,266
All:
Aye!

494
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:42,702
(All whooping)

495
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,643
Artie, we've been
friends for a long time,

496
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,179
so I'm just gonna ask,
are you and Kitty an item?

497
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:54,648
What? No.

498
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,284
I mean, yes.
I mean, maybe.

499
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,386
I'm unclear. It's sort of this
secret affair

500
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,988
we're not really supposed
to talk about.

501
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:02,957
Yes! I knew it!
Why? Why can't you?

502
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:04,191
Lower your voice, Tina.

503
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:08,229
Because Kitty's uncomfortable

504
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,763
with people knowing
she's dating...

505
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:10,965
Someone who wears glasses

506
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,067
who's in a wheelchair
who's in glee club?

507
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,435
Where's your self-respect?

508
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:17,037
Tina, I know you're trying
to help.

509
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:18,472
Like, at least I think you are.

510
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:23,802
So I'm gonna say thank you.

511
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,939
(School bell ringing)

512
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,344
All right, got your burger
and your salad. Enjoy.

513
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,782
Oh, my God, you're not gonna
believe this text

514
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,117
I just got from Blaine.

515
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,286
You're not gonna believe
who's sitting in my section.

516
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,959
Mmm, I'll take this.

517
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,862
Okay, so we have one Roxie

518
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,099
and one Velma,
a side of Billy Flynns.

519
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,635
Yes, it's me,
and, yes, it's awkward,

520
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,837
but I don't care,

521
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,272
because I am a professional.

522
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,674
Even when people are calling me

523
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,075
"too young" or-or "green,"

524
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,744
which, for your information,
I'm not.

525
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,945
I am a...
Am a star.

526
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,647
Yes, I am a star.
Rachel, look,

527
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,516
it's not personal.

528
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,918
Everyone thinks they're a star,
even when they're not.

529
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,953
Look around.

530
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,722
They all want
to be on Broadway.

531
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,491
Look, I'm not saying
you're not a star, Rachel.

532
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:23,395
Just saying
I'm not sure just yet.

533
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,598
I understand.

534
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,369
I guess I'll just have
to prove it to you, then.

Wait... after all that?

575
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:32,608
We have to go home.

576
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,102
There's something special
we need to do.

577

(Cheering continues)

578
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,557
I don't know what
you're so nervous about.

579
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:41,592
She's not going after
the cheerios!

580
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:42,960
It's the glee club she hates.

581
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,161
Bitch, please.

582
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,430
Sue Sylvester's had it out
for me since day one.

583
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:47,798
I took her job, remember?

584
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,501
I just know she's dug up
all kind of dirt on me.

585
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:51,902
What kind of dirt?

586
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:54,505
Number one, this bronze
damn olympic medal

587
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,107
in individual synchronized
swimming I won

588
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,443
at them Chinese Olympics
may have been

589
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,880
the result of some performance-
enhancing drugs and weed.

590
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,681
Number two, I may have
perpetrated a buttload

591
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:05,849
of credit card fraud.

592
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:08,685
An old lady in Florida
may have paid for my condo,

593
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,055
and I might have just
flat-out stole my lexus

594
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,125
off a used car lot.

595
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,794
Well, then, yeah,
we're both screwed.

596
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,830
Sue's gonna take out
the glee club

597
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:21,498
and the cheerios!
In one fell swoop.

598
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,168
Oh, now why on earth would I do
something like that, Buttchin?

599
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,003
Because you're vindictive
and petty.

600
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:28,305
Oh, well, you're forgetting
one thing, William.

601
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:31,542
I have been given the post of
interim principal at this school.

602
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:33,510
A post that will be made
permanent

603
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:36,814
at the end of the year
if all goes according to plan,

604
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:39,383
allowing me to demolish
this office down to the studs,

605
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:43,520
ridding it once and for all
of the deep, ethnic musk

606
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:44,655
that is Figgins' hallmark.

607
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:46,490
Now, in order to achieve that,

608
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:48,892
I need the programs
at this school to be successful.

609
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:53,130
I need the teams
at McKinley high to be winners.

610
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:55,299
Wait, wait,
y-you're not firing us?

611
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,568
Not if you win a national
championship, I'm not.

612
00:27:57,602 --> 00:28:00,337
However, if you fail to win at
Nationals, I will fire you.

613
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:02,406
You'll be forced to build
creepy relationships

614
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,874
with teenagers on your own time.

615
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:06,176
And you, you'll have to go back

616
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,712
to being a full-time spokesmodel
for Billy Dee Williams'

617
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:09,913
yellow hair helmets

618
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:12,182
for women who couldn't possibly
be less blonde.

619
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,550
Congratulations.

620
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:16,720
You're on my watch now,
which means...

621
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:19,756
You're winners.

622
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,363
Okay, guys, week one of
our Beatles fest has been epic.

623
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:28,799
I think we've really unpacked
what made the fab four

624
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,267
such a instant sensation,

625
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,703
but now I want to turn to their
oft-ignored middle period.

626
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,071
Mr. Shue, would you say

627
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:35,906
that the early Beatles looked
out for each other

628
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,941
even when they didn't want
to be looked out for?

629
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,109
Oh, God, no.

630
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:41,812
If I understand your question,
Tina,

631
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,281
yes, the early Beatles
always had each other's backs.

632
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,716
In that case, I'm sorry, Artie,
but this

633
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,017
is for your own good.

634
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:50,420
Everyone, Kitty and Artie
are dating,

635
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:51,788
but Kitty's making Artie hide it

636
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,257
because she's embarrassed
by him,

637
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,892
and I think
that's emotional abuse.

638
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:58,195
Artie is a great guy, and
he deserves to be loved openly

639
00:28:58,229 --> 00:28:59,590
and proudly
and without conditions.

640
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:02,866
For once we agree.

641
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:07,971
It's true.
Arthur and I are dating.

642
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,640
We are? Officially?

643
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:11,775
And for the record... and not
that it's anyone's business,

644
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,411
especially not yours,
Tina Cohen-agitator...

645
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:16,313
I did want to keep it hush-hush.

646
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:17,414
Because you were ashamed.

647
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:20,918
Yes, memoirs of a lame geisha,
because I occupy

648
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:22,619
a certain place
in the McKinley hierarchy,

649
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:26,590
and you all occupy a different,
lesser place in that hierarchy,

650
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,192
and before exploding
said hierarchy

651
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,394
by jumping up and down
on Oprah's couch,

652
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:34,031
declaring my undying love for
someone who is, let's face it,

653
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,500
not my usual body type...

654
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,836
I wanted to be sure.

655
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,103
Of what?

656
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:46,009
That I really, really liked him.

657
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,112
And that I would be willing
to risk

658
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:52,416
not just my social standing
but also getting hurt

659
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,918
by letting him wheel
into my heart.

660
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:58,021
And even though I know
he's getting ready to graduate,

661
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,825
and we're probably just
as doomed as every other sad,

662
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,528
broken, backwards relationship
that's ever started

663
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,463
in this Jesus-and love-forsaken
choir room...

664
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:09,166
Kurt and I <i>will</i> have
a happy ending.

665
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,368
But I do like you, Artie.
You make me laugh,

666
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:13,504
and not just with those stupid
YouTube fail videos

667
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:14,638
you're always showing me.

668
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:23,747
Look, asking you to keep
our stuff private wasn't cool,

669
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,848
and I'm sorry.

670
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:27,518
It's okay, Kitty.

671
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:33,257
But, um, as far as, like,
updating my Facebook status...

672
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:38,862
Yes, we are officially,
publicly, shockingly

673
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:40,856
a thing.

674
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:44,668
(All cheer)

675
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:49,786
You guys...
(School bell ringing)

676
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:55,177
Do any of you know
why I call you in here?

677
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:58,406
Uh, is it to get prepared
in case

678
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,208
the North Koreans invade
through Mexico?

679
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:02,210
I just saw <i>red dawn,</i> okay?
It could happen.

680
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,445
One of our own has turned

681
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:06,782
into a mean, bitter,
and angry person.

682
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,216
Tina. Tina. That'd be Tina.

683
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:09,418
She didn't used to be like this.

684
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,020
She was a sweet girl who dated
Artie until he dumped her

685
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:13,935
because he found out
she was faking her stutter.

686
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,391
And then she dated Mike Chang
until he dumped her

687
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:18,593
because she wasn't Asian enough
or something.

688
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,263
Wait... is that really why
he dumped her? Yeah.

689
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,498
Look, the point is, is that
it's time for us to step in.

690
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,067
She's falling apart.

691
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,635
I walked by
the too young to be bitter club

692
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:30,639
<i>meeting this morning, and</i>
<i>she was the only one in there.</i>

693
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:37,412
Those cakes are truly awesome.

694
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,481
Dude, those things were moist
and chocolaty at the same time.

695
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:41,116
Totally, totally.

696
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,430
Guys, this isn't
about the cakes.

697
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:43,919
I know how good they are.
I've had them, too.

698
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:45,153
This is about us trying
to help Tina.

699
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:46,455
Oh, of course, Blaine.

700
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,423
You know, even though this is
all clearly your fault,

701
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,659
you know, whatever you think
we should do, we're in.

702
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:11,847
Ah, settling in nicely,
then, are we?

703
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,815
You know, I think you
found your calling.

704
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,686
Janitor Figgins, I think,
has a quiet dignity to it.

705
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,154
You're not gonna get away
with this, Sue.

706
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,655
Well, I believe I already have.

707
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,358
And considering all
the scandalous behavior

708
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:24,626
that I recently uncovered,

709
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:27,362
I would say you are lucky
to have a job at all.

710
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:29,097
You had better be nice to Donna.

711
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,035
That woman is a Saint.

712
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:34,436
And she's my rock.

713
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,705
I'm afraid Donna isn't long
for this world.

714
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,540
As soon as she returns
from her suspension,

715
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,843
I plan on installing Becky
as my secretary.

716
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,079
And I will refer
to her as my "beckretary."

717
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,148
(Chuckles)

718
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,583
What is that?

719
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:52,120
That? Well, that's just
a five-gallon bucket

720
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,889
of expired grade D meat slurry

721
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:57,659
the poor kids at this school
were forced to eat

722
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:59,528
every taco Tuesday under
the jackboot of that corrupt,

723
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,731
decadent regime from which
they were recently liberated

724
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,299
by one Sue Rodham Sylvester.

725
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:05,734
That's not your middle name.

726
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:07,135
Oh, yes, it is.

727
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,570
I had it legally changed
this morning.

728
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:11,406
(Chuckles) Now, what would you
like me to do with this canister

729
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:13,208
of rancid horse offal?

730
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,077
No, Sue, please! No!

731
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:19,548
(Distorted):
No!

732
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:33,028
Sue Sylvester!

733
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,432
You are a monster!

734
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:40,836
Tina:
What is happening

735
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,571
and why did you
make me wear this?

736
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,306
I had to break out
one of the <i>grease</i> costumes.

737
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,807
(British accent):
Tina, I'm Paul.

738
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,542
That's George, that's Ringo,

739
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:48,744
and black John Lennon.

740
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:49,978
Half black.

741
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:52,012
(Cockney accent): We love
you, and this is for you.

you've been lately.

And by single,
we mean single prom dates...

790
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:08,183
We just wanted
to offer our services

791
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,685
as dance partner
or corsage buyer

792
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,621
or just general arm candy
for the big dance.

793
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:13,655
Yeah, so you can pick one.

794
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:14,623
And it's your choice.

795
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:15,724
Obviously I'm excluded.

796
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:18,694
Well, it's hard to pick.

Ryder has arms
and Blaine is my boo,

799
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,201
because he's the least gay

800
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:27,536
and least Asian of all of you

801
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,905
and I'm looking
to change my patterns.

802
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,273
Seriously, though...

803
00:36:31,307 --> 00:36:32,307
Thank you, guys.

804
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:33,475
I really needed this.

805
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,410
Bring it in, Tina.

806
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,745
Oh, I love you.

807
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,147
I love you.
Thank you, boo.

808
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:40,849
(Indistinct conversation)

809
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,776
Look, I, uh, know
we usually take

810
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:46,897
the highway to the airport,

811
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,132
but somebody told me
about this shortcut

812
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,266
through the back roads.

813
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,767
Dad, you can stop it.

814
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:53,971
I know you're driving me
to my surprise proposal.

815
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,506
I should have known you knew.

816
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,274
You're the kid who planned
his own surprise party

817
00:36:57,308 --> 00:36:58,575
for his tenth birthday.

818
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,010
That Justin Timberlake piñata

819
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:01,211
was a perfect likeness.

820
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,313
Well, I wouldn't know.

821
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,948
You okay?

822
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:06,250
You look like I'm driving you

823
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:07,351
to your execution.

824
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,288
I can't tell.

825
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:14,224
I mean, I really
love Blaine, and...

826
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:15,959
He makes me feel so connected

827
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:18,662
and safe and loved,

828
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,731
and I don't think I'm ever
gonna find someone else

829
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:22,766
who's gonna make me
feel like that.

830
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:26,937
But we're both so young.

831
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:29,006
Um...

832
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,142
Your mom and I met
when we were 22,

833
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:34,611
and I asked her to marry
me six months in.

834
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:36,079
We were just kids.

835
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:40,818
<i>Yeah...</i>
<i>It was really hard at first.</i>

836
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:42,920
<i>You know, you go in</i>
<i>with all these fantasies</i>

837
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:44,121
<i>about what your life together</i>

838
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:45,222
is gonna be like:

839
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:46,990
Nothing but laughing

840
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:49,259
and dancing around
in your underwear,

841
00:37:49,294 --> 00:37:50,394
cooking pasta,

842
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:52,429
<i>and sex.</i>

843
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:54,164
<i>A lot of sex.</i>

844
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,200
(Kurt sighs)

845
00:37:58,002 --> 00:37:59,603
It's hard being married, though.

846
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,638
It's hard enough
being in your 20s.

847
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:04,141
Do you wish you'd waited?

848
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:07,010
Not one second more.

849
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:08,946
I wish I'd met her
ten years earlier.

850
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,714
I didn't know then that
I was only going to get

851
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,149
so much time
with her, you know?

852
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:13,350
That she was gonna
leave us so soon.

853
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:16,887
I'd take 50 more years
of late-night fights

854
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,022
about, you know,
me working late

855
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:20,190
or the gas bill

856
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:23,560
or her letting the milk
go bad for just...

857
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,798
Ten more minutes
with her next to me.

858
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,633
We only get a few days

859
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,201
when you come down to it, Kurt.

860
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:32,836
You know that
better than anyone.

861
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,974
Look, totally
being honest here...

862
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:41,845
Blaine asked me
what I thought about this,

863
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,180
and I gave him my opinion.

864
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:44,815
Which was?

865
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,450
My opinion doesn't matter here.

866
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,018
You're your own man now.

867
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:51,455
But giving you a choice
means you gotta make one.

868
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,090
So relax.

869
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,392
Hear what the guy has to say.

870
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:58,629
I mean, all you gotta do
is say yes, no, or maybe.

871
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:00,964
Is there another option?

872
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,834

(Cheering)

920
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:40,524
We met right here.

921
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:42,092
I took this man's hand,

922
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,367
and we ran down that hallway...

923
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:44,828
And for those of you
that know me,

924
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:46,330
know I'm not in the habit
of taking people's hands

925
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:47,665
I've never met before, but...

926
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:48,799
I think that

927
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,201
my soul knew something

928
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:55,339
that my body and my mind
didn't know yet.

929
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:59,243
It knew that our hands

930
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:00,811
were meant to hold each other,

931
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:02,313
fearlessly

932
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:03,714
and forever.

933
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:06,850
Which is why
it's never really felt like

934
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:08,652
I've been getting to know you;

935
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:11,255
it's always felt like I was
remembering you from something.

936
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:13,290
As if in every lifetime

937
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:14,625
that you and I have ever lived,

938
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:15,893
we have chosen to come back

939
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,561
and find each other

940
00:42:17,595 --> 00:42:19,663
and fall in love all over again,

941
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:22,700
over and over for all eternity.

942
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,003
And I just feel so lucky

943
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:28,005
that I found you
so soon in this lifetime,

944
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:30,541
because all I want to do,

945
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:33,544
all-all I've ever
wanted to do...

946
