1
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:41,818
Feeling good, Mercedes.

2
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,086
This is amazing.

3
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:44,788
Ever since glee club
won sectionals,

4
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,122
Everybody looks at us
differently.

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,858
I want to be
with you, Rachel.

6
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,125
We're glitterati.

7
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:50,460
I feel like Lady Gaga.

8
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,329
Get used to it, guys.
We're stars now.

9
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:54,464
On par with all
the jocks and popular kids.

10
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,133
Oh, it's the dawn of a new era
here at McKinley,

11
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,635
And we are gonna
rule this school!

12
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:02,005
Ooh-hoo, welcome to loser town.

13
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,440
Population: You.

14
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:04,841
{bell ringing}

15
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:05,876
I don't understand.

16
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:07,477
We won sectionals.

17
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,846
I completely demonstrated
the validity of this program.

18
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,214
Now you're
saying we have

19
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,883
To place at regionals
or the glee club's gone?

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,852
Shue, that was the deal
from the beginning.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,220
I still have
a bottom line.

22
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:18,488
Those spotlights
in the auditorium

23
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,724
Don't run on dreams.

24
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,059
Our electricity consumption
is up two percent.

25
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:24,160
Besides, it's cold out,

26
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,196
Shue, and the Cheerios

27
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,498
Can no longer practice
out of doors!

28
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,600
They need the use of
the auditorium as well.

29
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,669
But the Cheerios
don't even have a coach.

30
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:34,571
Sue:
Oh, yes, they do.

31
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,773
Hey, buddy, you get a haircut?

32
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:37,974
Looks awful.

33
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,609
What are you doing here?

34
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:41,978
I'm just dropping off
a mocha for my maharishi.

35
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:43,313
I took the liberty

36
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,048
Of making it
a double whip.

37
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,983
Because after
our conciliatory dinner,

38
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:50,420
I happen to know
that there is nothing

39
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,989
You won't eat
whipped cream off of.

40
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:57,460
Would have gotten
you one, Will,

41
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:58,762
But, uh, I don't like you.

42
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,898
Okay.

43
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,969
Wait, what the hell
is going on here?

44
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,304
You suspended her

45
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,105
After she leaked
our set list at sectionals.

46
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:13,209
Yes, and the point of suspension
is reinstatement.

47
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:16,212
{typing on calculator}

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,114
{crowd cheering}

49
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:25,755
<i>Finn:
In some ways, I'm happy
football season's over.</i>

50
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:29,359
<i>I did set the single-season
record for being sacked,</i>

51
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:32,395
<i>But we only won one game.</i>

52
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:34,631
<i>So, I'm hoping basketball
can be a fresh start.</i>

53
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,469
{cheering}

54
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:42,072
<i>The fact is,
I'm kind of depressed.</i>

55
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:44,975
Hey, Finn.
Oh.

56
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,143
I made us his and her
relationship calendars.

57
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,778
That way, we always know
what the other is up to,

58
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:50,580
So you can't say
you forgot we had plans

59
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:51,848
When you miss
our dates anymore.

60
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,683
Great, but I'm kind of
allergic to cats, so...

61
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,353
I filled in all of our dates
for the next month.

62
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,355
<i>On the sixth,
we're going to see Phantom</i>

63
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,556
At the autistic
children's center.

64
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:00,890
<i>Finn:
I know I saved glee club,</i>

65
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,225
<i>And I guess chicks dig me,</i>

66
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:03,627
<i>But I guess
if I'm being honest,</i>

67
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:05,061
<i>It's more like
I'm not over her.</i>

68
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,763
Puck:
I'm not breaking up with you.

69
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:06,896
I'm just saying, please
stop super-sizing,

70
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,300
'cause... I don't
dig on fat chicks.

71
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:11,301
I'm pregnant.

72
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:12,569
And that's my fault?

73
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:13,903
<i>Finn:
And Rachel--</i>

74
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:16,139
<i>Now that we're sort of dating,
I have to work</i>

75
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:18,108
<i>So much harder to pretend
to be listening to her.</i>

76
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,209
That sounds great.

77
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,944
{whistle blows}

78
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,313
<i>Sometimes I wish I could be
more like Coach Tanaka.</i>

79
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,215
<i>He pulled a Jessica Simpson.</i>

80
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,651
<i>You know, lost his fiancée,
gained 40 pounds</i>

81
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:29,419
<i>And stopped showering.</i>

82
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,121
<i>And everyone acts like
it's totally normal.</i>

83
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,725
{whistle blows}

84
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:37,093
{buzzer sounds}

85
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,629
That's my boyfriend!

86
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>I'm off my game, and I don't
know how to get back on it.</i>

87
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,008
{bell ringing}

88
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,780
There.

89
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,616
You no longer confuse me
with your she-male looks.

90
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:02,819
I'm going to donate this to
the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

91
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:06,222
They can use it to plug
the holes in their trailers.

92
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,724
Sue.

93
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,460
Please tell me how
you managed to pull off

94
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:12,328
Getting reinstated.
Well, William,

95
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,464
I realized back
in my condo in Boca

96
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,833
That I had indeed
behaved poorly.

97
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,202
Riddled with remorse,
I arranged a dinner

98
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,272
So Figgins and I could have a
little professional sit-down.

99
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,941
Sue, there's no way I'm letting
you back into that school.

100
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,042
Mind flagging down that waiter?

101
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,281
We had a very frank
and healing discussion.

102
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,849
And you know what, Will?

103
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,752
It was like he was seeing me
and my moral integrity

104
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,987
For the very first time.

105
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,923
{siren wailing}

106
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:44,961
So here's what's going
to happen.

107
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,097
As of right now,
I am reinstated.

108
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,566
Or I will tell your wife
and the entire congregation

109
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,534
Of the Cornerstone
Bible Way Church

110
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:53,169
Of our sexual congress.

111
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:54,404
It's your choice.

112
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:56,840
Smile.

113
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,646
Okay, look, Sue, if you're back,
let's bury the hatchet.

114
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:05,181
I won't be burying
any hatchets, William,

115
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,484
Unless I happen to get
a clear shot to your groin.

116
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,519
You humiliated me.

117
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:11,187
You did this to yourself, Sue.

118
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,123
All I did was
enjoy watching it happen.

119
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,557
Yeah, well, enjoy this, William.

120
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,760
Now that I am back
and my position is secured,

121
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,962
I will not stop
until you are fired,

122
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,698
And your little glee club is
annihilated into oblivion.

123
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,199
Bring it.

124
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,001
Oh, I will bring it, William.

125
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,770
You know what else
I'm gonna bring?

126
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,105
I'm going to bring some Asian
cookery to rub your head with.

127
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,174
'cause right now you got
enough product in your hair

128
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:32,909
To season a wok.

129
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,679
{sighs}

130
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:44,921
Hello.

131
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,558
Hello?
All {weakly}:
Hello.

132
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,393
What do you guys say
when you answer the phone?

133
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,027
What up?

134
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,162
Who this be?

135
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,763
No, she's dead.
This is her son.

136
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,198
O-kay...

137
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,233
Alexander Graham Bell,
inventor of the telephone,

138
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,069
Liked to say "Ahoy, ahoy"
when he answered the phone.

139
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:02,906
It was edison
who decided that "Hello"

140
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,041
Was a more
appropriate greeting.

141
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,545
Look, I am really proud of
what you guys did at sectionals,

142
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,047
But as most of you
have realized by now,

143
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:12,882
It hasn't made
a bit of difference

144
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,384
In your day-to-day at school.

145
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,719
I have a slushee-stained
training bra to prove it.

146
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,822
The fact is, we're
gonna have to be better,

147
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,323
Even more spectacular,
at regionals.

148
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,724
It's time for
some reinvention,

149
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,761
Some new New Directions.

150
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:26,963
We need a new...

151
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:28,598
Hello.

152
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,500
Here's your assignment
for the week.

153
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,236
Come up with a fresh number,
but it has to have "Hello"

154
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,004
In the song title,
all right?

155
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,708
{bell ringing}

156
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,347
Hi.

157
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,883
Hi.

158
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:49,986
This is kind of
weird, isn't it?

159
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,387
Yes.

160
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,122
{laughs}
I mean, here we are.

161
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,825
We've been in this exact
situation a hundred times.

162
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,028
Only this time, I could just

163
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,231
Lean over and kiss you
if I want to.

164
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,568
And I want to.

165
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:06,903
No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

166
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,605
I'm sorry.
Um...

167
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,006
I just need to clean up first,

168
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,441
So I'll be right back.

169
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,976
Just hold on.
No, no, no, no.

170
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,244
Hey, Emma,

171
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,279
I don't care.
We've kissed before.

172
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,781
Yeah, but you caught me by
surprise sneak attack that time.

173
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,650
It was like a...
A pearly white harbor.

174
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,118
{laughs}

175
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,554
I'm sorry, this is a completely
unattractive quality.

176
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,090
You are adorable.

177
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,760
You're right, too.

178
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:34,163
We need to clean up a little
before we charge forward.

179
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,865
Get the monkeys off our backs.

180
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,333
Let's do this right.

181
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,801
We should go on a date.

182
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,404
Okay.
Get to know each other
as these...

183
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:44,274
New people,
not tied down by anyone.

184
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,808
My place.

185
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,477
I'll cook.

186
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:49,846
I didn't know you could cook.

187
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:53,483
There are so many things
you don't know about me.

188
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,520
And I can't wait
to introduce them all to you.

189
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,757
I'll see you later.

190
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,431
You two should be wetting
yourselves with shame.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,003
Glee club won sectionals,
and you did nothing to stop it.

192
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,838
If you were samurai,

193
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:18,041
And my letter opener
were sharp enough,

194
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,476
I would ask you both right now

195
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,011
<i>To commit seppuku.</i>

196
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,781
In japanese, this means
ritual belly-slitting.

197
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,383
We were seduced by the glitz
and glamour of show biz.

198
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:30,320
Let me drop
some knowledge on you.

199
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:32,622
Ever since Quinn Fabray
got knocked up,

200
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,091
I've been in the market
for a new head cheerleader.

201
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,961
If you want the job
and back in my good graces,

202
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,929
You're gonna have
to turn around

203
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,531
And listen up.

204
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:44,600
You're familiar with a little
glee clubber named Rachel Berry?

205
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:46,169
Rachel's the
kind of girl

206
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,805
Who wants things too badly.

207
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:52,342
And what she really wants
is one Finn Hudson.

208
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:53,943
I want you to
go after him.

209
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,311
She'll go crazy.

210
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,879
She won't be able
to stand your dating him.

211
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:59,682
Humiliated, shamed,

212
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,951
She'll have no choice
but to leave the group.

213
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,653
And without her,

214
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,122
Schuester won't make it
to regionals.

215
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,323
{bell ringing}

216
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,891
I know it's been hard on you

217
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,226
Since the baby drama.

218
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:12,228
Trust me, I get it,
and it sucks.

219
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:13,896
You seem to be
handling it fine.

220
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,732
Well, it's because
I realized that

221
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,267
I had to find this new
person inside of me,

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,103
The one that was okay
with what happened.

223
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,139
I just feel so bad
about myself.

224
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,708
Finn, that guy who made
all those bad choices,

225
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,177
Who ignored the signs,
he's gone.

226
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:32,281
This new, more experienced,
more interesting guy is here.

227
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,684
And I brought you here
to introduce you to him.

228
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:36,285
Help you move forward.

229
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:37,987
Oh, you mean like,
meeting other girls?

230
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,555
Because I think
I'm dating Rachel.

231
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,491
At least she sure
thinks I am.

232
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,326
No, it's not about
meeting someone else.

233
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,928
It's about being okay
just being you.

234
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:48,331
Come on, you're
a rock star, Finn.

235
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,932
You're like
Jagger, Morrison.

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,401
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

237
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:53,369
Good. I want you to meet

238
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,938
The new and improved
Finn Hudson

239
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,240
By singing about it.

240
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,741
Oh, that's why
the band's here.

241
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,844
Yeah. Pick a song, and
they're ready to back you up.

242
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,847
Well, I like what you said
about me being like Morrison.

243
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,983
And The Doors
have a "Hello" song.

244
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:08,718
So maybe I could find myself

245
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:11,054
And do my glee assignment
at the same time.

246
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,455
All right, man,
go to work.

247
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:18,227
{band playing
"Hello, I Love You"}

And that, fellow glee clubbers,
is how we say hello.

00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,892
{bell ringing}

285
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,527
Mr. Schuester,

286
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:00,429
I'd like to run some of
my "Hello" ideas by you.

287
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:11,040
You're a really good dancer.

288
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,776
Thanks, but my feet
weren't really moving.

289
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:14,977
That was the best part.

290
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:16,579
Oh.

291
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,447
Brit and I were wondering
if you wanted to go out.

292
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,449
On a... Date?

293
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:22,485
With which one of you?

294
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,855
- With both of us.
- With both of us.

295
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,204
Breadstix, 8:00.

296
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,505
Table for three?

297
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:40,940
Cool.

298
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,875
{giggles}

299
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,647
What did they want?

300
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,681
Oh, nothing.

301
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,616
Just the time.

302
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,489
I know being my boyfriend
is a challenge.

303
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:57,990
I'm not Quinn.

304
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,158
I don't look like her.

305
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,227
I'm not popular,
and my personality,

306
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:02,795
Though exciting and
full of surprises,

307
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:05,231
Isn't exactly
low-maintenance, but...

308
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,802
I'll always be honest with you.

309
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,170
Painfully so.

310
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,705
And all I ask in return

311
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:14,307
Is that you're just honest
with me.

312
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,245
I don't think I want
to be your boyfriend.

313
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,850
What?

314
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,818
Look, Rachel,
you're really awesome,

315
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,421
But I think I need to connect
with my inner rock star

316
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,922
Before I can fully commit
to one woman.

317
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,192
I need to find out who I am now.

318
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:38,197
I'll tell you who you are.

319
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:40,233
You're a scared little boy.

320
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,868
You're afraid of dating me

321
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,603
Because you think it might
hurt your reputation--

322
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,571
Though, which you'd
never admit it,

323
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,806
Is very important to you.

324
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,207
You hate what Quinn did to you,

325
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,308
Not just because it hurt,

326
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,243
But because it was
so humiliating.

327
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,611
You're freaking me out.

328
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,979
It's like you're inside
my head right now.

329
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,047
I just see you for who you are.

330
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,917
Unlike you, who can only see me
as this silly girl

331
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,585
Who made a fool out of herself

332
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,387
In her first glee club
rehearsal.

333
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:03,556
And that's where you lose, Finn.

334
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:05,591
Because, if you take
a second look at me,

335
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:09,262
You'd realize that I'm
the only person in your life

336
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:14,233
Who knows you and accepts you
for who you are, no matter what.

337
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,640
{bell ringing}

338
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:22,675
Finn:
Well, obviously,
Hawaiian pizza's the best

339
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,510
Because it's got ham and
pineapple on it, right?

340
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:25,945
True.
Mm-hmm.

341
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:28,281
So, it's better than most
pizzas because it has...

342
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,550
Will:
All right, guys,
you got to get moving

343
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,118
On those "Hello" numbers.

344
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,986
Who has got something
to show us?

345
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:34,987
Volunteers?

346
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,258
Mr. Schuester,
I think I found a song

347
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,394
That sums up my feelings
perfectly.

348
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,828
Fantastic, Rachel.

349
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,697
Show us what you got.

350
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,999
{playing "Gives You Hell"}

351
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:53,172
¶¶ I wake up every evening ¶¶

352
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,508
¶¶ With a big smile on my face ¶¶

353
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:58,311
¶¶ And it never feels
out of place. ¶¶

354
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:00,880
¶¶ When you see my face,
hope it gives you hell ¶¶

¶¶ Hope it gives you hell. ¶¶

356
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,118
¶¶ Now, where's your
picket fence, love? ¶¶

357
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,722
¶¶ And where's that shiny car? ¶¶

358
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,693
¶¶ And did it ever get you far? ¶¶

359
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,162
¶¶ You never seemed
so tense, love. ¶¶

360
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:19,432
¶¶ I've never seen you
fall so hard. ¶¶

361
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,267
¶¶ Do you know where you are? ¶¶

362
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:26,372
¶¶ And truth be told,
I miss you. ¶¶

363
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:31,510
¶¶ And truth be told, I'm lying. ¶¶

364
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:34,080
¶¶ When you see my face,
hope it gives you hell ¶¶

¶¶ Hope it gives you hell. ¶¶

¶¶ Hope it gives you hell. ¶¶

368
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,189
¶¶ If you find a man ¶¶

369
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,124
¶¶ That's worth a damn
and treats you well ¶¶

370
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,959
<i>¶¶ Treats you well ¶¶
¶¶ Then he's a fool ¶¶</i>

371
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:49,161
¶¶ You're just as well ¶¶

372

¶¶ Hope it gives you hell. ¶¶

373
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,266
¶¶ Now, you'll never see ¶¶

374
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,702
¶¶ What you've done to me. ¶¶

375
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,271
¶¶ You can take back
your memories. ¶¶

376
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,973
¶¶ They're no good to me. ¶¶

377
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,775
¶¶ And here's all your lies. ¶¶

378
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:06,012
¶¶ You can look me in the eyes ¶¶

379
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,147
¶¶ With the sad, sad look ¶¶

380
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:12,485
¶¶ That you wear so well. ¶¶

381
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:14,787
All:
¶¶ When you see my face,
hope it gives you hell ¶¶

00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:17,590
¶¶ Hope it gives you hell. ¶¶

¶¶ Never tell. ¶¶</i>

it will treat you well. ¶¶

401
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,735
Will:
Guys, guys, guys.

402
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:04,303
I don't want to
be a buzz-kill,

403
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,106
But the assignment was "Hello."

404
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:10,543
I'm sorry. I was just focusing
on the first syllable.

405
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,278
Will:
You know what?

406
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,546
I don't think
you guys understand

407
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,347
The seriousness
of what we're up against.

408
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,283
While we were busy
winning our sectional,

409
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,785
Vocal Adrenaline
was busy winning theirs.

410
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,854
They're last year's
national champions.

411
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,690
They haven't lost a
competition in three years.

412
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:28,494
This is the big leagues, guys.

413
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:32,465
If we don't place at regionals,
glee club is over.

414
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,090
Lionel Richie, huh?

415
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,860
One of my favorites.

416
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,295
Oh, my god,
you're Jessie St. James.

417
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,797
You're in Vocal Adrenaline.

418
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,165
And you're Rachel Berry.

419
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,734
I saw you perform
at sectionals.

420
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:11,704
Your rendition of "Don't Rain
on My Parade" was flawed.

421
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,506
You totally lacked
Barbra's emotional depth.

422
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,209
But you're talented.

423
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,578
This is one of my
favorite haunts.

424
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,548
I like to come and flip through
the celebrity biographies.

425
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,717
Pick up some lifestyle tips.

426
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm a senior now, so this
year's kind of my victory lap.

427
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:30,222
Snagging a fourth consecutive
national championship

428
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,657
Would just be gravy.

429
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,794
I'm getting out
of Ohio soon.

430
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,529
I've got a full ride
to a little school

431
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,964
Called the University
of California Los Angeles.

432
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:40,766
Maybe you've heard of it.

433
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,201
It's in Los Angeles.

434
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:48,741
What do you say we take it
for a spin?

435
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,310
Here?

436
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:52,912
Oh, no, I-I-I'm kind of nervous.

437
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,280
{sighs}

438
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,949
I remember
when I used to get nervous.

439
00:18:57,017 --> 00:18:59,185
Come on. I do this
all the time.

440
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,420
I like to give impromptu
concerts for the homeless.

441
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,656
It's so important to give back.

442

{playing piano intro to "Hello"}

443
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,701
¶¶ I've been alone ¶¶

444
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,840
¶¶ With you inside my mind. ¶¶

445
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:25,611
¶¶ And in my dreams,
I've kissed your lips ¶¶

446
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,248
¶¶ A thousand times. ¶¶

447
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:32,218
¶¶ I sometimes see you pass ¶¶

448
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:36,455
¶¶ Outside my door. ¶¶

449
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:40,125
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

450
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:44,563
¶¶ Is it me you're looking for? ¶¶

451
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:47,499
Both:
¶¶ I can see it in your eyes. ¶¶

452
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:52,438
¶¶ I can see it in your smile. ¶¶

453
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,642
¶¶ You're all I've ever wanted ¶¶

454
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,379
¶¶ And my arms are open wide. ¶¶

455
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:04,216
¶¶ 'Cause you know
just what to say. ¶¶

456
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:08,787
¶¶ And you know just what to do. ¶¶

457
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:14,260
¶¶ And I want to tell you
so much. ¶¶

458
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,996
¶¶ I love you. ¶¶

459
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,534
¶¶ Oh, yeah. ¶¶

460
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:25,638
¶¶ I long to see the sunlight ¶¶

461
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:29,475
¶¶ In your hair. ¶¶

462
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:34,046
¶¶ And tell you
time and time again ¶¶

463
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:37,950
¶¶ How much I care. ¶¶

464
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:40,920
Both:
¶¶ Sometimes I feel my heart ¶¶

465
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:45,624
¶¶ Will overflow. ¶¶

466
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,559
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

467
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,331
¶¶ I've just got
to let you know. ¶¶

468
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:57,636
¶¶ 'Cause I wonder
where you are. ¶¶

469
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:02,074
¶¶ And I wonder what you do ¶¶
¶¶ I wonder what you do. ¶¶

470
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:05,511
¶¶ Are you somewhere
feeling lonely? ¶¶

471
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:09,348
¶¶ Or is someone loving you? ¶¶

472
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,118
¶¶ Tell me how
to win your heart ¶¶

473
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:17,489
¶¶ For I haven't got a clue. ¶¶

474
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:22,027
¶¶ But let me start by saying ¶¶

475
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:28,334
¶¶ I love you. ¶¶

476
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:34,506
{music stops}

477
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:37,476
{applause}

478
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,311
We should do this
more often.

479
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:41,765
How's Friday night?

480
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,046
Excuse me.

481
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,983
We'd like to send these back.

482
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,584
But you ate all of it.

483
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:56,020
Look, I'm pretty sure
you have to do what we say.

484
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:57,054
And this food

485
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:58,623
Was not satisfactory.

486
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,158
There was a
mouse in mine.

487
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:02,126
So, we'd like more, please.

488
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,532
All right, hottest guys
in the school.

489
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,633
Go.

490
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,169
Okay, um, Puck's
super-fine.

491
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,670
Mm-hmm.
Finn's cute, too.

492
00:22:12,738 --> 00:22:14,505
Yeah, but he's
not hot, though.

493
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:15,740
He really isn't.

494
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,108
And you know what, Brit?

495
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:18,609
I think that dwarf
girlfriend of his

496
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:19,944
Is dragging down
his rep.

497
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:21,179
I mean,
if he were dating,

498
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:23,981
Say, popular pretty girls
like us,

499
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,716
He would go
from dumpy to smokin'.

500
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:26,684
Finn:
Hello?

501
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,386
Hey, I'm right here.

502
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:29,954
Would you guys mind,

503
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,823
Like, including me
in your conversations?

504
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,257
I'll just give you
an introduction

505
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,659
Into the way
that we work.

506
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,461
You buy us dinner and
we make out in front of you.

507
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,896
It's like
the best deal ever.

508
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:40,898
Did you see what Rachel
was wearing today?

509
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,366
I know.

510
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:43,467
She looked
like Pippi Longstocking,

511
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:45,403
But, like, Israeli.

512
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,938
Those sweaters make her
look homeschooled.

513
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,339
{laughing}

514
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:49,607
Hey, guys, come on.
Don't make fun of Rachel.

515
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,676
She's... She's kind of cool.

516
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,477
Finn, that's mean.

517
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:54,812
You know what, actually?
Would you mind

518
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,947
Waiting in the car?

519
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,316
And leave
your credit card.

520
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:05,323
Did you know that dolphins
are just gay sharks?

521
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,593
Yeah.

522
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:20,304
Neil diamond:
¶¶ Hello again. ¶¶

523
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,273
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

524
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:28,646
{will joins in}:
¶¶ Just called to say ¶¶

525
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:32,516
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

526
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:36,320
¶¶ I couldn't sleep ¶¶

527
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:40,358
¶¶ At all tonight ¶¶

528
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:44,195
¶¶ And I know it's late ¶¶

529
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:49,166
¶¶ But I couldn't wait... ¶¶

530
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:51,702
This is the perfect
song for us.

531
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,337
See, he's known this girl
for so long,

532
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,705
But they've just
been friends,

533
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:59,410
And now he's calling her up
to tell her he wants more.

534
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,580
I was sort of inspired

535
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:05,049
By my "Hello" assignment
with the kids.

536
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:06,217
Well, I love it.

537
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,218
Yeah?
I love it.

538
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,887
You do?
{both laughing}

539
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,122
Oh...

540
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,858
I don't know why, but...

541
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,961
I always had a soft spot
for this song.

542
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:21,299
¶¶ You're there at home. ¶¶

543
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,669
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

544
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:33,277
¶¶ Maybe it's been crazy ¶¶

545
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:37,381
¶¶ And maybe I'm to blame ¶¶

546
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:42,086
¶¶ But I put my heart
above my head... ¶¶

547
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:45,456
Too much too fast.
Too much too fast.

548
00:24:45,524 --> 00:24:46,958
You smell great,
your teeth are clean...

549
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:49,193
You're very sweet.
It's not that. I'm...

550
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:53,197
I just haven't been,
uh... Intimate

551
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:56,734
In a very, very long time.

552
00:24:57,903 --> 00:25:00,104
How long?

553
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,608
Ever.

554
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:07,979
¶¶ My friend, hello... ¶¶

555
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:12,350
I just haven't found
the right person.

556
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,618
You know, someone
who won't reject me

557
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:18,689
When things get really hard
with my, um, with my problems.

558
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,760
It-it's cool.

559
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:24,295
It's not.

560
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,930
It's not cool.
I can tell.

561
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:27,231
No, no, no.

562
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,566
Emma...

563
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:31,569
I understand.

564
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:35,973
I'll pop in a movie.

565
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,376
<i>Do we have to watch
Armageddon again?</i>

566
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:41,579
<i>Uh, it's that or Bad Boys.</i>

567
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:43,681
They're the only DVDs
that Terri left behind.

568
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,217
She liked to have Bruckheimer
night every other week.

569
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:48,119
Okay, okay.

570
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:49,787
{clears throat}

571
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,455
¶¶ Hello. ¶¶

572
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,491
{explosions and gunfire on tv}

573
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,595
Finn:
Hey, Rach, can we talk?

574
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:00,264
Look, I want
to apologize.

575
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:02,466
I realized I don't want
to date other girls.

576
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:03,667
Only you.

577
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,002
You do talk too much,

578
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,204
And usually you're just
talking about yourself,

579
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:09,840
But at least I don't feel
alone when I'm with you.

580
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:11,709
I'm glad you've come
to that realization,

581
00:26:11,777 --> 00:26:12,777
But you're too late.

582
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:14,045
I've met someone else--

583
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:16,947
A boy who's finally worthy
of my talent and love.

584
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:18,983
Whoa, whoa, wait.

585
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:20,317
Do I know him?

586
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:21,952
Is he, is he bigger than me?

587
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,288
Oh, he doesn't go to this
school, and he's a senior.

588
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:26,123
His name is Jessie, and he's
the male lead in Vocal Adrenaline.

589
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:28,426
We're both aware that our
Romeo-and-Juliet romance

590
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,461
Will be a challenge,
but our deep respect

591
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:32,196
For each other's talent
will carry us through.

592
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,798
Rachel, don't you think
that's kind of suspicious?

593
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,266
We make it to regionals
and suddenly

594
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,368
The top guy in our main
competition picks you up?

595
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,003
I know it's hard to believe
that anyone would like me

596
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:40,871
Without an ulterior motive,
but you have to respect

597
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:42,907
That our love is real.

598
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:44,575
Move on, Finn.

599
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,177
I finally have.

600
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:56,854
Mr. Shue... We have a problem.

601
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,526
Finn didn't fall
for any of our tricks.

602
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,428
Such as?
I didn't wear a bra,

603
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:09,332
And I had them turn up
the air conditioning.

604
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,268
Ladies, I misjudged you.

605
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:15,071
You may be two of the stupidest
teens I've ever encountered.

606
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:16,739
And that's saying something.

607
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:19,575
I once taught a cheerleading
seminar to a young Sarah Palin.

608
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:21,244
Wait, we did find out

609
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:23,513
Rachel's with some dude
from Vocal Adrenaline.

610
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,214
Name?

611
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:26,783
Jessie St. James.

612
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,387
Ooh, bringing down this club
may be easier than I thought.

613
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:34,657
I'm engorged
with venom and triumph.

614
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,928
Now get the hell
out of my office.

615
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:41,998

00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:32,048
Seriously, guys,

631
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,183
It's like watching
beige paint dry.

632
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:35,218
Could everyone
please look at Jessie?

633
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:37,687
Jessie, give us a show face.

634
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:40,189
That's a show face, guys.

635
00:28:40,257 --> 00:28:41,991
You want to look
so talented,

636
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,593
It's literally hurting you.

637
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,128
I want a look
that's so optimistic,

638
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,229
It could cure cancer.

639
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,632
That's what I'm talking about.

640
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,067
Take five, everybody.
Drink a Red Bull.

641
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,439
Excuse me,
Ms. Corcoran?

642
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:57,640
Hi, I'm Will Schuester.

643
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,475
Sorry, I don't know
who you are.

644
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:02,378
I'm a big fan, really.

645
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:03,946
I also coach
the McKinley glee club.

646
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:05,414
I don't usually
cotton too well

647
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,550
To my competition sneaking in
to watch a rehearsal.

648
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:10,620
But I also have trouble
seeing you guys as competition.

649
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:14,157
I believe you have a student
named Jessie St. James?

650
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:16,692
Yeah, I think he might be
dating one of my students.

651
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,528
I'm more than a little concerned

652
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,663
With the whole fraternizing
with the enemy aspect

653
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,198
Of their relationship.

654
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:23,432
You think we're
spying on you?

655
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,368
Honestly?

656
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:26,569
Yes.

657
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:28,738
Noted.

658
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,072
Look, I don't stand

659
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,141
For any funny business,
and Jessie's a good kid.

660
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,376
I mean, what
can you do?

661
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:37,446
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

662
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,249
Sometimes there's
that little spark.

663
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:50,092
I'm not interested
in coaching

664
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,028
Just your average
high school glee club.

665
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:53,196
I'm driven to excellence.

666
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:54,564
Yeah, excellence.

667
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,666
A lot of people thought
I couldn't take nationals

668
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,702
With a routine where the kids
dance entirely on their hands.

669
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,804
{both panting}

670
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:04,340
Okay... I'm sorry.

671
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:06,442
We have to stop.

672
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,343
I...

673
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:11,280
I just can't do this.

674
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:12,715
Aw, I'm sorry.

675
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,150
I'm all business;
I'm trying to work on that.

676
00:30:14,218 --> 00:30:16,419
No, it isn't that.

677
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:17,386
Are you gay?

678
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:19,055
What?

679
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,256
No.

680
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,190
Because most of the
show choir directors

681
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,725
I make out with are gay.

682
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:28,731
I spend
every waking moment

683
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,733
Thinking about Vocal Adrenaline.

684
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,034
I have no life.

685
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,870
I haven't been on a date
in three years.

686
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,104
Here you go.

687
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:36,172
Thanks.

688
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,774
I did lie
to you earlier.

689
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:39,876
I do know who you are.

690
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:42,178
I saw you
at our fall invitational.

691
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:43,446
I thought you were really cute.

692
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:45,348
{chuckles}

693
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:48,718
You know, I know what you mean--
about being obsessed with work.

694
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:50,453
I'm so committed
to the glee club,

695
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,456
And I think it played a big part
in ending my marriage.

696
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,758
How long have you been divorced?

697
00:30:55,826 --> 00:31:00,630
Um... Well,
I'm not really divorced yet.

698
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,098
And then I-I
started dating

699
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,467
Someone I-I really care about,

700
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,068
But it isn't working
for some reason.

701
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:08,537
Oh, you're already seeing
someone else

702
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,139
And you were just
making out with me.

703
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,942
I'm kind of a mess.

704
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,810
Look, I don't want to tell you
how to live your life...

705
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:16,846
Please, be my guest.

706
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,648
I think you need
to take some time

707
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:20,917
To reintroduce yourself
to yourself.

708
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:22,218
You just finished
being somebody's husband,

709
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:24,353
And that didn't really work out.

710
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:25,855
And now you're running off to be

711
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:27,423
Somebody's
boyfriend?

712
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:29,558
Seems to me you need
to take a little breather.

713
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,494
Look,

714
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:34,697
That hair, that dimple,

715
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:38,000
That terrible clunker
you drive--

716
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:40,569
I think you're about the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

717
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,438
Here's my number.

718
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:46,108
When you get things sorted out,
give me a call.

719
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,276
Thank you
for the coffee.

720
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:51,480
And the making out--
kind of hot.

721
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:01,557
{bell ringing}

722
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,858
Hey, guys.

723
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,293
Cut the butter,
Benedict Arnold.

724
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:06,796
We heard
about your new boyfriend.

725
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:08,130
Look, Rachel,

726
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,398
We're all happy
that you're happy,

727
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,000
But we've worked too hard
in glee club

728
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,035
To let you throw it all away
on a relationship

729
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,303
That might not
even be real.

730
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:16,372
Why, 'cause he's
in Vocal Adrenaline?

731
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,141
<i>Their motto is
"aut neca aut necatus eris."</i>

732
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,944
Which loosely translates
to "murder or be murdered."

733
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:24,013
They give their dancers
human growth hormone.

734
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:25,181
Look, we're
not saying

735
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,649
The dude is playing you.
He's playing you.

736
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:29,151
We just think that until
regionals are over,

737
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:31,887
We can't risk the
possibility that he is.

738
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:33,089
None of us want
to go through

739
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:34,423
What happened
at sectionals again.

740
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:38,627
Okay, look, Jessie and I
might not be true love,

741
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:39,929
But what if we are?

742
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:42,732
I know who I am.

743
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,735
And how many chances at this
am I going to get?

744
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:49,238
If you don't break up
with him, you're out.

745
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:51,374
You can't kick me out!

746
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,576
But we can all quit
if Mr. Shue doesn't.

747
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:56,612
Well, good luck winning
without me.

748
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,382
Everyone is replaceable,
even you.

749
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:01,150
How could you do this to me?

750
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:03,319
How could you
do this to us?

751
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,321
We're a team, and

752
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,156
All you've ever wanted was
for us to be great,

753
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:09,158
And be a part
of something special.

754
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,360
Now is that still true or not?

755
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:13,062
{bell ringing}

756
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,349
You wanted to see me,
Coach Sylvester?

757
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,984
I did, Rachel.

758
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,386
I want to introduce you

759
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,888
To the McKinley High
Old Maids Club.

760
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:35,930
Woman:
Have a seat,

761
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,097
Boy hips.

762
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:42,536
I don't understand.

763
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,371
Well, Rachel, it's
come to my attention

764
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,206
That you've been
given the old heave-ho

765
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,409
By that Terribly
uncoordinated Finn Hudson.

766
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,177
Ouch.
And I also understand

767
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,579
You have a serious suitor
in the form a piping hot

768
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:53,814
Hunkwad from
another district,

769
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:55,249
But that your fellow

770
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:57,751
Glee clubbers are so incensed
with betrayal,

771
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,654
They barely have time
to apply Freeze-Off

772
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,690
To the clusters of warts
between their knuckles.

773
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,625
How did you know that?

774
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:06,360
Brit and I told everybody
in glee club

775
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:07,561
About Jessie St. James.

776
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,029
They're furious.

777
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,798
If Rachel falls for him,
the club will self-destruct.

778
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,132
Outstanding.
On to step two.

779
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,101
Round up a bunch of
mustache-sporting teenage girls

780
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:15,469
With glandular conditions.

781
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:16,770
Anything else?

782
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,739
Sometimes
I forget my middle name.

783
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,808
I know how torn
you must be, Berry.

784
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,509
My freshman year,

785
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:24,878
I fell for a boy on an
opposing wrestling squad,

786
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:26,580
But my team
wouldn't go for it.

787
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,650
So, the next time
I stepped onto the mat,

788
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,151
I pinned him so hard,
it ruptured his scrotum,

789
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,419
Ending his run for

790
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,587
The state championship

791
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,955
And my run for his heart.

792
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,557
To my team,

793
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,792
I was a legend.

794
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,028
But I relished this
victory in solitude.

795
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:42,730
Now,

796
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,064
I spend my Friday nights

797
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,299
Making out with my cat

798
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,367
<i>And watching
Ghost Whisperer.</i>

799
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:47,568
Sue:
Well, Rachel,

800
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:48,802
If I weren't ignoring

801
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,204
What these ladies were saying

802
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:52,573
Out of an overwhelming sense
of deep repulsion,

803
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,508
I would probably hear them
encouraging you

804
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,977
To go for it
with your Carmel High beau.

805
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:59,380
Or you might end up like

806
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,348
Dottie here, who,
although her father offered

807
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,751
A sizeable dowry,
which included livestock,

808
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,053
Still couldn't get a date
to homecoming.

809
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,554
No homecoming?

810
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:10,357
Sue:
No valentines,
no sock hop.

811
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:13,761
Rachel, you need
to become even more narcissistic

812
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,462
And self-centered
than you already are.

813
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,632
Think of yourself--
your potential happiness.

814
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,768
If not,

815
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,703
Join the club.

816
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,549
{door closing}

817
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:37,217
Terri:
Beautiful table.

818
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:38,819
Meticulous, really.

819
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:42,423
I guess being crazy
has its benefits.

820
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,859
It's date night.

821
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,395
Actually, it was tomorrow,

822
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,297
But Will wanted tonight,
so, I'm surprising him.

823
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:51,598
And I know

824
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,400
He keeps a key under the mat.

825
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:56,003
You're really loving this,
aren't you?

826
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,839
I take no pleasure
in your pain, Terri.

827
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,207
But I am enjoying

828
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,176
Seeing will get a second chance
at happiness, yes.

829
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,777
Oh, and you're the one
to introduce him

830
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:05,145
To this magical new world
of bliss?

831
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:06,280
What, you with your
three-times-a-day showers

832
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,681
And the fact
that you can't sleep

833
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,216
Unless your shoes are all
in a row?

834
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,151
Is there a reason
that you're here?

835
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,687
'Cause I'd kind of like you
to be gone when Will gets home.

836
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,193
I just need to pick up the rest
of my Bruckheimer DVDs.

837
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:32,106
Whose is this?

838
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:33,674
That's mine.

839
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,409
<i>I got really tired of watching
Con Air every night.</i>

840
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,311
And will picked "Hello"
as our song.

841
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,480
Oh, you poor girl.

842
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:43,750
Don't bother sleeping
with my husband tonight.

843
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:44,985
You're already
screwed.

844
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,520
"Hello" was our prom song.

845
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,690
I mean, I doubt Will remembers.

846
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:52,893
He goes to the market for milk,
comes home with a pack of gum.

847
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,795
You're lying.

848
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,967
Ask him.

849
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:03,203
Or better yet,
go to the library

850
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:06,440
<i>And look it up for yourself
in that year's Thunderclap.</i>

851
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,844
{spoon clinks}

852
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:12,813
Sorry.

853
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,917
Jessie?

854
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:21,822
Who's there?

855
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,727
I carry a rape whistle.

856
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:27,494
Just me.

857
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:28,862
{sighs}

858
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,598
Most spots are 2,500 watts.

859
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,133
This one is ten
times brighter.

860
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:35,636
We have to wear sunscreen
onstage, but it's worth it.

861
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:38,338
I guess everything is bigger
and brighter here.

862
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:39,540
{chuckles}

863
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:43,210
I have to ask you something.

864
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,279
And I need you
to tell me the truth,

865
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,080
Because if you don't,
there will be consequences--

866
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:49,016
Life-and-death consequences.

867
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,185
Because if I give myself to you,

868
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:53,487
And it turns out
that you're just playing me,

869
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,455
I might die.

870
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,058
Okay, okay, not literally,
but emotionally.

871
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:00,994
It'll be the kind of heartbreak
that girls like me hold

872
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:04,131
<i>For the rest of their lives,
like Barbra in The Way We Were.</i>

873
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,300
{laughing}:
Oh, my God.

874
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,302
What?

875
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,604
You're more of a drama queen
than I am.

876
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,577
Hi.

877
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,212
I'm jessie.

878
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:20,380
I know who you are.

879
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,482
You know Jessie St. James,

880
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,185
The star of Vocal Adrenaline,
your competition at regionals.

881
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:28,121
I want to introduce
you to Jessie,

882
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,791
The guy who's
nuts about you,

883
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,826
The guy who would
never hurt you.

884
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,470
{sighs}

885
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:48,342
- No one can know.
- I understand.

886
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:06,094
{bell ringing}
Hi.

887
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:09,064
Hey.

888
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:11,400
I get home
last night, and

889
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,635
It was like some
ghost had laid out

890
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:16,204
This beautiful,
romantic meal for me.

891
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:17,572
A ghost who wears
your perfume.

892
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,241
I was just in the library.

893
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:22,344
Page 42.

894
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay.

895
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:29,551
Oh, my... My junior prom.

896
00:39:39,328 --> 00:39:41,263
I wanted to surprise you
on Wednesday.

897
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,899
Terri came by and, um,

898
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:47,035
Told me about the prom...
About the song.

899
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,704
Emma, I-I have no feelings
about this night anymore.

900
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:51,540
I didn't even remember the song.

901
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,241
No. I know.
I know, not consciously.

902
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,278
But somewhere inside,

903
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:57,679
You're still not over her.

904
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:01,583
We were naive.

905
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,118
I think sometimes we spend

906
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:06,555
So much time with these kids
that we start acting like them.

907
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,292
You've been
in the same relationship

908
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:13,061
Your entire life.

909
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:15,197
You don't know
who you are alone.

910
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:17,732
I think this song is just

911
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,502
The beginning of you
repeating the same patterns.

912
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,504
Terri and I met
when I was 15.

913
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:24,039
I'm a different person now.

914
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:26,274
How is you compromising yourself

915
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:30,612
For my crazy any different
than you doing it for hers?

916
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:45,694
Well... What do
you want to do?

917
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:47,762
I think that...

918
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,299
...You need to spend
some time alone.

919
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,637
I do. I think you need
to get to know yourself.

920
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,272
You know, you haven't been okay

921
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,307
With having your own needs
since you were 15.

922
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:08,917
You're right.

923
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,052
I guess...

924
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,054
I'm just not good
at being alone...

925
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:16,291
And realizing what
my own needs are.

926
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:21,696
Well, maybe around the time that
you figure out what they are...

927
00:41:21,764 --> 00:41:24,232
Maybe I'll be ready
to get a little messy.

928
00:41:27,937 --> 00:41:30,005
Can you go now?

929
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:34,776
I think I need
to close the door and cry.

930
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:35,911
{laughs}

931
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:37,012
{clears throat}

932
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,184
{sighs}

933
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,573
{crying softly, bell ringing}

934
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,575
Hey.

935
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:07,776
I ended it with Jessie.

936
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:08,910
You can spread the word.

937
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,712
I know you know how to do that.

938
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,114
Look, I'm sorry, uh...

939
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:14,783
Look, I know
this really sucks for you

940
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,352
But I think it's for the best.

941
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,087
Taking one for the team.
I get it.

942
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:20,689
No, not just for the team.

943
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:22,424
For us.

944
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,259
You and me.

945
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:25,927
I've been thinking a lot lately.

946
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:27,529
I feel like I have

947
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,564
All these problems, you know,

948
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,766
With Quinn and-and basketball
and girls and stuff,

949
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,068
And I've been so overwhelmed

950
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,669
Trying to figure them all out.

951
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:37,639
Then I realized the only thing
I needed to fix was us.

952
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:42,611
I want us to be together,
Rachel.

953
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:44,746
A real couple.

954
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:50,452
Look, I even circled some dates
on your crazy calendar.

955
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,088
Is you not being able
to talk right now

956
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,056
A good thing or a bad thing?

957
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:57,092
I can't.
Can't what?

958
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,162
I-I can't be a couple with you.

959
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:06,001
It's the team.

960
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:09,270
We-we can't have any,
um, drama right now.

961
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,640
You know, we need... We need
to focus on regionals.

962
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:14,409
And I appreciate your offer,

963
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:16,911
But in the spirit
of being a team player,

964
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,880
I have to decline.

965
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:20,248
Hey, whoa.

966
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:22,217
{laughs}

967
00:43:22,284 --> 00:43:24,753
I'm not just some guy
that you met at the music store

968
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,887
That you can just blow off.

969
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:28,690
I don't give up that easy.

970
00:43:32,395 --> 00:43:34,262
See you at rehearsal.
