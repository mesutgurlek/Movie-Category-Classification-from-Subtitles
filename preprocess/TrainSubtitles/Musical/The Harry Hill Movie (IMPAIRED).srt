- Your hands are cold.
- Bless him. And he's only young.

496
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,559
Yeah. So if you could see your
way clear to showing us round.

497
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,119
It'd mean the world to him.

I'd love to, darling,
but I'm very busy, you see.

00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,161
Maybe this'll change your mind?

has zero possibility

517

The mass defect of a nucleus

is the difference between the total
mass of all its separate nucleons

Au revoir.

1259
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,879

1264
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,843
- Guess who?
- Harry!

1265
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,839
I'm coming, Abu. I'm coming.

1266
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,839
Nan and Harry! Hurrah!

1267
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,485
Try and get closer, Nan.

1268
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,559
I expect you're wondering
how I learnt to fly a helicopter?

1269
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:16,479
Well, I spent three years out in 'Nam
flying the old H-46's for the green berets.

1270
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,159
I was first out of Saigon
when things started to get sticky,

1271
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,639
and I've spent the last 8 years ferrying
the Pope to corporate engagements.

1272
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,119
Roger that, Harry. On my way.

1273
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,245
- Stop flapping and start scrapping.
- Undo his buttons, Abu!

helpful as a bag of farts.

- What?

Ah!

01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,879
Well, that's higher than it looks.

1289
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,319
- I'm slipping!
- Hold tight, Abu.

1290
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,170

- Ah!

1291
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,079
Oh!

1292
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,567
- Take us down, Nan.
- Roger that.

1293
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,879
Nan to Control Tower.

1294
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,359
Permission to land on a

Are you all right?

1297
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,439
Sorry about all that

1298
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,165
What? You've got a nerve.

1299
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,159
Don't mention it.

- (ABU) Harry!
- Ow.

1301
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,559
Well, Abu. At least you finally
got to see the Blackpool Tower.

1302
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,239
- Hey!
- Michelle.

1303
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,046
- Ow.
- Come here, you.

1304
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,439
Make way for the king!

1305
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,239
Excuse me, king coming through.

1306
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,359
Your Majesty.

1307
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,119
Harry, I was wrong about you.

1308
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,239
You are a true hero.

1309
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,603
Maybe there's something in this
interspecies carry-on after all.

1310
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,445
I give you permission
to marry my daughter.

1311
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,519
Marry? Who said anything
about marriage?

1312
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,999
What's the rush?
Maybe cohabit first?

1313
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,488
After all... there's plenty
of room for everyone.

1314
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,963
- Even for me?
- Not so much.

1315
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,079
That's it. Go on, cart him off.
That's it. Get out of it!

1316
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,800
I'm just pleased to see
a happy ending.

1317
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,527
Abu, what's that you're sucking?

1318
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,639
A green felt tip pen?

1319
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,439
That's why he's been throwing up.

1320
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,599
Where did you get this?

1321
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,839
Sorry, Harry. I planted
it in your house.

1322
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,519
Hamsters love to suck on a
felt tip but it makes them sick.

1323
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,039
I knew you'd bring him to my vet's
surgery and then I could steal him.

1324
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:04,290
Right, so you didn't think to steal Abu
then? When you gave him the pen?

1325
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,399
- Oh, yeah.
- (HARRY) Yeah.

1326
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,279
Well, the good news is:
he's not going to die any time soon.

1327
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,119
So you're blaming me
for the whole caper?

1328
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,719
Nonsense, Abu. If you hadn't
sucked that green felt tip

1329
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,048
I never would have met my Michelle.

1330
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,119
How come you can
understand Hamster now?

1331
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,479
We all can! It's a conceit to
speed up the end of the movie!

1332
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,439
I'll take him down
the station, Mr H.

1333
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,919
Not yet, Officer.
We'll need him for the finale song.

1334
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,799
Ooh.

1335
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,719
