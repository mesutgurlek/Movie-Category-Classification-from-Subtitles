00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:05,542
<i>¶¶Madonna.¶¶</i>

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,778
<i>Simply saying the word aloud
makes me feel powerful.</i>

3
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:12,115
<i>Even in voice-over,
how I have worshipped her</i>

4
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,883
<i>ever since I was a little girl.</i>

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:17,387
<i>Sorry, Angie Jolie,
Catherine the Great...</i>

6
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:19,889
<i>Madonna is the most powerful woman</i>

7
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,392
<i>to ever walk the face
of the Earth.</i>

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,627
I'm instating a new policy whereby

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,432
quite loudly, throughout
the entire school day.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,202
But blasting her delicious
hooks would make it impossible

11
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,070
for the students to concentrate.

12
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:36,306
Ah, who cares? Madonna
never finished college.

13
00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:37,707
She hopped a cab for
the bright lights

14
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,677
of New York City with
35 bucks in her pocket.

15
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:43,346
And I think we should encourage
our pupils to do the same.

16
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:44,814
You say the word,
and I will provide you

17
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,282
a list of the students
I believe should be

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,817
rounded up and shipped
off immediately.

19
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:50,620
I am sorry, Sue.
This is insanity!

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,089
What you call insanity,
I call inspiration.

21
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:55,425
Let me break it down for you.

22
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,327
It's been the biggest
dream of my career

23
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,828
to pay homage to Madonna...

24
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,830
the woman most responsible
for my take-no-prisoners

25
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,266
demeanor, and my subconscious
tendency to always be

26
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,268
desperately looking for
someone named Susan.

27
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,170
And now, my Cheerio Squad this year

28
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:09,939
finally has the talent to
make that dream come true.

29
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,175
You will not take
that dream from me.

30
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,310
Do you not understand

31
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,012
the blackmail process
and how it works?

32
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,515
Smile.

33
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,185
I have your wife's phone
number on speed dial.

34
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,588
To recap, you will be
playing those Madonna hits

35
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,957
throughout the day at
an earsplitting volume.

36
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:32,529
Understood?
Santana.

37
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,863
What does your bracelet say?

38
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,067
<i>¶¶W.W.M.D.¶¶
¶¶What would Madonna do?¶¶</i>

39
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,235
Well, the answer to
that question is usually

40
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:40,603
date a younger man.

41
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,906
So, let's see some
arm candy, girls.

42
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,541
Sorry, freshmen.

43
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:46,676
You're going to have to start
trolling the middle schools.

44
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:49,145
And you know why?
'Cause if you want to be

45
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,214
as riveting a performer
as Madonna...

46
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:53,116
a skill that will nab us Nationals

47
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,785
this year... you're
going to have to start

48
00:01:55,853 --> 00:02:00,190
thinking like her, acting like her.
Also...

49
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,991
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â  la Madonna,
I will no longer acknowledge

50
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,626
that any of you have last names.

51
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:07,097
Becky Jackson.
From now on,

52
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:12,936
you're just Becky... You know,
it's like Madonna once said,

53
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,638
¶¶I'm tough, I'm ambitious,
and I know what I want.

54
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:19,109
If that makes me a bitch, okay.¶¶

55
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:23,546
I'm pretty sure she stole that line
from one Sue Sylvester.

56
00:02:23,614 --> 00:02:24,948
No, really, she stole it from me.

57
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:29,819
I said it first. Palladium. '87.

58
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,130
- Can I ask you guys something private?
- Yes, you should move to Israel.

59
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:48,671
It's about dating.
Not that I'm dating anyone.

60
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,306
We all know that Finn and
I are no longer an item,

61
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:51,941
and for the sake of the team,
I broke up with Jessie.

62
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,512
But let's just say I
was dating someone.

63
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,781
Let's just say, hypothetically,
we went to a Wiggles concert

64
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,083
last Friday night,
and then because my dads

65
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,417
weren't home, we went up to my room

66
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:05,021
and started making out.
It was erotic and romantic.

67
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:09,092
And then he said...
We should do it.

68
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,763
- ¶¶It¶¶? Totally.
- Haven't you done it before?

69
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:17,500
- No. - Have you?

70
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:23,173
- What do you think?
- It's no big deal.

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,341
For a girl, it is.

72
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,911
What if then he got really
crabby and left, and didn't even

73
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:29,946
take home the Care Bear I
won him playing Skee Ball?

74
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,949
Would you please stop talking?
You're grossing out my baby.

75
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:35,318
I just want to be ready...
I know I'm getting older,

76
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:37,787
and these things are going
to happen someday, but

77
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,990
how do I stop a guy from getting
mad at me for saying no?

78
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,859
Just do what I do.
Never say no.

79
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,662
Oh, totally. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?

80
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,164
- Sorry, Quinn.
- Look, girl, don't ask me.

81
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:49,933
The last guy I liked was
the mayor of gaytown.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,434
And I can't wait to get a guy

83
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,870
- ...Mad at me for saying no.
- We just have to accept

84
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:55,838
that guys don't care
about our feelings.

85
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,174
Like, the other day,
I was walking with Artie...

86
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,676
I've thought a lot about it,
and I forgive you

87
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,211
for lying about your stutter.

88
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,146
However, if you're planning
on getting all up on this,

89
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,681
I'm going to need you
to make some changes.

90
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:06,916
The goth thing was two years ago,
so maybe lose

91
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:09,485
the vampire makeup and consider
some tighter-fitting clothing.

92
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,988
You've got the pow, and I
believe you should work it more

93
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:16,459
if we're going to be an item.
That's got to sting.

94
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:21,297
Hey, guys. I'm sorry
to interrupt your little sorority,

95
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,565
but I couldn't help but overhearing.

96
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,401
Are you really having
that much boy trouble?

97
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,204
You wouldn't understand,
Mr. Shue. You're a guy.

98
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:32,141
Well, then maybe you should
talk to someone else about it.

99
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,244
- Like Ms. Pillsbury.
- I tried that.

100
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,546
Oh, um, that's a
hot-button topic, isn't it?

101
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,214
I mean, when to do that.

102
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:39,916
This is the perfect chat
to have with your mom.

103
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,986
- I have two gay dads.
- Right, right... you...

104
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,387
How about your rabbi?

105
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,522
I really don't feel
comfortable talking about this

106
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,993
with Rabbi Greenberg.
Aren't you a guidance counselor?

107
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:55,999
The fact is is that women
still earn 70 cents,

108
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:59,235
to every dollar that a man
does for doing the same job.

109
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,070
That attitude starts
in high school.

110
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:06,809
I don't know what to say. I mean,

111
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:09,312
I can't do this job if I don't
have the kids' confidence.

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,714
Now, I get that this
area of interest is, uh,

113
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:14,884
your blind spot, but I want to
help you so that the next time

114
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,286
a girl comes in here asking those

115
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:20,990
kinds of questions, you'll be prepared.
I'm not saying you need to have sex.

116
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,893
No! No, no, no. No,
that's not what you were offering.

117
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,061
- Just...
- Why would you offer that?

118
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,630
- It wasn't what I was thinking.
- Wishful thinking is all that was.

119
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,132
I mean, what this is
all really about is

120
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,633
teenage girls feeling
like they have no power.

121
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,602
Right, and it makes sense, too.
I mean, look at their

122
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,371
role models, you know? You've got
Britney Spears and her shaved head.

123
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,774
<i>Lindsay Lohan looks like something
out of Lord of the Rings.</i>

124
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:39,075
Ann Coulter.

125
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:44,280
Let's work together
to try to find a way

126
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:45,948
to make them feel more
confident about themselves.

127
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,418
Yeah, I like that.

128
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,953
Yes, we will change the
world one girl at a time.

129
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,822
We'll be like a girl-saving team.

130
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,591
And maybe along the way,
we can find

131
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,627
a way to help you, too.

132
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:26,322

Sloppy freak show babies!

141
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,746
Somewhere in the
English countryside,

142
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,517
in a stately manor home,
Madonna is weeping!

143
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,152
Hit the showers!

144
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,424
Oh, hey, William.

145
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,225
I thought I smelled cookies wafting

146
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,861
from the ovens of the little
elves who live in your hair.

147
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:42,432
- Wow, Sue. I'm really impressed.
- Yeah, well, Madonna is legend.

148
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,635
And I want my girls to learn
all the lessons she has to offer:

149
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:48,271
Strength, independence...

150
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:52,275
Nobody quite like the Material Girl
to empower my Cheerios.

151
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:54,277
Just like your hairdresser
has empowered you

152
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:56,512
to look absolutely ridiculous.

153
00:07:57,815 --> 00:08:03,553
- I'll see you later, Sue.
- You think this is hard?

154
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,457
I'm passing a gallstone
as we speak! That's hard!

155
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:10,026
What comes to mind
when you see that name?

156
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:13,596
- Genius. Icon.
- Hall of Fame MILF.

157
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:18,768
So, we're all aware of Madonna's
musical and cultural significance,

158
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:21,938
which is why this week,
your assignment

159
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,806
is to come up with
a Madonna number.

160
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:27,743
- Yes! Yes!
- Uh, Mr. Shue?

161
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,146
As a dude, Madonna makes
me kind of uncomfortable.

162
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:31,614
Yeah, she's smokin' and everything,

163
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,216
but can't some of us
do something else?

164
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:37,854
Like the guy version of Madonna?
Like, you know, Pantera?

165
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:39,689
Guys! You know,
it's come to my attention

166
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,157
that many of you
haven't been treating

167
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:44,560
the young ladies of our
group very nicely lately.

168
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:46,529
You're disrespectful, bullying,

169
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,499
sexist, and I hate to say it,
misogynistic.

170
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,534
I have no idea what that means.

171
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,804
When I pulled my hamstring,
I went to a misogynist.

172
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,910
What it means is, put yourself
in their shoes for a change.

173
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:04,046
Culturally, Madonna's
legacy transcends her music,

174
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:06,382
because by and large,
the subtext of her songs are about

175
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,718
being strong, independent

176
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:11,487
and-and confident,
no matter what your sex.

177
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,723
But more than anything,
Madonna's musical message

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,224
is about equality.

179
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,494
And that is something I think
you guys need to work on.

180
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:22,031
Mr. Shue, I don't think we can
have an honest conversation

181
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,366
about Ms. Ciccone
without acknowledging

182
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,668
that her images are as
indelible as her songs.

183
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,737
I would like to honor her
contributions by tackling

184
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,138
a multi-media project

185
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,007
- with Mercedes.
- Great.

186
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:34,176
- Go for it, Kurt.
- I'm still not down.

187
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,344
And no chick intimidates Puckzilla.

188
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:37,813
I just don't think her music
translates to show choir.

189
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,883
Really? Well I, for one,
couldn't disagree more.

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,754
Express Yourself,go.

191
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,928
<i>¶¶Do you believe in love? </i>

192
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:53,496
<i>¶¶'Cause I got something
to say about it, </i>

193
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:55,865
<i>¶¶and it goes something like this. </i>

194
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:59,936
<i>¶¶Don't go for second best, baby, </i>

195
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:02,338
<i>¶¶put your love to the test. </i>

196
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:04,774
<i>¶¶You know, you know,
you've got to </i>

197
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,810
<i>¶¶make him express how he feels </i>

198
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:11,113
<i>¶¶and maybe then you
know your love is real. </i>

199
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,218
<i>¶¶You don't need diamond rings </i>

200
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:21,190
<i>¶¶or 18-karat gold, </i>

201
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:24,727
<i>¶¶fancy cars that go very fast,
you know, </i>

202
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:29,098

203
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,368
<i>¶¶What you need is a big,
strong hand </i>

204
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:37,640
<i>¶¶to lift you to
your higher ground. </i>

205
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,143
<i>¶¶Make you feel like
a queen on a throne </i>

206
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:46,582
<i>¶¶make him love you till
you can't come down. </i>

207
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,652
<i>¶¶Don't go for second best, baby, </i>

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,321
<i>¶¶put your love to the test. </i>

209
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,590
<i>¶¶You know, you know,

210
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,593
<i>¶¶make him express how he feels </i>

211
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:03,032
<i>¶¶and maybe then you'll
know your love is real. </i>

212
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,903
<i>¶¶And when you're gone,
he might regret it. </i>

213
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,740
<i>¶¶Think about the
love you once had, </i>

214
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,376
<i>¶¶Try to carry on, </i>

215
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:15,778
<i>¶¶But he just won't get it. </i>

216
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:19,849
<i>¶¶Hey... ¶¶He'll be back
on his knees, so please </i>

217
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,152
<i>¶¶Don't go for second best, baby, </i>

218
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,421
<i>¶¶put your love to the test. </i>

219
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,823
<i>¶¶You know,
you know you've got to </i>

220
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,593

221
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:34,230

222
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,165
<i>¶¶Let him know your love is real. </i>

223
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,602
<i>¶¶You've got to make
him express himself. </i>

224
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,638
<i>¶¶Hey, hey, hey, hey. </i>

225
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,675
<i>¶¶Put your love to the test.,
¶¶So if you want it right now, </i>

226
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:48,010
<i>¶¶make him show you how.
¶¶Make him show how he feels. </i>

227
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,979
<i>¶¶Express what he's got. </i>

228
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,114
<i>¶¶Oh, baby, ready or not. </i>

229
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:55,317
<i>¶¶Express yourself. </i>

230
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,322
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.

231
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:07,237
- I look smokin' hot.
- Guess who I'm dating.

232
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:10,473
- Who? - Wes Brody.
He's super cute.

233
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,242
He plays soccer with my sister.

234
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,612
- He's seven. - Oh! Crap.

235
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,648
I need a younger, inferior man.
If I don't find one,

236
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,417
Coach Sylvester will kick me
off the Cheerios, for sure.

237
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,718
Hello? Finn!

238
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,586
His birthday's like
three days before yours,

239
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:24,921
and he's super dumb.

240
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,023
We already tried with Finn,
and he hates us.

241
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,326
Trust me, the way to get a
man to follow you forever...

242
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:32,462
take his virginity.

243
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,798
Madonna, like,
wrote a song about it.

244
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:38,768
<i>¶¶You're not convinced that
that is enough... </i>

245
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,437
Hey, Finnocence.

246
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:43,006
You know, I've been thinking,
and I think we should go out.

247
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:44,874
Just you and me this time,
no third wheel.

248
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:48,278
- Will you talk to me this time?
- I don't really talk during.

249
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,216
Look, Finn, It's high
time you lost the big V.

250
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,452
Everything about
you screams virgin.

251
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,721
You're about as sexy
as a Cabbage Patch Kid.

252
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,658
- It's exhausting to look at you.
- Well, look, I appreciate the offer,

253
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:02,959
but I have feelings
for someone else,

254
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,661
and I'm trying to work
things out with them. So...

255
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,129
Who, Rachel?

256
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,164
She's dating that Jessie
kid from Vocal Adrenaline.

257
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,967
No, she's not.
Please, you can smell it on her.

258
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,469
She's like a cat in heat.

259
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:14,704
She talked about him
yesterday and practically

260
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:20,076
- Sprayed the choir room.
- So come on, let's do the deed.

261
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,611
It'll be great for my image,

262
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,346
and Sue will promote
me to head cheerleader.

263
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:24,447
It's win-win.

264
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:27,884
Wait, what...
what do I get out of it?

265
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:29,219
I don't know.

266
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,387
You get to have sex and
make Rachel jealous.

267
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:36,126
- I meant for me, okay?
- It's win-win for me.

268
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,664
- You wanted to see me? - Sue!

269
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:44,033
Um... Yeah. Thank you for coming.
Please sit down.

270
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:50,086
No. Okay.
Um, I was just wondering

271
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,475
why Madonna's playing
everywhere except my office.

272
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,043
Well, it's simple, Arlene.

273
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:57,046
You don't deserve the
power of Madonna.

274
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:58,248
You have none of her
self-confidence,

275
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:01,417
her power over her body
or her sexual magnetism.

276
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:04,087
Simply put, you have
all the sensuality

277
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,156
of one of those
pandas down at the zoo

278
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,757
who refuse to mate.

279
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:11,995
I had your, uh,
intercom disconnected.

280
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,068
There you go.

281
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,070
Finn, I was just
coming to find you.

282
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,640
Look, I know that the boys
were a little uncomfortable

283
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:25,141
about this Madonna assignment,

284
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,377
so I figured you and
I as co-captains

285
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,112
could do a little mash-up
of a bunch of her songs

286
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,181
just to show everyone
how cool it can be.

287
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,817
Yeah, sure, whatever.

288
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,618
Look, are you still
dating that Jessie kid?

289
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:39,489
- No, no. - Who told you that?

290
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:42,158
Look, I know things have
been weird between us,

291
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,161
but I never thought
you'd lie to me.

292
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,030
Look, please just
don't tell anyone.

293
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:48,498
Unbelievable.

294
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,701
We may not be together
the way that Jessie and I are,

295
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,536
but we can still be friends.

296
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:59,175
I-I'm asking you
as my friend to trust me.

297
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:05,548
Fine... but if this leads to
something bad for all of us,

298
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:08,251
don't expect any more
friendship from me.

299
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,522
- Noted.
- All right, let's rehearse, then.

300
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:26,302
<i>¶¶Something in the way you
love me won't let me be. </i>

301
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,974

307
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,359

308
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,527

309

310
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:57,834

311
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:02,038

312
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,009

00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:09,879
<i>¶¶I'll give you love if you,

314
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:14,784

316

322
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:41,978

something to say. </i>

323
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:46,649
<i>¶¶Open your heart to me, baby. </i>

324
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:50,820
<i>¶¶I'll hold the lock

325
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:54,924

326
00:16:54,992 --> 00:17:00,029
<i>¶¶I'll give you love if you,

327
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:03,299
<i>¶¶Open your heart,
I'll make you love me. </i>

328
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:06,936
<i>¶¶I'll hold the lock
and you hold the key. </i>

329
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:10,807
<i>¶¶Open your heart to me, darling </i>

330
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:15,345
<i>¶¶I'll give you love if you,
you turn the key. </i>

331
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:25,254
<i>¶¶Open your heart with the key. </i>

332
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,627
- That was good. - Totally.

333
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:40,548
- Hey guys, how's the assignment
coming along? - Oh, amazing.

334
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,950
You know how Madonna kind of
reinvented the video, right?

335
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,219
Well, we got Artie and
the A/V Club to help out.

336
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,021
We're gonna make a
Madonna video of our own.

337
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:48,823
It's going to be Madge-ical.

338
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,925
Madge... you know,
Madonna's nickname?

339
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,994
Okay, you really got to
get up to speed here.

340
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:53,794
Hey... Schuester!

341
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:57,765
I heard a juicy little rumor
that your Up With People rejects

342
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,300
were doing some Madonna songs.
Is that true?

343
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,369
Yeah, well, to be honest, Sue,

344
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,037
I got inspired
watching your Cheerios.

345
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,172
Well, I have been waiting
years to pay tribute to her,

346
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,108
and you are not swooping
in at the last minute

347
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,610
to snatch her from my talons.

348
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,713
Madonna belongs to me,
and I will not be copied.

349
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:16,717
- It's in my contract.
I want you to listen very closely.

350
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:19,320
You can have your
Barbras and your Chers

351
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,921
and your Christinas...

352
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,024
and wow, I just lost
my train of thought.

353
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,792
You have so much
margarine in your hair.

354
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,862
Okay, first of all,
my kids are doing Madonna.

355
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,297
She's public domain, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

356
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,867
Secondly, enough
with the hair jokes.

357
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:36,370
Oh, by the way, how's the Florence
Henderson look working out for you?

358
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:39,473
<i>Oh... ¶¶And you should know I
suffer the same... </i>

359
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,877
Oh, maybe you should try a
new setting on your Flowbee.

360
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:44,578
Oh, snap!

361
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:54,188
<i>¶¶Love is a bird,
¶¶she needs to fly. </i>

362
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:58,159
<i>¶¶Let all the hurt inside
of you die. </i>

363
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:03,764
<i>¶¶You're frozen
¶¶when your heart's not open... </i>

364
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:06,701
Who else wants a
piece of this, huh?!

365
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:15,843
<i>¶¶Give yourself to me. </i>

366
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:25,352
Hey, uh, so, that offer of yours
to lose... the big V...

367
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,956
...I'm in.

368
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:33,160
<i>¶¶If I could melt your heart... </i>

369
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:42,470
- Ms. Sylvester, we'd like a word.
- We saw how upset you got today.

370
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,105
I don't know what
you're talking about.

371
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,473
We saw your face

372
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,141
after Mr. Schuester
insulted your hair.

373
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:52,113
Close the door. Sit down.

374
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,320
You know, kids, I grew up
with a handi-capable sister.

375
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:02,723
My parents were
famous Nazi hunters,

376
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,160
- So they weren't around a lot.
- I had to bring her up on my own.

377
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,162
I didn't have a lot
of time or money

378
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,264
to keep up with all
the latest looks.

379
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,102
<i>But on my sixth birthday,
True Blue was released.</i>

380
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,673
An album that would later sell
over 30 million copies.

381
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:22,076
My sister and I took it upon
ourselves to bleach my hair

382
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,345
with whatever chemicals we
could find around the house.

383
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:26,247
Ammonia, napalm.

384
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,450
My hair was so damaged,
I've been forced to wear it short

385
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:31,051
ever since.

386
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,756
It's been a daily, ongoing pain.
Wait, that would make you, like, 30.

387
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:36,891
29.

388
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,061
And here's the truth:
I mercilessly pick on

389
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,798
Will Schuester's lustrous,
wavy hair

390
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:48,335
because I'm jealous.
There, I said it.

391
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:51,305
- I think we can help.
- Mercedes is black. I'm gay.

392
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,507
We make culture. Go on.

393
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:56,010
We're working
on an exciting new project

394
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,711
and would like to use the Cheerios.

395
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:59,613
And we can help you
find a new look.

396
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,715
Interesting.

397
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:05,920

<i>- Sondheim on Music.
- Jessie, is that you?</i>

401
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm so glad you came.

402
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,203
I picked the Stephen
Sondheim biography section

403
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,138
for our clandestine meeting place,

404
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,675
because only he would be able
to express my melancholia.

405
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:29,844
I feel bad about what
happened at your house.

406
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,412
Do you still have my Care Bear?

407
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,648
- Yes. - Since we're
meeting in the shadows,

408
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,083
there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

409
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:37,785
Me first.

410
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:40,521
I was out of line the other night.
You deserve more than that.

411
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:47,027
You deserve romance...
no, you deserve epic romance.

412
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:50,097
I feel badly that I pressured
you into... you know,

413
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:54,735
going all the way.
I'm willing to wait.

414
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:56,670
You tell me when you're ready.

415
00:21:56,738 --> 00:22:00,441
And I'll make sure that
I'm fastidiously groomed.

416
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:08,983
- What did you want to tell me?
- I'm ready.

417
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,760
Hey, that catch was
amazing Tuesday.

418
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:25,266
- Will! Hey. Hey, wait up.
- All right. How's it going?

419
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,235
Good. Um... okay,
I've realized something,

420
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,704
something really important.

421
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,673
You know when we were talking
about Madonna the other day

422
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,342
and how her music was being blasted
like an intimidating cluster bomb

423
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,677
into everybody's
office except for mine

424
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:39,046
because, apparently,
I lack a shred of sex appeal?

425
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:41,515
Well, it struck me that the Big Mo
is always in control of everything.

426
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,451
Her life is her own.
Okay.

427
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,956
So I need to take control
of myself and my body,

428
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:53,060
just like Madonna. Which is why...

429
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,195
I'm planning on doing
the nasty with you

430
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,298
tonight at your place.

431
00:22:57,365 --> 00:23:00,434
Foreplay shall begin at 7:30 sharp.

432
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:05,472
- So, what do you think?
- Not that it matters.

433
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I couldn't agree more.

434
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:08,776
- Great. - Great.
- 7:30. - Cool.

435
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:22,132
Vogue,take one. Sound speed...

436
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,004
and action. And playback.

437
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,623
Strike a pose.

495
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,291
<i>¶¶Oh, your love thawed out, </i>

496
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:23,224

497
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,802

499
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,473

very first time. </i>

501
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:37,046
<i>¶¶Like a vir-ir-irgin. </i>

502
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,383
<i>¶¶When your heart
beats next to mine. </i>

503
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:46,022
<i>¶¶Like a virgin.
¶¶Oh-oh-oh, like a virgin. </i>

504
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,527
<i>¶¶Yeah, it feels so good inside. </i>

505
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,961
<i>¶¶When you hold me. </i>

506
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,730
<i>¶¶When you hold me.
When your heart beats. </i>

507
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,499
<i>¶¶When your heart beats.
¶¶When you love me. </i>

508
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,368
<i>¶¶When you love me, baby.
¶¶Oh-oh. </i>

509
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,736
<i>¶¶Whoa. </i>

510
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:06,776
<i>¶¶Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah.
¶¶Oh-oh... yeah. </i>

511
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,513
<i>¶¶Oh, like a virgin. </i>

512
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:26,225
- Rachel?
- I'm ready.

513
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,702
I wonder which look
she's gonna rock.

514
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,270
Doesn't matter.
They were all fantastic.

515
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:42,743
- Oh, dear.
- Miss Sylvester.

516
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,679
Oh, hey, there,
Whoopi, Don Knotts.

517
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,714
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you what.

518
00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:50,150
All those costumes
and the hairstyles,

519
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,352
I'm gonna leave constant
reinvention to Madonna.

520
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,388
Know why?
Had a revelation.

521
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:58,558
Here's a list of the kids
I want shipped off to New York

522
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:01,628
with 35 bucks in their pocket.
Operation Madonna is now complete.

523
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,097
- Sue, these are all Glee kids.
- Yep.

524
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,200
Um... I'm sorry, Sue.

525
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,569
I'm having trouble concentrating.
Your new look is...

526
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:12,806
- Fantastic. Yeah, I agree.
- Unnecessary.

527
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:17,010
Sue, you're a powerful woman.
You don't need to copy anyone else.

528
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,746
You're an original,
just like Madonna.

529
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:21,481
Don't lose that quality.

530
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,884
Do you mean that,
or are you just saying that

531
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:25,786
because I poked a
couple of kids' eyes out

532
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,020
before second period today?

533
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:32,225
See, kids, Sue Sylvester realized
she didn't need to reinvent herself.

534
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:34,928
She needs to reinvent  everybody
else, starting with you two.

535
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:44,738
- Hey. - Hi.

536
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:47,174
So how'd your date with
Jessie go Friday night?

537
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:50,110
It went wonderfully.

538
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:52,112
Honestly, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

539
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,016
I mean, you know, it-it was great.

540
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,684
But when it was over, I just, uh,

541
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,219
you know, didn't know why

542
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:01,087
I was so nervous
in the first place.

543
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:05,826
Just come out so we can talk...
or sing about it.

544
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:12,833
Look, Jessie,
I really like you, but...

545
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,068
I can't do it.

546
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:18,138
It wouldn't be right for...
the team.

547
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:20,473
What does the team
have to do with this?

548
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,142
If I give myself to you

549
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,610
knowing that my teammates
wouldn't approve,

550
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:26,112
it would be like I was
sleeping with the enemy.

551
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,982
I'd be betraying them.

552
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,284
And because I'm truly
not ready to do this,

553
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:36,590
- I'd be betraying myself.
- I'm happy for you.

554
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:39,693
And, uh, what about you?

555
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,895
I heard that you had a date
with Santana on Friday night.

556
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:44,764
Yeah. I-I couldn't
go through with it.

557
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:46,533
Why?

558
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:49,336
I guess I'm just waiting
for the right person.

559
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:52,472
Do you think they have
room service in this place?

560
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,509
- 'Cause I want a burger.
- I thought I'd feel different after.

561
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,212
Yeah, well, I've noticed that
it takes about 20 or so times

562
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,748
before the feeling of
accomplishment really kicks in.

563
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,250
There's no menu,

564
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:05,952
so you're gonna have to
take me to a burger joint.

565
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,790
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel anything...

566
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:12,626
'cause it didn't mean anything.

567
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:27,274
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all weekend.

568
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,175
I was kind of embarrassed.

569
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:32,913
I really wanted to go
through with it, Will.

570
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,016
You were so gracious
and gentle and...

571
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:40,253
handsome, and it felt so good
to be close to you in that way.

572
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:42,656
I just, I don't know why I
always freak out like that.

573
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,858
Stop, stop-stop-stop.

574
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,127
You don't need to sleep
with me to prove anything.

575
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:48,795
You took ownership of
your body on Friday

576
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,230
when you told yourself
you weren't ready...

577
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:52,465
and then ran out of my
apartment with no shoes on.

578
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:54,100
They're my favorites.
Did you bring them?

579
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:56,670
I feel bad, Emma.

580
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:58,772
I've been working so hard
trying to get the guys

581
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,874
to start treating the
girls with more respect,

582
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,442
and I haven't been
walking the walk.

583
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,245
I never should have agreed to
have you come over that night.

584
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:08,982
- I did kind of throw myself at you.
- That is the point.

585
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,086
We're falling into a pattern here.
We need to instate an official

586
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:16,890
no-dating policy until
my divorce is final.

587
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,626
Well, when will that be?

588
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:24,331
I filed today.
So that's a start.

589
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,735
But while we're waiting,
I want you to get some help

590
00:33:28,803 --> 00:33:30,370
for your problems;
we need to take action here.

591
00:33:30,438 --> 00:33:32,472
They're not gonna go
away unless we do.

592
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,242
Now, our health union
covers counseling.

593
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,644
They'll come to the school,

594
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:39,813
meet you in your office,
whatever you need.

595
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:46,886
And... I polished them myself.

596
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,495
Thank you.

597
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:03,169
- Mr. Schuester? - Yes?

598
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:06,706
I'm Jessie St. James.
Can I talk to you about something?

599
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:11,044
What the hell?! It seems like
now everybody's doing things

600
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:12,379
just to hurt my feelings.

601
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:13,913
I thought you all
would take this news

602
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:16,182
a little better. I'm a star.
You can learn from me.

603
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,517
We were already fighting
for second leads.

604
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:18,752
And now that you've shown up,

605
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:20,387
I've lost all hope at
ever getting a solo.

606
00:34:20,454 --> 00:34:21,955
Yeah, that's right.
And y'all just trot me out

607
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:24,391
at the end of every number so
I can wail on the last note.

608
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,460
- How is that okay?
- He's a spy, Mr. Shue. I would know.

609
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:28,862
Whoa, Whoa... guys.

610
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,697
I saw all the paperwork,
I spoke with his parents...

611
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,333
They winter in Bali.
It's a very expensive phone call.

612
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,101
Jessie just moved
in with his uncle,

613
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,469
which is in our school district.

614
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:39,339
It's all above board, guys.
He goes to this school now.

615
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:41,808
- But this isn't fair.
- Guys!

616
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:44,944
Everyone who's ever auditioned
for this group has gotten in.

617
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,413
That's how we do things here.

618
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,015
Okay, to suddenly
change the rules now,

619
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,652
- that would be unfair.
- Brittany.

620
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,554
Mr. Shue, is he your son?

621
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't understand why
you're doing this.

622
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:01,061
Because when you love something,
you got to go for it.

623
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:02,262
You would never be
with me completely

624
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:04,164
if I were on the opposing team.

625
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:06,599
And I care about you more than
winning another national title.

626
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:10,403
So I left Vocal Adrenaline.
For you.

627
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:14,407
All right, guys,
we have got a lot of work to do.

628
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:16,176
Jessie, great to have you here.

629
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:20,413
- Welcome aboard. Okay, from the top.
- Five, six, seven, eight!

630
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:36,629
<i>¶¶Hey. ¶¶Unh, come on. </i>

tick-tock. </i>

655
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:05,084
Sue, what the hell
is going on here?

656
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,819
Oh, what's the matter, buddy?
Did you miss the show?

657
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,321
You probably had to run
to the powder room.

658
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:09,422
Let me fill you in.

659
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,391
Future center square
Kurt Hummel there

660
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,561
and his brassy hag Mercedes
just tore that Madonna song

661
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,930
- a new one.
- Wait, you two are Cheerios now?

662
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:18,231
Yeah, I've decided to add vocals

663
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,067
to my already wildly
overproduced Cheerios numbers.

664
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:23,102
It'll give us the
edge at Nationals.

665
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,971
You guys could've at least
given me the heads-up.

666
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,006
You mean, the same way
you gave us a heads-up

667
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:29,042
before not giving us a
solo almost every week?

668
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:30,743
Mr. Shue, Mercedes and I

669
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,745
talked it over,
and we love being in Glee,

670
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,480
but being in the
Cheerios will give us

671
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:37,483
- more opportunities to shine.
- So we're doing both.

672
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:39,686
Ah, chipper up, Tiger.

673
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:41,854
You know, I was down
at the pharmacy today,

674
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:44,691
and they're having a
monster sale on Dep.

675
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,359
Dep is a hair gel.

676
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:50,063
And once again, I am making fun of
your incredibly stupid hairdo.

677
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,056
Girls can wear jeans and
cut their hair short,

678
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:03,694
wear shirts and boots,
'cause it's okay to be a boy.

679
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:07,298
But for a boy to look
like a girl is degrading,

680
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:10,467
'cause you think that
being a girl is degrading.

681
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:14,371
But secretly you'd love to know
what it's like, wouldn't you?

682
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,206
What it feels like for a girl.

683
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:30,287
<i>¶¶Silky smooth
¶¶lips as sweet as candy, </i>

684
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,058
<i>¶¶baby. </i>

685
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:38,495
<i>¶¶Strong inside,
but you don't know it. </i>

686
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:42,333
<i>¶¶Good little girls,
they never show it. </i>

687
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,904
<i>¶¶When you open up
your mouth to speak </i>

688
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:51,608
<i>¶¶could you be a little weak? </i>

689
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:53,811
<i>¶¶Do you know
¶¶Do you know </i>

690
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:57,414
<i>¶¶what it feels
like in this world </i>

691
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,416
<i>¶¶for a girl?
¶¶For a girl? </i>

692
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:00,951
<i>¶¶Oh. </i>

693
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:09,626
<i>¶¶For a girl... </i>

694
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:16,900
<i>¶¶In this world... </i>

695
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:20,804
<i>¶¶Do you know </i>

696
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:26,543
<i>¶¶what it feels like
in this world? </i>

697
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:30,681
I am not down with this.
I like being a dude.

698
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,483
<i>That's because it's easy
to be a dude.</i>

699
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,585
Uh, Mr. Shue, I think we're
gonna need a new baritone,

700
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:35,953
'cause Finn would like
to become Finnessa.

701
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,888
Wait, h-hold on, Puck.
Finn has a point.

702
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,089
I mean, haven't you noticed

703
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:40,557
how low morale has been
around here lately?

704
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,692
I have.

705
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,695
I think the way I was objectifying Tina
may have sent her over the edge.

706
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:48,499
- Hey, girl.
- My eyes are up here!

707
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:51,068
I am a person with feelings!
Get out of my grill!

708
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:52,669
I am a powerful woman,

709
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:54,738
and my growing feminism
will cut you in half

710
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,973
like a righteous blade of equality!

711
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,144
We've been treating
the girls like crap...

712
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,413
not caring about their feelings,
not listening, objectifying.

713
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,881
That's the right word,
right, Mr. Shue?

714
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,948
- That's right.
- Objectifying.

715
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:08,051
As an honorary girl,
I have to agree.

716
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,720
This team shouldn't work,
but it does

717
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:11,388
because we respect
each other's talent.

718
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,823
And if we want to take it to

719
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:14,224
the next level, we have to start

720
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,793
respecting each other
as individuals.

721
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,561
Really see each other.

722
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:20,964
Why were you
singing with us, Mr. Shue?

723
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:25,502
Because apparently...
I need to learn that lesson.

724
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,871
Fine, but I'm not
singing this song.

725
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,173
We don't have to.

726
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,874
We just have to make it
right with the girls,

727
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,444
show them we get how it feels.

728
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:38,081
I would get down on
one knee if I could.

729
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,383
Why would you propose to me?

730
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:42,085
- You don't even like me.
- Stop.

731
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:45,889
That's where you're wrong.
I was really rude to you.

732
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,125
You're awesome.

733
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:50,828
And you shouldn't change,
unless you want to.

734
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:56,233
And if you want to get up on this,
just let me know.

735
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:03,373
Yep. That's more like it.

736
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:07,945
Hey.

737
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,480
If you're gonna criticize
and mock me again

738
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:13,350
- about Jessie, you can can it.
- I wanted to apologize.

739
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:15,285
The only reason you were even

740
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,888
open to dating Jessie was
because I was such an ass.

741
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:22,192
Mr. Tough Guy and all that.
I really liked you.

742
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,729
And I could have had you,
but I blew it.

743
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:31,435
- You really liked me?
- Okay, Finn. I know we have

744
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:34,705
a big showdown coming,
so let's just decide on the arena.

745
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:37,374
Sing-off, the parking lot,
5:00... be there.

746
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:42,379
- No.
- Welcome to New Directions.

747
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:45,315
Frankly, I need you.
I'm tired of

748
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:46,617
carrying the male
vocals all by myself.

749
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,155
I'll do my best to stay
away from your girl.

750
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:55,893
I appreciate that.
She's a keeper.

751
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,461
Walk with me to the auditorium.

752
00:41:57,529 --> 00:41:58,862
I put together a
new Madonna number;

753
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,266
- I'll talk you through it on the way.
- Sweet.

754
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:18,087
Like A Payer¶¶ Madonna

755
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,891
¶¶Glee¶¶.
