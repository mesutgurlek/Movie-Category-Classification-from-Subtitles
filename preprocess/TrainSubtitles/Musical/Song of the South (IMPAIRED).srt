doesn't count for much these days.

297
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:32,834
Remus: Yassum, it's a pity, too.
What dat child needs is his paw.

298
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,842
Doshy: And that's what his mother needs...
But I'm afraid it's going to take

299
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:37,826
Doshy: a little while for her to find that out.

300
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:40,898
Remus: Might cut de time down a piece,
Miss Doshy, if you jes' draps a word.

301
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,635
Doshy: If I want your advice I'll ask for it.
I'm a stubborn old woman Uncle Remus

302
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:49,635

I knows dat. Well, goodnight.

303
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,651
Doshy: Goodnight.

Joe: Yeah.

661
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:26,633
Remus: Miss Sally ain't got no
time to be bothered wid you.

662
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:28,714
Remus: An' she don't wanter hear no
talk about dat dawg, neither.

663
01:00:28,714 --> 01:00:30,730
Sally: What's this all about?

664
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:34,250
Jake: Johnny's got our dawg
- An' we we wants it back!

665
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:37,622
Sally: Your dog? You don't
mean that little puppy?

666
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:41,815
Jake: Yassum. Johnny took it down to
ol' Remus's so's you wouldn't know.

667
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:43,427
Sally: Is that right, uncle remus?

668
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,827
Remus: Well, you see
miss sally, I had...

669
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,116
Sally: I see. Uncle remus'll get your
dog back to you. Now run along, please.

670
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:51,972
Joe: You gonna whup johnny?

671
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,284
Jake: Ya oughta!

672
01:00:53,636 --> 01:00:55,492
Jake: Johnny said he didn't
care if we told you...

673
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,253
Jake: bute not to tell our maw.

674
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,621
Joe: and when we told her,
she giv'd us a whuppin'.

675
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:06,693
Remus: <chuckle> Lawzy, Miss
Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.

676
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:10,534
Remus: He was jes' trying to be like
Brer Rabbit. I tol' him a tale 'bout de

677
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:15,686
Remus: tar baby an' he just got a li'I bit too
bodacious, and outreached hisse'f, dat's all.

678
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:22,023
Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your

679
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:27,015
Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe
it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile.

680
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:30,344
Remus: Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no...

681
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:34,888
Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you
mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young.

682
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,104
Remus: Miss Sally...

683
01:01:36,136 --> 01:01:38,792
Sally: I'll have to ask you
not to tell him any more.

684
01:01:42,217 --> 01:01:44,521
Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...

685
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,410
Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I
can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind.

686
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,643
Doshy: That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,

687
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:07,339
Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.

688
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:10,187
Sally: Well, he has his
mother... and his grandmother.

689
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:16,556
Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have
friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers

690
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:23,244
Doshy: children, then it must be someone else...
someone of his own age. That's just good common sense.

691
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:30,573
Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen?

692
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:37,838
Sally: Johnny!

693
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:40,591
Johnny: Yes, mama.

694
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:45,161
Sally: Do you know what next tuesday is?

695
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:47,657
Johnny: Uh... of course. My birthday.

696
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:51,401
Sally: That's right, dear.
And what happens then?

697
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,034
Johnny: I get presents.

698
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:55,754
Sally: And a birthday
party. Would you like that?

699
01:02:55,786 --> 01:02:57,802
Johnny: A party? Sure!

700
01:02:57,834 --> 01:02:59,850
Sally: With lots of nice
little boys and girls.

701
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:02,186
Johnny: Can i ask Ginny?

702
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:05,451
Sally: Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...

703
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:07,915
Doshy: That one more
won't make any difference.

704
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:13,003
Johnny: Gee! Thanks! Will daddy come?

705
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:22,796
Sally: Well, dear... uh... I'll
write and ask him.

706
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:26,829
Johnny: Oh boy.

707
01:03:32,718 --> 01:03:35,054
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!

708
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:42,030
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?

709
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:51,823
Johnny: Uncle Remus? A present
for Teenchy! Where's Teenchy?

710
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:54,383
Remus: He's gone.

711
01:03:54,416 --> 01:04:02,224
Johnny: Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n
might happen to him... if he runs around loose.

712
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,713
Remus: He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.

713
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:09,169
Johnny: Then, where is he?

714
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:17,681
Remus: He's back at de Favers. Dat's
what he b'longs an' you knows it.

715
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:21,426
Johnny: But teenchy's
my dog. He's mine.

716
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,794
Johnny: Ginny gave him

722
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:49,205
Johnny: Jake'll drown

725
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:04,086
