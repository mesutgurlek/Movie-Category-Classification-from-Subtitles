00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:49,290
<i>But a miniature sleigh</i>
<i>And eight tiny reindeer</i>

303
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,054
<i>With a little old driver</i>
<i>So lively and quick</i>

304
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,756
<i>I knew in a moment</i>
<i>It must be Saint Nick</i>

305
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,663
<i>More rapid than eagles</i>
<i>His coursers they came</i>

306
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:02,328
<i>And he whistled and shouted</i>
<i>And called them by name</i>

307
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:06,101
SANTA: <i>Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!</i>
<i>Now, Prancer and Vixen!</i>

308
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:09,769
<i>On, Comet! On, Cupid!</i>
<i>On, Donner and Blitzen!</i>

309
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,575
<i>To the top of the porch</i>
<i>To the top of the wall</i>

310
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,153
<i>Now dash away, dash away</i>
<i>Dash away, all</i>

311
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,516
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

312
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,524
TRUNDLE: <i>As dry leaves that before</i>
<i>The wild hurricane fly</i>

313
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:26,595
<i>When they meet with an obstacle</i>
<i>Mount to the sky</i>

314
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:29,961
<i>So up to the housetop</i>
<i>The coursers they flew</i>

315
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,829
<i>With a sleigh full of toys</i>
<i>And Saint Nicholas too</i>

316
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:38,236
<i>And then, in a twinkling</i>
<i>I heard on the roof</i>

317
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:41,469
<i>The prancing and pawing</i>
<i>Of each little hoof</i>

318
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,209
<i>As I drew in my head</i>
<i>And was turning around</i>

319
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:47,843
<i>Down the chimney</i>
<i>Saint Nicholas came with a bound</i>

320
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:50,714
<i>He was dressed all in fur</i>
<i>From his head to his foot</i>

321
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:54,157
<i>And his clothes were all tarnished</i>
<i>With ashes and soot</i>

322
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:56,452
<i>A bundle of toys</i>
<i>He had flung on his back</i>

323
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:59,460
<i>And he looked like a peddler</i>
<i>Just opening his pack</i>

324
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:04,163
<i>His eyes, how they twinkled</i>
<i>His dimples, how merry</i>

325
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:08,396
<i>His cheeks were like roses</i>
<i>His nose like a cherry</i>

326
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:11,541
<i>His droll little mouth</i>
<i>Was drawn up like a bow</i>

327
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,906
<i>And the beard of his chin</i>
<i>Was as white as the snow</i>

328
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,513
<i>The stump of a pipe</i>
<i>He held tight in his teeth</i>

329
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,912
<i>And the smoke, it encircled his head</i>
<i>Like a wreath</i>

330
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:24,986
<i>He had a broad face</i>
<i>And a round little belly</i>

331
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:28,955
<i>That shook when he laughed</i>
<i>Like a bowlful of jelly</i>

332
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:33,563
<i>He was chubby and plump</i>
<i>A right jolly old elf</i>

333
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,666
<i>And I laughed when I saw him</i>
<i>In spite of myself</i>

334
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,598
<i>A wink of his eye</i>
<i>And a twist of his head</i>

335
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,262
<i>Soon gave me to know</i>
<i>I had nothing to dread</i>

336
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:46,475
<i>He spoke not a word</i>
<i>But went straight to his work</i>

337
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:50,375
<i>And filled all the stockings</i>
<i>Then turned with a jerk</i>

338
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,277
<i>And laying his finger</i>
<i>Aside of his nose</i>

339
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,942
<i>And giving a nod</i>
<i>Up the chimney he rose</i>

340
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:00,454
<i>He sprang to his sleigh</i>
<i>To his team gave a whistle</i>

341
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:04,958
<i>And away they all flew</i>
<i>Like the down of a thistle</i>

342
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,961
<i>But I heard him exclaim</i>
<i>Ere he drove out of sight</i>

343
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:15,566
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

344
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,315
