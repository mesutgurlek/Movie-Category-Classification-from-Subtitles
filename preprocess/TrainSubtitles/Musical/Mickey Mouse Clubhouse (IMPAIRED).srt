Um, uh, It's...
Piska, pooska, pick-a-Mouse.

162
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,930
I mean, uh, Mickey Mouse. Ha ha.

163
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:03,599
- Are those the right magic words?
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, no. Those are not
the right magic words.

165
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,113
- Whoa.
- Oh.

166
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,278
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

167
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,821
- [Both scream]
- [Grunts]

168
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,825
- [Gasps] Pete.
- What?

169
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:25,090
[Donald] Hey, what's the big idea?

170
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,996
[Daisy] Whoa. Up, up and away.

171
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,593
Gosh.
Where's the ground going?

172
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,503
This can't be right.
Now what?

173
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:38,338
Uh, hopsy-popsy, shooba-dee-doo.

174
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,277
Uh, handsy-glovesy...

175
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,678
Please come down.

176
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,917
Oopsie.

177
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:51,922
I said the wrong magic words, didn't I?

178
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,925
Drat. I'm in big trouble now.

179
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,962
[Humming]

180
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,190
Oh, ding dong it, it's Mickey.

181
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,597
I'd better get out of here
before he sees me.

182
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,401
Strange that Clarabelle
wasn't at the bakery.

183
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,636
[Barking]

184
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,702
Huh?! What happened
to the clubhouse?

185
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:21,446
The clubhouse floated away?
Who made that happen?

186
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,483
Pete did it? He said the wrong
magic words? Uh-oh!

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,860
We've gotta get the clubhouse back and
rescue Minnie, Goofy, Daisy and Donald,

188
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,695
or we won't be able
to have our Easter party.

189
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:40,735
Will you help us find all the pieces of
the clubhouse and get our friends back?

190
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,071
Hot dog!

191
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:46,838
[Sniffing]

192
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,778
Hey, look. Pluto's already on the trail.

193
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,110
Attaboy, Pluto.

194
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:54,640
Come on, let's follow Pluto
and look for the clubhouse.

195
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:08,658
Aw, Pluto, how will we ever find
all the pieces of the clubhouse?

196
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,066
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

197
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,367
Ta-da!

198
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,034
Oh, boy! It's Professor Von Drake.

199
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:28,078
- [Chuckles] Hello there, Mickey.
- Professor, we need your help.

200
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,053
The clubhouse floated away.

201
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:35,491
You're telling me. I almost rocketed
right into the clubhouse pants.

202
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,961
Fortunately, the professor
went under the pants.

203
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,898
I said ''underpants.''
Did you hear that?

204
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,832
You saw the clubhouse pants?

205
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:48,361
That's right.
They landed right over there.

206
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,835
Oh, Minnie.

207
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:57,704
- Oh, you found me.
- We rescued Minnie.

208
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,476
[Sniffing]

209
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:04,317
[Growls and barks]

210
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,914
Hey, wait a minute. That's Pete.

211
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,515
No, it's not.

212
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,589
Oh, that Pete is running away.

213
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:15,929
Aw, Pete must think I'm upset with him
for making the clubhouse float away.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,060
But I'm not.
Gee, we could really use his help.

215
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,605
Don't worry about that, Mickey.

216
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:26,201
Now that we've found the pants,
we've got the Mousekedoer to help us.

217
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,939
Say, that's right, Professor.

218
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,210
Oh, that means we can
use our Mouseketools.

219
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,013
Hot dog!
Come on, everybody.

220
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,146
Let's go get our Mouseketools
from the Mousekedoer.

221
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,685

# Here are your Mouseketools #

230
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,912
[Mickey] A pacifier?

231
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,926
My toolbox.

232
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:20,187
A crane. Wow!

233
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:25,194
Ooh, and the mystery Mouseketool.

234
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,099
That's a surprise tool
that can help us later.

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,616
Look, it's Toodles.
Hiya, Toodles.

236
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,952
- Hi there, Mr. Toodles.
- Hi, Toodles.

237
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,823
[Mickey] Toodles is gonna bring us our
Mouseketools when we need them.

238
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,557
Oh, boy!
We got our Mouseketools.

239
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,429
Now let's go find the
other pieces of the clubhouse.

240
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,299
And rescue Donald, Daisy and Goofy.

241
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,031
[Barking]

242
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:06,042
Hold on, Mickey. We've got to get this
pants piece back where it belongs.

243
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,237
Oops. You're right.

244
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:11,476
Hmm. How are we going
to do that, Professor?

245
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,382
Every time you
find a piece of the clubhouse,

246
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,250
you have to touch it. Like so...

247
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:20,314
Then, you're gonna say
the right magic words.

248
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,325
Well, we know those.

249
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,829
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

250
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:29,663
That's right. And after you're
saying the magic words,

251
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,828
the piece will fly back home with you.

252
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:35,998
Alright. Let's send the pants back home.

253
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,941
Everybody say the right magic words.

254
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,878
[All] Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse!

255
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:50,615
[Von Drake] Whoop-de-do. Here we go.

256
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,024
Oh, boy. We did it!

257
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,360
We did it!

258
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:05,630
Well, ain't that something?
The pants are back.

259
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,194
They sure are. Thanks, everybody.

260
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,174
But, Mickey, before we can
have our Easter party,

261
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,710
we need to find four more pieces.

262
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,645
Four more. You betcha!

263
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:19,547
Professor, what's the
next piece we need to find?

264
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:23,212
Well, why don't we
check with Toodles, let's?

265
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:27,850
Good idea.
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles!''

266
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,360
[All] Oh, Toodles!

267
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:38,058
Alright. Toodles, do your doodles.

268
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,873
[Von Drake] Oh, look at that.
It's like a puzzle.

269
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:47,207
Now, already we've found
the first piece, the pants.

270
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,145
Where does the first piece go?

271
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,285
In number one.

272
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,286
[Mickey] So what's the next
number we need to find?

273
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:06,887
[Von Drake] Number two.
Right, the shoe.

274
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,165
Just remember...

275
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,228
# The pieces of the clubhouse

- # And number five
- # The hand

281
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:26,573
# Let's do that again
Oh, boy!

282
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,643
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

283

- # The pants

284

- # Number two
- # The shoe

- # Number three
- # The head

286

- # Number four
- # The ears

287
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,051
- # And number five
- # The hand

288
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,390
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

289
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,464
OK, we gotta find number two.

290
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:50,234
- The shoe.
- That's the shoe garage, is what.

291
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,402
Come on.
Let's go find the shoe garage.

- Goodbye, Mickey. Happy landings.
- Good luck, Mickey.

295
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,574
[Chuckles] Bunny ears.

296
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,778
Are you ready to be my copilot?

297
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,778
Swell! Pilot to copilot,

298
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,447
if you see the shoe garage, say ''shoe.''

299
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,591
Yeah, there it is. And there's Goofy.

300
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,297
Hey there, Mickey.

301
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:07,442
Goofy, you're heading for a waterfall.

302
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,681
Wow! Heading for a waterfall?!

303
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,985
Why would I want to do that?!

304
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,917
Whoa!

305
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,956

Hold on, Goof.
We're coming to the rescue.

309
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:44,451
Hey, Mickey,
you gotta unstick the shoe.

310
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:49,118
I mean, get the shoe unstuck.
And get me out of here!

a crane, and the mystery Mouseketool.

316
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:15,212
Which Mouseketool will help us
lift the shoe out of the river?

317
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,949
The crane. Right!

318
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,490
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

319
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,226
OK, now we're controlling the crane.

320
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:36,535
Which way should we move
the handy helper to grab the shoe?

321
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:39,007
Should we move it up or down?

322
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,573
[Chuckles] Down. Right!

323
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,642
[Chuckles] You got it!

324
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,448
Which way should we move
the handy helper

325
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,649
to pull the shoe out of the river?

326
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,323
Up. Right!

327
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,591
- [Hydraulic hissing]
- [Beeping]

328
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,264
Good job.
We got the shoe garage out of the river.

329
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,534
Yippee!

330
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,876
Thanks for saving Goofy Bunny.

331
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:20,008
Now let's bring the shoe back home.

332
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:23,076
Everybody say the right magic words.

333
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:27,147
[Both] Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

334
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:37,425
[Goofy shrieks]

335
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,334
- [Von Drake] How do you like that?
- [Minnie] It's back.

336
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,498
Whoo-hoo! You found the shoe!

337
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,099
And Goofy Bunny is back too.

338
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:50,637
Alright. Now let's see what piece
we gotta find next.

339
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,309
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

340
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,854
- # Number one
- # The pants

341
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,514
- # Number two
- # The shoe

342
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,114
- # Number three
- # The head

343
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,659
- # Number four
- # The ears

344
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,718
- # And number five
- # The hand

345
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:08,058
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

346
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:11,932
[Von Drake] We found the second piece,
the shoe garage.

347
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,903
Where does it go?

348
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,742
- Right, in number two.
- [Mickey] What number's next?

349
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,709
Number three.

350
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,476
[Von Drake] That's the clubhouse head,
is what that is.

351
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,277
Come on. Let's go find
the clubhouse head.

352
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:35,889
[Engine rewing]

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,689
Happy head-hunting.

354
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,696
- [Chuckling]
- [Barking]

355
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,304
Let's look for the clubhouse head.

356
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,698
Yikes!

357
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,980
That was close.
Let's keep looking.

358
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,260
Well, lookie there.

359
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,596
- [Daisy] Whoa.
- [Mickey] Is that the clubhouse head?

360
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,535
It sure is. Come on.

361
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,003
Mickey!

362
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,301
Please get me down.

363
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,006
- I'm getting dizzy.
- Gee.

364
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,744
We gotta get the head down
and rescue Daisy.

365
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,916
What's holding the head way up there?

366
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,824
The water. Right!

367
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,625
We're gonna have to turn the water off
to bring the head back down.

368
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,893
Yes. Just turn...

369
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,559
...the valve.

370
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,368
Hmm. Turn the valve.

371
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,469
[Straining]

372
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,807
[Panting]

373
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,439
[Straining] Wow!

374
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,107
- [Crash]
- [Cat screeching]

375
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,650
Well, that didn't work.

376
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:11,176
[Chuckles] Gee, this is
really hard to turn.

377
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:14,782
Say, do you see anyone
who could help us turn the valve?

378
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,323
Yeah, there's Pete.

379
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,662
He's strong. Hiya, Pete.

380
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,928
Oopsie! Gotta go.

381
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,932
- Pete, wait!
- [Chicken clucks]

382
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:31,839
Aw gee, we could've
really used his help.

383
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,376
[Daisy] Hurry, Mickey.

384
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,410
Hey, I'll betcha a Mouseketool
can help us turn the valve.

385
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,111
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles!''

386
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,644
Oh, Toodles!

387
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:54,964
[Mickey] Which Mouseketool has
something to help us tighten the valve?

388
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,102
My toolbox. Right!

389
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,963
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

390
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,073
Oh, boy!

391
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:14,011
Which wrench matches
the shape on the valve?

392
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,993
This one, the flower shape.

393
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:27,724
Right. Now we can tighten
the valve and stop the water.

394
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,789
Will you help me tighten the valve?

395
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,660
Great! Turn the wrench with me.

396
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:36,535
Turn, turn, turn.

397
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,939
Turn, turn, turn.

398
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,536
Now, one more great big turn.

399
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,608
[Straining] Turn!

400
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,709
Wow! You're really strong.

401
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:54,689
Whew! Thanks for
getting me down, Mickey.

402
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,022
And thank you too.

403
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,153
Aw, anytime.

404
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,961
Come on. Let's get the
clubhouse head back home.

405
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,025
Everybody say the right magic words.

406
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:10,096
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

407
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,047
[Daisy] Whee!

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,613
- [Goofy] You're back! Yipee!
- [Von Drake] There they are.

409
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,857
- Oh, terrific.
- You did it.

410
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:34,523
With the head back in place,
we're really getting ahead.

411
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:39,903
- And Daisy's back home.
- We did it!

412
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,669
Alright, let's see what piece
we need to find next.

413
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,071
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

414
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:53,616
- # Number one
- # The pants

415
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,276
- # Number two
- # The shoe

416
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,876
- # Number three
- # The head

417
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,421
- # Number four
- # The ears

418
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,480
- # And number five
- # The hand

419
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,820
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

420
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:08,698
[Von Drake] We found the third piece.
That's the head, you know.

421
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:12,293
Now then, where does
the third piece go?

422
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,835
Right! In number three.

423
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:21,105
[Mickey] So what number piece
should we look for next?

424
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,183
Number four, the ears.

425
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,846
[Von Drake] Two round ears,
just like Mickey's ears.

426
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,216
You know, I have
a suspicion where they went.

427
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,194
Good thing I have a giant telescope.

428
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,528
- [Cow mooing]
- [Hydraulic hissing]

429
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,932
- Gosh.
- Oh, my!

430
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,402
That is a big telescope.

431
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,937
[Barking]

432
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,337
How about a peek there, Mickey.

433
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,274
Gee, sure thing, Professor.

434
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:58,475
Come on, look with me.
Let's find the clubhouse ears.

435
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,815
Now, if you see the ears, say ''ears!''

436
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,746
Ooh. [snickers]

437
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,816
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

438
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,053
[Both laughing]

439
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:13,688
[Mickey] Aw, that's Chip 'n Dale.

440
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,226
What? You saw the ears?

441
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,897
Yeah, there they are.

442
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,496
Gosh, but how are we
gonna get to them?

443
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:27,169
Well, to get them,
we can take the clubhouse rocket.

444
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,711
Great idea, Minnie.

445
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:31,441
[Chuckles] Come on, copilots.

446
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,913
[Minnie] Blasting off in ten seconds.

447
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,353
Count down from ten to one with us.

448
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,449
Ten, nine, eight,

449
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:45,359
seven, six, five,

450
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,365
four, three, two, one...

451
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,025
Blastoff!

452
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,138
[All cheering]

453
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,471
Oh, boy!

454
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:08,882
Let's look at the screen
and figure out how to get to the ears.

455
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,819
Do you see the ears?

456
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,291
Yep. There they are, on that planet.

457
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:22,628
Hmm. Now which path
should we take to get there?

458
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,032
The path of pink space rocks?

459
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,771
The path of yellow stars?

460
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:35,168
Or the path of purple satellites?

461
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:45,112
The path of stars! Right.

462
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:49,148
Oh, and look, Mickey.
The stars are making a pattern.

463
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:52,718
Big star, little star, little star.

464
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:56,664
# Big star, little star, little star

465
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,430
Sing the pattern with us.

466
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,563
# Big star, little star, little star

467
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,631
# Big star, little star, little star

468
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,769
# Big star, little star, little star

469
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:12,111
# Big star, little star, little star

470
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:16,380
# Big star, little star, little star #

471
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:20,451
[Minnie giggles] Hooray! We made it.

472
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:23,254
Let's go get those ears.

473
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,887
Good luck, Mickey.
See you at the clubhouse.

474
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,165
Help me rocket to the ears.

475
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:32,168
Put your hands up in the air
and fly with me.

476
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:35,569
Here we go!

477
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,071
Donald!

478
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,245
Are you in there?

479
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
You found me.

480
00:29:57,127 --> 00:30:00,221
[Marching music plays]

481
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,559
[Chuckles]

482
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:08,204
OK, Donald.
Let's send these ears back home.

483
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,797
Everybody say the right magic words.

484
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:14,401
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

485
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:19,845
[Mickey chuckles] Wahoo!

486
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,044
[Chip 'n Dale chuckling]

487
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,958
- [All cheering]
- The ears are back!

488
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:36,223
- You found the ears.
- And Donald's back.

489
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,761
I was in outer space.

490
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:43,295
Oh, boy! We got all our friends back.

491
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:46,831
But we still have
one last piece to find.

492
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:52,305
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

493
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:53,849
- # Number one
- # The pants

494
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,509
- # Number two
- # The shoe

495
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,110
- # Number three
- # The head

496
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,654
- # Number four
- # The ears

497
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:00,713
- # And number five
- # The hand

498
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:04,053
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

499
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,259
[Von Drake] Let's see.

500
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,527
We found the fourth piece, the ears.

501
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,397
Where do they go?

502
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,205
Right, in number four.

503
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:20,338
[Mickey] So what number
do we still need to find?

504
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,478
Number five, the hand.

505
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,142
[Von Drake] That's the glove balloon,
you know.

506
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,775
[Chuckles] Ooh.

507
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,751
We don't need the glove balloon, Mickey.

508
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,689
I'm ready for the Easter party
right now.

509
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:38,558
Yeah, me too.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

510
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,789
Uh-oh.

511
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,195
Mickey, what's the matter?

512
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,963
I, uh... We don't have any Easter eggs.

513
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,437
What?! No Easter eggs?

514
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:54,136
I put all our eggs in one basket.
The glove balloon basket.

515
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:57,703
Oh, boy. This is one bad pickle.

516
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,045
Where could the glove balloon
have gone?

517
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,518
Yeah, we've looked
almost everywhere.

518
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:07,819
- Even in outer space.
- Oh, this is terrible.

519
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:10,325
Exasperating.

520
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,842
[Whimpering]

521
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,537
Aw, Pluto. [sniffles]

522
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:32,742
Well, the clubhouse just won't
be the same without the glove balloon.

523
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,284
And I ruined the party.

524
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:39,516
Gosh, I wish somebody saw
where the glove balloon went.

525
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,549
Hmm. Oh, I know. Pete did.

526
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:46,425
He saw all the pieces
of the clubhouse float away.

527
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:50,364
That's right. Maybe Pete knows
where the glove balloon went.

528
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:54,803
You at home out there,
do you see Pete anywhere?

529
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,231
Huh?

530
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:00,572
Uh-uh, uh-uh... Shh.

531
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:05,445
- You see Pete?
- Yes, there he is.

532
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,240
No, there he ain't.

533
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:13,949
Help us call for Pete.
Say, ''Oh, Pete.''

534
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,788
[All] Oh, Pete.

535
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:21,495
Gosh, maybe Pete didn't hear us.

536
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,795
Let's call him again, louder.

537
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,392
[Iouder] Oh, Pete!

538
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:32,966
[Chuckles] One more time everybody.
The loudest of all.

539
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:36,137
[Yelling] Oh, Pete!

540
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:39,873
Oh.

541
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,542
Hello, everybody.

542
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,950
You know, I...
I wasn't hiding or anything.

543
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,421
- I just...
- Pete! Oh, boy!

544
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,015
- I sure am glad to see ya.
- You are?

545
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:52,220
It's OK, Pete. We know
you said the wrong magic words

546
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:54,263
and made the clubhouse go to pieces.

547
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:57,823
But I didn't mean to.
I was just playing, you see. And...

548
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,927
- Don't worry. You can make up for it.
- I can?

549
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,564
I need you to think really hard.

550
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,632
Now, did you happen to see
where the glove balloon went?

551
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,178
The glove balloon, you say?

552
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:11,180
Let me think now.

553
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,317
Glove? Kinda like this one, bigger?

554
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,649
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

555
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,713
The glove balloon. Right.

556
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,784
I remember. I saw it
float all the way up there.

557
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,659
[Mickey] Wow! All the way
up into the clouds.

558
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,258
Gosh, that's where the giant lives.

559
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:33,325
- Giant?
- Oh, boy.

560
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,394
You don't want to be disturbing him.

561
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,804
But we need to get
the glove balloon back.

562
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:40,172
Why, it's the last piece
of the clubhouse.

563
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:42,837
Don't forget about the Easter eggs.

564
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,677
We can't have an
Easter egg hunt without eggs.

565
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,740
Hmm. We're gonna need something

566
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,343
to help us float quietly
up into the clouds.

567
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,014
Well, maybe one of those
Mousekedoodles...

568
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,854
I mean, Mouseketools can help us.

569
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:58,360
Good idea, Goofy Bunny.

570
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:01,522
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles.''

571
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:04,658
[All] Oh, Toodles!

572
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,772
[Mickey] We've got two
Mouseketools left.

573
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:18,307
The pacifier and
the mystery Mouseketool.

574
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,839
Can we use the pacifier
to float up into the clouds?

575
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:26,385
[Giggles] Nah, that's silly.

576
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:31,450
[Von Drake] Yipee! That means it's time
for the mystery Mouseketool.

577
00:35:31,928 --> 00:35:36,661
[Mickey] Everybody say,
''Mystery Mouseketool.''

578
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:41,597
What's today's mystery Mouseketool?

579
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:45,867
- [Goofy] A bunch of balloons.
- [Mickey] You betcha.

580
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:49,935
Hmm. Will the balloons help us
float quietly up into the clouds?

581
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,082
They sure will.

582
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,415
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

583
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:02,288
Oh... I'm floating away.

584
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,260
Don't worry, Pete.
I'm coming with ya.

585
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,592
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

586
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,928
- Be careful!
- Happy landings!

587
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,197
Whoa. It's cloudy in these clouds.

588
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,306
Do you see the glove balloon?

589
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,382
You do? Where?

590
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,124
How about that? There it is.

591
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,491
Imagine that.
Inside the giant's barn.

592
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:39,551
[Gulps]

593
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,826
Come on.
Let's go get that glove balloon.

594
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,865
I'm not scared at all.
I'm not scared at...

595
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,699
Well, maybe just a little.

596
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:54,739
- [Door creaking]
- [Snoring]

597
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:03,375
- The giant.
- Shh.

598
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:06,547
- We don't want to wake him up.
- Oh, we sure don't.

599
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,682
You know what, I got a good idea.

600
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:12,091
I'll wait outside safe and sound,
I mean, uh, standing guard,

601
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,790
things like that,
while you do everything and...

602
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,356
Pete, you said you weren't scared.

603
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,561
Are we brave?

604
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:23,572
- We sure are.
- We are?

605
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,042
Oh, yeah. We are brave.

606
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:31,104
Come on. Let's tiptoe
up to the glove balloon.

607
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,842
You f... first.

608
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,248
Help us tiptoe up to the balloon.

609
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:38,310
You need to stand up first.
Up on your feet.

610
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,021
Now, tiptoe with us.

611
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:50,461
[Snoring]

612
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,808
The giant's snoring is keeping
the balloon really high.

613
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,867
We're gonna need something
to stop the giant from snoring.

614
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:05,881
How can we make a giant stop snoring?
It can't be done, I tell ya.

615
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,281
That's why we got our Mouseketools.

616
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,752
Everybody whisper, ''Oh, Toodles.''

617
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,584
[Whispering] Oh, Toodles.

618
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,556
[Mickey] Will the pacifier stop
the giant from snoring?

619
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,693
It sure will.

620
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:27,636
We picked all our Mouseketools.

621
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:30,764
Everybody whisper, ''Super cheers!''

622
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:35,908
[Sucking]

623
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,919
We did it. Now let's take
the glove balloon home.

624
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,784
Good idea. I'll go first.

625
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,652

626
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,056
Chicken feathers.

627
00:38:52,595 --> 00:38:54,392
[Pete] Oh... Whoa.

628
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,956
[Grunts] Oopsie.

629
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:59,433
- Oh, excuse me.
- Pete, look out.

630
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:02,062
Oh... [grunts]

631
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:05,434

00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:21,213
Yikes! We better get out of here.

636
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,557
Ooh! A little birdie with round ears.

637
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:28,654
Mickey!

638
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,897
D'uh... I always wanted
a birdie for a pet.

639

Oh, tweet-tweet.

I'll keep you in my birdie cage.

Ooh, I'm gonna go
get you some birdie food.

I'll be right back.
D'uh, bye-bye birdie.

Uh-oh. What should I do?

Oh, it's mean Pete.

[Chuckles] This is your
big chance, Pete, buddy.

Now that you've got the glove balloon,

647
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:09,336
you can have the
clubhouse all to yourself.

00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:14,002
- Just like you were thinking.
- Yeah. Pete's clubhouse.

- Uh-oh. It's nice Pete.
- Now, now, Petey.

650
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:23,408
You know it's not nice to leave
poor Mickey in the giant's birdcage.

651

- He's your friend.
- Mickey's not your friend.

652
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,553
He didn't even give you an invitation
to the Easter party, remember?

653
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:34,688
- He's got you there, nice Pete.
- Oh. But Mickey did invite you.

Well, paint me

Maybe I shouldn't have been so sneaky.

Oh, weasels.

663

Well, what are we waiting for?
We gotta save our friend, Mickey.

and save Mickey?

Great!

670
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:29,350
Now, reach your hand in the air
and grab the rope.

671
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:31,410
Now pull.

672

It's working. OK, keep pulling there.

Great! Now, one more big pull!

Hurry up, Pete.

We gotta open the birdcage
before the giant comes back.

Will you help me and Pete
lift the latch?

Great!

679
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:55,970
Now put your hands out in front of you,
grab the latch and lift.

to get Daisy down.

[Mickey] And, finally, we used the
balloons to fly up to the clouds,

793
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:55,961
and the pacifier to get the glove
balloon away from the giant.
