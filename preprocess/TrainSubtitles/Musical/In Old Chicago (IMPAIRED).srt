I said, " and you know it.

But what do you care about people,

- Lost?

You're lyin'. You've been gambling
at that racetrack again.

There wasn't
any gambling to it, Ma.

207
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,176
There are only eight horses in the race...
mine and seven others.

208
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,977
- All we had to do was shoot the other seven.

Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma.
How about it, hmm?

I told that Gil Warren...

214
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,069
I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths
they'd been drawing pictures on.

215
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,006
- Send it back.
- Wait a minute. This looks like a map.

216
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,170
Maybe Warren's gonna hunt
for a buried treasure.

217
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,078
Hunt for it? He's already found it
in the city treasury.

218
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,309
Something about
Randolph Street...

219
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,409
<i>and</i>...<i>and Madison.</i>

220
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,478
This looks like the tracks
for the horse car line.

221
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,649
I know what it is.

222
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:32,716
This means they're gonna run
the car line along Randolph Street.

223
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,661
You're crazy. They've already surveyed
Madison for the tracks.

224
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,666
Sure, they have. That's exactly
what makes me think they're
gonna run along Randolph.

225
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,998
- By golly, maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right!

226
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,437
That's the way they cheat the people...
get them to invest on Madison Street...

227
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,203
and then switch the line
by their own property.

228
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:52,007
- What an idea.
- You're right. This information
is worth a fortune.

229
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,878

not a penny ever honestly
earned to your name.

232
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,115
Maybe so. But if I had
this corner here...

233
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,023
where all the traffic meets,
I'd put up the biggest saloon in town.

- And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary.

Your carriage is here.

Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him

Driver! Driver!

- Oh, you're crazy!

316
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:56,199
Maybe. But I was sane
enough until tonight.

317
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,002
Then I heard you sing,
and something happened to me.

318
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:04,670
Something swept over me I've never
felt before or ever expect to feel again.

- I'm in love with you, Belle.

320
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:15,188
- Get out, or I'll call the police!
- They can't stop me from loving you.

321

Maybe not, but they can sure
cool you off, brother.

322

- Listen to it. Ow!

325

I'm trembling all over.

And I wanna be calm and cool
so I can make you understand.

Say, are you
on the level?

328

Absolutely.

329
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,350
- But I don't even know who you are.
- Does that matter?

330
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,353
It does to me.
And I'll tell you another thing.

331
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,415
- I didn't like that cheap
trick you pulled on me.
- I had to talk to you alone.

332
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,586
What gave you the idea you could
make love to me like this?

333
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:59,759
Just give me a chance.
I'll tell you the whole story.

334
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:03,736
All right. You can stop here
and buy me a drink.

335
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:06,239
No, not here.
It's too crowded.

336
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,400
Since you've
taken me by storm...

337
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:13,038
the least you might do is to take me
to your place so we can really talk.

338
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,574
Very well, but your story
had better be good.

- Yes.

You'll be gettin' married right away

Now, give me that pail.

Look. "D.V.S."...Who's that?

His name is Swift and he sells pigs.

The jury wasn't out
more than 15 minutes...

speech he's heard all session.

the other side. And... yippee!

Congratulations. I always
knew you had it in your tongue.

A fellow from the <i>Tribune</i>

- Huh?

- How much did you get?
- You did get paid for it, didn't you?

388
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,762
The fellow only makes $10 a week,
and he's got a wife and a family.

389
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,893
Ten dollars a week?
That's just $10 more than you make.

390
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,427
- I couldn't take his money, could I?
- I give up.

391

my laundry and spends his money

I may be late.
- Hmm.

Huh, indeed.

And where is it all going to end?

399
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,125
For one thing, we can
be going in to supper.

do you know what I was doing?

00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,769
- How do you do?
- How do you do? So sorry.

590
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:55,436
You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary
another few minutes. I'll send him back.

591
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:58,674
- That'll be very sweet of you.
- Thank you.

592
00:46:01,117 --> 00:46:05,213
- Is that the woman?
- Why, yes, I believe so.

593
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:08,223
She's pretty... in a way.

594
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,886
- Women like her have all
the advantage, don't they?
- All except one.

595
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:14,486
I wasn't thinking
of marriage.

596
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,533
- So you're taking his money?
- What's the matter with his money?

597
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,401
- The check's good, isn't it?
- You know how he feels about us,
the threats he's made...

598
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,872
I wouldn't worry about
that if I were you.

599
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:28,468
Ever since I left his place,
he's schemed to get even.

600
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:31,377
Now he's trying to do it
with your own help.

601
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,610
- He knows that if he's mayor...
- What makes you think he's gonna be mayor?

602
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,482
- But you took his money.
- Sure.

603
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:40,488
Sure, and I'll vote for him
myself, if necessary...

604
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:43,218
but I didn't say
how the Patch'll vote.

605
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,283
- Why, that's...
- Politics.

606
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:49,525
He'd knife me if he could,
and I simply mean to beat him to it.

607
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:54,328
Why, you dirty dog.

608
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,604
- You love me?
- Certainly not.

609
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,609
Go on. Say it before
I break your back.

610
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:05,169
Who was that little doll-faced blonde
you were smiling all over yourself about?

611
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:08,217
Senator's daughter.
I have to be nice to him, don't I?

612
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,844
Why weren't you breathing
down his neck?

613
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,911
Stop it.

614
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:15,958
You and The Senate
and Warren on the run.

615
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,085
In other words, Mr. O'Leary
is rising in the world.

616
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:21,289
- Mr. O'Leary and present company.
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

617
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,423
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- <i>[Pickle] Chief, Mitch is here.</i>

618
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,160
Come on in
and shut the door.

619
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:30,128
Is it true that you were caught
registering under a false name?

620
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:33,141
Gee, chief, how was I to know
that guy was already registered?

621
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:35,803
I told you this bozo
don't use his head.

622
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:38,574
Oh, have a brain, you. Getting caught
with an election coming up...

623
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,412
and that reform crowd
already yelling its head off.

624
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,146
It would serve you right
if I let them send you to jail for life...

625
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,348
but, no, I've got to sit through a trial
and figure a way to get you out.

626
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:49,948
I oughta...
Oh, get out.

627
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:52,426
Yeah! Come on out!

628
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:59,261
Now, where were we?

629
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,565
Oh, yes.

630
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:14,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

631
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,485
- Everything fixed?
- The district attorney said if you're worried...

632
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,852
he'll let us have witnesses to prove
Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years.

633
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:23,084
That's the kind
of prosecutor I like.

634
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:25,184
- What'd you give him?
- The usual.

635
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,991
Chief! It ain't fair!
It ain't fair!

636
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:30,123
- It ain't fair!
- What's the matter?

637
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,793
The district attorney...
and after we had him all fixed.

638
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,893
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he fell down...

639
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,962
and broke his ankle
and he ain't here!

640
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,031
- The fool doesn't know how to walk?
- And the judge appointed...

641
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:42,100
somebody to take his place
and I don't know who.

642
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:44,840
- What's this mean?
- It means it ain't fixed.

643
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,973
Oh, come on.

644
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:51,676
In view of the unavoidable
detention of the district attorney...

645
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,086
the court has appointed
a special counsel...

646
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:57,648
a representative
of the Election Reform Committee...

647
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,855
in the case of <i>The City</i>
<i>of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell.</i>

648
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,865
<i>Mr. O'Leary, are you</i>
<i>prepared to proceed?</i>

649
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,562
- We're ready, Your Honor.
- Oh, yes.

650
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:11,198
- Is the defense ready?
- Uh, Your Honor...

651
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:14,505
Your Honor, certain matters
have come up.

652
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:19,014
New evidence have been uncovered
that compels me to...

653
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,742
Go ahead with the trial.

654
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,841
- Go ahead?
- Proceed.

655
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,318
The defense is ready,
Your Honor.

656
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:28,380
You may proceed,
Mr. O'Leary.

657
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:35,157
Your Honor, it is no secret
that multiple voting...

658
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,222
for years has been
a common practice...

659
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,791
in that section of Chicago
known as the "Patch."

660
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:45,239
So common, it has come to be regarded
as one of the minor evils...

661
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:47,299
in that district.

662
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:50,834
Men who occupy the highest
offices in this city...

663
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:53,677
openly and brazenly
bid against each other...

664
00:49:53,749 --> 00:49:55,683
for that very vote.

665
00:49:55,751 --> 00:50:01,053
Any mention of it is dismissed
with an indulgent smile...

666
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,854
as something that
should not be talked about.

667
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,896
There are men in this very courtroom,
Your Honor...

668
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,524
who control every election
in this city...

669
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,659
with such illegal votes.

670
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:16,830
Men who sit in their
fine saloons...

671
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:20,307
surrounded by every luxury
that money can buy...

672
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,867
or that they can steal...

673
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:28,508
while public officials bow and smile
before them and fight for their favor.

674
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:33,521
Until today, nobody has ever obtained
sufficient evidence to convict them.

675
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:37,047
Now, however, we have
an eyewitness...

676
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,959
who was actually present
when the defendant, Edward Mitchell...

677
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:43,692
<i>was caught attempting to register</i>
<i>under four different names</i>...

678
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:47,896
The last time,
as the beloved
Bishop Cornwall himself.

679
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,565
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- You know, he's really good.

680
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,167
- Some day he'll be a great lawyer.
- I think he's all right now.

681
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,804
Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue
to the stand.

682
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,849
<i>Carrie Donohue</i>
<i>take the stand.</i>

683
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:07,845
- She can't do this to me.
- Shh! Quiet!

684
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,949
Stand up. Raise your
right hand.

685
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,119
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth...

686
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,220
- so help you God? What's your name?
- I do.

687
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:17,288
- Carrie Donohue.
- Sit down.

688
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:21,302
- Miss Donohue, you know this defendant?
- Do I know him?

689
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,430
- Hmph! That big squirt.
- None of that now.

690
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,600
- I'll haul off...
- Quiet!
- [Laughter]

691
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:30,543
- <i>[Clerk] Order in the court.</i>
- Refrain from personal remarks.

692
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:32,945
Tell the court what you know
about this man's registration.

693
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,176
- Well, my gentleman friend's...
- Face the judge.

694
00:51:35,251 --> 00:51:38,311
hired to watch the registration
and I'm keeping him company...

695
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,548
when this big squirt
walks in.

696
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:44,252
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- Well, he don't see me
and I don't say anything...

697
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:47,318
but when he keeps comin' back,
I get suspicious...

698
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,662
and I'm just about to tell my friend
that something funny's going on...

699
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,532
when, sure enough,
back he comes again...

700
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:57,037
and, this time,
he says he's a bishop.

701
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:59,768
- Well, that's too much even for me.
- <i>[Laughter]</i>

702
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,776
- <i>[Banging Gavel]</i>
- <i>[Clerk] Order in the court.</i>

703
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,971
- That's what you get for marrying 'em.
- You married to this woman?

704
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,037
- What?
- Can you imagine it?

705
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:08,811
- Ever divorce her?
- No!
- Your Honor!

706
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,580
May it please the court,
we ask that this woman's testimony...

707
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:13,645
be stricken
from the records...

708
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:16,350
and this case dismissed
on the grounds that the law says...

709
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,950
a wife cannot testify
against her husband!

710
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:24,898
- <i>That woman is my client's</i>
<i>lawful-wedded spouse.!</i>
- Madam, is this true?

711
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,629
- <i>[Crowd Murmuring]</i>
- Well, I married him once,
if that's what you mean...

712
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:29,671
- <i>but I can tell you</i>...
- <i>That will do.</i>

713
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:32,764
- Well, I mean that he...
- That will do.

714
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,242
Well. Hmph.

715
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,274
Mr. O'Leary,
you distinctly told me...

716
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:43,114
that you had had time to familiarize
yourself with all the facts in the case...

717
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,643
and, yet, you take up this court's time
allowing your only witness...

718
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:49,418
to testify, although
she's clearly unqualified.

719
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:53,622
Your Honor, I assure you, this is
as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

720
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:56,130
I ask the court's pardon.

721
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:58,894
Case dismissed.

722
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,185
- Tough break, kid.
- Yeah.

723
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:08,693
- Congratulations.
- Aw, you can never
tell about these women.

724
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,320
They'll put it over on you every time,
if they can...

725
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,524
but you were great yourself,
I was proud of you.

726
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,296
Wait'll I go after the big fish,
the higher-ups...

727
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,894
- then you'll really hear something.
- That's the way to talk.

728
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:23,408
- How about meeting Belle?
- It's about time.

729
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:25,943
Belle, this is brother Jack.
Jack, Miss Fawcett.

730
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,845
- How do you do?
- I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

731
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,349
- You have?
- Yes.

732
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,647
Dion isn't the only admirer
of beauty in the family.

733
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,711
- [Laughs]
- Thank you.

734
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:38,847
- That was a very nice thing to say.
- I couldn't help...

735
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,949
but look at you
all through the trial.

736
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:44,621
- Maybe that's why you lost your case.
- [Laughs]

737
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,324
- Uh, can we drop you someplace?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

738
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:50,664
I've, uh... I've got some things
to do here in the building.

739
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:58,572
You know, it seemed kind of funny,
you and Dion on one side...

740
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,578
and me on the other,
fighting each other.

741
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:02,910
[Laughs]
When we were kids,
we were always fighting.

742
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:04,972
I bet if any other Irishers tried
to horn in...

743
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,041
it was the O'Learys
against the world.

744
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,247
- Oh, you said it.
- You two must've had fun
when you were little.

745
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:12,882
- We still do.
- Even though we don't
always see eye-to-eye.

746
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,153
Well, I've got
to leave you here...

747
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:17,024
but I'll tell ya what you do,
Miss Fawcett...

748
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:19,427
- or shall I call you "Belle"?
- Please do.

749
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:22,365
Let Dion bring you up the house
some time for dinner, meet Ma.

750
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:24,459
Well, I'd be
delighted.

751
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:26,561
I wanna show you
some pictures of Dion...

752
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,629
in his First Communion
suit at the age of nine.

753
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:31,198
And some of you without any suit
at all at the age of six months.

754
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:34,439
[Laughing]

755
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,573
I wish you'd keep
an eye on this fellow for us.

756
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,210
He's getting up in the world so fast,
it might go to his head.

757
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:44,255
I'd kind of hate
to have to knock it off.

758
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,314
I'll try.

759
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:48,723
Good-bye.
See you soon.

760
00:54:48,794 --> 00:54:51,354
Good-bye, Jack.

761
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,660
- You know, I like him.
- They don't make 'em any better.

762
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:00,068
That was nice of him,
wanting me to meet your mother.

763
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,072
Well, yes. I've been thinking
about that myself.

764
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,904
Oh, don't. I understand how
she feels about me.

765
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:07,672
Oh, Ma's all right...
A little old-fashioned, perhaps.

766
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,737
Oh, please.

767
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,682
I had no idea he was so...
so human.

768
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,618
Oh, sure.
Takes after me.

769
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,678
You know, there's something
almost normal about him.

770
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:21,157
He just looks so real, you know
he believes everything he says.

771
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:24,423
Honestly, it just makes me sick
to think of a man like Gil Warren...

772
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:27,863
trying to run Chicago when there
are men here like your brother.

773
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:30,766
Can you imagine the mayor
he'd make if he had the chance?

774
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:34,033
Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up
with that reform crowd...

775
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:36,131
Wait a minute.

776
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,608
- I've got an idea.
- What?

777
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:41,111
I just thought what do with that check
Gil Warren gave me.

778
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:43,238
Back to The Senate.

779
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,709
In brief, we've come here
to ask you to run for mayor.

780
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:52,985
- What?
- We have canvassed the field,
and you're the man we want.

781
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,755
Well, this is all
very flattering, gentlemen.

782
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,160
May I... May I ask
whom you represent?

783
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,358
The respectable
people of Chicago...

784
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,163
citizens who want a new deal
in our city administration.

785
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,363
We're organizing
a reform party.

786
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,999
- I'm not sure I'm the man.
- We're willing to take that chance.

787
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,444
- It's a great opportunity.
- Decent people are waiting
for an honest program.

788
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:18,210
You'll carry every district, except,
perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch.

789
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:20,251
I'm not so sure
he won't get that too.

790
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,185
Your brother's influential there.
Surely he'll support you.

791
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,951
I'm afraid you can't
count on my brother.

792
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:28,788
You see, we O'Learys
are a strange tribe.

793
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,226
- Then we'll win without the Patch.
- Chicago needs you.

794
00:56:31,296 --> 00:56:34,390
- Yes, Mr. O'Leary.
- Will you do it, sir?

795
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,962
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'll run.

796
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:41,972
[All Voicing Approval]

797
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,736
[Laughing]

798
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,677
What did he say when you suggested
that I would support him?

799
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:51,011
- He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you.
- [All Laughing]

800
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,983
Well, at least he's agreed to run.
That's the first step.

801
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:57,385
What worries me is,
can you control him once he's in?

802
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,653
He's a pretty stubborn
young fellow.

803
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:04,456
You leave that to me.
We O'Learys are a strange tribe.

804
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,932
- How's that?
- Not bad.

805
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,063
Of course, it doesn't
look much like you.

806
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,338
"Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor.
Reform ticket."

807
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:23,575
That's a great thing for Chicago.
I'd like to help.

808
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,708
- You help me?
- Sure. Why not?

809
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:30,050
If other people say you're good enough
to be mayor, I'm not going to say no.

810
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:32,919
Of course, I couldn't
support you openly.

811
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,118
You know how I feel
about the Patch.

812
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:37,354
Oh, of course.
No strings attached.

813
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:41,695
- The fact you're my brother
wouldn't mean a thing.
- Stop arguing, will you?

814
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:44,030
If you stood in the way of something
I felt oughta be done...

815
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,731
I'd go after you as fast as I would
after anybody else, maybe faster.

816
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:52,937
Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago
as a great city people can be proud of.

817
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,138
I'd wipe out
all this mushroom growth...

818
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:58,273
start all over on a sound basis,
with steel and stone.

819
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,818
You don't have to make
speeches to me, Jack.

820
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:03,446
I just wanted you
to know where I stand.

821
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:08,719
- Well, how much do I owe you?
- I'm two games up on you.

822
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:12,786
Ah. Twenty cents.
What a gambler.

823
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,567
- It's in the blood.
- [Laughing]

824
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:16,158
- It's in the blood.
- [Laughing]

825
00:58:16,234 --> 00:58:21,001
Say, why don't you get Belle
and come to the house tonight
and take her and Ma for a drive?

826
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:24,735
- Ha! You know Ma.
- We'll get a couple of beers under her belt.

827
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,369
Well, heaven help us
if it doesn't work out.

828
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:31,176

[All Laughing]

832
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,975
- To His Honor, the future mayor.
- To Chicago!

833
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,915
And to herself,
the first lady of the city!

834
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:07,975
Oh, to the lot of you!

835
00:59:08,053 --> 00:59:12,956
- The compliments
of the season to you, ma'am.
- Oh, go on. More presents.

836
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:16,118
You should see the grand house
we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing.

837
00:59:16,194 --> 00:59:20,130
- And a butler in short pants.
- Heaven help me.

838
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,189
<i>It's himself.</i>

839
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,258
- <i>Pa.!</i>
- <i>It looks just like him.</i>

840
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:26,804
- Sure got my nose.
- [Laughs]

841
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,931
I can remember the day we took it
like it was yesterday...

842
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:32,272
and the trouble we had
puttin' the collar on him.

843
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:35,245
- Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him?
- Hang him?

844
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:39,215
You'll do no such. He's gonna
spend the rest
of his days on this organ.

845
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,050
- [All Laughing]
- If he only could have seen it himself.

846
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,648
Isn't he beautiful?
I want the baby to see it.

847

[Coos]

Look, that's
your grandpa.

849
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:56,792
Aw, Pat,
would you believe it?

850
00:59:56,868 --> 01:00:00,167
And Bob
just a baby himself.

851
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:04,800
If you turn out half as good as the blood
that's in you, I'll not complain.

852
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:07,606
You know, Ma,
it looks like Pa had...

853
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,874
sort of a roving eye
for the ladies.

854
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,746
I'll thank you to keep
a civil tongue in your head.

855
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,308
Roving eye, ha!
I'd like to catch him.

- [Blubbering]
- Look.

857

You're so good to me, the lot of you.
You'll have me in tears.

858
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,690
- Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry.
- Listen to him.

859
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:29,563
We'll play him a tune,
his favorite one.

860
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:32,102
- Come on, Ma, and play it.
- Come on, the four of you.

861
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,662
We'll show him a thing or two.
The O'Learys against the world.

862
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,800
- [Together]
The O'Learys against the world!

01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,836
You should've seen your father dance,
as light as a canary...

866
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:15,345
and stealing a kiss
before you could shut your eyes.

867
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,938
And the fair Molly Callahan
loving it, I'm thinking.

868
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,950
And why shouldn't I
be loving it?

869
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:23,784
Himself as fine a man as ever stood up
with a girl in front of an altar.

870
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,948
And that's what
you should be doin'.

871
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:29,084
- That's what I was telling him today.
- Is it herself, you mean?

872
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,596
I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman.
You oughta know her.

873
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:35,929
Hmm. I will not. And her workin'
in a saloon like any hussy.

874
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,197
- Oh, that's not fair, Ma.
We're living in modern times.
- That's right.

875
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,933
Don't forget, things have changed
since you were a girl. This is 1870.

876
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,532
Times may have changed,
but I haven't changed.

877
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,738
And I don't want any daughter-in-law

01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:38,602
Look at him. You know,
he really looks like a mayor.

1025
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:41,509
Gee, I bet Ma feels great.

- Dion, look at this!

1030
01:14:28,559 --> 01:14:30,550
Huh.

1031
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:33,153
Huh, indeed.

1032
01:14:40,237 --> 01:14:43,229
Belle, we're friends,
aren't we?

1033
01:14:43,307 --> 01:14:45,901
I hope so.

1034
01:14:45,976 --> 01:14:49,309
I've got a proposition
to put up to you.

1035
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:53,077
It may startle you at first,
but I think you'll see my point.

1036
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:57,211
I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want
to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me.

1037
01:14:57,287 --> 01:15:00,518
- And you want me to help you?
- Exactly.

1038
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:03,389
But after all,
what has it to do with me?

1039
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,690
You know how things
are down there.

1040
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:09,199
Everything that's rotten in
Chicago comes out of the Patch.

1041
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:12,235
The whole thing is an atmosphere
of vice and crime.

1042
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:15,430
It's getting out of control,
and I'm gonna wipe it out.

1043
01:15:15,506 --> 01:15:17,371
How?

1044
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:21,878
The law gives us the right
to condemn property.

1045
01:15:21,945 --> 01:15:25,437
The courts will have it
appraised and set a fair price.

1046
01:15:25,516 --> 01:15:29,543
It's what they call the right of eminent
domain. It's perfectly legal and fair.

1047
01:15:31,422 --> 01:15:35,916
But all of Dion's money
is tied up in The Senate. Mine too.

1048
01:15:38,028 --> 01:15:40,019
That's what's worrying me.

1049
01:15:40,097 --> 01:15:42,531
If he won't see it our way,
there'll be trouble.

1050
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:49,070
I don't know what to say.

1051
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:52,131
Dion's a great person.
He can go anywhere, do anything...

1052
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:55,303
if he only gets
on the right track.

1053
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:59,440
Belle, I want
to see him marry you...

1054
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:04,453
<i>have a home and children,</i>
<i>get something real out of life.</i>

1055
01:16:04,521 --> 01:16:08,252
Don't you think that's
what I've been hoping for?

1056
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:10,623
That's what he wants too,
if he can only see it.

1057
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:16,032
What do you want me to do?

1058
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,160
He couldn't stand
a public investigation.

1059
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:22,228
You know how he operates
in the Patch.

1060
01:16:22,306 --> 01:16:25,173
I couldn't do
a thing like that.

1061
01:16:25,242 --> 01:16:27,267
<i>Believe me, Belle...</i>

1062
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:30,939
if I can't bring him
to his senses any other way...

1063
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:35,007
I'll start an investigation
that'll crack this town wide open.

1064
01:16:35,085 --> 01:16:37,952
<i>I'll use you</i>
<i>as chief witness against Dion...</i>

<i>of how he operates in the Patch.</i>

<i>How do you feel</i>
<i>about that, Belle?</i>

1067
01:16:44,962 --> 01:16:49,490
I just wanted Belle
to understand my position...

1068
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:52,296
same as I want you
to understand it.

1069
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:56,499
- Dion, listen to Jack.
- I heard him. I know now where he stands.

1070
01:16:56,573 --> 01:16:59,167
You knew exactly where
I stood before the election.

1071
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:02,041
I told you and I told
the people of this city.

1072
01:17:02,112 --> 01:17:05,013
- I elected you, not the people.
- You?

1073
01:17:05,082 --> 01:17:09,280
Sure. It was my idea. I sent
that committee to see you.

1074
01:17:09,353 --> 01:17:12,652
I paid for it, ran it, framed it,
threw Warren's men into jail.

1075
01:17:12,723 --> 01:17:15,248
I even voted for you.

1076
01:17:15,325 --> 01:17:17,486
I don't believe you.

1077
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:20,052
Is that true?

1078
01:17:21,365 --> 01:17:24,926
- Yes.
- <i>I just wanted it to look hunky-dory.</i>

1079
01:17:25,002 --> 01:17:27,266
[Sighs]

1080
01:17:27,337 --> 01:17:30,067
Why did you want me
to be mayor?

1081
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:33,405
Oh, a lot of reasons.
I wanted to see if I could do it.

1082
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:37,106
Or maybe it was because I wanted
to see the smile on Ma's face...

1083
01:17:37,181 --> 01:17:39,479
when she rode with you
in the carriage election night.

1084
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:44,146
All right. You elected me,
but I'm mayor.

1085
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:48,248
Yes, you're mayor,
but I'm Chicago.

1086
01:17:48,325 --> 01:17:50,850
I'd hate to
have to kick you out.

1087
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,091
Don't try it. A lot of people
like what I'm doing.

1088
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:00,227
- What are you going to get out of this?
- Nothing.

1089
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:04,502
But I happen to have sense
enough to see what Jack's
after, even if you haven't.

1090
01:18:04,575 --> 01:18:07,601
- Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start...
- You keep out of this!

1091
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:10,909
Well, of course,
since you've gone for Reform...

1092
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,609
I guess we won't be seeing
very much of each other.

1093
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:16,118
You're not gonna walk out
on Belle like that.

1094
01:18:16,186 --> 01:18:19,883
It seems that she's the one
that's done the walking out.

1095
01:18:19,957 --> 01:18:23,358
Dion. Dion!

1096
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,422
Oh!

1097
01:18:43,614 --> 01:18:47,846
<i>A grand jury investigation.!</i>
<i>Terrible.! Terrible.!</i>

1098
01:18:47,918 --> 01:18:50,045
How did you ever get involved
in such a mess?

1099
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,281
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you weren't...

1100
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:54,347
in for a bit of sweatin'
yourself, Senator.

1101
01:18:54,424 --> 01:18:57,291
You've been milkin' the Patch
for a long time.

1102
01:18:57,361 --> 01:19:00,888
Me? Why I'll give you to understand, sir,
that my life is an open book.

1103
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:04,456
Open or shut, brother, your shirttail's
out with the rest of us.

1104
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:07,367
It's my daughter
I'm thinking of.

1105
01:19:07,437 --> 01:19:09,598
I'll have to take her to Europe,
get her away from here.

1106
01:19:09,673 --> 01:19:11,766
- The trip would do her good.
- I'll have to ask you...

1107
01:19:11,842 --> 01:19:14,174
not to see my daughter
again ever.

1108
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:18,840
- To think I should be so
deceived in the character...
- I've always wanted to see...

1109
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,907
what a senator looks like...

1110
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:23,248
when he gets a good,
swift kick in the pants.

1111
01:19:26,957 --> 01:19:30,256
- Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?
- I'm hurrying, honey.

1112
01:19:30,327 --> 01:19:33,296
Miss Belle,
you want this old plush?

1113
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:37,322
Yes. No. Throw it away.
I don't care what you do with it.

1114
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,426
Oh, this just fits
in my trunk.

1115
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:43,030
Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use
in you carryin' on like this.

1116
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:46,667
- Ain't no man worth it!
- Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?

1117
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:48,768
<i>I'm hurryin', honey.</i>

1118

I'm sorry,
but I had to come.

1127

Just let me say one thing,
then you can put me out. I won't care.

1128
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:28,963
- Oh, please go.
- I don't ask you to forgive me.

1129
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:32,195
I've said and done things
no woman could ever forgive.

1130
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:35,329
But you've got to believe
I love you, Belle.

1131
01:20:35,405 --> 01:20:38,238
I always have
and I always will.

1132
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:41,038
Oh, why talk about it?

1133
01:20:41,111 --> 01:20:43,170
But you said you loved me.

1134
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,305
That's over.

1135
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,146
You can't change in a moment
any more than I can.

1136
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:51,153
We can't do
without each other.

1137
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,883
I can.
I'll make myself.

1138
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:58,189
Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll
go on fighting, but we'll do it together.

1139
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:01,162
We were meant
for each other.

1140
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,029
Belle, marry me.

1141
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:07,430
Now. Tonight.

1142
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:10,996
I've got the license
and the ring.

1143
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,271
We'll go to Jack,
have him marry us.

1144
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:16,335
Will you, Belle?

1145
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,980
Oh, my darling!

1146
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,383
Come on, Mr. Policeman.
Right in here. She...

1147
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:29,184
She's done
backslid again.

1148
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:36,264
Do you realize that 75%
of the buildings in the Patch...

1149
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,927
are made of pine?

1150
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:42,267
There are no sewers,
no hydrants.

1151
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:45,638
Nothing but filth, cesspools.

1152
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:50,840
But worst of all,
it is a veritable firetrap.

1153
01:21:50,914 --> 01:21:55,783
Now, that sort of thing
may have been excusable when
Chicago was just beginning...

1154
01:21:55,852 --> 01:21:58,013
but that time has passed.

1155
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:01,080
Today it's a menace
to a great city...

1156
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:04,126
a cancer
that must be cut out.

1157
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:07,186
Now, I propose to condemn
the whole district...

1158
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:09,891
wipe it out
and start all over again.

1159
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:13,197
- Yes, what is it?
- [Whispering]

1160
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:15,965
Tell him
I'll be right out.

1161
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:21,069
Will, uh, you gentlemen
go ahead with the discussion...

1162
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:23,874
and excuse me
for a little while, please?

1163
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,313
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

1164
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,648
Well, Jack, you've won.

1165
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:36,249
- I've won what?
- I've been a fool.

1166
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,997
I wouldn't take a million
for this moment.

1167
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:47,298
Now it's really the O'Learys
against the world.

1168
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,168
Well, here's the little
lady who's responsible.

1169

No. No, I've been
