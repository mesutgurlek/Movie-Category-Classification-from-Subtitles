<i>[Woman] Once upon a time, in
a magical kingdom known as Andalasia,</i>

3
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,822
<i>there lived an evil queen.</i>

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,452
<i>Selfish and cruel,</i>

5
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:07,023
<i>she lived in fear that one day
her stepson would marry,</i>

6
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,092
<i>and she would
lose her throne forever.</i>

7
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,699
<i>And so, she did all in her power
to prevent the prince from ever meeting</i>

8
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:21,714
<i>the one special maiden with whom
he would share true love's kiss.</i>

9
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,012
[Birds] Giselle, Giselle,
how about this for your statue?

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,248
- Oh, this will be perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,121
Come on! OK, you mookses, move it!
We have got a face to put together here

12
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,717
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

13
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,285
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

14
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,355
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

15
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,900
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

16
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,368
Blue? Oh, how did you know?

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,304
And they sparkle just like his. Mm!

18
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,638
OK. There we go.
[Gasps]

19
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,578
- Yes! That's it!
- [Laughing] OK. Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:59,744
- Floor's yours, honey.
- Presenting my one true love.

21
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,754
My prince. My dream come true.

22
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,189
- [All gasping]
- [Gasps] Oh, my goodness!

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,787
- Whoa, whoa. What? What's the problem?
- I didn't give him any lips.

24
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,458
- [Pip] Ooh!
- Does he have to have lips?

25
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,433
Of course.

26
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,165
When you meet the someone
who is meant for you

27
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,006
<i>¢Ü Before two can become one
There's something you must do</i>

28
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,945
- Do you pull each other's tails?
- Do you feed each other seeds?

29
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,572
No.

30
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,981
<i>¢Ü There is something sweeter</i>

31
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,818
<i>¢Ü Everybody needs</i>

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,452
<i>¢Ü I've been dreaming

34
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,366
<i>¢Ü That's what brings</i>

35

<i>¢Ü Ever-afterings so happy</i>

36
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,233
<i>¢Ü And that's the reason
we need lips so much</i>

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,212
<i>¢Ü For lips are the
only things that touch</i>

38
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,714
<i>¢Ü So to spend</i>

39
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:07,014
<i>- ¢Ü A life of endless bliss

<i>¢Ü Through true love's kiss ¢Ü</i>

42

[sighs]

43
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,931
If we're going to find
a perfect pair of lips,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,468
we're going to need
a lot more help.

45
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,563

- Amazing, sire.

61
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,753
Your tenth troll this month.
[Straining]

62
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,926
Oh, I love hunting trolls.

63
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,802
Big trolls, little trolls.
Trolls, trolls, trolls...

64
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,636
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's OK.

65
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,404
Ah, trolls are fine
to pass the time, Nathaniel,

66
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,505
but... but my heart longs
to be joined in song.

67

- Do you hear that, Nathaniel?</i>

70
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,454
Me? No.
No, I hear nothing.

71
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,688
- Nothing. [laughs]
- [Singing continues]

72
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,197
- [Vocalizes] Oh!
- I must find the maiden

73
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,962
- that belongs to that sweet voice.
- Oh, no! Come back, sire.

Oh, pooh. Oh, no.
No. This isn't good.

77
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,380
All these years of troll chasing, trying
to keep him from ever meeting a girl.

78
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,249
Oh, the queen.
No, she's not going to like this.

79

Honey, do you really think
your dream boy exists?

Oh, Pip. I know he's
out there somewhere.

93
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,764
Hey! That's cheating!

94
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,835
I supposed to eat you.

95
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,701
Oh, no you don't,
you big lug.

Oh? Oh!

97

98
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,571
Wow, I got to lay off the nuts.

99
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,412
Girl yummy.

- Oh, thank goodness.
- Hey, honey, wait up!

126
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,366
- We ain't done with you yet.
- No! Ah!

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,571
Oy!

- [Nathaniel] If you'll allow me...

132
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,997
[Giselle] To think that in a few moments
that Edward and I...

Oh, what a lovely bride.

136

That's very kind of you,

- but I really...
- No, no!

- Granny has a wedding gift for you.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,739
But I really should be going.
You see, I'm going...

140

- 'Tis a wishing well, dear.
- Oh!

But all my wishes
are about to come true.

If I ever see that fat mook's
face again, I'm gonna...

[Giselle] I really do have to go.

144
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,656
[Granny] But a wish on your wedding day.

145
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,667
That's the most magical of all.

146
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,604
Just close your eyes,
my darling, and make your wish.

147
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,666
That's right. That's right.
Lean in close.

148

- Are you wishing for something?
- Yes, I am.

Where, my most adored queen,
where did you send her?

154
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:06,230
To a place where there
are no "happily ever afters."

155
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,739
[Screaming]

156
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,513
Oh! Oh.

157
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,610
Oh!

158
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,315
[Yelps] What is this?

159
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,985
Oh! [yelling]

160
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,800
[Screaming]

- [Tearing]
- Oh!

166
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,361
[Truck horn blowing]

167
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,063
Oh!

[Horn blowing,

169
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,436
- Oh!
- [Glass shatters]

170
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,741
[Gasps] Oh!

171
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,912
- [Man] Get out of the street!
- Oh!

172
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,215
- Oh!
- Whoa!

173
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:39,417
Lady! Are you crazy? Now you
have to pay for all of this.

174
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,689
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I was wondering if one of you

175
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,425
kind people might
direct me to the castle?

176
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,097
Oh!

177
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,036
Hey, watch it, will you?

178
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:58,042
- Grumpy!
- Jeez, lady. Are you for real?

179
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,307
I think so. Oh, wait! Wait!

180
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,949
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

181
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,314
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

182
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,912
I'm supposed to be at the ball
to wed my true love,

183
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,550
Prince Ed... Oh! Edward!

184
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,526
Edward?

185
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,287
Oh! Edward!

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,247
- Edward?
- [Sirens wailing]

187
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,583
Oh, no.

188
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,861
Oh! Hello, old man! Oh!

189
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,626
Hello.

190
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,963
- May I sit with you?
- [Grunts]

191
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,696
Oh!

192
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,001
I'm very tired, and I'm scared.

193
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,598
I've never been this far away
from home before,

194
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,236
and I'm not sure at all where I am.

195
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,110
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

196
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,241
a friendly "hello" or even a smile,

197
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,014
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

198
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,180
[Chuckles]

199
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,550
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

200
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,858
- Oh! Where are you going?
- [Laughing]

201
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,027
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

202
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:34,630
You! Come back here!
I need that!

203
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,265
Oh! Please?

204
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,467
You...

205
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,240
...are not a very nice old man!

206
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,713
[Thunder crashes]

207
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,287
[Woman] No way you're getting him,
Ethan.

208
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,694
- [Man] You want him because I want him.
- I'm not letting you have him!

209
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,528
- Forget it. Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

210
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,228
- I'm getting confused. Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

211
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,830
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

212
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,636
A baseball card?

213
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,041
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

214
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,636
You never loved Hank like me.

215
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,511
- You never loved me like Hank!
- How did I make you so angry?

216
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,572
- Robert?
- Yes?

217
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,846
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,514
- It's a longer list!
- What would you do if you...?

219
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,490
I have to pick up my daughter.
Can we do this around 9:00?

220
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,186
- 9:00 sounds good.
- Great. I'll see you then.

221
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,195
Phoebe, I'll see you in the morning, OK?

222
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,231
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

223
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,096
- [Man] I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

224
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,965
After a whole day of that,
you still want to get engaged?

225
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,597
Those people got married
on a crazy romantic whim.

226
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,402
It's not like that with Nancy and I.

227
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,204
Right. None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?

228
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,369
Oh, come on.

229
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,709
- I mean, we're rational.
- [Laughs]

230
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,477
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

231
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,485
Sounds like building a bridge.
Have you told your daughter?

232
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,781
No, I haven't. Not yet.

233
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,290
I'm going to tonight.
I got a present to ease her into it.

234
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,156
With news like this, I hope you
got her a Shetland pony.

235
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,661
No. Something much better than that.

236
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,771
- A book?
- Oh, come on. Don't give me that look.

237
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,399
I know it's not that fairy tale book
you wanted, but this is better.

238
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,603
Look at this. See?
Rosa Parks.

239
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,804
Madame Curie.

240
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,509
She was a remarkable woman who
dedicated her life to research...

241
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,246
...until she died from...

242
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,086
...radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

243
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,320
- [Cell phone rings]
- I wonder who that is.

244
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,884
Yeah, hi.

245
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,432
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

246
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,401
<i>- [woman] With her now?
- Yes, let me call you later.</i>

247
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,870
All right. Bye-bye.

248
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,737
It was Nancy.

249
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,333
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,938
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

251
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,173
Sweetie...

252
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,316
...I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

253
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,620
- What?
- Yeah, you like her, don't you?

254
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,216
We all get along.

255
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,057
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

256
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,859
Do I have to give up my bedroom?

257
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,764
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

258
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,894
Come on, it's going to be great.
I promise.

259
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,202
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

260
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,970
- Stepmother.
- She's gonna be a nice stepmother.

261
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,979
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow, just you and her,

262
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,106
for some grown-up girl-bonding time.

263
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,581
I'm only six.

264
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,278
You won't always be.

265
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,854
[Thundering]

266
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,943
Hello!

267
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,218
It's me, Giselle, from Andalasia.

268
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,422
Hello!

269
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,961
Hello!

270
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,364
- Is there anybody home?
- [Knocks]

271
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,922
Hello, please open the door.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,594
[Giselle] It's very cold out here.

273
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,367
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

274
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,465
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

275
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,807
- She's really there!
- No, she's not. What are you doing?

276
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,370
Get back in here! Stop!

277
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,143
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

278
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,707
- Princess!
- Morgan!

279
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,481
- Don't you ever do that again!
- Look! Look!

280
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,955
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

281
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,049
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

282
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,153
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

283
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,427
I was wondering if maybe you...
Whoa!

284
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,331
- Hang on!
- [Yelping]

285
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,302
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

286
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,566
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

287
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,846
Catch her, Daddy!

288
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,549
- Oh!
- Ow!

289
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,680
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

290
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,782
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

291
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,091
- What were you doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

292
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,997
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

293
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,000
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

294
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,969
Yeah, well, welcome to New York.

295
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,438
Thank you.

296
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,305
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

297
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,540
- Oh, yes.
- You need me to call somebody for you?

298
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,207
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

299
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,013
- What?
- [Thunder crashes]

300
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,184
- [Elevator dings]
- Morgan, show her the way, please.

301
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,785
And then
the old hag told me to...

302
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,660
Oh! ...look into the well
and wish for my heart's desire.

303
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,097
But I must have looked very far

304
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,830
because I fell,
down, down, down.

305
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,099
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

306
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,040
and I got very lost,
until I fell off of the castle.

307
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,101
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit of yours?

308
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,271
Falling off stuff?

309
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,838
Well, usually someone catches me.

310
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,376
But, not to worry, I'm certain that
Edward is already searching for me.

311
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,447
No doubt by morning he'll come
and rescue me from this strange land.

312
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,552
Take me home, and the two of us
can share in true love's kiss.

313
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,687
True love's kiss?

314
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,231
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

315
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,324
Right.

316
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,268
Now if I could only find a place
to rest my head for the night.

317
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,363
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

318
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,341
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

319
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,899
A hollow tree?

320
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,277
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're very hospitable.

321
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,045
All I can do is let you in for a minute.
Dry off, use the phone if you want to.

322
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,643
We have our own bedtime
to stick to. Let's go.

323
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,451
That's very kind of you.

324
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,389
- What is it with this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

325
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,397
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk

326
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,764
from my silkworms and I spun it
into thread on my spinning wheel.

327
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,168
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits

328
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,865
did help with the sewing.

329
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,103
- They're good!
- Oh!

330
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,871
- [Tearing]
- Whoa!

331
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,712
[Giggles]

332
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,081
Why don't we see about
getting you a car.

333
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,484
[Thundering]

334
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:33,320
- Couldn't she sleep here, Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

335
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,155
[Sighs]

336
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,365
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

337
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,426
But... [yawns]

338
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,371
...I will be soon.

339
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,343
Wow, Dad.
She's really sleepy.

340
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,946
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

341
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,014
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

342
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,320
I want you to go to bed.

343
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,884
But I think she might be
a real princess.

344
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,626
Morgan, just because she has on a funny
dress, doesn't mean she's a princess.

345
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,467
She is a seriously confused woman
who's fallen into our laps.

346
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,803
- So we're not going to let her stay?
- No.

347
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,274
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

348
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,777
Good night, OK?

349
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:36,315
Hi. I need a car
at 116th and Riverside, please.

350
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,618
<i>- [man] Hold, please.
- Thank you.</i>

351
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,158
[Thunder rumbling]

352
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:54,667
<i>Hello, sir.
Destination, please.</i>

353
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,332
<i>Sir?</i>

354
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,575
[Sighs]

355
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,854
- Morgan.
- What?

356
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,720
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

357
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,760
- Why?
- Just come on.

358
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,692
All right.

359
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,268
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

360
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,004
Yeah, but who's
gonna rescue me?

361
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,172
- All right, let's close it up.
- Whoa!

362
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,915
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

363
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,351
- [Yelling]
- Guys, I got it.

364
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,912
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

365
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,322
Are you in league with
the wicked old hag who sent

366
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,384
my poor Giselle
to this foul place, Arty?

367
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,828
[Yelling]

368
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,266
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

369
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,861
[Squeaking]

370
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,938
[Coughing, squeaking]

371
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,245
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

372
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,979
- Speechless in my presence.
- [Squeaks]

373
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,248
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

374
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,257
- What are you talking about?
- I seek a beautiful girl.

375
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,452
My other half,
my one coquette,

376
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,222
the answer
to my love's duet.

377
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,059
I'd like to
find one of them too.

378
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,328
Then keep a wary eye out, Arty.

379
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,892
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

380
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,665
- [Squeaking]
- Hey!

381
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,906
- [Man] Hey! Get off the car, you nut!
- [Honking]

382
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,375
Did you see that chipmunk?

383
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,117
[Yawning]

384
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,368
Oh, my. [clicking tongue]

385
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,675
This just won't do.

386
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,582
[Vocalizing]

387
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,624
[Buzzing]

388
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,994
Whoa!

389
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,898
- [Squeaking]
- [Shouting]

390
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,211
[Gasps] Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

391
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,255
- [Warbles]
- Oh. [giggles]

392
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,689
- [Squeaking, warbling]
- Hello.

393
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,694
Oh...

394
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:13,235
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

395
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,570
All right, everyone,
let's tidy things up.

396
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:21,704
<i>¢Ü Come, my little friends as we all sing
a happy little working song</i>

397
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,907
<i>¢Ü Merry little voices
Clear and strong</i>

398
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,951
<i>¢Ü Come and roll your
sleeves up so to speak</i>

399
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,545
<i>¢Ü And pitch in cleaning
crud up in the kitchen</i>

400
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,750
<i>¢Ü As we sing along</i>

401
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:38,455
<i>¢Ü Trill a cheery tune in the tub
as you scrub a stubborn mildew stain</i>

402
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,998
<i>¢Ü Pluck a hairball
from the shower drain</i>

403
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,968
<i>¢Ü To that gay refrain
of a happy working song</i>

404
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,005
<i>¢Ü We'll keep singing
without fail</i>

405
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,541
<i>¢Ü Otherwise we'd spoil it</i>

406
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:56,275
<i>¢Ü Hosing down the garbage pail
and scrubbing up the toilet</i>

407
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:00,250
<i>¢Ü How we all enjoy letting loose with
a little "la da dum dum dum"</i>

408
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,151
<i>¢Ü While we're emptying the vacu-um</i>

409

<i>¢Ü It's such fun</i>

410
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,085
<i>- ¢Ü To hum a happy working song
- ¢Ü Ooh</i>

411
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,992
<i>¢Ü A happy working song</i>

412
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:15,624
<i>¢Ü Oh, how strange
a place to be</i>

413
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
<i>¢Ü Till Edward comes for me</i>

414
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,833
<i>¢Ü My heart is sighing</i>

415
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,638
<i>¢Ü Still, as long as I am here</i>

416
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:30,807
<i>¢Ü I guess a new experience</i>

417
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,646
<i>¢Ü Could be worth trying</i>

418
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,744
<i>¢Ü Hey, keep drying</i>

419
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,948
<i>¢Ü You can do a lot
when you've got such</i>

420
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,492
<i>¢Ü A happy working tune to hum</i>

421
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,686
<i>¢Ü While you're sponging up
the soapy scum</i>

422
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,789
<i>¢Ü We adore each filthy chore
that we determine</i>

423

<i>¢Ü So, friends even though
you're vermin</i>

424
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:56,341
<i>¢Ü We're a happy working throng</i>

425
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,842
<i>¢Ü Singing as we fetch
the detergent box</i>

426
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,970
<i>¢Ü For the smelly shirts
and the stinky socks</i>

427
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,742
<i>¢Ü Sing along</i>

428
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,682
<i>¢Ü If you cannot sing
Then hum along</i>

429
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:12,212
<i>¢Ü As we're finishing
our happy working song ¢Ü</i>

00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,490
Ah.

431
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,051
Wasn't this fun?

432
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,289
[Chittering]

433
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,294
- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

434
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,030
- Wake up!
- What is it?

435
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,629
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

436
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,538
I can't tell you.
You have to come see!

437
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,041
What's wrong? Are you OK?

438
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,706
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

439
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,149
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

440
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,053
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.

441
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,820
- Get rid of them.
- Put them back?

442
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,020
Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

443
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,393
Open the door!

444
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,400
Good! Watch out!

445
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,200
- [Giselle humming]
- [Water running]

446
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,642
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

447
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,446
Shh. Stay there.

448
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,885
- Hello.
- Come in!

449
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:22,018
- Yeah, can I...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

450
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:26,086
Oh! That's too thoughtful of you.

451
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,759
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

452
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:34,430
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

453
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,303
Where does the water come from?

454
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,936
Uh, well, the water comes
from the pipes.

455
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:45,472
- And where do the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

456
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,146
...wherever the pipes get it.
- Oh.

457
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,813
It is magical.

458
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,616
[Knocking]

459
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,297
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

460
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,925
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

461
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,730
Kick what?

462
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,634
Why do you still have your PJ's on?

463
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,172
It's been pretty busy around here.

464
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,943
Wow.
It's really neat in here.

465
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:18,415
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

466
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,917
[Giselle] Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

467
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,820
- [Vocalizing] Oh!
- [Grunting]

468
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,517
[Laughing]

469
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,457
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

470
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,518
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

471
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,291
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

472
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,525
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

473
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,192
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

474
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,566
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

475
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,800
- She was lost. I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

476
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,342
The shower.
The shower is wonderful, Nancy.

477
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,878
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough. Thank you.

478
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,813
- Calm down. Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

479
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,373
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,

480
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,011
Morgan's here, and you have
to maintain boundaries

481
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,351
and I thought,
"I'm so lucky. He's sensitive!"

482
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,153
I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.

483
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,818
- We'll talk.
- Don't bet on it.

484
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,125
What about taking Morgan?
Some grown-up girl-bonding time.

485
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,997
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

486
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,696
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

487
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,794
Goodbye!

488
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,235
Oh, she is lovely.

489
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,210
Get dressed, please.
For school.

490
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,543
Just... Please.

491
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,915
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

492
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,851
Nancy, wait!

493
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,481
[Groans]

494
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,287
- [Giselle] Hello?
- You got to go.

495
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,854
I don't know what your deal is,
if you're waiting for Prince Charming...

496
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,763
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

497
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,302
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

498
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,635
and then that's it!
I can't get involved after that.

499
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,310
What is this?

500
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,281
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

501
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,475
Do you like it?

502
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,280
You're unhappy.

503
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,413
You made a dress out of my curtains?

504
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,254
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

505
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,193
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

506
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,594
It's an unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

507
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,896
- I have heard of it, but I...
- You have created a completely

508
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,369
unnecessary problem with Nancy
that I now have to resolve.

509
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,770
See, the fact is,
I was just getting ready

510
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,365
to take a very serious step forward.

511
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,570
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

512
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,045
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and I...

513
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,380
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

514
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,615
Oh, no.

515
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,214
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

516
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,192
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

517
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,788
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

518
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:51,324
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

519
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,963
And then she'll know for sure.

520
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,103
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know.

521
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,408
It's like you escaped from
a Hallmark card or something.

522
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,574
Is that a bad thing?

523
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,108
[Sighs] School! We're late!
We've got to run!

524
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,280
Oh!

525
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,252
[Door slams]

526
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:21,265
Oh, wouldn't she just love to come
crawling back here and steal my crown!

527
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,200
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

528
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,432
Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.

529
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,838
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

530
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,001
[Grunting]

531
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,039
Oh...

532
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:43,383
Oh! I do wish there was someone
who cared enough for me

533
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,287
- to go after him.
- [Chuckles]

534
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:52,023
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

535
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,964
- I'd do anything for him.
- [Chuckling]

536
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,229
Never fear, my queen.

537
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,635
I will stop him!

538
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,902
- [Echoing yelling]
- [Clanging]

539
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,475
- What now?
- Another one?

540
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,451
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

541
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,283
Where are these people coming from?

542
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,822
- Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

543
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,791
- [Straining]
- Get him up.

544
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,588
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

545
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:27,028
Let me guess. You're, uh,
looking for a beautiful girl too.

546
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,861
No.

547
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,231
I'm looking for a prince, actually.

548
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,964
- Right.
- [Edward laughs]

549
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:42,572
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

550
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,713
[All shouting]

551
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,349
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

552
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,895
- [Laughter]
- Drat!

553
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,490
The steel beast is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

554
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,400
- [Man] Move that bus!
- [Man 2] Come on, already!

555
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,496
- [Man 3] Get that bus out of there!
- Are you crazy?

556
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,906
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

557
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,637
Do you hear me?

558
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,872
- You get down here!
- If you'll allow me...

559
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,644
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I suggest that you...

560
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:23,312
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

561
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,288
Come here and mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

562
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,622
- Don't you roll your eyes at me!
- [Squeaks]

563
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,925
A rat!
Get it away from me!

564
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,659
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

565
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,067
- [Screaming]
- Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere

566
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,730
for your bride?

567
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,919
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

568
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,586
It's just a statue!

569
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,426
- [Elevator dings]
- Come quickly. Quickly.

570
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,296
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

571
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,960
- Mrs. Banks is here.
- Great.

572
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,594
With Mr. Banks and his lawyer.

573
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,662
- Perfect, how long?
- Do you want to know?

574
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,334
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

575
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,876
- See this girl?
- Who is she?

576
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,310
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

577
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,575
- What do I do?
- Find out where she's from,

578
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,844
and get her there.
And make sure it's cheap.

579
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,818
If Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.

580
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,820
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

581
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,220
I have a meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

582
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,418
Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.

583
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,017
- Yes? Hi.
- Stay out of trouble.

584
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,085
[Laughing]

585
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,332
Oh... Oh.

586
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:47,235
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

587
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,905
[Growling]

588
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,908
Your Majesty.

589
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,746
- [Queen] Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

590
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,678
Nathaniel, here!

591
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,721
- Nathaniel!
- [Clanks]

592
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:15,126
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here. [sighs]

593
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,760
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't, My Lady.

594
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,033
[Sighs] Time is of the essence.

595
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,041
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

596
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,100
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

597
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:31,512
No, he shan't. I intend to make
absolutely certain of that.

598
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,380
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

599
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,353
...ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

600
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,022
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

601
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,657
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

602
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:53,898
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

603
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,235
- Hmm?
- Happily...

604
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,799
...ever after?
Oh, My Lady.

605
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,038
Mmm, yes.
It won't be difficult.

606
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,674
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

607
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,846
One small bite to drag her down

608
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,720
into a deep and troubled sleep.

609
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,259
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

610
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,785
that precious little pretender
to my throne

611
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,957
will be gone!

612
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,400
It shall be done, My Lady.

613
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,460
- I swear it.
- [Laughing] Yes.

614
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,837
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

615
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,333
Your Majesty?

616
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,815
[Squeaks] Hello.

617
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,714
You little...

618
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,980
[man] Whoa! Hey!

619
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,355
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please. I beg of you.

620
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,926
Don't listen to that
insane little vermin.

621
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,995
He's probably eaten some bad nuts.

622
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,064
We should put him down
for his own good.

623
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,836
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

624
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,038
But, sire! No. He's delirious.
He came to tell all sorts of...

625
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,276
[choking]

626
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,316
- [Coughing]
- Go ahead, Pip.

627
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,083
- What is it you want to say?
- [Clears throat]

628
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,750
You watch me. OK?

629
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,794
- [Squeaks]
- Nathaniel?

630
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,354
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

631
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:32,198
- Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
- No, no, no.

632
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,136
Hmm... Oh!

633
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,698
[Imitating Nathaniel]

634
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,753
[Imitating Giselle, singing]

635
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,790
Oh, oh, oh!
I know this.

636
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,793
- Uh...
- Apple?

637
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,522
No, thank you.

638
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,063
It's good.

639
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,599
Oh, OK.

640
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,231
[Choking]

641
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,895
Ta-da!

642
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,168
- You feel you'd die without me here.
- [Groans]

643
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,317
Yes. Here we go. Good.

644
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,286
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

645
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,721
There's no reason not
to be reasonable.

646
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,954
Great. We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

647
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,552
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars for a second.

648
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,188
- Sorry. [laughs]
- What? What?

649
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,563
She has no driver's license.
No passport.

650
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,431
Can't find this place she comes from.

651
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,696
- What place?
- Andalusia.

652
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,998
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

653
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,005
I've called every travel agent.

654
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,268
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

655
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,470
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

656
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,413
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

657
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,576
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

658
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,154
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

659
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,750
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

660
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,661
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

661
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,597
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain he already knows.

662
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,228
- Excuse me?
- [Gasps] Are you him?

663
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,400
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

664
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,467
- It's no wonder you're in love.
- I got it!

665
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,741
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

666
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,840
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

667
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,385
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

668
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,217
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

669
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,950
- Yeah.
- For how long?

670
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,152
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

671
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,061
Shh. Yes.

672
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,792
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

673
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,960
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

674
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,969
- She's not.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

675
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,767
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

676
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,240
What kind of an operation
are you running here?

677
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,901
This is so unprofessional.

678
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,538
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

679
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,048
If you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

680
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,846
you can throw this whole deal out.

681
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,981
What is going on here?
Who's she?

682
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,581
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

683
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,822
You begged me to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

684
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,057
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

685
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,326
<i>And some girl is crying
like we're on Oprah.</i>

686
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,699
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

687
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,170
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

688
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,867
<i>Yes, you. This whole Kumbaya,
Up With People routine.</i>

689
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,809
- Those people are in real pain.
- Of course they're in pain.

690
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,277
They're separated forever.

691
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,405
Married one day
and the next they're not.

692
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,007
- What sort of awful place is this?
- It's reality.

693
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,348
Well, I think I'd prefer to be
in Andalasia.

694
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,253
- I think I'd prefer that too.
- Get in, please.

695
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,223
[Squeaking]

696
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:46,252
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

697
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,289
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

698
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,097
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

699
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,331
Where do you suppose I should look?

700
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,840
[Squeaking]

701
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,747
Look, sire! Over there!

702
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,252
[Edward] Ah! Giselle!

703
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:14,280
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose! [laughs]

704
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,521
- [Edward] Giselle!
- [Robert] I try to do the right thing.

705
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,153
Oh, you've been very nice to me.

706
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:23,256
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

707
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,461
- I can't help you anymore. OK?
- What?

708
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,199
Here's some money. I want you
to take it. Call your prince.

709
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,104
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

710
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,008
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

711
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,479
- Robert?
- Just go.

712
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,846
I'm so sorry.

713
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,750
You have been a very kind friend
to me when I had none.

714
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,257
And I would never want to make you
unhappy or cause you any trouble, so...

715
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,723
...I'll go.

716
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:55,356
I wish you every happiness.

717
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,987
[Giselle] You have lovely friends.

718
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,288
[Woman] Would you like to feed
the birds? Just a dollar a bag.

719
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,328
Certainly.

720
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,193
By chance,
have you seen my prince?

721
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,232
He was here.

722
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,097
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

723
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,637
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

724
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,799
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,308
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

726
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,776
He was on the bus this morning.

727
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,508
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

728
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,981
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

729
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,679
- You can't just give people money.
- You gave me money.

730
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,018
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

731
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,115
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

732
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,128
- How long you two been together?
- Oh, about a day.

733
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,790
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

734
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,665
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

735
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,397
- One day?
- Yes.

736
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,838
- And tomorrow will be two days.
- You're joking.

737
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,705
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

738
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,368
But I'm not.

739
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:18,006
You're gonna marry somebody after a day
because you fell in love with him?

740
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,607
Yes.

741
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,208
Yes!

742
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,825
Oh! Ooh! [laughs]

743
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,821
I don't get it. How can you talk
about loving some guy

744
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,060
- you don't even know?
- Well, I know what's in his heart.

745
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,534
Oh, OK. Great.

746
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,764
This was so yummy.

747
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,069
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

748
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,405
- You all done? OK.
- Mmm!

749
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,446
- Let me put that out for you.
- What about you?

750
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,847
- How long have you known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

751
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,681
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. I...

752
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,244
Well, no wonder she's angry.

753
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,552
[Nathaniel using accent]
Hello, nice lady.

754
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,526
You want juicy,
sweet caramel apple, maybe?

755
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,721
Mm.

756
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,424
No charge for the beautiful
young woman.

757
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,364
- Oh, really. It's free?
- Of course!

758
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,164
Today is free caramel apple day.

759
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,537
Tomorrow is free beef... jerky.

760
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,099
Thank you very much, kind sir.

761
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:24,341
- You're welcome, miss.
- [Squeaking]

762
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,143
You...

763
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,380
- [muffled squeaking]
- Shut up.

764
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,653
Most normal people get to know
each other before they get married.

765
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,921
They date.

766
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,190
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

767
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,358
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

768
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,460
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

769
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,701
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

770
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,242
About yourself.
About your interests.

771
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,540
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

772
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,308
You have such strange
ideas about love.

773
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,079
Maybe we should do what you would do.
You meet, have lunch, and get married.

774
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,143
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

775
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,553
Forget "happily ever after."
It doesn't exist.

776
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,921
Well, of course it does.
[Gasps] Oh!

777
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,983
- [Sizzling]
- Oh!

778
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,087
[Robert] I hate to disagree,
but marriages are a success

779
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,426
if they manage not to end.

780
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,297
- Forget about happiness.
- What about you and Nancy?

781
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,632
You know that you will
live happily ever after.

782
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:25,141
I don't know if I'll make it
through today, let alone a lifetime.

783
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,837
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It's complicated.

784
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,004
But it doesn't have to be.

785
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,776
- Not if she knows.
- Knows what?

786
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,318
- How much you really love her.
- Of course she does.

787
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:38,513
We just don't talk about it every minute
of the day, but she knows.

788
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,386
- How?
- What do you mean, "how?"

789
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:44,052
<i>¢Ü How does she know</i>

790
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,153
<i>- ¢Ü You love her?
- [Laughs] No. Don't.</i>

791
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,792
<i>- ¢Ü How does she know
- People looking.</i>

792
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,827
<i>- ¢Ü She's yours?
- Don't sing. It's OK.</i>

793
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,203
Let's just walk.
Can we walk? OK?

794
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,764
- Well, does she?
- Yeah.

795
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,174
<i>¢Ü How does she know
that you love her?</i>

796
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,837
- Oh.
- He knows the song too?

797
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,313
<i>¢Ü How do you
show her you love her?</i>

798
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,111
[Playing calypso music]

799
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,550
<i>¢Ü How does she know
that you really</i>

800
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,748
<i>- ¢Ü Really, truly love her?
- I've never heard this song.</i>

801
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,155
<i>¢Ü How does she know
that you love her?</i>

802
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,194
<i>- ¢Ü How do you show her you love her?
- Really nice work.</i>

803
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,197
<i>- ¢Ü How does she know that you really
- That's it. OK.</i>

804
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,358
<i>- ¢Ü Truly love her?
- Let's go.</i>

805
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:28,393
<i>¢Ü It's not enough to take
the one you love for granted</i>

806
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:33,273
<i>¢Ü You must remind her
or she'll be inclined to say</i>

807
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,369
<i>¢Ü How do I know</i>

808
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,710
<i>¢Ü He loves me?</i>

809
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,683
<i>¢Ü How do I know</i>

810
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,243
<i>¢Ü He's mine?</i>

811
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,449
<i>¢Ü Well, does he leave
a little note to tell you</i>

812
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,516
<i>¢Ü You are on his mind?</i>

813
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,360
<i>¢Ü Send you yellow flowers
when the sky is gray?</i>

814
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,959
<i>¢Ü Hey, he'll find
a new way to show you</i>

815
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,869
<i>¢Ü A little bit every day</i>

816
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,464
<i>¢Ü That's how you know</i>

817
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,978
<i>¢Ü That's how you know
he's your love</i>

818
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,674
- See?
- I've seen quite enough. Let's go.

819
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,340
- A ball?
- Yeah.

820
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,648
- That would be fun!
- That would not be fun.

821
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,517
<i>¢Ü You got to show her
you need her</i>

822
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,219
<i>¢Ü Don't treat her
like a mind reader</i>

823
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,694
<i>¢Ü Each day do something
to lead her</i>

824
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,561
<i>¢Ü To believe you love her</i>

825
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,332
<i>¢Ü Everybody wants to live
happily ever after</i>

<i>¢Ü Everybody wants to know
their true love is true</i>

827
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:45,076
<i>¢Ü How do you
know he loves you?</i>

828

<i>¢Ü How do you know he's yours?</i>

829
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:55,791
<i>¢Ü Well, does he take you out dancing
just so he can hold you close?</i>

830
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,087
I don't dance.

831
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,597
<i>¢Ü Dedicate a song with words
meant just for you? Ooh</i>

832
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,431
<i>- And I really don't sing.
- ¢Ü He'll find his own way to tell you</i>

Take these flowers to Nancy, please?

841
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,498
Are you crazy? They're birds.
They don't know where she lives.
