I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

149
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,617
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

150
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,786
As a result of your careless behavior...

151
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,693
Careless and reckless behavior!

152
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,993
...the entire celebration was, uh...

153
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,729
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

154
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:21,964
This concert was to be

155
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:25,633
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

156
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,475
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

157
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,138
But it wasn't her fault...

158
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,877
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

159
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:38,443
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

162
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,556

and it was, "This is this..."

163

didn't you?

166

- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

167
00:12:55,871 --> 00:13:00,103
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

168
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:04,806
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

169
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

170
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:11,509
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

171
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:14,078

I'm not a child anymore.

Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

173
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,395
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

174
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,330
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

175
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:27,801
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

180
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:47,811
Do you think I was too hard on her?

181
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,016
Definitely not.

182
