1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,200
DATE--SEPTEMBER 6, 1620.

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,200
JUST 128 YEARS

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,700
SINCE COLUMBUS
DISCOVERED AMERICA.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,200
THE PLACE--

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
THE HARBOR OF PLYMOUTH
IN ENGLAND.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
A TINY SHIP CALLED
THEMAYFLOWER

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
IS BEING BOARDED
BY 102 PEOPLE.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,200
THERE ARE 70 MEN AND WOMEN,
32 CHILDREN,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
A HANDFUL OF COCKS
AND HENS AND PETS,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
AND A DOG.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,700
SOME OF THE VOYAGERS
ARE PEOPLE

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
WHO TODAY
WE CALL PILGRIMS.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,700
THEY'RE LEAVING THEIR HOMELAND
TO SEEK MORE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,200
IN THE NEW WORLD.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
SOME PASSENGERS,
KNOWN AS "STRANGERS,"

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,700
ARE MERELY SEEKING WEALTH
IN THE NEW LAND.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,200
SOME ARE
INDENTURED SERVANTS,

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,700
AND THE REST
ARE THE CREW

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
WHO WILL SAIL
THE MAYFLOWER.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
THE PILGRIMS
HAVE A CONTRACT

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,200
WITH ENGLISH MERCHANTS

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
WHO WILL FINANCE
THE JOURNEY.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
THE PILGRIMS AND MERCHANTS
WILL SHARE ANY PROFITS

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,700
FROM THE NEW SETTLEMENT.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,200
THIS, HOWEVER, IS A MOST
DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,700
THE VOYAGERS REALIZE
THEIR VERY LIVES

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,200
ARE AT RISK.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
THEY MUST CROSS
THE TREACHEROUS
NORTH ATLANTIC

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
IN A VERY SMALL SHIP.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,700
THE JOURNEY WILL TAKE
MANY WEEKS

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,200
ON THE OPEN SEA.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
WILL BE TRAVELING

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,700
IN UNBELIEVABLY
CROWDED CONDITIONS,

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,200
SHARING WHAT LITTLE
SPACE THERE IS

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
WITH THE PRECIOUS CARGO.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
THE VOYAGERS WILL
HARDLY HAVE ANY ROOM

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,300
TO SLEEP AND EAT,

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
LET ALONE MOVE ABOUT.

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
MANY WILL BE LEAVING
LOVED ONES BEHIND.

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,300
EVEN IF THEY SURVIVE
THIS DANGEROUS CROSSING,

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,300
THEY WILL ARRIVE AT
A VIRTUAL WILDERNESS.

42
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
HOWEVER,
THEIR BELIEF IN GOD,

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,800
THEIR DESIRE FOR FREEDOM
FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION,

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
AND THEIR DREAMS
OF CREATING A NEW WORLD

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS

46
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,300
ALL MAKE THEIR
LIFE-THREATENING JOURNEY

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
A RISK WORTH TAKING.

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,300
THEIR ADVENTURES
WILL CHANGE THE COURSE

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,800
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,300
FOR THE FIRST WEEKS,

51
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
THERE ARE FAVORABLE WINDS.

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
THE MAYFLOWER
MAKES STEADY PROGRESS

53
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,800
ACROSS THE SEA.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
UNFORTUNATELY,
EVEN IN GOOD WEATHER,

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
THE CONDITIONS ABOARD SHIP
ARE MISERABLE.

56
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,800
THERE ARE NO
SANITARY PROVISIONS

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
AND VERY LITTLE PRIVACY.

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,300
SOME HAVE TO SLEEP
ON STRAW ON THE FLOORS.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
SOME ON BOARD
GET VIOLENTLY SEASICK.

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
THE CHILDREN,
RANGING IN AGE

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,900
FROM A FEW MONTHS OLD
TO 15, GROW RESTLESS.

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
AFTER THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
OF FAVORABLE WINDS,

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,400
THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN
FINALLY TURNS ITS FULL FURY

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,900
ON THE TINY MAYFLOWER.

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,400
DAMAGING CROSSWINDS
AND VIOLENT STORMS

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
CONTINUE STRAINING
THE MAYFLOWER

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,400
TO THE BREAKING POINT.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,400
THE PASSENGERS ARE FORCED
TO STAY INSIDE

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,900
IN THE FOUL-SMELLING
CABINS.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,900
I'M NOT FEELING WELL,
LINUS.

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
I'M NOT EITHER,
CHARLIE BROWN.

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,400
HOW MUCH FARTHER
DO WE HAVE TO GO?

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
I'M NOT SURE.

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
I THINK SOMEONE SAID
WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY.

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,900
OH, NO!

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,400
COME ON,
CHARLIE BROWN.
SHAPE UP.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
YOU CAN'T LET
THIS LITTLE WIND
BOTHER YOU.

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
THE STORMS BECOME
SO VIOLENT,

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
THE CREW IS FORCED
TO HULL THE SHIP,

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
TO GO TO SHORT SAIL,

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,900
OR PRACTICALLY
NO SAIL AT ALL.

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,500
THIS KEEPS THE SAILS
FROM RIPPING APART,

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
BUT NOW THE MAYFLOWER
IS LIKE A CORK,

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
BOBBING UP AND DOWN,

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
HELPLESS
ON THE GREAT OCEAN.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,500
AAH!

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
MAN OVERBOARD!

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WHAT WAS ALL THE YELLING
ABOUT ON DECK?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,500
THEY JUST SAVED
JOHN HOWLAND'S LIFE.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
THE STORM
BLEW HIM OVERBOARD.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
OH, NO!

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,000
AND NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
NOW WHAT?

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
WE MAY HAVE TO
RETURN TO ENGLAND.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
TURN BACK?
ARE THEY CRAZY?

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THE STORM DAMAGED
ONE OF THE MAIN BEAMS
AT MIDSHIPS.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
THE BEAM IS CRACKED
AND BOWED.

99
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
WHY CAN'T THEY FIX IT?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO ON?

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
SOME OF THE CREW THINK

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,500
OUR SHIP HAS ALREADY
TAKEN TOO MUCH
OF A BEATING.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
IF WE HEAD FOR HOME,

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
THE WINDS WILL BE
AT OUR BACK.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WHAT'S GOING TO
BECOME OF US, LINUS?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IT'S UP TO CAPTAIN JONES.
HE'S THE CAPTAIN.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
LET HIM TELL US.

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
CAPTAIN,
WE CAN'T RISK LIVES.
WE MUST TURN BACK.

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,000
IF WE CAN FIX THAT BEAM,
WE WILL GO ON.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WE'VE COME TOO FAR
TO TURN BACK NOW.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
AFTER MANY HOURS OF DEBATE,

111
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
A GREAT JACKSCREW
FORCES THE SPRUNG MAIN BEAM

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,000
BACK INTO PLACE.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THERE IT'S SECURED
TO THE TIMBERS.

114
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
A POST IS PLACED
UNDER THE MAIN BEAM

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
TO BRACE IT.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
THE MAYFLOWER'S
CAPTAIN JONES

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,100
HAS FAITH IN HIS SHIP,

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,100
AND THE PILGRIMS
HAVE FAITH IN THEIR GOD.

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,600
THEY ALL DECIDE TO
FURTHER RISK THEIR LIVES

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
TO REACH THE NEW WORLD.

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
THE DATE IS
NOVEMBER 9, 1620.

122
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,600
IT IS DAYBREAK.

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,100
DO YOU MISS
ENGLAND?

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,100
I REALLY MISS
MY GRANDMOTHER
AND GRANDFATHER.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
BOY, I REALLY MISS
MY FRIENDS.

126
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE
ANY CHILDREN IN THE NEW WORLD.

127
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,600
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
SEEM WORRIED.

128
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
THIS MUST BE
A REALLY DANGEROUS TRIP.

129
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN
ON THIS SHIP, LINUS?

130
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
THIS IS OUR 65th DAY,
CHARLIE BROWN.

131
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,600
GOOD GRIEF!
NINE WEEKS!

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LONG TALK

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
WITH WHOEVER
PLANNED THIS TRIP.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,100
DO YOU THINK WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT?

135
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,600
I HARDLY HAVE
ANY STRENGTH LEFT.

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
CHARLIE BROWN,
WE HAVE TO KEEP FAITH.

137
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,100
A BATH AND NEW CLOTHES
WOULDN'T HURT EITHER.

138
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,600
A LOT OF THE OTHERS
ARE STARTING TO GIVE UP.

139
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
THEY DON'T THINK
WE'LL GET THERE.

140
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
WE HAVE TO GET THERE.

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,100
WHY IS THAT, LUCY?

142
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,100
BECAUSE I HAVE TO LODGE
ALL MY COMPLAINTS

143
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,600
ABOUT THIS
TERRIBLE TRIP.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
LAND HO!  LAND HO!

145
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
WE MADE IT,
CHARLIE BROWN!

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
WE MADE IT!

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,700
WE DID IT, LUCY!
WE DID IT!

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,700
WE CROSSED THE GREAT OCEAN!

149
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
POINT ME TO
THE SUGGESTION BOX.

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I'VE GOT A FEW CHOICE WORDS
FOR THE CAPTAIN OF THIS SHIP.

151
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
GOOD GRIEF.

152
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
THEMAYFLOWERHAS ARRIVED.

153
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,200
THE DATE--
NOVEMBER 9, 1620.

154
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
SHE FIRST SIGHTS LAND

155
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,700
65 DAYS AND 2,750 MILES

156
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
FROM PLYMOUTH, DEVON.

157
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,700
THE AVERAGE SPEED--
2 MILES PER HOUR.

158
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
TWO DAYS LATER

159
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
ON NOVEMBER 11th

MARCIE, YOU ARE WEIRD.

319
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
WE SURE ARE
LUCKY TO HAVE
CAPTAIN STANDISH

320
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,800
AS OUR
MILITARY LEADER,

321
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
EVEN IF HE ISN'T
ONE OF US PILGRIMS.

322
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
THAT'S FOR SURE.

323
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,300
HE HELPS
WITH THE BUILDING.

324
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
HE NURSES THE SICK.

325
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
HE'S EVEN
GOING TO TRAIN US
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

326
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,300
DEFEND OURSELVES
FROM WHAT?

327
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
THE INDIANS.

328
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,300
WE KNOW THEY'RE
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,

329
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,800
AND THEY CAN
ATTACK US ANY DAY.

330
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I HOPE THEY
DON'T ATTACK TODAY.

331
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
WHY TODAY?

332
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,300
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
THE WASH YET.

333
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,800
BY THE END OF FEBRUARY,

334
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,300
TWO-AND-A-HALF MONTHS
AFTER LANDING AT PLYMOUTH,

335
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
NO INDIANS HAVE BEEN SEEN,

336
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
BUT THE COMBINATION
OF A TERRIBLE WINTER

337
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
AND LACK OF NUTRITIOUS FOOD
AND NECESSARY MEDICAL SUPPLIES

338
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,800
HAS BEEN DEVASTATING.

339
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,300
HALF OF THE ORIGINAL
102 PASSENGERS HAVE DIED.

340
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
ONLY 20 ADULTS AND
30 CHILDREN HAVE SURVIVED.

341
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,300
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

342
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,800
AS THE WINTER CONTINUES

343
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
THROUGH THE FIRST DAYS
OF MARCH,

344
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,800
NOTHING LESS
THAN A MIRACLE IS NEEDED

345
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
TO SAVE THE FEW SURVIVORS.

346
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
THE STRONG FAITH OF
THE SURVIVING PILGRIMS...

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,400
IS JUST ABOUT ALL
THEY HAVE LEFT.

348
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
EVEN CAPTAIN MILES STANDISH
HAS BEEN HEARD SAYING

349
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
TIME MAY BE RUNNING OUT
ON THE SURVIVORS.

350
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,900
IN EARLY MARCH,

351
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
THE SURVIVORS
MUST MAKE A DECISION.

352
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,900
SHALL THEY RETURN TO
ENGLAND ON THEMAYFLOWER,

353
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,400
OR SHALL THEY
TRY TO SURVIVE

354
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
IN THE WILDERNESS?

355
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
AND THEN, A MIRACLE...

356
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,900
LOOK, LINUS.

357
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,900
HE'S NOT CARRYING
ANY WEAPONS.

358
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
WELCOME, ENGLISHMEN.

359
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,400

MY PEOPLE WELCOME YOU
TO OUR LAND.

HE SPEAKS ENGLISH!

362
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
WELCOME,
ENGLISHMAN.

363
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
WELCOME.

364
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,900
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

365
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,400
MY NAME SAMOSET.

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,900
MY PEOPLE WELCOME YOU
TO OUR LAND.

367
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,400
HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU
KNOW OUR LANGUAGE?

368
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
ENGLISH FISHERMAN, MANY
MILES NORTH OF THIS PLACE.

369

ENGLISH FISHERMAN
TEACH ME SPEAK,

370
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,400
AND FUR TRADERS, TOO.

371
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,400
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US
WHY THIS LAND HAS BEEN CLEARED

372
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,900
AND WHO CLEARED IT?

373
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
WE HAVE SEEN NO ONE.

374
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,900
THIS LAND IS LAND
OF PATUXET TRIBE.

375
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,400
THEY CLEARED LAND HERE.

376
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,900
WHERE ARE THEY?

377
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,400
ALL DEAD. TERRIBLE PLAGUE.

378
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,900
ALL DIED HERE
FOUR YEAR AGO.

379
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,400
EVERYONE DIED?

380
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,900
YES, YOUNG MAN,

381
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,400
EXCEPT FOR ONE MAN.

382
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,900
HIS NAME SQUANTO.

383
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,400
HE SPEAK
BETTER ENGLISH.

384
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,900
I BRING HIM TO YOU
IN TWO SUNRISES.

385
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,400
WHILE THE PILGRIMS
CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THEIR EYES AND EARS,

386
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,900
SAMOSET TELLS THEM

387
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
ABOUT THEIR
SURROUNDING WILDERNESS.

388
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,500
TWO DAYS LATER,

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
SAMOSET RETURNS
WITH THE INDIAN SQUANTO.

390
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
THE PILGRIMS WERE NOT ONLY
ASTOUNDED BY HIS GOOD ENGLISH,

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
BUT ALSO BY THE STORY
OF HIS LIFE.

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,500
I WAS KIDNAPPED FROM
MY LAND HERE BY ENGLISHMEN

393
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
MANY YEARS AGO.

394
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
THEY TOOK ME TO SPAIN.

395
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
FRIENDLY MONKS HELPED ME
TO ESCAPE TO ENGLAND.

396
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I SERVED A WONDERFUL MAN

397
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
WHO ALSO HAD ME
LEARN ENGLISH.

398
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THAT MAN FINALLY
GAVE ME MY FREEDOM

399
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,500
TO SAIL BACK HERE
TO MY LAND.

400
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,000
WE NEED MUCH HELP.

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
MANY OF OUR PEOPLE
HAVE DIED.

402
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,000
MANY OF US FEEL
WE SHOULD RETURN TO
ENGLAND THIS VERY MONTH.

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN HELP US?

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
THIS LAND IS THE HOME
OF MY PEOPLE.

405
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I AM THE LAST
OF OUR TRIBE.

406
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
I WISH TO REMAIN HERE

407
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
IF YOU SO WISH IT, TOO.

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,500
LINUS,
IT'S A MIRACLE!

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
LET'S HOPE SO,
CHARLIE BROWN.

410
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
THROUGHOUT MARCH AND APRIL,

411
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
SQUANTO TEACHES
THE PILGRIMS

412
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
THE HERITAGE
OF HIS FATHERS.

413
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO PLANT MAIZE,

414
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,000
AND WE WILL START
BY CATCHING SOME FISH.

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
BUT WHAT DO FISH HAVE
TO DO WITH PLANTING CORN?

416
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR

417
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
THAT THE FISH
SWIM UPSTREAM.

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
LOOK, LINUS.

419
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
HUNDREDS OF FISH.

420
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,000
HA HA.

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THEY ARE CALLED ALEWIVES.

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
WHAT ABOUT
THE CORN PLANTING?

423
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
FIRST WE WILL CATCH THEM,
AND THEN I WILL SHOW YOU.

424
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

425
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,000
ABOUT THE BEST TIME
TO PLANT CORN?

426
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,600
YOU SAID WE SHOULD
PLANT THE CORN

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,600
WHEN THE OAK LEAVES
ARE THE SIZE OF A MOUSE'S EAR.

428
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
IT IS TIME TO PLANT.

429
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,600
NOW WE'LL DIG THE EARTH
INTO 6-FOOT SQUARES

430
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,100
AND HEAP THE EARTH
INTO SMALL HILLS.

431
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,600
PUT IN TWO OR THREE
KERNELS OF CORN
IN EACH HILL.

432
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,100
AND NOW...

433
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,600
WE PLACE THE FISH
AROUND THE SEED.

434
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
WE DO?

435
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,600
WE CALL THIS FOOD
FOR THE PLANTS.

436
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,100
IT MAKES
THE SOIL BETTER.

437
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,600
THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
PASSED QUICKLY.

438
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
THERE ARE NO MORE DEATHS.

439
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
SEVEN MORE ONE-ROOM HOMES
ARE COMPLETED.

440
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,600
MANY MONTHS BEFORE,

441
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
SAMOSET AND SQUANTO

442
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,100
HAD INTRODUCED
THE PILGRIMS

443
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,600
TO THE GREAT
INDIAN CHIEF MASSASOIT

OF THE REGION.

CHIEF MASSASOIT
AND THE PILGRIMS

446
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
SIGNED A TREATY
OF FRIENDSHIP

447

AND OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE,

448

A TREATY THAT WILL LAST
FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY.

449

AND FINALLY,
IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER,

450
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,100
THE MOST BOUNTIFUL HARVEST

HAD EVER SEEN.

[PLAYINGTHE PEANUTS THEME]

A FEW OF YOUR

THAT I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND.
