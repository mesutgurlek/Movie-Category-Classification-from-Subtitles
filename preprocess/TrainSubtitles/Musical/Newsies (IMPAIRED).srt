We got 'em, Cowboy

1850
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:18,095

Look at me
I'm the king of New York

1858
01:57:18,906 --> 01:57:21,533
Suddenly I'm respectable

1859
01:57:21,743 --> 01:57:24,536
Staring right at you
Lousy with stature

1860
01:57:24,746 --> 01:57:29,875
Nobbing with all the muckety mucks
I'm blowing my dough and going deluxe

1861
01:57:30,084 --> 01:57:32,794
Then there I be, ain't I pretty?

1862
01:57:33,004 --> 01:57:37,382
It's my city
I'm the king of New York

Holy cow, it's a miracle

1866
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:06,411
Pulitzer's crying
Weasel, he's dying

1867
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:08,955
Flashpots are shooting
Bright as the sun

1868
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:11,666
I'm one highfalutin son of a gun

1869
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,711
Don't ask me how fortune found me

1870
01:58:14,921 --> 01:58:17,631
Fate just crowned me
I'm the king of New York

1871
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,718
Victory, front page story
Guts and glory

And The World will learn

1876
02:00:40,274 --> 02:00:44,861
And The World will wonder
How we made the tables turn

1877
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:49,741
And The World will see
That we had to choose

1878
02:00:49,951 --> 02:00:54,663
That the things we do today
Will be tomorrow's news

1879
02:00:54,872 --> 02:00:59,626
And the old will fall
And the young stand tall

1880

And finally know
