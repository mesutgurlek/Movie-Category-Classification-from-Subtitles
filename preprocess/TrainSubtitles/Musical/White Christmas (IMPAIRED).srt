- Yeah.

159
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,867
- Hello, honey. Hi.
- Hi.

- Yeah.

On stage, girls! On stage. Finale.

Albert, did you get the notice drawn up?

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,209
- Yes, sir. Show lays off tonight.
- Good boy.

165
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,211
Cast and crew get ten days off with pay.

166
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,173
Gee, they'll go wild. Nicest Christmas
present anybody ever had.

167
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,966
Well, they deserve it.
You got the tickets for New York?

168
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,718
Well, a little rough
for the holiday traffic,

169
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,762
but I pulled a few strings,
got you and Mr. Davis on the 1 :00 train.

170
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,055
- Tickets are on the way over.
- Good enough.

171
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,057
- Put that on the bulletin board.
- Sign this, Bob.

172
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,726
OK. Say, if you want us
for anything in New York,

173
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,728
we'll be at Radio City.
We'll be rehearsing there

174
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,229
- for the Ed Harrison Television Show.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,064
Too bad you and Mr. Davis
couldn't get a little rest.

176
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,733
Oh, man,
I wasn't about to turn this down.

177
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,152
This is a great big, fat plug
for the show.

178
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,904
- Bring the tickets when they come.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,573
- Edna, the light of my life!
- [Davis] Bob?

180
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,283
Can I see you a minute?

181
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,203
- You know Doris, friend of Rita's.
- Another one, huh?

182
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,581
- How do you do?
- Mutual, I'm sure.

183
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,584
I thought before train time,
we'd get a bite to eat

184
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,212
- and have a few laughs or something.
- No, I can't make it.

185
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,672
I'm afraid you can't either.
We got some business to take care of.

186
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,758
- What kind of business?
- We got to go look at an act.

187
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,802
- Look at an act?
- Some other time, I hope?

188
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,140
Well, I like that! Without so much
as a "Kiss my foot" or "Have an apple!"

189
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,809
That does it. That's the last time
I'm gonna dig up a date for him.

190
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,103
And from now on,
you can do your dirty work yourself.

191
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,773
Yeah, well, excuse me one minute,
will you, kids?

192
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,693
Wallace, I think it's time
you and I had a little talk.

193
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,363
Yeah, it's a good idea, buster.
If you don't mind, I'll lead off.

194
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,114
- Now, wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.

195
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,991
You know something,
for about three months now,

196
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,494
you've been clumsily trying
to entangle me with some female.

197
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,996
- All I'm trying to do...
- Fat ones, tall ones, thin ones.

198
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,290
Doesn't make any difference,
as long as they're wearing skirts,

199
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,126
a little mascara and still breathing,
you ran them at me.

200
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,461
Believe me, it's for your own good.

201
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,630
- For my own good?
- Yeah. Let's face it, Bob,

202
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,049
- you're a lonely, miserable man.
- What?

203
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,636
And you're unhappy, too,
and when you're unhappy, I'm unhappy.

204
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,056
After all, I feel a strong sense
of responsibility to you, Bob,

205
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,977
- ever since the day I...
- Not again with that life-saving bit.

206
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,564
- Well, if you'd rather forget it...
- How can I? You won't let me.

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,483
Since you saved my life,
you decided you had the right to run it.

208
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,902
You've ootzed me along
every step of the way.

209
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,154
You've hammered, drove,
pushed, shoved.

210
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,614
And if that wasn't enough,

211
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,033
you'd look at me
with those great big cow eyes of yours,

212
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,703
point at that phony arm,
and I'd melt and go along!

213
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,746
- I don't expect any gratitude.
- You're gonna get it.

214
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,665
We did great, and I'm grateful.

215
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,085
So, thank you. Thank you, Phil Davis,
from the bottom of my heart.

216
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,670
Now, will you let
the rest of my life alone?

217
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,046
- No, I won't.
- Well, why not?

218
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,299
Because you're a miserable,
lonely, unhappy man.

219
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,342
You're whacky. I'm a very happy man.

220
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,011
Well, then, you're happy
for the wrong reasons.

221
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,806
And that's the same as being lonely
and miserable, except it's worse.

222
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,225
You know something, you're off
your nut about a mile and a half.

223
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,643
I've got everything in life I want.

224
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,562
- I'm off my nut a mile and a half.
- At least.

225
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,772
You've got everything you want
except the most important thing.

226
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,858
- What's this?
- A girl.

227
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, I'll get around to that
one of these days.

228
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,780
My dear partner,
when what's left of you

229
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,159
gets around to what's left to be gotten,
what's left to be gotten won't be worth

230
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,244
getting whatever it is you've got left.

231
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,622
When I figure out what that means,
I'll come up with a crushing reply.

232
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,125
- What's back all this, anyway?
- Nothing. Only your happiness.

233
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,210
- My happiness?
- Yeah.

234
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,380
You know, when you get an idea that's
for my sole and ultimate happiness,

235
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,633
there's always lurking behind it
a little angle for you.

236
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,551
- Now, what is it?
- Do you really want to know?

237
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,511
- Yes, I really want to know.
- All right, I'll really tell you.

238
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,721
Then lay it on me, will you?

239
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,098
Ever since the day we became
producers, you were a changed man.

240
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,601
You've gone absolutely berserk
with work.

241
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,229
The strange thing is you liked it.
You like being Rodgers & Hammerstein.

242
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,565
- It was your idea, you know? Yeah.
- Well, sure it was my idea.

243
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,692
But I didn't think
I was going to create a Frankenstein.

244
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,070
From that day on, I haven't had
one minute I could call my own.

245
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,655
What do you want me to do about it?

246
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,908
I want you to get married.
I want you to have nine children.

247
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,912
And if you only spend five minutes
a day with each kid, that's 45 minutes,

248
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,624
and I'd at least have time to go out
and get a massage or something.

249
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,959
You don't expect me to get serious
with the kind of characters

250
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,671
- you and Rita have been throwing at me.
- There've been some nice girls, too.

251
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,132
Yeah, yeah. Like that nuclear scientist
we just met out in the hall.

252
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,262
All right. They didn't go to college.
They didn't go to Smith.

253
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,182
Go to Smith? She couldn't even spell it.

254
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,978
That's very funny. [chuckles]
The crooner is now becoming the comic.

255
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,525
Phil, let me tell you something.

256
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,612
There's a lot of sense in what you say,
and I have to admit it.

257
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,532
But the kind of girls
you and I meet in this business,

258
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,744
they're young and they're ambitious.
They're full of their own careers.

259
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,915
Not interested in getting married,
settling down, raising a family.

260
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,085
That's funny, Bob. I never heard you
open up like that before.

261
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,421
Someday, the right girl
is gonna come along,

262
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,923
and if she'll have me,
we'll get married. We'll settle down.

263
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,134
We'll start having
those nine kids for you.

264
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,511
Forty-five minutes going to be enough?

265
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,805
- If I need any more, I'll tell you.
- [knocking on door]

266
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,014
Come in!

267
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,642
Your railroad tickets, sir.
Drawing Room A, Car 207.

268
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,978
- Thanks. Grab those, will you, Phil?
- Here.

269
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,896
We'll go right over to the station
from Novello's

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,607
- after we audition this act.
- What kind of an act is it?

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,444
- It's a sister act.
- We don't need any sister act.

272
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
What are we wasting time for?

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,281
Well, I got a letter from Benny Haynes.
They're his sisters.

274
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,700
Do you remember Benny Haynes,
the old mess sergeant?

275
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,827
Freckle-Face Haynes,
the dog-faced boy?

276
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,495
- That's the kid. Yeah.
- He's got sisters?

277
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,372
- Claims he's got them.
- Come on now.

278
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,916
How can a guy that ugly
have the nerve to have sisters?

279
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
Very brave parents, I guess.

280
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,336
- Bob, will you do me one favor?
- What's that?

281
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,464
Give me one reason, one good reason,

282
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,924
why we should spend
our last two hours in Florida

283
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,511
looking at the sisters of Freckle-Face
Haynes, the dog-faced boy.

284
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,347
Let's just say we're doing it
for a pal in the Army.

285
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,225
Well, it's not good, but it's a reason.

286
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,731
- [indistinct chatter]
- [slow jazz plays]

287
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,822
- Hey, Novello.
- Good evening, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Davis.

288
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,449
Say, have the Haynes Sisters
been on yet?

289
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,118
No, sir, not yet.
They'll be on in about 1 5 minutes.

290
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,537
- Tell them we're here, will you?
- Certainly, Mr. Wallace.

291
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,707
Luigi, show these gentlemen
to their table.

292
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,671
This is ridiculous. We could have
been out with Doris and Rita

293
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,881
having some laughs.

294
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,759
Phil, when are you gonna learn
girls like that are a dime a dozen?

295
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,929
Please, don't quote me the price
when I haven't got the time.

296
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,141
- [woman] Who is it?
- It's me. Novello.

297
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,272
Bob Wallace and Phil Davis
are out front to catch your act.

298
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,733
- Wallace and Davis?
- They got a letter from your brother.

299
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,902
He asked them to take a look
and give you some advice.

300
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,071
Come on now. You'd better hurry.

301
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:20,367
Isn't that fabulous?
Wallace and Davis here to see us.

302
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,910
Yeah, fabulous.

303
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,622
Who'd have thought that of Benny, huh?
What a brother!

304
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,251
- What a sweet, wonderful guy!
- Amazing.

305
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,629
I wonder whatever gave him the idea.

306
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,673
Well, he probably knew we were here,
you know,

307
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,883
and that they were in town
with the big show.

308
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,552
He probably figured

309
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,264
we were too shy to take advantage
of an old Army friendship to call...

310
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,891
Judy, did you read Mother's letter
this morning?

311
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,770
- No. Why?
- Benny's got a job in Alaska.

312
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,773
He's been out of the country
for three months.

313
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,775
Oh? Oh...

314
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,111
Well, he could have written from Alaska.

315
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,029
But he didn't, did he?

316
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,285
- Oh, he might have.
- Judy, why did you write the letter?

317
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,954
Oh... Well...

318
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,624
Because it's good business.
You can't leave everything up to fate.

319
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,753
Just like honesty needs a little plus,
fate needs a little push.

320
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,922
Judy, next time,
will you talk to me first

321
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,925
before you push us and plus us
right out of show business?

322
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,927
You needn't sound so patronizing.

323
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,598
You sound just like a mother hen
looking after a little chick.

324
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,100
Well, little chick needs
plenty of looking after.

325
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,185
Until someone else comes along
who can do it better,

326
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,063
mother hen's gonna stick pretty close
to the coop.

327
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,774

There, that's cozier, isn't it?
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

364
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,601
Well, I'm Betty,
and this is my sister, Judy.

365
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,312
And you're Phil Davis,
and you're Mr. Wallace.

- Guilty on both counts, I guess.
- Isn't this nice?

367
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,108
Mr. Wallace was just saying
how remarkable it was

368
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,154
that Benny Haynes' sisters
should have eyes... I mean, blue eyes.

369
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,200
- That is, eyes... [laughs]
- Nice out.

370
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,743
That's quite an act you kids have there.

371
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,579
It's a funny thing Benny never told us
there's so much talent in the family.

372
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,039
Well, to be perfectly honest...

373
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,334
Benny didn't want to take advantage
of an old Army friendship.

374
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,088
You know how shy he is,
so modest and retiring.

375
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,300
- It's a family characteristic.
- I have a recent snapshot here.

376
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,593
Oh?

377
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,309
He always was a good-looking kid.

378
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,687
Uh, speaking of families,

379
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,816
uh, I read an article just the other day
about citrus fruit

380
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,568
and its effect on children's teeth.

381
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,824
Are you interested in families
or children

382
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,201
- or things like that, Miss Haynes?
- Yes, I suppose so.

383
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,703
- Oh, man, nix, nix.
- Isn't that amazing?

384
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,455
Imagine a girl in show business today,

385
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,250
wanting to settle down
and raising a family.

386

- It's so refreshing, isn't it?
- Pushing, pushing.

387

- Well, would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

388
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,716
I, for one,
would like a little free advice.

389
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,053
Mr. Wallace, do you have
any suggestions for the act?

390
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,639
No. Just keep plugging away.

391
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,060
Oh. But there must be something.
Should we both be blondes?

392
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,771
Maybe Betty's hair
should go a shade darker?

393
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,942
Or should she maybe change the style?
A little more off the face?

394
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,822
No. I wouldn't change a thing.

395
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,699
[voice cracks] Would you care to dance?

396
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,619
- Don't you think we should discuss...
- Let's say it with music.

397
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,996
All right.

398
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:02,584
Now, promise you won't say anything
important till I get back. Bye, now.

399
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,968
- They look well together, don't they?
- Yes.

400
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,471
Say, I was sure surprised to get
Benny's letter today. I didn't know...

401
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,559
Look, Mr. Wallace, before you
go any further, I must tell you,

402
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,603
you were brought here tonight
under false pretenses.

403
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,189
Benny didn't write the letter,
my sister did.

404
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,356
Judy?

405
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,609
She figured you'd never come
to see us if we asked you,

406
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,195
and you might if Benny did.
As simple as that.

407
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,199
[laughs] How do you like that? Even
little Judy there's got an angle going.

408
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,951
- She didn't mean anything by it...
- You don't have to apologize.

409
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,120
Everybody's got an angle.

410
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,499
- That's a pretty cynical point of view.
- Come, come now, Miss Haynes.

411
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,294
Surely you knew that everybody's got
a little larceny operating in them.

412
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,795
- Didn't you know?
- Just for the record,

413
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
I want you to know that
my sister and I don't play angles.

414
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,467
Well, if that letter wasn't an angle,
I'd like to know what it was.

415
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,637
- I don't like your whole inferences.
- I've got no squawks, no beefs.

416
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,597
The kid played a percentage,
it worked and we're here.

417
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,225
Let's not make a whole
big mish-mosh out of it, huh?

418
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,772
- They're getting along just fine.
- And so quickly, too.

419
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Isn't that nice?

420
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,067
All I'm saying is, when you've
been around show business

421
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,570
as long as I have, you just get used
to people working angles, that's all.

422
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,822
Mr. Wallace, as the chance
of our seeing each other again

423
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,327
is extremely remote, I don't think it's
important for us to go on arguing.

424
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,122
- [laughs] Well, I'll drink to that.
- Be my guest.

425
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,003
Hey, if this keeps up, we'll practically
be in-laws before the dance is over.

426
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,047
Well, I don't mind, if you don't.

427
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,424
Yeah, it's too bad
we're leaving town tonight.

428
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,887
That is a shame,
but we're leaving tomorrow, anyway.

- Vermont, huh?

431
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,897
Vermont should be beautiful this time
of the year, with all that snow.

- Yeah... You know something?
- What?

433

Vermont should be beautiful
this time of year.

434
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,826
- All that snow.
- That's what I just said.

We seem to be getting a little mixed up.

- Maybe it's the music.
- Maybe it isn't only the music.

Our tickets aren't good until tomorrow.

But you've got to get out tonight.

take these. Now, get going. Come on.

We can't take your tickets.
What will Mr. Wallace think?

499
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,654
Well, honey, it was his idea.
Now, will you please get going?

500
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,448
- His idea? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,699
He won't think
it's some kind of an angle?

502
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:36,078
I told you it was his idea.
Now, come on. Upsy-daisy. Here we go!

That's right.

We'll pay you back.
Where can we reach you?

you please go? The taxi is coming.

508

- Bye, Phil.

- Here.
- Here.

- Bye, now.

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,397
And I can't stall him much longer.

512

Hey, whatever happened
to paying the $200?

513
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,943
Well, we've got to give the girls
five or ten minutes' start.

514
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,111
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

515
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,197
If you could just stall him
for just a few minutes.

516
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll try, but he's eating me
out of business already.

- OK.

Listen, Sheriff, I haven't got all night
to wait here while you eat free food.

Now, we agreed to let them finish
their show first.

526
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:40,643

00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,754
We are. I mean, we should.
It'll do us a lot of good, Bob,

594
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,841
all that snow and the fir trees
and the clean fresh air and... Ooh!

595
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,384
Great change of pace,
just what we need.

596
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:46,764
- Two tickets to New York.
- It's still $97.24 though.

597
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,101
- OK, buster, get it out. Come on.
- Uh, I don't seem to have any cash.

598
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,855
What did you do with that?
Leave it in your snood? Here.

599
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,692
- $97.24.
- OK. There you are.

600
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,654
- Where are you going?
- It's for breakfast.

601
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,530
- Breakfast! Get some peanuts.
- All right.

602
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,907
- Club car's straight ahead.
- OK.

603
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,533
Excuse me, gentlemen.

604
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,203
I certainly don't get this.
We had space in our names.

605
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,829
They're not allowed to give it away
to somebody else.

606
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,332
Well, with the holiday rush and all
there could have been a slip-up.

607
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
- Whoop!
- [Judy screams]

608
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,212
- Excuse me.
- The club car's in there, I think.

[train whistle blows]

00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,887
Well, this is great, just great.

611
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,556
We've paid for our tickets twice,
and now we've got to sit up all night.

612
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,891
What are you screaming about?

613
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,185
If we took a plane,
we'd be sitting up all night.

614
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,354
We're not taking a plane.
We're taking a train,

615
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,648
a train on which we had tickets.

616
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,402
Tickets for a drawing room with
two nice, warm, soft comfortable beds,

617
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,071
where, at this very moment, two...

618
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,035
Oh, no, you wouldn't do this to me.

619
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,540
- Wouldn't do what?
- After you dressed me up like a dame,

620
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,833
you get me involved with a sheriff.

621
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,004
I almost lose my life
trying to catch a train. I know...

622
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:06,218
I just know on top of all that, you
wouldn't take away my nice warm bed

623
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,680
and let me spend the night
out here in a drafty old club car.

624
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,600
You wouldn't do this to old Bob,
would you?

625
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
Whatever are you talking about?

626
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,024
I'm going down there to Drawing
Room A, I'm gonna open up that door,

627
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,360
and if I find those two Haynes sisters
there, I'm gonna take them by the hair

628
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,779
and with these two hands I'm...

629
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,699
Oh, Mr. Wallace,
how can we ever thank you?

630
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,951
It was really so sweet
and generous of you.

631
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,662
Mr. Davis told us you insisted
on giving us the tickets,

632
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,622
and, well, it was just wonderful of you.

633
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,501
Wasn't there something you... [clears
throat] wanted to say to the girls?

634
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,465
Yeah. [clears throat] Won't you have
a drink or a sandwich or something?

635
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,799
- Let's sit down.
- Yeah, sit down.

636
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,176
Can we have some club sandwiches?

637
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,762
- I'd like lemonade, please.
- I'll have a malt, please.

638
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:54,349
- We're emceeing the joint.

[all chattering indistinctly]

00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,563
Tell me, where are you kids
going to stay in New York?

641
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,024
We're not staying in New York.
We're booked for over the holidays.

642
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,235
- Where?
- The Columbia Inn, Pine Tree, Vermont.

643
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,993
Oh, well, that sounds very Vermont-y.

644
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,870
Should be beautiful this time
of the year in Vermont,

645
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,289
- all that snow and everything.
- Yeah, yeah, beautiful.

646
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,375
The fir trees, the clean pine air. Brr!

647
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,045
- Very beautiful. Just what we need.
- Uh-huh.

648
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,756
Oh, wonderful. Could you
come up for a couple of days?

649
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,174
Well, I don't know...

650
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,843
I wish you could.
It would be awfully nice.

651

Miss Haynes,
if you're ever under a falling building

652

and somebody runs up
and offers to pick you up

We're not here as guests.
We're the Haynes Sisters.

742
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,801
- Oh.
- My friend and I are guests.

743
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,052
We came up for the snow.

744
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,514
- Where are you keeping it?
- Well, we take it in during the day.

745
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,350
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
we won't be able to use you.

746
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,644
We'll pay you the half salary
for canceling.

747
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,563
Well, are things really that bad?

748
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,732
We're using the ski tow
to hang the wash on.

749
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,359
You aren't gonna stay either, are you?

750
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:23,947
Well, if the girls are leaving,
I'll just get the luggage here.

751
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,158
Thank you, sir.

752
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,993
General Waverly!

753
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,121
- Sir.
- At ease.

754
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,293
- How are you, Captain?
- I'm fine, General, but...

755
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,379
We just try to keep
the "general" part quiet.

756
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,340
Why? Begging your pardon, sir.

757
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,719
Well, to put it in one sentence,

758
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:49,723
people don't expect a major general
to carry firewood.

759
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,392
Bob, I was just thinking... Hi. I was...

760
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,104
Private Davis, sir.

761
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,273
At ease, Davis.

762
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,652
General Waverly! A janitor!

763
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,323
- Never thought I'd make it, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir. Sir.

764
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,783
You could do anything
you put your mind to, sir.

765
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,578
But, uh, a janitor!

766
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:15,749
Matter of fact, it's worse than that.
I own this hotel.

767
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:19,753
- A landlord.
- He got it in a shrewd business move.

768
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,506
If I, uh, start the introductions,

769
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,218
- can I get to meet these young ladies?
- Why, sure.

770
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,305
My housekeeper, Miss Emma Allen.
My granddaughter, Susan Waverly.

771
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,473
- Susan.
- Hello.

772
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,392
- We're the Haynes Sisters.
- Your floor show.

773
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,562
Don't worry, I've already told them
we'd have to cancel.

774
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,607
Why? We have a floor, haven't we?

775
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,110
Last time I looked.
But who are they gonna sing to?

776
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,696
Well, even if it's only to you and me,
it'll be well worth it.

777
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,283
Besides, there'll be six inches of snow
tonight. We'll be full up tomorrow.

778
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,910
Is that the weather forecast?

779
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,664
No, but if there was one thing I learned
in the Army, it was to be positive,

780
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,209
especially when you don't know
what you're talking about.

781
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,379
General Waverly, we want you to know
that you needn't feel obligated.

782
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:06,049
- I mean, since there's no snow...
- Nonsense. We've made a contract.

783
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,678
Your first performance
is tonight at 8:00.

784
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,056
- Be there or I'll sue!
- Here.

785
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,812
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm on KP.

786
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,647
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

[applause]

800
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,078
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

801
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,913
You know what?
I think Bob and I could give you

802
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,207
some pointers on that Sister number.

803
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,461
- I don't like the wardrobe.
- But it's so purdy.

804
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:29,007
Isn't this awful? It's like
taking money under false pretenses.

805
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,926
Emma, couldn't you talk him into
letting us work for half salary?

806
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,888
Not Light Horse Harry.
"Advance, advance, never retreat."

807
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,390
- He's advancing into bankruptcy.
- How deep's he in here?

808
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,517
He sunk everything,
his pension, his life savings,

809
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,227
everything in remodeling this place!

810
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,939
It used to be a gristmill and a barn.
Now, it's a Tyrolean haunted house.

811
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,275
Well, eat hearty!

812
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,070
There ought to be
something we can do about it.

813
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,530
Well, there is. We're going
to New York in the morning.

814
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,574
- New York?
- But you just got here!

815
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,409
We got some connections there,
some good ones.

816
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,911
We can dig him up a spot somewhere.

817
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,830
Yeah, but that takes too long.
The problem is here, now.

818
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,083
We've got to stay up here
and dream up some way

819
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,709
of getting people
to come into this place.

820
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,253
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

821
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,173
It should be something unusual,
some kind of a novelty...

822
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,218
Tell me, brainstorm, what do you think
would be a novelty up here in Vermont?

823
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,137
Who knows?
Maybe we can dig up a Democrat?

824
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,431
- They'd stone him!
- [laughter]

825
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,893
Well, if you ask me, what this place
really needs is a dynamite act.

826
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,938
Now, you're talking.
If we could get something really big.

827
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,399
- Something sock, like...
- Like Wallace and Davis.

828
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,776
No, honey, you couldn't get them.
They're too big.

829
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,487
Wait a minute. Wallace and Davis.
How about that, Bob?

830
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:36,157
We could do our old nightclub act,
fit the girls in here and there.

831
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,868
- Might be wonderful. What do you say?
- I think you got something.

832
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,454
It's a great idea.
It's half a great idea, anyhow.

833
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,125
Will you excuse me? Young lady,
get me the New York operator.

834
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,419
OK, Mr. Wallace. This way.

835
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,966
I don't know what he's up to,
but he's got that

836
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,843
Rodgers & Hammerstein look again.

837
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,513
- Is that bad?
- Not bad, but always expensive.

838
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,849
Excuse me.

839
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,647
[laughs] I know it sounds crazy, Al,
but you're working for crazy people.

840
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,859
Now, get this straight. I want
the whole show up here in three days.

841
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,487
Yeah, the whole show. Sets, costumes
and all the cast you can round up.

842
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,864
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this gonna cost?

843
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,491
Everybody gets an extra week's pay
and you get a bonus, Al.

844
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,161
- What's this gonna cost?
- We open Christmas Eve.

845
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:27,125
- The tab! How much?
- Al, what's this gonna set us back?

846
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,045
- Wow!
- How much is "wow"?

847
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,048
Well, OK, Al, do the best you can.
Good luck.

848
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,093
- How much is "wow"?
- We got a big job, buster, a big job.

849
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,387
Whatever acts we can't get,
we fill in with the Haynes Sisters.

850
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:44,225
- How much is "wow"?
- Right in between "ouch" and "boing."

851
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,978
- Wow! I'm right behind you.
- Come along.

852
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,691
I won't tell the general,
you do it your own way,

853
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,527
but I think bringing your show up here
is just one of the nicest...

854
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,737
How did you know?

855
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,864
Well, like any decent,
self-respecting housekeeper,

856
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,242
I listen in on the other phone.
I just don't know what to say.

857
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,827
Mmm!

858
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,372
- He thought of it.
- Well, it was a lovely thought.

859
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,544
- Wow!
- Let's get hold of yourself. Come on.

860
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,047
- [blowing]
- [indistinct chattering]

861
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,883
Hurry up, kids. Check in the lobby
for your room numbers.

862
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,968
Put your bags backstage.

863
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,390
Everybody grab his own suitcases.
Let's not get mixed up now.

864
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,976
The wardrobe trunk's in the hall.

865
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,647
Let's go, let's go, we got to get
started hanging those drapes.

866
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,483
All right, kids,
find your rooms, get settled.

867
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,237
Get your rehearsal costumes on. We
start rehearsals right after breakfast.

868
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,660
I still don't understand it. You mean
you brought your whole show up here?

869
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,913
- Well, most of it, sir.
- Well, it's still not clear to me. Why?

870
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,666
Well, we have this show. Now,
we have to close down for the holidays,

871
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,376
lay the cast off, and business is bad...

872
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,128
I know about business being bad. Go on.

873
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,382
Well, we figured
since we had a chance to rehearse,

874
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,133
we might as well do
our rehearsing up here.

875
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,426
Why here?

876
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,262
Well, you've got this nice
big empty ski lodge,

877
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,139
and the minute Phil and I saw it, we
decided it was ideal. Didn't we, Phil?

878
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,142
That's right, Bob. Ideal.
That's exactly the word we used, too.

879
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,437
Ideal. We looked at this big ski lodge
and we said, "Isn't it ideal?

880
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,523
- Absolutely ideal." Didn't we?
- Ideal.

881
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,900
We've established the fact
the lodge is ideal.

882
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,945
And it gives us a chance, you see,
sir, to test new material.

883
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,196
- On what?
- On the audience.

884
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,156
We use them like guinea pigs.

885
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,827
Pigs, we can get for you.
I'm not so sure about people.

886
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,704
Well, uh, with all due modesty, sir,

887
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,790
Wallace and Davis never had

- Morning, General.

Looks like you're on active duty.

1079
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,457
Yeah, Emma drafted me for a few chores.

1080
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,377
And I picked up the handbills
for the new show.

1081
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:31,130
- Oh?
- Look pretty good, huh?

1082
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:35,634
Well, that ought to bring in
quite a few guinea pigs.

1083
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,178
You ever hook up with the fellows
in the horseshoe game?

1084
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:41,223
No. No, I'm a little too young
for that sort of thing.

1085
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,434
Figure a fellow ought to hold off
on horseshoes

about show business and guinea pigs,

1091
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,825
but in case you and Phil
are worried about the welfare

1092
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,786
of a certain Vermont innkeeper,
you needn't be.

1093
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:07,332
- His inn-keeping days are numbered.
- I wouldn't say that.

1094

The percentage is gonna catch up
with the weatherman one of these days.

1095
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,338
I've been watching those clouds,
and there's snow in them.

1096
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,341
Those are cumulus clouds,
elevation 7,000 feet.

1097
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,636

if it snowed overnight.

01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,806
I want to tell you something
I haven't even told the womenfolk.

- I'm going back in the Army.
- Really?

- I've applied for active duty.
- Well, that's wonderful news, sir.

1101

I got an idea they may try to palm off
one of those desk jobs on me,

1102
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,776
but they'd better not.

there's a letter for you, General.

01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:49,041
Yeah. Here it is, from Washington, too.

learn this game of horseshoes.
Now, would it?

Look, why don't you go all out?
Put the whole show on TV?

1189
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,637
I'll come up there myself,
bring the camera, the crew, the works.

1190
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:03,016
- Thanks, Ed, but that's not the idea.
- Well, it's a great idea.

1191
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,938
Put the show on the network
right from Pine Tree. Play it up big.

1192
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,481
A real Christmas Eve show,

1193
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:12,692
all about how you're playing
Santa Claus to the old man, you know.

1194
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,986
Plenty of schmaltz, lots of heart.

1195
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:18,156
Would be worth over $100,000
in free advertising for you and Phil.

1196
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,158
And, yeah,
we'll put the old boy on himself,

1197
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,870
you know, the forgotten-man angle.
Tear their hearts out.

1198
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,165
Here's the laundry, Emma.

1199
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,252
I'm sorry, Ed. Sorry, but that's out.

1200
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,964
We're not commercializing
on the old man's hard luck. No chance.

1201
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,093
All I want to do is go on your show
and make a little pitch. OK?

1202
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,555
Wonderful. Wonderful.
See you Sunday night then. Bye.

1203
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,934
- Take it upstairs, Susan.
- All right.

1204
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:54,859
Emma?

1205
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,657
- Oh. Was there a telegram for me?
- What?

1206
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:04,869
Oh, yeah! Just an offer
from the Carousel Club in New York,

1207
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,371
anytime you and Judy are available.

1208
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,540
What's your technique?
Holding them up to the light?

1209
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:12,919
- That's for amateurs. I use steam.
- You're quite a pro.

1210
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,463
I'm thinking of turning in my uniform.

1211
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,173
Stick your nose
in other people's business

1212
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,384
and eventually you find out things
you wish you hadn't.

1213
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,386
Anything specific?

1214
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,723
Did you know the boys are planning
to put this whole show on television?

1215
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,725
- Television?
- Right from here, on Christmas Eve.

1216
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,103
I just heard Bob fix it with
Ed Harrison. It's a big deal.

1217
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,188
Real schmaltz, I think they called it.

1218
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,692
- They're even gonna put the general on.
- I just can't believe it.

1219
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,528
That'll make him a pathetic figure
from coast to coast.

1220
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,072
What's it gonna do to his pride?

1221
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,075
Of course, you know it means
over $200,000 worth of free publicity

1222
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,746
- for Davis and Wallace.
- Emma, that's a terrible thing to say.

1223
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,540
I didn't say it. Bob Wallace said it.
I just heard him.

1224
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,753
No. Bob wouldn't be involved in a thing
like that. I'm sure you're wrong.

1225
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,547
Well, if I am, I'll resign as president
of the New England chapter

1226
01:17:57,715 --> 01:17:59,424
- of Busybodies Anonymous.
- [phone buzzing]

1227
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,676
Oh, dear, my nerves. It's the phone.

1228
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,806
[humming] Hi, Betty.
Have you seen Bob?

1229
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,184
Do you know whether he made that
phone call to New York or not, Emma?

1230
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,436
- I understand he did.
- Oh, good.

1231
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,979
I hear that television's
entered the picture.

1232
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,607
- Then he worked it out, huh?
- Beautifully.

1233
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:18,610
- It's a great, little angle, isn't it?
- Brilliant.

1234
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,570
Listen, uh, keep this
under your hat, will you?

1235
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:23,073
We wouldn't want the general
to know about it, because it's...

1236
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,240
I can understand that.

1237
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:28,370
Betty, that was Bob. He's waiting
to rehearse in the dining room.

1238
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,664
- Anything wrong?
- Tell him I'm on the way.

1239
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,043
- Hi, hon. How about some lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

1240
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,754
- But Betty...
- I said I'm not hungry.

1241
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:43,843
- What's with her?
- I'm not sure, but I have an idea.

1242
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,095
I want to think about it.

1243
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,972
Yeah, well, let's think about it over
a sandwich, kid. I'm starving to death.

1244
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,141
- Change the routine...
- That other rehearsal's

1245
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,643
got me crazy. I don't know...

1246
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:54,479
- [indistinct chatter]
- [man] Let's set up the next number.

1247
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,402
[Wallace playing
down-tempo piano music]

1248
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:09,160
Oh, howdy. I was just going over
this Blessings number.

1249
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,831
Something we could do together.
Want to try it from the release?

1250
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,501
♪ When my bankroll is getting small

1251
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,796
♪ I think of when I had none at all

1252
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:23,675
♪ And I fall asleep
counting my blessings

1253
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,971
What's the matter? A bad key for you?

1254
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,681
Look, I don't think
I'm right for this song.

1255
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:32,350
Of course you are. Lays great for you.
Come on, now, let's try it.

1256
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:36,271
- No, I don't think I'm right for it.
- Don't be silly.

1257
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:38,648
What I'm trying to say is
I don't feel like doing this song.

1258
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,402
I don't want to do this song. In fact,
I'm not sure I want to do the show.

1259
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,530
Well, what is this?
You sleep well last night or what?

1260
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,491
I'd rather not discuss last night,
if you don't mind.

1261
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,536
Come now, I admit I was
a little carried away and everything,

1262
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:54,372
but there's no use getting all upset
with just a simple little kiss.

1263
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,499
Nobody signed a contract.

1264
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,418
There's certainly nothing
for you to feel guilty about.

1265
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,463
- Look who's talking about guilt.
- What do you mean by that?

1266
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,717
I mean, you shouldn't mix fairytales
with liverwurst and buttermilk.

1267
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,303
- What did you have for lunch today?
- I didn't have lunch.

1268
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,554
Well, maybe you ought to eat something.

1269
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,931
Why is everybody suddenly
so concerned about my eating habits?

1270
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:16,478
- Why don't people leave me alone...
- Whoa, whoa! Time, time, cut!

1271
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,230
Let's get off the merry-go-round.
If you got something to say, say it.

1272
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:22,817
Otherwise, let's get to work. I got
a lot of details here to take care of.

1273
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:26,404
Well, then, let's just skip all this.
I certainly wouldn't want to interfere

1274
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,907
with the business plans
of the great Wallace and Davis.

1275
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,702
- That's quite a remark.
- I'm sorry. It's the best I can do.

1276
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,288
Look, Betty,
I've got no time for games today.

1277
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,332
Now, are you gonna
sing this song or not?

1278
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,918
- I don't want to sing the song.
- Well, nobody's twisting your arm.

1279
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,795
- Is that all, Mr. Wallace?
- Yes, that's all, Miss Haynes.

1280
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,102
[Davis] Yours ought to be done by now.

1281
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:24,170
- How do you figure that?
- I'm not sure,

1282
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,464
but daylight's beginning to glimmer.

1283
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,926
Last night she couldn't sleep.
Today she won't eat.

1284
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,845
- She's in love.
- If that's love, somebody goofed.

1285
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,306
It's love all right, but she's
deliberately putting up barriers.

1286
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:36,808
I'd bet my bottom dollar on it.

1287
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,810
- Why?
- Because of me.

1288
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,688
She's always felt that she's mother hen
and I'm her little chick.

1289
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,315
She'll never leave the roost
until I'm taken care of.

1290
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,652
- That's funny. Are you sure?
- Oh, I should've known.

1291
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,405
She'll never get involved with anyone
until I'm married

1292
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:55,034
- or engaged or something.
- Well, I guess that's the end of that.

1293
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:59,872
Unless I get myself engaged
or something real fast.

1294
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,125
That's ridiculous.
Even if it made any sense at all,

1295
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:05,003
you're up here in the wilderness.
There's nobody around here.

1296
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,629
Oh, I don't know.

1297
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:10,717
Be realistic. Who could you find up here
to get yourself engaged to?

1298
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:14,137
Well, I suppose it ought
to be someone that I know.

1299
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,597
That always helps.

1300
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,683
- Of course, it's got to be a man.
- That's an absolute must.

1301
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,353
No, no, no. I mean a mature man.
One with talent and experience.

1302
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,022
- Talent, experience...
- One that's witty,

1303
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,524
- gay, charming, attractive.
- Witty, gay, charming, sure.

1304
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,527
Where are you gonna find
such a super man?

1305
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:33,156
- Don't be so modest.
- Honey, fellas like that don't...

1306
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:38,536
- Me?
- Well, you're not exactly Superman,

1307
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,373
- but you're awfully available.
- Yeah, now, don't get any ideas, Judy.

1308
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,668
- I'm not the marrying kind.
- It's just an engagement.

1309
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,630
Yeah, well,
I'm not the engaging kind, either.

1310
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,048
Well, what kind are you?

1311
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,884
Well, I'm more the "I don't mind
pushing my best friend into it,

1312
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,471
but I'm scared stiff when I get
anywhere close to it myself" kind.

1313
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,931
How terrible could it be for a few days?

1314
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:02,727
- You do like me, don't you?
- Sure, I do.

1315
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,021
I mean, I'm not exactly repulsive.

1316
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,273
Of course...
[clears throat] Of course not.

1317
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:12,403
And you do find me gay, amusing,
good company, fun to be with?

1318
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,032
I do, but I feel the same way
about my cocker spaniel.

1319
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:21,371
Well, let's just skip it.
I was only thinking of Betty and Bob.

1320
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,873
Betty and Bob, yeah.

1321
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,251
Look, uh, it would
only be temporary, huh?

1322
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,714
Well, of course. Well,
you don't think I'm the kind of girl

1323
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,258
that goes around throwing myself
at a man, do you?

1324
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,429
Of course not. Nobody thinks that.
Well, look, let me figure this out.

1325
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:42,934
Now, it would only last two or three
weeks at the worst. At the most, I mean.

1326
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,103
Well, of course.

1327
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,272
And, uh, we wouldn't have to
