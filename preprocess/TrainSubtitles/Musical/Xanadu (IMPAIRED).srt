Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.

98
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,489
She never filed a W-2
and she never got a check.

99

she just doesn't exist.

she doesn't exist?

wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.

just jumped into frame.

was on the contact sheets.

Hey, you! Come on! Hold on!

Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back.

00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,011
Sure. If you bring
it back in person.

165

Okay.

181
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,921
I run into this girl
this morning.

182
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,550
Never saw her before in my life.

183
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,724
She kisses me and disappears.

184
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,893
So what's so weird about that?

185
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,311
What's so weird about that is

186
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,107
that 10 minutes later I see her picture
on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.

187
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,604
I mean, that's crazy, right?

188
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,734
Well, if I said it sounded crazy,
would you stop looking for her?

189
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,941
No. Then why ask?

190
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,197
So I'll keep looking for her.

191
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,538
Okay, kid, but take
a tip from me.

192
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,953
What's that?

193

Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.

How you doing, Big Al?

198
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,386
How could I go wrong with the great
paint job you did on my van?

199

Hey, and the chicks love it.

Yeah. It's one of the
finer examples of my work.

201
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,187
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?

202
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,483
East. Where you going? West.

203

Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.

Why shouldn't I believe it?

she really looks.

316
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,212
Now, I've got an office,

317
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,670
I make a lot of money,

318
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,971
and people respond when I call.

319
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,225
That's because I smartened up
and I gave up art.

320
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,223
I think you made
the right decision.

321
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,849
I want you to smarten up, too.

322
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,023
Start doing things the company way,
not the way you want to do them.

323
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,728
But sometimes I see more in these
covers than what's really there.

324
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,029
That's art.

325
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,072
Just paint what
you're told to paint.

326
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,828
If you start making changes, then
other people start making changes.

327
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,244
And before you know it,
you got a lot of people

328
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,821
running around,
doing what they want to do.

329
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,373
That's not a company.
That's chaos.

330
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,953
Now, I want you to hang
some of your precious covers.

331
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:36,007
Pick up the van and hustle your
butt over to the Platinum Palace.

332
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,253
Tuesday's Wednesday.

333
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,988
Hey, clarinet. How you doing?

334
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,574
Hey, what do you say, kid.
What're you doing up there?

335
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,250
Trying to get down.
Grab a hold of the ladder.

336
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,326
Sure.

337
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,583
Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we
might <i>as</i> well introduce ourselves.

338
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,791
Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.

339
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,752
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team.

340
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,514
What you got there?
Oh, this is a real gem.

341
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,966
I've been waiting months for it.

342
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,343
Ah, Glenn Miller.

343
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,766
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time.

344
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,310
So was Beethoven,
but I know who he is.

345
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,979
Do you like Glenn Miller?

346
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,056
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.

347
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,482
I love Glenn Miller.

348
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,739
(WHISTLES)

349
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,484
This place is incredible.

350
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,614
It belonged to a silent
movie star.

351
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,324
(CHUCKLES) Obviously, they did
things big in those days.

352
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,124
What do you do
with all this space?

353
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,496
Nothing really.

354
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,829
But I love this room because it
makes my records sound great.

355
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,165
Well, I've only got
one thing to say.

356
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,795
Remember, I gave you
some popcorn.

357
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,549
(LAUGHING) Okay. But you came
here to listen to Glenn Miller.

358
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,097
So, all set up. There he goes.

359
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,307
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.

360
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,512
Hey, Danny, that's you.

361
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,847
Yeah.

362
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,272
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...

363
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,020
Listen.

364
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,697
<i>(PLAYING CLARINET)</i>

365
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,864
That's me.

366
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,114
Hey, that's all right.
You got any more surprises?

367
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,699
This is what I call
my memorabilia room.

368
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,534
Sort of the story
of Danny McGuire.

369
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,086
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?

370
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,381
Yeah. We used to all
hang out together.

371
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,709
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band

372
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,045
and my own club
on West 51 st Street.

373
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,802
It was small and jam-packed,

374
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,975
but everybody who was in town
would drop by.

375
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,520
Sometimes they'd sit in
for a set or two.

376
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,682
Well, now it's a parking lot.

377
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,608
Why did you give it up?

378
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,937
Oh, it was one of those
turning points

379
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,318
where you turn
in the wrong direction.

380
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,779
It was a girl.

381
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,735
The girl on the album.

382
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,279
Yeah.

383
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,745
The singer with the band.

384
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,454
When she left,
I figured she'd be back,

385
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,003
and I wasn't about
to run after her, right?

386
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,254
(CHUCKLES)

387
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,677
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.

388
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,630
Never saw her again.

389
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,968
After that, the heart went
out of my music.

390
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,803
I went into the family
construction business

391
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,685
and became what
they call comfortable.

392
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,142
Three cheers for comfort.

393
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,943
You ever think about
going back into music?

394
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,864
No. Only about
20 or 30 times a day.

395
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,486
(LAUGHS)

396
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,613
So, you gonna do it?

397
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,491
Well, I can't play clarinet
like I did in the old days.

398
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,541
But you know something, kid? I'd
love to open up another joint again.

399
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,459
Why don't you?

400
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,958
I've had real estate agents
looking for two years.

401
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,789
They can't find the right place.

402
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,591
Well, if it's just a place you
want, that seems pretty easy.

403
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,011
No, it's not easy. It's kind
of like falling in love.

404
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,386
You gotta feel a special
attachment, a special...

405
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,842
Like you and your friend...
Kira.

406
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,142
Kira.

407
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,308
Hey, why don't you help me look?

408
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,231
Maybe you can come up
with something.

409
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,353
Me?

410
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,025
Sure. You've got a good eye.

411
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,728
Stranger things have happened.

412
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,154
Yeah, I guess they have.

413
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,776
(CHUCKLES)

414
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,071
Listen, I gotta go.
I understand.

415
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,152
I'll let myself out? Sure.

416
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,955
So long. See you around.

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,586
KIRA: Hello. Hey!

476
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,172
Oh, I'm sorry.

477
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,137
You scared the hell out of me.

478
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,765
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet.

479
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,345
How long you been
standing there?

480
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,805
Just a few seconds.

481
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,141
Should I go? Oh, no, stay.

482
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,976
You paint beautifully.

483
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,689
This is the first time I've cared about
what I've painted in a long time.

484
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,239
That's a shame.

485
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,434
It must be frustrating to
waste your talents on things

486
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,577
that don't really matter to you.

487
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,995
Yeah.

488
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,916
I met a guy the other day. He told
me I should take long lunch hours.

489
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,243
A guy?

490
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,749
Yeah. Someone I met
at the beach.

491
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,627
He's got this crazy idea
he wants to build a club,

492
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,583
and he asked me
if I'd help him find a place.

493
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,260
All the real estate agents in
this town, he <i>asks</i> me, right.

494
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,430
That's not such a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye.

495
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,303
That's what he said.

496
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,179
If it's a place you want,
what about this one?

497
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,263
My place, where we met.

498
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,314
That? Forget it.

499
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,143
I think it has a very special
aura about it.

500
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,603
It's a dump!

501
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,281
You're supposed to be an artist.
Use your imagination.

502
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,404
Thanks a lot, I'm all out.

503
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,445
You know, I really think
you believe that.

504
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,701
I've had enough for tonight.

505
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,494
Come on, let's get out of here.

506
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,700
Okay.

507
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,173
What's this?
Shh, we gotta be quiet.

508
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,966
I thought we were going skating.

509
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,886
I wanna show you
the special studio first.

510
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,760
Only the biggest groups
get to record here.

511
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,222
It's really kind of magic. Mmm?

512
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,601
Yeah. They flash all sorts
of pictures on screens.

513
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,352
Really? Can we see it?

514
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,808
Straight ahead.

515
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,359
(KIRA LAUGHING)

516
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,984
But pictures
in a recording studio? Why?

517
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,315
For inspiration.

518
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,866
Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect.

519
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,448
I've only watched them do this
a couple of times before.

520
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,451
Let's see...
Turn on that one. And this.

521
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,366
I don't know how to
make the whole thing work.

522
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,001
Do everything. Go on. Press them all.
I don't wanna break it.

523
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,171
Then press them carefully!
What the hell.

524
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,293
I didn't like the job anyway.

525
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,545
Let's see...

526
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,467
Now will we see the magic?

527
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,135
Sure. Come on.

528
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,964
Careful.

Now I want to go somewhere else.
Where?

00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,844
Find out more about you.

I wanna know about you.

So am I.

583
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,435
Well, after all that, do you think you'd
let your imagination roam a little?

584
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,521
Look, I won't even start
in on that one.

Oh. Well, well, well.
Now, what a coincidence.

588
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,876
Look where we just happened
to end up.

589
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,796
You think you're real clever,
don't you?

590
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:01,047
Well, I just didn't want you to close
your eyes to any possibilities.

591
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,721
You really think
this could work out for Danny?

592
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,266
I think this place could be
anything you want it to be.

593
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,305
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream,

594
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,359
and you want to be involved in
something you really believe in.

595
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,903
Well, maybe his dream is big
enough for the both of you.

596
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,150
So here we are. Someone who believes
that dreams come easy, and...

597
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,407
Someone who doesn't know
what they believe in.

598
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,749
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it.

599
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,302
DANNY: You gotta be kidding.
This place?

600
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,008
They used to have
wrestling here.

601

SONNY: So it's got
a history of success.

602
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,312
It needs some fixing up. I
think it could look terrific.

<i>So could the Titanic.</i>

604
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,943
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team.

605
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,739
Look, I know it's a wreck now, but
I can see it coming to life again.

606
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,944
Just check it out, Danny.
That's all I'm asking.

607
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,118
DANNY:
Well, what put you onto this?

608
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,239
SONNY: A girl.

609
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,867
DANNY:
Oh, that explains everything.

610
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:17,411
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a
certain kind of aura about this place?

611
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,542
Well, if that's what you call
it, it's got it all right.

612
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,669
Let's see the rest of it.

613
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,382
Of course, it's not small and
intimate like my club in New York.

614
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:31,308
But then again, that was back in
1945 and things are bigger now.

615
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,687
(CHUCKLES) And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.

616
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,059
SONNY: Yeah, it is.

617
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,391
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.

618
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,569
Naturally, I can't take
all this too seriously.

619
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,568
But if I were going to do something
about it, and I can't say I am

620
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,320
because, you see, I'm a builder,

621
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,494
and a builder has to take his
time deciding these things.

622
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,914
But if I were going to
do something about it,

623
00:42:54,989 --> 00:43:00,211
just speaking hypothetically,
it just might work.

624
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,583
You think so?

625
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,165
Might. If I planned it right.

626
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,464
Let's see... Stage over there.

627
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,055
Stairs there and there
and back there.

628
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,929
Kid, can you imagine it?

785
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,457

the right way, I'd be fired.

786
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,880
Well, you were right.

Huh?

788
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,087
I'm fired!

789
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,048
Malone, I want you
out of here in five minutes.

790
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:38,474
That's five minutes, Malone, and if
it's six, just keep walking. Got it?

791
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,936
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

You know that dream of mine
to get out of here?

00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,856
Well, it's happening,
and you're all invited.

794
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,185
Opening night, whatever
you want, it's on the house.

795
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,904

to say that line.

No.

My father's or my mother's?

you have to wear something...

<i>Everybody got the word, word
Word, word, word, word, word</i>

945
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,792
<i>All over the world</i>

946
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,125
<i>Everybody got the word</i>

947
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,600
DANNY: Yeah, that's right.
We're opening tomorrow night.

948
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,303
Well, you can bring your
TV cameras if you like,

949
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,265
but we're not gonna do
any of that celebrity stuff.

950
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,729
No, no, just people.

951
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,227
Anybody who shows up.

952
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,905
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
So long.

953
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,650
I wonder what would have happened
if I got that album to paint?

954
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,453
Don't worry.
Your turn will come.

955
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,657
Everyone gets at least one
chance at feeling like that.

956
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,492
Yeah. That's what they say.

957
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,248
That's what I say.

958
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,879
All right, what's next, boss?

959
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,758
Well, we're down to little
details. Fountains, yes.

960
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,303
The mirrors, yes. Next, we
need those new parking signs.

961
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,130
Oh, the signs are here. We
just haven't put them up yet.

962
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,215
Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.

963
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:06,677
I'll be right back. I wanna talk
to you about the sound system.

964
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,932
Sure.

965
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,723
You've made the place
look beautiful.

966
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,523
Just did What the kid said.

967
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,022
Oh, I see a little
Danny McGuire here and there.

968
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:20,198
Oh, just here and there. Don't
tell anybody, but I'm nervous.

969
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,616
What about?

970
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:26,659
Well, I haven't had
an opening night since 1945.

971
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,207
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.

972
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,877
Well, just pretend we're
back in 1945 all over again.

973
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,954
I don't have to pretend.

974
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,751
It is 1945 all over again.

975
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,634
Well, that takes care of that.

976
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,590
Sonny, don't worry
about that sound system.

977
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,347
I looked over it twice today
and it's fine.

978
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,178
You kids go on home.

979
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,144
Bye, Danny. 1945.

980
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,658
You did it. Tomorrow's your big day.
It's all gonna come true.

981
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,081
Tomorrow's gonna be the most
beautiful day in the world.

982
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,533
Kira.

983
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,581
I love you.

984
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,289
I love you, Sonny.

985
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,513
What's the matter?

986
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,091
All of it, everything.

987
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,060
We can't go on pretending
this is for real.

988
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,434
I know, it is hard to believe.

989
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:36,813
I can't have
these kind of feelings.

990
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,939
It's beginning to hurt.

991
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,771
This part of it was
never supposed to happen.

992
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,653
I don't understand.

993
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,736
What do you mean, "hurt"?

994
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,789
I know I shouldn't,
but I do, and it's crazy.

995
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,209
Sonny, there's something I
have to tell you about myself.

996
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,502
I know all I need to know.

997
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,876
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.

998
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,417
All I was sent to do
was to make Xanadu happen.

999
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,377
SONNY: I don't get it.

1000
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:08,466
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell
you that I never wanted to hurt you.

1001
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,427
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.

1002
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,014
I'm not as I appear to you.

1003
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,563
Have you ever heard the
expression, "Kissed by a muse"?

1004
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,190
That's what I am. I'm a muse.

1005
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,987
I'm glad somebody's
having a good time.

1006
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,690
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.

1007
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,077
I come from Mount Helicon.

1008
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:33,874
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have
eight sisters. My real name is...

1009
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,962
Are you telling me
that's not real?

1010
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,632
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?

1011
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,923
Look up the word "muse"
in the dictionary. Go on.

1012
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,970
Page 728. Read it.

1013
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:50,595
Okay. All right, I'll read it.

1014
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,516
"Muse. Any of the
nine sister..."

1015
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,438
Like the album cover?

1016
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,265
Hmm.

1017
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:03,361
"Any of the nine sister
goddesses in Greek mythology

1018
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,157
"presiding over song and poetry
and the arts and sciences.

1019
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,655
"And do you believe me now,
Sonny?"

1020
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,406
How'd you do that?
What's going on?

1021
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,036
The television.

1022
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:23,207
<i>NICK:
Well, well, look who's here.</i>

1023
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:27,419
<i>Who's chasing you this time, Vargas?
The cops? Or the mob?</i>

1024
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,925
<i>Don't get smart with me, Nick.</i>

1025
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,803
<i>I told you to stay away
from Brenda Trent.</i>

1026
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:37,729
<i>Yes, you did tell me.
What should I do, Sonny?</i>

1027
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,023
<i>Dive at him or make a martini?</i>

1028
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,817
<i>What'?
VARGAS: Who you talking to?</i>

1029
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,567
<i>Sonny Malone. He doesn't
believe Kir♪s a muse.</i>

1030
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,240
How can you be talking to me?
You're a movie.

1031
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,194
<i>I ain't got time
for this, Malone.</i>

1032
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:55,497
<i>Brend♪s the only one
that saw me at the racetrack.</i>

1033
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,793
<i>Now if the lady says
she's a muse, she's a muse.</i>

1034
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,541
<i>Who's that? Brenda!</i>

1035
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,168
Kira.

1036
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:05,998

1039
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,090
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.

1040
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,427
<i>NICK: Good luck on the opening
of your joint, kid.</i>

1041
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,347
<i>Wish I could be there.</i>

1042
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,062
Oh, wow!

1043
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,485
Oh, Sonny.

1044
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,156
We've been painted
by Michelangelo.

1045
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,114
Shakespeare's written
sonnets about us.

1046
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:40,120
Beethoven's played music for us.

1047
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,170
We're not supposed to feel
emotion or show any feelings.

1048
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,839
Muses are just supposed
to inspire.

1049
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,761
I fell in love.

1050
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,842
You did?

1051
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,638
Well, what do you think
happened to me?

1052
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,470
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.

1053
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,806
Well, now what the hell
do we do, huh?

1054
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,357
Answer that, muse!

1055
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,479
I don't know.

1056
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,028
I'm sorry. lt just never
should have happened.

1057
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,980
Well, it did.

1058
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,737
I love you, Sonny.

1059
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,572
Kira.

1060
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,037
I'll love you forever.

1061
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,831
I Will.

1062
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,834
I'll love you forever.

1063
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,925
Kira! Wait!

1064
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,261
<i>I'll love you forever.</i>

1065
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,724
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?

1066
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:46,933
Here.

1067
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,356
Well, how do I look?

1068
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,735
Aren't you gonna say anything
about my new threads?

1069
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,199
Hubba, hubba.

1070
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,450
Well, we're gonna
miss you tonight.

1071
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,122
It won't be any fun without you.

1072
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,451
I told you. I can't go.

1073
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,629
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.

1074
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,379
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?

1075
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,677
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?

1076
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,724
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.

1077
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,268
She made it real.

1078
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,972
So find her! Bring her back!

1079
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,558
Dreams die.

1080
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,893
No.

1081
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,901
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.

1082
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,859
Now, if you give up,
you'll be sitting on that rock

1083
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,569
30 years from now,
just like I was.

1084
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:44,123
I know how you feel, kid. I
felt the same way once. I did.

1085
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,747
I didn't know
how important love is.

1086
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,754
But let me tell you something.

1087
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,879
Somehow, somewhere,
there's a way to get her!

1088
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,711
If she got here,
there's a way to get there.

1089
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,468
Believe me, kid, it's up to you.

1090
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,346
It's up to you.

01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:48,309
<i>It's a lie</i>

1098
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,392
<i>I see the autumn rain</i>

1099
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:56,651
<i>Falling on my window pane</i>

1100
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:00,154
<i>I hear you say goodbye</i>

1101
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,115
<i>I see a tear in your eye</i>

1102
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:07,165
<i>It's a lie
I don't believe it's so</i>

1103
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,995
<i>It's a lie</i>

1104
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,297
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong</i>

1105
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,125
<i>How could I know</i>

1106
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,007
<i>I was only dreaming</i>

1107
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,508

01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:54,746
<i>I see you in a dream</i>

1113
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,958
<i>You turn and start to go</i>

1114
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,300
<i>I call to you once more</i>

1115
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,427
<i>Guess that I'm taking the fall</i>

1116
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:09,602
<i>It's a lie
I don't believe it's so</i>

01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,226
<i>It's a lie</i>

1118
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,610
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong</i>

1119
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,403
<i>How could I know</i>

1120
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,322
<i>I was only dreaming</i>

1121
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,900
<i>And now</i>

1122
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,951
<i>Now that you're gone</i>

1123
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:30,658
<i>I will go on really believing</i>

1124
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,796
<i>I take the fall</i>

1125
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,842
Kira.

1126
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,675
Sonny. How did you get here?

1127
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,181
You didn't think I'd let you
get away from me, did you?

1128
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,682
You'll have to go back.

1129
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,810
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

1130
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:44,071
I can't go with you, but you have
to get out before it's too late.

1131
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,989
Too late for what?

1132
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,035
Oh, please, you took
a big chance coming here.

1133
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:53,202
What's going on here? I'm
taking you back with me, Kira.

1134
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,534
It can't be done. Nobody's
ever taken anyone out of here.

1135
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,166
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.

1136
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,293
I'll make them let you go.

1137
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,750
Hey, Zeus!

1138
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,461
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.

1139
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,842
I wanna talk to you.

1140
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,471
<i>ZEUS: We don't use those
old-fashioned names anymore.</i>

1141
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,017
<i>In any case, it's me
you want to speak to.</i>

1142
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,188
I've come to get Kira.

1143
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,188
<i>She's not leaving!
It's impossible!</i>

1144
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,446
That's what you think.
That's what you think.

1145
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,569
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

1146
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,367
<i>Put it this way.
I'm a good guesser.</i>

1147
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,529
What else do you know?

1148
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:33,863
<i>Everything.</i>

1149
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,165
All right, then. You know this.

1150
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,914
I'm sticking to this place
till hell freezes over.

1151
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,040
Sonny!

1152
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,044
<i>You'll leave now
and you'll leave without Kira!</i>

1153
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:47,548
Why? <i>Because other
people have dreams.</i>

1154
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,173
So send another muse.

1155
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,756
You got muses running
around all over the place.

1156
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,137
<i>One dream, one muse.</i>

1157
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,141
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?

1158
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,267
Kira and I love each other.

1159
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,229
Now I don't know how often that
happens in this kind of place,

1160
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,861
but back on Earth,
it's pretty rare.

1161
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:12,989
We need to be together.

1162
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,366
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

1163
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,915
<i>You're leaving. Kir♪s staying.
No more discussions.</i>

1164
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,085
<i>Those are the rules
and that's all there is to it.</i>

1165
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,414
<i>WOMAN: On the other hand, dear,
rules were made to be broken.</i>

1166
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,090
<i>ZEUS:
We'll talk about that later.</i>

1167
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,759
<i>WOMAN: Which is later
and which is earlier?</i>

1168
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,804
<i>WOMAN: I keep forgetting.</i>
KIRA: <i>Just</i> a <i>minute!</i>

1169
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,428
Isn't anyone interested
in my feelings?

1170
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,430
<i>What do you mean, "feelings"?</i>

1171
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,977
<i>Oh, you remember, pet.</i>

1172
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,602
<i>We learnt about feelings
in our mortal history class.</i>

1173
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,148
Yes, feelings.

1174
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,270
I guess that's what
you call them.

1175
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,072
I've never really
had them before.

1176
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,071
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

1177
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,746
And I've never asked
to leave here. Not ever.

1178
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,790
Not once in the whole
time I've been here.

1179
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,211
<i>WOMAN: No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.</i>

1180
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,665
<i>Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up.</i>

1181
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:12,470
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?

1182
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:16,641
<i>ZEUS: No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.</i>

1184
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,720
Just one moment?

<i>So sure I could need no one</i>

1189

<i>My heart always on the run
to nowhere</i>

1190
01:17:55,212 --> 01:18:00,093
<i>Now as you're holding me</i>

1191
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:05,023
<i>My heart is reminding me</i>

1192
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:09,648
<i>That now I could never be</i>

1193
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,855
<i>Without you</i>

1194
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:19,495
<i>But how can our love succeed?</i>

1195
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:24,371
<i>A miracle is what we need</i>

1196
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,705
<i>And so I appeal to you</i>

<i>So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time</i>
