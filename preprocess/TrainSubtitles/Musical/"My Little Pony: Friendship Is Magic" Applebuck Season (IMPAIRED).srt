1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,923
Applejack: Boy, howdy. I got my work cut out for me.

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:09,009
That there's the biggest bumper crop o'apples I ever laid eyes on.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,118
Big Macintosh: Ee-yup. Too big for you t'handle on yer own.

4
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:17,647
Applejack: Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better.

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:20,526
I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle.
(jabs Big Mac)

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:22,245
Oops! Sorry...

7
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,892
I'll take a bite outta this job by day's end.

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,700
Big Mac: Biting off more than you can 
 chew is just what I'm afraid of.

9
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,074
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?

10
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,855
Yup.

11
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:38,081
Why, of all the- This is your sister Applejack, remember?!

12
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:41,285
(raising voice) The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?

13
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:43,746
But still only ONE pony.

14
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:48,483
And ONE pony plus HUNDREDS o'apple trees just doesn't add up.

15
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,455
Don't you use yer fancy "mathematics" to muddy the issue!

16
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,985
I said I can handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you.

17
00:00:54,985 --> 00:01:01,486
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those 
 trees this applebuck season all by myself.

18
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,575
(gulps)

19
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:13,305
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

20
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:17,717
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

21
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:21,711
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

22
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,033
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

23
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,123
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

24
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:28,166
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

25
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,442
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

26
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:38,940
(My Little Pony) Do you know you're all my very best friends

27
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,093
Well, I better get kickin'.

28
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,048
These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.

29
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:51,036
(low rumbling, apple thuds)
Hey!

30
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:52,071
(ground rumbling)
Oh no!

31
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,030
STAMPEEEEEEDE!

32
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:08,041
(cows mooing, ground being trampled)

33
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:13,075
(ponies panicking, doors slamming shut)

34
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:21,046
Pinkie Pie: (laughing, voice trembling with ground) He-e-ey! Thi-i-is ma-a-akes my-y-y-y voi-i-ice so-o-ound silly-y-y!

35
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,010
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!

36
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,033
Everypony calm down. There is no reason to panic!

37
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,060
Rarity: But mayor! Whatever shall we do?!

38
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,077
Rainbow Dash: Look there!

39
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,018
(ground shaking underfoot)

40
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,027
Applejack: YEE-HAW!

41
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,078
(cheering)

42
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:41,075
Move aside, Winona. (Winona barking)

43
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,047
Applejack: Herd'em up, girl!

44
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,019
(Winona barking)

45
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,013
(Rarity moans)
Pinkie Pie: This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!

46
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:55,089
Come on, little doggie!

47
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,001
Herd!

48
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:00,007
Applejack: (whistles) Winona, put'em up.

49
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,037
(Winona barks)

50
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,064
Applejack: Ha HA! That's it!

51
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,092
(rope twirling, Applejack grunting)

52
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:17,077
(Winona barks)
Applejack: (grunts) Attagirl. Yeehaw!

53
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:22,085
(cheering)

54
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,048
Applejack: Whoooooa!

55
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,024
Hoo-wee!

56
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,060
Now, what was THAT all about?

57
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,072
(moos, clears throat)

58
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:37,008
Oh, my! Begging your pardon, Applejack,

59
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:41,077
but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.

60
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,058
(cows gasp)

61
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,058
(cows gasp)

62
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,084
And it just gave us ALL the willies, don'tcha know!

63
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,070
I completely understand.

64
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,046
Just next time, try and steer clear o'Ponyville.

65
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,057
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!

66
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,089
(Winona barks)

67
00:03:56,089 --> 00:04:02,079
(ponies cheer, Winona barks)
Applejack: Yee-haw!

68
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:05,048
Pinkie Pie: Yee-haw! Ride'em, cowpony!

69
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:09,066
Mayor: Applejack was just...just...
Pinkie Pie: Apple-TASTIC!

70
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,056
Exactly!

71
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:15,060
We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.

72
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,009
Pinkie Pie: I know! A PARTY!

73
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:22,090
Twilight: We all ready?

74
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,031
Just one last thing.

75
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,046
Rarity: NOW we're ready.

76
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,090
Is Applejack all set?

77
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,081
Rainbow Dash: Actually, I haven't seen her all week.

78
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,020
Pinkie Pie: Not since the stampede.

79
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,078
Rainbow Dash: But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is NEVER late!

80
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,053
(ponies chattering)

81
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,092
(notecards slapping desk)

82
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,080
Twilight: Welcome, everypony!

83
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:59,054
Today we are here to honor a pony we can always 
 count on to help in matters great and small.

84
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:02,071
A pony whose contributions to- (crash)

85
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,039
Rainbow Dash: Did you see Applejack's swift moves out there?!

86
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,097
What an ATHLETE!

87
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,085
This week, she's gonna help me with my new flying trick,

88
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,077
and I know it's gonna be (squealing) so awesome!

89
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,084
Twilight: EXACTLY. And-

90
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,014
Pinkie Pie: This week, I get to run 
 Sugar Cube Corner for the first time!

91
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,037
Twilight: What does that have to do with Applejack?

92
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,011
OH!

93
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:25,059
Applejack, one of the best bakers EVER, is gonna help me!

94
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:29,077
Applejack makes everything great, so FREE SAMPLES FOR EVERYPONY!

95
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,072
(ponies cheer)

96
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,030
Twilight: Hokay, that's great.

97
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,011
Twilight: Now, if I could just make a 
 point without being inter-
Fluttershy: Twilight? Twilight: -rupted...

98
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:39,048
Fluttershy: Twilight, I'm so sorry,

99
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:44,034
but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also 
 helping me this week with the official bunny census,

100
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,065
where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season.

101
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:51,018
She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.

102
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,045
Twilight: (dryly) Anyone else?

103
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,099
Anyone?

104
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,005
Twilight: No?

105
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:01,037
Well, then. As I was trying to say-

106
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,050
(frustrated grunt) Never mind.

107
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,068
(clears throat) And so, with no further ado,

108
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,089
it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of Ponyville Award

109
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,065
to our beloved guest of honor,

110
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,079
a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,

111
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,009
reliability, and integrity,

112
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,055
Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend, Applejack!

113
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:31,044
(ponies cheering, stop)
Spike: Cool, way to go, Applejack! That was awesome! I mean- heh...

114
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,037
(clears throat nervously)

115
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,041
Spike: (singsong) Awkward.

116
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:41,029
Applejack: (groggily) I'm here! I'm here...

117
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:47,060
(yawns deeply) Sorry I'm late-whoa! (trips, thuds) Was I just-

118
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:48,081
Did I get your tail?

119
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:55,048
Miss Mayor, thank you kindly for this here...award...thingy...

120
00:06:55,568 --> 00:07:01,037
(yawns) It's so bright and shiny and...heh...heheh...

121
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,074
I sure do look funny, heh...

122
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:10,057
Applejack and Pinkie Pie: Woooowooooowoooo!

123
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:13,082
Twilight: Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack,

124
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:16,005
for saving us from that scary stampede,

125
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,042
and always being there for everypony.

126
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,064
(yawns) Yeah...I like helpin' the ponyfolk and...

127
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,098
(yawns) and stuff... (snores)

128
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,033
Oh! Uh...yeah, thanks!

129
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:42,031
(trophy drags on ground loudly)

130
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,056
Twilight: Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little-
Rainbow Dash: Tired?

131
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,000
Fluttershy: Dizzy?
Rarity: Messy?

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,006
(haughty) Well, did you SEE her mane?!

133
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:53,034
Pinkie Pie: She seemed fine to me. WOO! WOO!

134
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,099
(Twilight "hmm's")

135
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:59,031
(Applejack grunts, kicks tree, apples thud into baskets)

136
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,002
(Applejack grunts, kicks tree, apples thud into baskets)

137
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:07,016
(Applejack grunts and kicks tree then sighs)

138
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,013
(sighs sleepily, shakes self awake)

139
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:11,096
(Applejack kicks, yelps)

140
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:16,033
(Applejack kicks basket, apples roll out)
Twilight: What on earth is that pony doing?!

141
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,016
Applejack: Whoops...

142
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:20,076
Twilight: Hey, Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

143
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:22,099
Twilight: Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

144
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:25,064
Twilight: Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

145
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,068
(Applejack snores)

146
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,070
Twilight: APPLEJACK!
Applejack: Oh! (shakes self awake)

147
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:34,037
Applejack: H-howdy, Twilight!

148
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:35,090
Twilight: What IS all this?!

149
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,085
Applejack: I-it's applebuck season!

150
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,035
Applejack: (kicks tree, apples thud into baskets) Wh-whoa!

151
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,087
Twilight: Applewhat season?

152
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:47,032
Applejack: (frustrated grunt) It's what the Apple Family calls harvesting time.

153
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,044
We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.

154
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,053
Twilight: But...why are you doing it all alone?

155
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,052
Applejack: 'Cause Big Macintosh hurt himself.

156
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:58,019
Twilight: What about all those relatives I met when I first came to Ponyville?

157
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,021
Can't they help?

158
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:02,028
Applejack: (sighs) They were just here for the Apple Family Reunion.

159
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,037
They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards.

160
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,041
So, uh, I'm on my own.

161
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:12,059
(poof)
Which means I should really get back to work.

162
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,035
Applejack: (clears throat ostentatiously) Hint-hint?

163
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,097
Applejack: Get back to work?

164
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:19,086
Twilight: Fine.

165
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,078
Applejack: (woozy) Uh, could you step aside, Twilight?

166
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:27,006
Twilight: I just did... (echoing) Applejack, you don't look so good...

167
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:32,002
Applejack: (shakes self awake) Don't any a'you three 
 worry none, I'm just fine and dandy.

168
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,072
Applejack: (kicks tree) Wh-whoa...

169
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:37,027
Twilight: Do you...want some help?

170
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:40,052
Applejack: Help?! No way, no how.

171
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:42,094
Twilight: But there's no way you can do it all on your own!

172
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:46,010
Applejack: Is that a CHALLENGE?
Twilight: Um...no?

173
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:50,004
Applejack: Well, I'm gonna PROVE t'you that I can do it!

174
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:53,085
Now, if you'll EX-KYUUSE me, I've got apples t'buck.

175
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,031
(Rainbow Dash tapping hoof on fencepost)

176
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:03,014
Rainbow Dash: THERE you are!
Applejack: (yawns) I'm a-mite sorry, Rainbow...

177
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,028
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I-

178
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,094
I closed my eyes for a second, and 
 when I woke up, I was late.

179
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,022
Now, what's this new trick a'yours?

180
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,057
Rainbow Dash: See this contraption?

181
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,021
Applejack: Uh, yeah...

182
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,016
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,

183
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,016
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,

184
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,067
then you're gonna jump down from that platform,

185
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:22,043
launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own.

186
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:26,061
Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins

187
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,080
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.

188
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,016
Isn't that a mite dangerous?

189
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,018
Heh, not for a pony who can fly.

190
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,030
Well, all righty, then!

191
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,027
(wind whistling)

192
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,091
Applejack: (woozy) Oh my...

193
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,037
Ready?! One...two...

194
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:48,086
THREE!
(Applejack slams into ground, grunts)

195
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:55,045
Uh, maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land ON the other end.

196
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,096
Applejack: (face pops off ground, dazed) Got it...

197
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:01,054
(thud, grunt, thud, grunt, thud, grunt)

198
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,028
Rainbow Dash: Applejack, what the hay is goin' on?!

199
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,039
I mean, I THOUGHT I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!

200
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:10,092
(shakes self awake, talking loudly) You ARE! I'm okay...

201
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,052
Really...I-I have an idea.

202
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:18,086
Watch this. (groans, launcher creaks) Ta-da.

203
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,064
Applejack: Oh...maybe not...

204
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,080
Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.

205
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:26,001
(thud, Rainbow Dash grunts)

206
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,045
(groans)

207
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,037
Applejack: Heh heh...he-here I go!

208
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:40,022
Rainbow Dash: WAIT! (into distance) APPLEJAAaaaaack...

209
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,047
Applejack: (shouting) You're welcome!

210
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:48,065
(approaching jet, Rainbow Dash screaming, crash)

211
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:50,060
Can I help you?

212
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,043
I think somepony else needs your help...

213
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,066
Twilight: (flatly) Applejack?
Rainbow Dash: Yep.

214
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:04,076
Applejack: (thunk) OW!

215
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:06,048
(tuning fork wobbling)

216
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,039
Twilight: Applejack, can we talk?

217
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,043
(bubbles popping)

218
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,098
Twilight: (echoing) Applejack, can we talk?

219
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,068
Applejack: CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I-I DON'T THINK SO...

220
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,016
Twilight: No. Can we talk?

221
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:22,050
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?

222
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:25,010
(louder) No! I need to talk to you!

223
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:29,052
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?! WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?

224
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,028
(louder) I NEED to TALK to you!

225
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:35,079
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?! WHATCHA WANNA TALK ABOUT?

226
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,029
(loudly) Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today!

227
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:40,062
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER.

228
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:45,012
(shouting) YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY 
 AFTER YOU LAUNCHED HER INTO THE AIR.

229
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:49,081
(normal volume) Oh, yeah...I wasn't feelin' quite myself this mornin'...

230
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,078
Because you're working too hard, and you need HELP!

231
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:57,020
What? Kelp?! I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!

232
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,019
(shouting) HELP! YOU NEED HELP!

233
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,014
Nothin' doin', Twilight.

234
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:05,088
I'm gonna prove t'you...t'everypony...that I can do this ON MY OWN.

235
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,046
(thwap, Applejack yelps)

236
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:12,024
Ugh...now if you'll EXCUSE me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie...

237
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:13,068
(sighs)

238
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:20,028
Mrs. Cake: Now, Pinkie Pie, are you SURE you're up to 
 baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?

239
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,060
Yessirree bob, Mrs. Cake!

240
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:25,034
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out.

241
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,022
Why, she's the best baker EVER! Right, Applejack?
(Applejack shakes self awake)

242
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,066
(Pinkie's words echo incoherently)

243
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,024
(shakes self awake)

244
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,065
Mr. Cake: No? You're not the best baker ever?

245
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:37,050
What?! Oh no! I mean, don't you fret.

246
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:41,022
I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.

247
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:44,047
Mrs. Cake: Ohoho! Well, all right! Well, see you later, girls!

248
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,072
(shakes self awake)

249
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,084
Pinkie Pie: Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'!

250
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,023
All righty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.

251
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,071
Can you get me some chocolate chips?

252
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:56,031
E-eh, uh...wh-what was that?

253
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:59,052
(slowed down, distorted) Chocolate chips!

254
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:03,005
"Chips"...got it. Tater chips...

255
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:06,020
All salty'n'dry...okie-dokie.

256
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,057
Applejack: (empties chips into bowl) What next?

257
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:10,073
(slowed down, distorted) Baking soda!

258
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,071
"Soda"...

259
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,014
Perfect! That'll get the tater chips nice'n'wet.

260
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:18,035
Applejack: (pours soda, shouts) NOW WHAT?

261
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,047
Pinkie Pie: (normally) A cup of flour.

262
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,074
A cup of sour?!

263
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,002
Well, lemons are sure sour.

264
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,010
Applejack: One cup o'sour comin' up.

265
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,080
Anything else, Pinkie?

266
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:30,084
Pinkie Pie: One last thing. Wheat germ.

267
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,033
(grimaces) Wheat worms?!

268
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:35,062
Oh! That must be fancy talk for earthworms!

269
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:44,082
Pinkie Pie: Now THAT'S gonna be DELICIOUS!
Applejack: If you say so...

270
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:49,056
Pinkie Pie: FREE MUFFIN SAMPLE SPECTACULAR!

271
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:54,053
(ponies talk over each other)

272
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,019
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get'm while they're hot!

273
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:02,047
Twilight: We came as soon as we heard!

274
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:09,016
(sickly moans)
Nurse: Oh, thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get!

275
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:11,085
Oh no! What happened?!

276
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:15,028
Nurse: It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.

277
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:18,054
Pinkie Pie: (weakly) No...not baked goods.

278
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,062
Baked BADS... (gurgles)

279
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,020
Applejack.

280
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,025
Spike: (chewing noisily) Mm! Want one?

281
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,077
Applejack: (kicks tree, snores, apple thuds) Wha?! Huh?!

282
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,037
(cart rolling, Applejack yawning)

283
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,041
(Applejack moans with exhaustion, apples roll out)

284
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,099
(Applejack snoring loudly)

285
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,050
Twilight: Applejack, we need to talk.

286
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:46,079
Whoa?! Huh?! Oh, it's you, Twilight...

287
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:51,053
(yawning) I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.

288
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,069
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help!

289
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,082
Applejack: (sarcastic) Hardy-har. (strains) No, I don't.

290
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,012
Twilight: Here. Let me help.

291
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,021
Applejack: Help?! Nooo thanks.

292
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,050
(straining) A little more...

293
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:08,027
(cart creaking) Little...

294
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,029
(straining, cart creaking, crash) ...There...

295
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:16,054
(panting) I'll prove that THIS apple can handle THESE apples!

296
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:20,095
(kicking tree repeatedly) Come on...apples...fall off!

297
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:25,027
Twilight: AJ? I think you're beating a dead...tree.

298
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:27,087
I-I knew that...

299
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,054
Twilight: Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about.

300
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,095
I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care, and-

301
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:37,006
Applejack: Y'know, I'm a LITTLE busy to get lectured right now, Twilight...

302
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,069
Twilight: But if you'd just let me help-

303
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,008
Applejack: UGH! No...no...NO!

304
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:44,004
How many times do I gotta say it?!

305
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,005
I don't need NO help from NOpony!

306
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:51,001
Twilight: Uuugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.

307
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,007
(mule neighs)
Twilight: No offense.

308
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,005
Mule: None taken.

309
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:58,004
Fluttershy: Oh, Applejack.

310
00:16:58,045 --> 00:17:02,005
Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round-up.

311
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,008
Applejack: (annoyed) Ugh. Why are we doin' this?

312
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,006
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born,

313
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:10,002
so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.

314
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:12,003
Applejack: (impatiently) Fine. Can we just get on with it?!

315
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:16,009
Certainly. But remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.

316
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,002
They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.

317
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,007
I do NOT need any direction on corralin' critters!

318
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,006
Right, WInona?!
(Winona barks)

319
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,006
Fluttershy: Okay, little bunnies.

320
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:30,004
(gently) I need you to all gather here in the middle.

321
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,002
Applejack: (intimidating) That's right! Let's go, bunnies!

322
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:35,000
In the center! Hop to it!

323
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,003
...Swell. Just swell.

324
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,005
Put 'em up, Winona!

325
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:43,008
(Winona barking)

326
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,003
Fluttershy: Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!

327
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:52,000
Applejack: We know what we're doin'!

328
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,005
Git along, little bunnies!

329
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,006
(Winona barks)

330
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,009
(Winona growls)

331
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:01,000
Fluttershy: Oh no...

332
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,002
(bunnies scream)

333
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,005
(ground rumbling)

334
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,005
STAMPEEEEEDE!

335
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:14,006
(ponies panic, doors slam shut)

336
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:23,009
(rumble grows more intense)

337
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,005
(faints)

338
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,007
(Twilight humming tunelessly)

339
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,005
(gasps)

340
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:39,002
The horror, THE HORROR!

341
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,005
It was AWFUL!

342
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:43,001
A DISASTER! A horrible, horrible DISASTER!

343
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,002
Twilight: I don't get it.

344
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,006
Our gardens! Destroyed!

345
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,004
Every last flower, devoured!

346
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,000
By...by... (shrieks) THEM!

347
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,000
Fluttershy: (frantic) Oh...oh my! Please stop, little bunnies.

348
00:18:55,967 --> 00:19:00,001
Nono! Please! Let's go home! (panting) Oh my goodness...

349
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:03,004
All right. Enough is enough.

350
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,005
Applejack: (wearily) Must...keep...buckin'...

351
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:13,000
(kicking tree repeatedly) Just...a few...more...must...finish...harvestin'...

352
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,009
Twilight: All right, Applejack.

353
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,004
Your applebucking hasn't just caused YOU problems,

354
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,009
it's over-propelled a pegasus,

355
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,009
practically poisoned plenty of ponies,

356
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:22,001
and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies.

357
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,006
I don't care WHAT you say,

358
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,000
YOU. NEED. HELP.

359
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,004
Applejack: (grunts, kicks tree, apples land in baskets) Heh! No I don't!

360
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:31,001
Look! I did it!

361
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:36,001
I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without yer help.

362
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,009
(chuckles) How'dya like THEM apples?!

363
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,005
Big Mac: Um...How do YOU like THEM apples?

364
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:51,006
Applejack: (trembling) A-a-apples... (incoherent rambling, faints)

365
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,008
Twilight: (faint) Applejack? (normal) Applejack!

366
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:56,009
Applejack: Huh...?

367
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,007
Oh good. You're okay.

368
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:02,005
Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways.

369
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,009
You're always there to help anypony in need,

370
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:08,000
so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside

371
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,007
and allow your friends to help you?

372
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:11,009
(resigned) Okay, Twilight.

373
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,002
I am not taking "no" for an answer- (doubletakes) What?!

374
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:17,003
Yes, Twilight. (pleading) Yes, please...

375
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,001
I could really use your help...

376
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,000
(Twilight giggles, sighs with relief)

377
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,009
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dear Princess Celestia,

378
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:28,007
My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have,

379
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,008
and she's always there to help anypony.

380
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,004
The only trouble is,

381
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:33,004
when she needs help,

382
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,009
she finds it hard to accept it.

383
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,009
So, while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends,

384
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:40,005
it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.

385
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:43,004
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

386
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,003
How 'bout y'all take a little break?

387
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,007
Applejack: I got some fiiine apple juice waitin' for ya.

388
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,003
(sighs) Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.

389
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,001
I was actin' a...bit stubborn.

390
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:54,009
A bit?!

391
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:57,003
Okay, a MITE stubborn.

392
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:59,004
And I'm awful sorry.

393
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:03,001
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony Award,

394
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:07,002
but the real award is havin' you five as my friends.

395
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,000
(slurping)

396
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:12,008
Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry!

397
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:15,005
Spike: And I've got the perfect treat!
Pinkie Pie: Eeewww!

398
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,004
Spike, I threw those away! Where'd you get them?!

399
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:19,006
From the trash.

400
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,009
(ponies all revulse)

401
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,002
Spike: Just a liiittle nibble?

402
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:28,007
Spike: Come on!
(ponies moan in disgust)

403
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,003
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

404
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,004
My Little Pony

405
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:47,004
(instrumental)

406
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:53,008
My Little Pony, friends
