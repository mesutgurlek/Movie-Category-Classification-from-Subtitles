Once upon a time in France,

named Christopher Tracy.

but he died for one.

he learned the true meaning of love.

Tricky, today is a wonderful day.

How'd you dig it if I told you
I was leaving the business?

That's right.
Christopher Tracy, an honest man.

638
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,162
Seriously. I've been thinking
that if you really love someone

639
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,075
it would go deeper than the flesh,
but be happier than sex.

640
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,336
Really, Tricky,
there's got to be something else.

641
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,044
If two people really dug one another, they
couldn't be torn apart no matter what.
