1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>, here's what you missed on
Glee: Quinn was dating Sam,</i>

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,037
<i>but then she kissed Finn, so
Santana told Sam, and now</i>

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,805
<i>they've started dating.
You are Biebalicious.</i>

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,141
<i>Will's not dating anyone and
says he's over Emma, but it</i>

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,676
<i>seems like he's still got a
thing for her, even though
she's married.</i>

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,511
<i>Kurt's really into Blaine,
and Blaine likes Kurt,</i>

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,146
<i>but he says he just wants to
stay friends.</i>

8
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,048
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,585
(school bell rings)
Figgins,

10
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,353
you wanted to see me?

11
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,621
William, we have an epidemic
on our hands.

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,090
Head lice?
Worse. Giggle juice.

13
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,725
I-I'm sorry. What?

14
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,060
Alcohol, William.

15
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,628
The wet devil.

16
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,762
Our children

17
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,698
are so brazen,
they are showing up

18
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,999
to school wasted.

19
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,934
And not wasted
on learning, Will.

20
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,269
Wasted on booze.

21
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,471
Why, just this week,
we've had five suspensions

22
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,673
for intoxication
on school grounds.

23
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,242
(pounding on window)
Figgins!

24
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,743
You rock!

25
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,278
Yeah, man!

26
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,680
Six suspensions.

27
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,182
I-I don't get it.

28
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,984
Drinking's never been a problem
at this school.

29
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,585
That's because there are
new alcoholic beverages

30
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,886
targeted to kids, Will.

31
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,521
Just listen
to the radio.

32
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,858
Pop music now glorifies
binge drinking.

33
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,059
Just listen to any hit

34
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,229
by pop sensation
Ke-dollar-sign-ha.

35
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,231
Oh. You-You mean Ke$ha?

36
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,100
We must do something
to protect our children, Will.

37
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,935
I-I totally agree.

38
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,570
How-How can I help?

39
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,572
I have decided to make this week

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,906
Alcohol Awareness Week

41
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,074
at McKinley.

42
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,476
I have contacted
Kitty Dukakis,

43
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,111
who will be
the guest speaker

44
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,214
at an assembly where your
Glee Club will perform a song

45
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,049
highlighting the dangers

46
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,050
of teenage drinking.

47
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,719
Can I count on you, William?

48
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,259
(school bell ringing)

49
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,894
WILL:
Emma?
Hi.

50
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,262
Enough with us
not being friends.

51
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,131
Look, I heard through the
grapevine that you and Carl

52
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,265
started looking
for a tract house together,

53
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,833
and I just wanted to say

54
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,136
that I'm genuinely
happy for you.

55
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,604
Thank you.

56
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,472
(chuckling)
That's really sweet.

57
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,308
Two-slicer.
(laughs)

58
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,009
Do you want to catch up?

59
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,011
Yeah. Sure.

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,913
(clears throat)

61
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,448
How have you been?

62
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,684
Busy. Yeah.

63
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,052
Glee Club's gearing up
for Regionals...

64
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,287
I, um, love hearing
about the Glee Club,

65
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,922
but I'm actually more
interested in you.

66
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,791
You know, how
you're doing.
Me? Uh...

67
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,492
Are you dating anybody?

68
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,227
No.

69
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,530
No?

70
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,365
Maybe you should.

71
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,067
You know,
Ella, I think

72
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,902
Will should really concentrate
on his treatment

73
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,170
before he tries another
relationship

74
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,238
with an early hominid,
even a human female.

75
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,841
Treatment?
Alcoholics Anonymous, Will.

76
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,876
I suggest you
pre-emptively check

77
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,512
into rehab,
as you are a future alcoholic.

78
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,214
I mean, come on.

79
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,216
Look where you are.
You're coaching a Glee Club

80
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,285
that can only beat
choirs of old people.

81
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,221
You're rehashing the details
of your failed marriage

82
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,558
with the very lemur
who rejected the bestial horror

83
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,826
of your craven sexual advances.

84
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,595
And when my Glee Club
crushes you at Regionals,

85
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,099
well, the last ounce of meaning
will drain from your life,

86
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,567
and you will turn to drink.

87
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,801
I don't get it. How is it

88
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,203
that you're now
coaching a Glee Club?

89
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,472
I was so inspired by my stint
in the Glee Club,

90
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,474
that I took the trip
to Westvale,

91
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,708
and I volunteered my help.

92
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,477
Unfortunately,
the chipper homosexual

93
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,045
who coaches Aural Intensity

94
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,880
had a terrible fall
down the stairs.

95
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,782
(epic music plays)

96
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,353
I'm okay. Don't worry.

97
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,691
(grunting)

98
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,992
Not to be alarmed.

99
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,528
Doctors say he will be fine.
Provided they can get

100
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,896
the swelling in his brain
under control.

101
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,031
Okay, sorry. I still
don't understand.

102
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,267
How can the school let
you coach Aural Intensity?

103
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,002
Newsflash, Amelda.

104
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,338
There's no one lining up
to coach Glee Clubs

105
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,240
because it's a sucky job
for losers.

106
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,042
But there was an opening,
and I am a champion.

107
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, Will.
Here's the book by Bill W.,

108
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,181
outlining the 12 steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

109
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,983
I can't wait for you
to start climbing those steps,

110
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,217
because when you get to the top,

111
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,686
I'm gonna knock you back down.

112
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,624
(school bell ringing)

113
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,692
What's up, my hot, little
Jewish-American Princess?

114
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,161
What do you want,
Puckerman?

115
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,129
Well, word on the street is
that your dads are out of town,

116
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,297
and you're all
alone in your house.

117
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,965
They are on the
Rosie O'Donnell cruise.

118
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,500
Was that...
Who told you that?

119
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,702
This is the kind of information
a guy like me tends to know.

120
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,272
So, uh, party
this Saturday?

121
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,840
I'll bring the beer ball.
That's a mini-keg.

122
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,675
Forget it.

123
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,076
Oh, come on. Just
the Glee kids.

124
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,378
We're losing our minds,

125
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,245
all stressed
about Sectionals and stuff.

126
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,347
Regionals. Besides,

127
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,050
you just want a place
to have sex and get drunk.

128
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,819
Yeah. There's a word
for that. A party.

129
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,320
No. No.
(notes tinkling)

130
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,290
No. My-My-My dads, they left me
alone in my house

131
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,825
because they trusted me
to be responsible.

132
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,894
They left you alone 'cause you
suck and are a total bore.

133
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,262
FINN:
Hey.

134
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,430
Yo.

135
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,498
How's the song-
writing going?

136
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,100
Hey. It's going amazing.

137
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,102
I think I might have
a really big hit here,

138
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,270
which is why
I wanted you to come by.

139
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,738
I-I want you to hear it.

140
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,373
Oh. Yeah. Cool.

141
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,309
Come here.

142
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,349
(chuckles)

143
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,687
What was that for?

144
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,121
To break the tension.

145
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,557
We were boyfriend
and girlfriend, Finn.

146
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,025
It's silly for us to pretend

147
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,494
like we aren't comfortable
around each other.

148
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,596
Yeah. Totally.

149
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,498
And I know that we have
some unresolved feelings,

150
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,268
but like my two new role models
Carole King and Gerry Goffin,

151
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,603
I think it's important
that we just

152
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,706
put them aside and stay
focused on our mission

153
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,908
which is just
to write an amazing song

154
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,209
to win Regionals with.

155
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,712
Well, I have no idea
who those people are,

156
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,747
but I'm on board.
Let's hear it.
Okay.

157
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,550
It's just... It's a little
rough, but, uh...

158
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,752
(piano ballad playing)
I think it's really special,

159
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,320
so...

160
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,555
(clears throat)

161
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,759

00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,246
Hold...
Hold on. Uh...

177
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,747
Is this song about
your headband?

178
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,849
Yes.
It's called, "My Headband."

179
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,918
They say you should write
about what you know.

180
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,587
Well, uh...

181
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,222
It's really... interesting,

182
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,658
but it's not...

183
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,528
emotional or,
like, good.

184
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,029
It sucks.
Yeah.

185
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,831
How am I supposed to write
a song like Joni Mitchell

186
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,333
or Carole King?
They've lived.

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,436
Well, maybe if you want
to be an artist like them,

188
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,771
you should do a
little living.

189
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,274
You're so right.

190
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,410
I mean, even now,

191
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,646
it-it's Alcohol Awareness Week,

192
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,048
and we're supposed to sing songs
about the dangers of drinking,

193
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,650
and I've never
even had a drink.

194
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,185
Wait, seriously?

195
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,886
That's why I never got
past second base. Wait.

196
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,755
Where are you going?
To find Puckerman.

197
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,291
You know, my journey
from little princess

198
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,061
to natural woman begins this
Saturday night at my house.

199
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,496
(school bell ringing)

200
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,998
That sounds awful.

201
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,232
Is anybody going?

202
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,600
Let me find out.

203
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,502
(phone beeps)
(phone vibrates)

204
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,870
Did you hear?
Yes.

205
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,238
Mercedes just told me.

206
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,406
Tell them I'll
go if they go.

207
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,607
Tell them yourself.

208
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,442
I ain't no pony express.

209
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,777
(headset beeps)
You're going, right?

210
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,245
Only if there's liquor.

211
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,948
Because a Rachel Berry party
is not something I can do sober.

212
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,583
But it's Alcohol
Awareness Week.

213
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,619
Precisely. And I am aware
of how much fun alcohol is.

214
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:34,987
Let's ask Puckerman.
(phone beeps, phone vibrates)

215
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,222
You're go for Puck.

216
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,556
Noah, it's Santittany
and Artcedes.

217
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,325
Can your friend score us
some wine coolers?

218
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,027
No, but his I.D. can.

219
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,029
Well, if we're all
in, it's settled.

220
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,898
The Rachel Berry House Party
Train Wreck Extravaganza

221
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,633
is officially a go.

222
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,901
♪
♪

223
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,569
Welcome.

224
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,039
Kurt. Blaine.

225
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,875
I wasn't expecting
you guys.

226
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,110
FINN: Kurt's been
blackmailing me

227
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,879
ever since he saw
my browser history.

228
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,580
He kind of
insisted on coming.

229
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,783
I'm totally off
the clock right now, Rachel.

230
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,184
I'm not a Warbler.
I'm just Blaine.

231
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,986
I'm not even
wearing my uniform.

232
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,655
So, this is
your dads' Oscar Room.

233
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,924
Yes. They transformed
our ordinary basement

234
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,559
for our famous
annual Oscar parties.

235
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,127
Is that a stage?

236
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,729
I like to give
impromptu performances

237
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,130
for our neighbors sometimes.

238
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,365
Hey, girlfriend.

239
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,766
Having fun?

240
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,702
Yeah.

241
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,603
Awesome party.

242
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,741
Uh, okay. Let's, uh...

243
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,743
Let's go over the rules.

244
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,678
Everybody gets
two drink tickets

245
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,547
to keep things
from getting out of hand.

246
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,083
We're serving
wine coolers today.

247
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,684
That is our
specialty drink.

248
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,320
That's actually
all that we have.

249
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,457
Brittany!

250
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,726
Remember the rules.
No sitting on anything.

251
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,361
Okay. Okay, everybody.

252
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,063
Cheers!

253
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,631
Great party, Rachel.

254
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,233
We got to run.

255
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,868
Yeah, dinner reservations.

256
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,237
But, but, but we haven't
even played Celebrity yet.

257
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,339
I...

258
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,675
Why is everybody leaving?

259
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,977
Because this
party blows.

260
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,880
I haven't even had
my first sip yet.

261
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,648
How am I supposed to
write "Both Sides Now"

262
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,450
if I can't even
throw a party?

263
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,452
Look, if you want
everyone to stay,

264
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,588
you have to let me break into
your dads' liquor cabinet.

265
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,290
No one's gonna get
buzzed off two wine coolers.

266
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,993
I'll replace it
before they get home.

267
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,966

288
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,745
No. Designated driver.

289
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,913
What about you?

290
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,315
I'm still trying
to impress Blaine.

291
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,084
Can't get too sloppy.

292
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,387
Clearly, he doesn't
have the same concern.

293
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,855
Hey!

294
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,525
It is so cool that you
and Kurt are brothers.

295
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,726
Right?

296
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,129
Like, brothers! Wow!

297
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,699
You're so tall.

298
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,968
You having
fun, Blaine?
Yeah.

299
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,204
This is
the best party ever!

300
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,139
Finny.

301
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,407
Dance with me.

302
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,075
♪ Fly like a G6 ♪

303
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,044
We had it going on, right?

304
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,513
I wasn't making it
up or anything?

305
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,383
I would do anything
for you. Anything!

306
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,085
Okay, Rachel.

307
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,186
Since this is your
first time at this...

308
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,487
Sit down?

309
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,522
I'm going to break
it down for you.

310
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,224
Guys and girls fall

311
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,360
into certain archetypes
when they get drunk.

312
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,764
Exhibit A-- Santana,
the weepy, hysterical drunk.

313
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,366
You like her
more than me.

314
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,735
She's blonde and
awesome and so smart.

315
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,137
Admit it. Just admit it!

316
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,739
No. Kiss me.

317
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:17,076
Lauren Zizes and Quinn--
the anger girl drunks.

318
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,644
I can't believe what
you did to my body.

319
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,512
I used to
have abs.
Oh, back off!

320
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,715
Who told you that hairstyle
was cool? Geronimo?
Chill out!

321
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:27,253
Brittany, also known as the girl
who turns into a stripper drunk.

Well done, you guys.

497
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,136
I mean, you
always bring it

498
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,537
with the singing
and the dancing,

499
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:43,905
but what I was really
impressed with today

500
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:45,073
was your acting.

501
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:46,374
I truly thought

502
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:47,576
that some of you guys
were drunk.

503
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,177
We take our craft serious.

504
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,313
Problem is, that song is great,

505
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,182
but it-it kind of glorifies
drinking, don't you think?

506
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,117
We're supposed
to sing about the dangers

507
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:57,852
of alcohol for this assembly.

508
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,155
Well, good luck finding
a song that does that.

509
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,323
RACHEL:
Mr. Shue?

510
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,024
First of all,
that vest is very cute.

511
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,126
You are all kinds of awesome.

512
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:07,329
But second, maybe
there's really no songs

513
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,764
about the dangers of drinking
because there's really none

514
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,334
as long as you have
a proper designated driver.

515
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,536
I ever told you
how great you are?

516
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,637
Whoa.
WILL:
Well, Rachel, yeah.

517
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,072
Driving drunk
is dangerous.

518
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,374
And have you guys ever heard
of alcohol poisoning?

519
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,643
Yeah, it kills about 400 people
every year. Uh...

520
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:23,845
(crying)

521
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,280
Santana, are you...
are you crying?

522
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,982
I'm okay. I'm okay.

523
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,216
QUINN:
You're such
a hypocrite.

524
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,151
You drink. Most adults do.

525
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,153
Well, I may have a beer
every now and then,

526
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,521
but I don't...
I don't get drunk.

527
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,956
We're just saying
this is a waste of time.

528
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,524
I mean, we're totally
aware of alcohol.

529
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,026
We see adults
drinking it and having fun.

530
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,127
Every commercial
during NASCAR

531
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:39,995
is for beer.

532
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,263
Okay. Enough, guys.

533
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,332
Look, tomorrow come
with your thinking caps on,

534
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,368
because we're going
to spend the entire day

535
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,336
brainstorming ideas for songs

536
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:49,738
to sing at
this assembly.

537
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,873
(sighs, school bell rings)

538
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,274
Am I out of touch?

539
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,677
I mean, I used to drink
a lot more when I was their age.

540
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:58,179
Most of the time it was just
to deal with Terri, but I mean,

541
00:19:58,247 --> 00:19:59,748
who am I to tell them
not to drink

542
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,149
when I blacked out
a couple of times

543
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,917
when I was their age,
and I ended up okay?

544
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,953
You're taking
this way too hard.

545
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,054
Something else
going on?

546
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,455
Let's see.

547
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,991
Um... my divorce is starting
to really sink in.

548
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,327
Sue's coaching my competition
at Regionals.

549
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:15,263
And Emma is looking for a house
with her husband.

550
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,665
Is that all?

551
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,333
What do you do

552
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:20,235
for stress
relief?
Exercise.

553
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,238
Well, me, too, but that's
a little too close to
being productive.

554
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,640
You got to get a little
ridiculous, man, burn off

555
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,242
some of that angst.
You have
any suggestions?

556
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,743
Tomorrow night,

557
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,645
you're tagging along with me
for my stress relief.

558
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,047
We're going to

559
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,382
a little place
they call Rosalita's Roadhouse.

560
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,552
Isn't that like
a honky-tonk bar?

561
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,722

00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,306
You spent the entire night

That, sir, is what

Hi, Rachel.

573
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,614
Kurt and I were just
talking about you.

574
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:16,551
You're such a cutie pie
with your blazer and your pants.

575
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,521
So...

576
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:21,756
I have a question for you.

577
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,558
I wanted to know...

578
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:24,826
Oh, my God.
Is she drunk?

579
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,294
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

580
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:29,097
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.

581
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,999
All right, I'll
see you then.

582
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,235
Okay, bye.

583
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,339
Rachel just asked me out.

584
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh, that's amazing.

585
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,508
She's got a girl crush on you.

586
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:42,878
(Kurt laughs)

587
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:45,013
Wait a second.
Why'd you say yes?

588
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:46,214
You can't lead her on.

589
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:47,582
Who says I'm
leading her on?

590
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,052
You can't be serious.

591
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,022
When we kissed,
it... it felt good.

592
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,091
It felt good
because you were drunk.

593
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,460
What's the harm in going out
on one crummy little date?

594
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,229
<i>You're gay, Blaine!
I... thought I was, but...</i>

595
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:03,398
I've never even had
a boyfriend before.

596
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:06,568
Isn't this the time you're
supposed to... figure stuff out?

597
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:08,803
I can't believe that I'm
hearing this right now.
Maybe I'm bi. I don't know.

598
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,106
Bisexual's a term that
gay guys in high school use

599
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:13,508
when they want to hold hands
with girls and feel like

600
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,343
a normal person
for a change.
Whoa, wait, wait.

601
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,779
Why are you so angry?
Because I look up to you.

602
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,447
I admire how proud you are

603
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,316
of who you are.
I know what it's like

604
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,318
to be in the closet,
and here you are

605
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:26,288
about to tiptoe back in.
I'm really sorry if this
hurts your feelings

606
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,023
or your pride or whatever,

607
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,592
but however confusing
it might be for you,

608
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,495
it's actually a lot more
confusing for me.

609
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,297
You're 100% sure
who you are.

610
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,098
Fantastic.

611
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,068
Well... maybe we all
can't be so lucky.

612
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,703
Yeah, I have... I've had
a lot of luck, Blaine.

613
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:44,005
I was really lucky to be
chased out of high school

614
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:45,573
by a bully who
threatened to kill me.

615
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,075
And why did he do that?

616
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:48,643
Because he didn't
like who I was.

617
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,979
Sort of exactly what you're
saying to me right now.

618
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:54,249
Isn't it?

619
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,550
I am...

620
00:22:55,618 --> 00:22:56,551
(sighs)

621
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,119
...I'm searching, okay?

622
00:22:58,187 --> 00:23:00,689
I am honestly just
trying to figure out

623
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,190
who I am, and for you,

624
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,759
of all people, to get
down on me for that,

625
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:07,429
I didn't think
that's who you were.

626
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:10,298
I'll see you.

627
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:14,469
I'd say "bye," but I wouldn't
want to make you angry.

considering

710

that you didn't even drink.

711
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,217
Well, I was in
the neighborhood.

712
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,186
At 10:00?
Are you sure you're not here

713
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:20,355
just to find out how
my date with Blaine went?

714
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:21,856
Oh, was that tonight?

715
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:24,626
Look, we're
friends, so...

716
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:26,628
I'm gonna be
honest with you.

♪

718
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:29,931
The date was lovely.

719
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,666
<i>We saw Love Story at
the Revival Theater.</i>

720
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:34,102
We even dressed up
as the characters.

721
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,670
That's not gay at all.

722
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:37,972
Did you kiss?
No. Our lips

723
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,175
spent the evening mouthing
Ali McGraw's dialogue.

724
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:42,243
Frankly, I did expect
a little snog

725
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:44,579
as the date drew
to a close, but...

726
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,381
I guess the timing
just wasn't right.

727
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:47,749
Or the blood-alcohol level.

728
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,585
Look... I know that
you have feelings for him,

729
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,688
and I'm sure you think
I'm crazy for asking him out,

730
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:55,190
but Blaine is
obviously conflicted,

731
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:56,724
and if he
turns out not

732
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,527
to be gay, well, then I guess I
will have done you a favor.

733
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:03,064
And I'm doing you a favor
by telling you that Blaine

734
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:06,834
is the first of a long line
of conflicted men that

735
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,203
you will date
that will later

736
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,405
turn out to be only
thmost flaming of homosexuals.

737
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:12,540
Blaine and I have
a lot in common.

738
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:15,877
A sentiment expressed
by many a hag about many a gay.

739
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:18,213
Look, I don't doubt
that you and Blaine

740
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,150
would have a jolly good time
shopping at Burberry

741
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:23,751
and arguing
who would make

742
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,253
the better Rum Tum Tugger--

743
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,121
I don't dispute that--

744
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,657
but there's something you
and Blaine'll never have...

745
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,326
and that's chemistry.

746
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,730
Fine.

747
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:37,565
Then I'm gonna
prove you wrong.

748
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,067
I'm gonna take

749
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,202
the beer goggles off, and
I'm gonna kiss him sober.

750
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,272
And if the spark is still
there, then I'm taking you

751
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,976
to your bakery of choice for a
piping hot slice of humble pie.

752
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,396
(Beiste laughs)

753
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,765
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
easy, partner.

754
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,901
(slurring): Can I get
you something to drink?

755
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,703
Oh, no, no, no, no.

756
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,738
Taxi's waiting.
All right.

757
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,007
(exhales)
H-H-How are you not drunk?

758
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,876
We drank exactly
the same amount.

759
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:08,644
I got a hollow leg.

760
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,579
(laughs)
You got a hollow leg!

761
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,348
You gonna be okay?

762
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:13,916
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

763
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,052
(grunts) I just... just
got to grade some papers

764
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,587
and... I'm still looking

765
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,923
for a song for the kids to sing

766
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,659
at the Alcohol
Awareness Assembly.

767
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:25,027
Oh...
Yes, uh...

768
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,630
The kids
want to sing a Ke$ha song...

769
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:31,867
but, uh, it just makes drinking
seem like a lot of fun.

770
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:33,602
<i>Sometimes it is fun.</i>

771
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,671
Exactly.
(chuckles)

772
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,139
Like tonight.

773
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,808
That's the most fun I've had
in a really long time.

774
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,777
I mean, we were careful.
Mm-hmm.

775
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,445
We didn't drive.
Mm, yeah.

776
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,647
What's wrong with that?

777
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:45,681
Nothin'.

778
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:47,316
Nothin's wrong with that.

779
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:49,385
Except we're not
teenagers anymore, Will.

780
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,354
You know?

781
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,089
The way I see it,

782
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,624
you can't just
lecture kids.

783
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,860
I mean, we can't stop
them from drinking

784
00:28:57,928 --> 00:28:59,795
if that's what
they're gonna do.

785
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,597
I mean, the best
we can do

786
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:04,033
is make them aware of
the dangers and just...

787
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,234
hope they're
smart enough

788
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:08,604
to make a good
decision on their own.

789
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:10,539
(laughing)

790
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,376
Nut. All right, buddy,
I'm out of here.

791
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:15,811
Okay.
Don't get up.

792
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,246
(grunts)
I'm not...
(slurred muttering)

793
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:19,248
All right, hey.
Yes?

794
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:21,650
You just make sure you
drink lots of water.

795
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,185
Okay?
Mwa!

796
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:24,954
I love you.

797
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,622
Right back at you.

798
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,357
Yay, happy face.

799
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:30,259
Okay.

800
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:31,961
(belches)

801
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,430
That was a valiant effort.

802
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:36,098
You get a A-plus.

803
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,066
That's how I roll.

804
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:40,102
I don't even know who you are.

805
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,542
Oh, what the hell?

806
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:51,847
Hey, there...

807
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,782
sexy lady. (chuckles)

808
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,185
I know it's late.

809
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,288
And... I know you're taken,

810
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:01,457
and I've had
a couple drinks, but...

811
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:07,663
<i>...there's something I r-really,
really want to say to you.</i>

812
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,565
(school bell rings)

813
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,568
William!

814
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,903
Can't wait to see what your
New Directions are planning

815
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:16,939
for the assembly.
I know we've had issues

816
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,274
with your kids performing
in front of the school,

817
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:21,877
but I have a really good feeling
about this one.

818
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,312
(whispers):
Why are you screaming?

819
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,947
I'm not screaming.
Are you okay?

820
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:27,716
Oh... wow, your cologne
is just really strong.

821
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,019
It's Drakar Noir!

822
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:31,620
Emma.
(laughs)
Ooh...

823
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:33,822
Will, you look terrible.

824
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,624
Considering how
much I drank,

825
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,292
I think I'm lucky
to be alive.

826
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,161
(laughs)
Although I kind of
wish I was dead.

827
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,196
I am so embarrassed.

828
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:43,665
Why? I mean, besides
the fact that you drank

829
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,335
like a frat boy
and you're well
into your 30's.

830
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,904
Please don't
make me say it.
Sorry?

831
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,940
I don't even remember
half the things I said to you.
I-I'm not following.

832
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:53,642
I-I drunk-dialed you last night.

833
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,277
No, you didn't.

834
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,246
I mean, I didn't get
a single message.

835
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,848
What would you have said that
you'd be embarrassed about?

836
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:00,983
Nothing.

837
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,785
(school bell rings)
(both laughing)

838
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,286
I-I-I... This
must have been

839
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,755
a really elaborate, uh,
booze dream, yeah.

840
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,590
SUE:
It's time, Will.

841
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,626
I've arranged to have you
committed for 48 hours,

842
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:12,061
and it's not
gonna be easy.

843
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,797
Those state institutions
tend to turn the fire hose

844
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:16,565
on patients going
through the D.T.'s,

845
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,500
but at this point,
I have no other option

846
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,601
but a forced intervention.

847
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,604
Sue, I do not have
a drinking problem.

848
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,506
Really? Then what's with
the Corey Hart imitation?

849
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,541
(sighs)

850
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:27,709
Will, I'm trying to save you.

851
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:30,312
Why? All you ever want
to do is destroy me.

852
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,182
Yeah, well, it's kind of like
nursing a P.O.W. back to health

853
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,384
so he's at his strongest
when you torture him to death.

854
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:36,985
(groans)

855
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:38,487
All right, Will,
you had your chance

856
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:39,988
to do this the easy way.

857
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,790
KURT: Souffle is all
about the whites.

858
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,726
If you get yolk in it
or you don't let it
stiffen properly

859
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:46,628
then you might as well
be making pancakes.

860
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,465
All right. You think the one
we already made is ready yet?

861
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,699
I hope so.

862
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,734
All right, let's check it out.

863
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:54,536
Here we go.

864
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:56,238
Ta-da.
(sighs)

865
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,440
You didn't leave
enough room in the
dish to let it rise.

866
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:00,776
Hey, I'm sorry-- why are
you being so hard on me?

867
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:03,512
I would've been happy
with you teaching me
to make toast.

868
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,448
I'm sorry, Dad, I know
this is supposed to be
bonding time, but...

869
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:07,916
it's Blaine.

870
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:10,552
He's interested...
in Rachel.

871
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:14,022
I'm confused;
I thought he was gay, too.

872
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,424
Oh, he is, he is.

873
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:18,660
He's just...
experimenting.

874
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,230
(laughs)
Yeah. He's not the only one.

875
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:22,698
What does that mean?

876
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,600
Look, I need you to ask me

877
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,435
before you have
someone sleep over.

878
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:28,137
We-we were fullylothed
the entire time,

879
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,240
and Blaine was too drunk to
drive, so I let him crash here.

880
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,441
I was being responsible.

881
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:33,842
Wait a minute,
you kids are drinking now?

882
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,644
Finn and I didn't have any.

883
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,346
If that's what
you're worried about.

884
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,647
No. I'm worried

885
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:41,950
about you being
inappropriate
in my house.

886
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:44,853
And if Puckerman had
a sleepover with Finn,

887
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,722
would that be inappropriate?

888
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,690
That's different.
Because they
wouldn't have sex?

889
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:53,128
No, I would never allow Finn
to have a girl sleep over

890
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:54,763
in his bed.

891
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:56,732
But would it make you
uncomfortable if he did?

892
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,700
Hey, when have
I been uncomfortable

893
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,969
<i>with you being gay?
So it's not being gay
that upsets you,</i>

894
00:33:01,037 --> 00:33:02,337
it's just me acting on it.

895
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:05,140
I don't know what two guys do
when they're together.

896
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,876
<i>You know, I sat through
that whole Brokeback Mountain.</i>

897
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,444
From what I gather,

898
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,246
something went down
in the tent.

899
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:12,781
Okay. What do you want
from me here, Dad? I...

900
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,717
I want you to apologize
for being inappropriate

901
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,387
and promise me
you'll never do it again.

902
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:23,058
Fine. I'm sorry.

903
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,994
I won't have sleepovers with
anyone that might be gay

904
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:27,996
without asking you first.

905
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,732
Thank you.

906
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,241
But maybe you could step
outside your comfort zone

907
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,543
and educate yourself, so
if I have any questions,

908
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:44,646
I could go to my dad, like
any straight son could.

909
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:52,424
. Quiet,
please, children.

910
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:54,960
I would like
to wish you and yours

911
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:58,030
a healthy and happy
Alcohol Awareness Week.

912
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,565
Unfortunately,

913
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:02,434
Kitty Dukakis could not be here
because of disinterest,

914
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:06,372
but Lima Police Chief
Lawrence Krowley is here

915
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:09,808
to show you a grisly slideshow
of auto accidents.

916
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,343
Take it away, Chief.

917
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:12,845
BRITTANY: You guys, I'm
really nervous.

918
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:15,614
Ke$ha's been
a cultural icon for weeks,

919
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:17,816
and I really want
to do her music justice.

920
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:20,152
We haven't had enough rehearsal.
Or any at all.

921
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,587
And most of our
assembly performances

922
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:22,554
usually end
in some kind of riot.

923
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:23,889
Never fear, teammates.

924
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,691
Now, it's a Broadway tradition
for nervous performers

925
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,192
to take a shot of whiskey
before going on

926
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,394
to calm their nerves

927
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:29,995
and to mask the stench
of bad dental hygiene.

928
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:32,331
In that tradition, I have mixed
us a playful showbiz cocktail

929
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,000
of what was left in
my dads' liquor cabinet.

930
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,769
There's some brandy
and vermouth and port wine

931
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:38,303
and scotch in here, and also
a little bit of Kool-Aid

932
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:39,538
and some crumbled-up Oreos.

933
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:40,606
SANTANA:
Oh, my God.

934
00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:41,673
This tastes like
cough syrup.

935
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:42,775
There's also cough syrup.

936
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:43,742
ALL: Cheers.
To Ke$ha.

937
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,843
Cheers. Ke$ha.

938
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:46,211
To Ke$ha.
To Ke$ha.

939
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,713
Thank you, Chief.

940
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,915
And now,
performing the hit single,

941
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,884
"Tik and also Tok"

942
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,787
by rapper Ke-dollar-sign-ha,

943
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,456
the New Directions.

944
00:34:57,524 --> 00:34:58,991
(microphone feedback squeals)

945
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:00,759

Heads up, McKinley.

1001
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,699
Coach Sylvester's
gonna shout at ya.

1002
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,068
Students,

1003
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,704
colleagues, indeed,

1004
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:28,974
all who understand
the Queen's English...

1005
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:32,744
we all still quake in terror
at what we witnessed yesterday

1006
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:35,147
at the assembly by a Glee Club

1007
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,749
spiraling out of control.

1008
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:39,785
My nose is still filled

1009
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:42,688
with the acrid stench
of teen vomit.

1010
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:45,557
And there is, simply,
but one person to blame.

1011
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:49,127
The alcoholic teen-vomit
fetishist Will Schuester,

1012
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:52,264
the director of that club.

1013
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,333
Two days ago,

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,901
I received a drunk dial

1015
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,869
in the middle of the night
from a horny Will Schuester.

1016
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:59,037
Oh, no.

1017
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,806
Open your ears, McKinley High,

1018
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,941
and behold the awful price

1019
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,043
of alcoholism.

1020
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,478
(phone beeps)

1021
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:09,514
WILL (on phone):
Hey there, sexy lady.

1022
00:38:09,582 --> 00:38:11,083
(laughs)

1023
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,152
There's something I really,
really want to say to you.

1024
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,054
I love how you eat your lunch

1025
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,557
with your little plastic gloves,
and they crinkle

1026
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,393
and make the cutest sound I've
ever heard in my life.

1027
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:25,263
Why don't you pick up
some wine coolers,

1028
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:27,366
and come over here?

1029
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,201
And it'll be just one night
of us just getting crazy.

1030
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:31,236
Let's just get crazy!

1031
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:34,673
Let's get really crazy
and roll around in the hay.

1032
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:35,907
(laughing)

1033
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:38,010
I was just in some hay
earlier tonight,

1034
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:40,412
and I rode a bull
and I was thinking of you.

1035
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,219
(phone beeps off)
Will Schuester?

1036
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,588
You've just been
publicly humiliated.

1037
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:51,690
And on the road to recovery,

1038
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,559
it's the very first step.

1039
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:06,819
I think you'll
definitely get suspended.

1040
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,354
You'll probably all
get suspended.

1041
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:11,491
Oh, you're one to talk. How
about you crack a Four Loko,

1042
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,525
Count Boozy Von Drunk-a-ton.

1043
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:18,064
William? Glee Club?

1044
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:20,266
I have one word for you.

1045
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:23,069
Congratulations.

1046
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:26,839
Those special effects at
the assembly really paid off!

1047
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,875
I had no idea what brilliant

1048
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:32,378
musical comedy performers
you all have become.

1049
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:33,713
The kids at this school

1050
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:34,714
are scared straight.

1051
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:35,782
Today is the first day

1052
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,650
in a month without a single act

1053
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,452
of public drunkenness

1054
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,121
at McKinley High!

1055
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:44,624
And as a thank
you, here are

1056
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,692
coupons
for half-off frozen yogurt.

1057
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,394
Yum.

1058
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:49,796
(all chuckling)

1059
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:52,498
William, I do think
you need to see someone

1060
00:39:52,566 --> 00:39:54,934
about your sex
and love addiction.

1061
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:57,537
I've talked
to my pastor about you,

1062
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,706
and he's willing to meet you
at your earliest convenience.

1063
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,074
Thank you.

1064
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,309
Okay.

1065
00:40:03,377 --> 00:40:04,377
Achievement!

1066
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,446
(half-hearted cheering)

1067
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:10,883
I'm torn. Part of me never wants
to drink again because it made

1068
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,820
me so sick, but if it weren't
for drinking, the assembly would

1069
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:16,022
have been a disaster.
I, for one, am never
drinking again.

1070
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:18,391
Being thrown up on, it just
does something to a person.

1071
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,993
All right, guys, while I'm happy
things worked out

1072
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:22,862
with the assembly,

1073
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,431
I never want to see you guys
pull anything like that again.

1074
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:27,934
Drinking while performing
is unprofessional.

1075
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,335
Drinking while at school
is just stupid,

1076
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:31,003
and, most importantly,

1077
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:32,839
any of you guys
drinking at all is illegal.

1078
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:34,106
There's a fair
amount of the pot

1079
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:35,308
calling the kettle
black right now.

1080
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,143
(whispers):
That is so racist.

1081
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:38,411
WILL:
I couldn't agree more.

1082
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,413
Which is why I'm going
to stop drinking.

1083
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,415
Not even a beer at the end of
the night to take the edge off.

1084
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,317
But if you don't drink,

1085
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,551
what will you have
to live for?

1086
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,120
I have plenty
in my life without beer.

1087
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:49,455
Like what, exactly?

1088
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:52,158
The point is, I'm going to stop.

1089
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:53,492
And I hope you guys do, too.

1090
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,428
Isn't that kind
of unrealistic?

1091
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,463
Yeah. Honestly,
I think it is.

1092
00:40:57,531 --> 00:40:59,298
Which is why I'm only
going to ask you to do it

1093
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:01,400
until after Nationals.

1094
00:41:01,468 --> 00:41:03,402
Consider yourselves
like prize fighters

1095
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,405
getting ready for a
big heavyweight bout.

1096
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:09,208
Now, these are
pledge forms.

1097
00:41:09,276 --> 00:41:10,910
And I want you guys

1098
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:12,178
to sign them.

1099
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:13,379
And what if we fall
off the wagon again?

1100
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:16,649
Look in the top corner
of your form.

1101
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:18,484
That's my cell phone number.
Yes!

1102
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:21,587
Part of your pledge
is that if you do slip up,

1103
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:24,457
no matter where you are,
or what time of the night it is,

1104
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,892
I want you to call me
to drive you home.

1105
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,262
We got lucky this time
that the only consequences

1106
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,564
of your drinking
was some ill-timed vomiting.

1107
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:34,734
None of us wants to see any
of you guys get hurt.

1108
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,035
Cool beans, Mr. Shue.
I'll sign this.

1109
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:38,938
Me, too. I mean,
alcohol has done nothing

1110
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:40,439
for my songwriting.

1111
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:43,509
What about
after we win Nationals?

1112
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:51,150
I'm buying the sparkling cider.

1113
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,919
(all chuckling)
SAM:
Yes.

1114
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:54,287
So, you said he comes
this way at 3:30?

1115
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:56,555
Like clockwork. For his
post-rehearsal medium drip.

1116
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,057
I just can't wait
to lay one on him.

1117
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,259
I've got a bad feeling
about this, Rachel.

1118
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:01,694
I mean, I don't mean
to be schooled,

1119
00:42:01,762 --> 00:42:03,429
but I don't want you
to get hurt, either.

1120
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:05,131
There's no victory in this
for me, either way.

1121
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:06,399
Who cares about you, buddy?

1122
00:42:06,466 --> 00:42:07,767
I might get a new
boyfriend out of this,

1123
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,635
who can keep up with me
vocally, and in the future,

1124
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:10,903
give me vaguely Eurasian-
looking children.

1125
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,538
KURT:
There he is.

1126
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:15,207
Dreamy as ever.

1127
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,176
Okay. Wish me luck.

1128
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,946
♪ I feel the earth move
under my feet ♪

1129
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:21,047

Huh.

1137
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:37,897
Yep.

1138
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:39,065
I'm gay.

1139
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:41,867
100% gay.

1140
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,704
Thank you so much for clearing
that up for me, Rachel.

1141
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,905
Listen, save my space
in line, will you?

1142
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:47,039
I got to go hit
the restroom.

That was hard,
wasn't it?

1147
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:57,049
Are you kidding?

1148
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,285
That was amazing.

1149
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:00,753
I am speechless.

1150
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:02,455
I just had

1151
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:04,323
a relationship with a guy
who turned out to be gay.

1152
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,992
That is songwriting gold.

1153
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,460
Oh!

1154
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:08,894
Okay. I have
to go compose.

1155
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,796
But thank you. Thank you.

1156
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:15,601
