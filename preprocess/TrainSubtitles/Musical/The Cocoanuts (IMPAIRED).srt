What's the matter?
Somebody pay their bill?

[All]
We want our money.
Yes, money.

You want your money?
We wanna get paid.

Oh, you want my money?
Is that fair?
Do I want your money?

00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,562
Suppose George Washington's
soldiers had asked for money?
Where would this country be today?

10
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,121
But they did ask.
And where's Washington?

11
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,193
No, my friends. No, money will
never make you happy, and happy
will never make you money.

12
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,262
That might be a wisecrack,

00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,542
Let's get together and
we'll make a regular hotel
out of this place.

16
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,577
I'll put writing paper in the hotel,
and next year if you behave
yourselves, I'll put in envelopes.

17
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,886

Think of the opportunities
here in Florida.

19
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,857
Three years ago I came to Florida
without a nickel in my pocket.

20
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,730
And now I've got a nickel
in my pocket.
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer,

21
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,237
but we haven't been paid
in two weeks and we want our wages.

22
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,297
Wages?
Do you wanna be wage slaves?
Answer me that.

23
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,141
No.
No, of course not.
Well, what makes wage slaves?

24
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,340
Wages. I want you to be free.

25

liberty, except <i>Colliers</i> and

Pardon me. A couple of telegrams
for you, Mr. Hammer.
There you are.

29

Business is beginning
to pick up already.

They must be mice.

"If we like your property,
we will immediately buy it."

34
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,640
See that, things have
started our way already.
Who's it from?

35
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,618
Western Union,

Well, I'll take the bus down myself.

See, we're gonna be
stuffed by tonight.

38
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:32,462
This hotel will be so crowded
that we'll be turning away
thousands of people.

39
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,059
"If there is another hotel
in Cocoanut Beach,
cancel our reservations."

Yes, sir.

You bet I will.
I'll be back someday.

Keep a light burning in the window,

All right, sir. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Jamison.

62
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,917
Hello, Harvey.
Why so downhearted?

63
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,653
Is Bob Adams cutting
you out with Polly Potter?

64
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:19,687
I'm not worried about a hotel clerk.
No, but I'll bet you're worried
about the Potter millions.

65
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,929
You generally could use money
in the old days.
Oh, lay off that stuff.

66
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,166
You know, marrying Polly
is the only way for you
to square your debts.

67
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,902
I can take care of myself.
I doubt it.

68
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:36,706
Suppose I have a little plan
that'll take care of both of us.
What do you mean?

69
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,512
Have you ever seen that diamond
necklace of Mrs. Potter's?

70
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,679
You bet I have.
What's that got to do with us?

71
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,183
Her room and my room
are right next to each other.

72
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,594
Hers is 318; mine, 320.

73
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,827
The door between is unlocked.
Well?

74
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,893
She keeps everything in a jewel case
locked up in her dresser.

75
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,633
The key is always in her bag.
That's what you've got to get.

76
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,870
It's a large order,
but maybe it can be done.

77
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,244
Suppose I invite Mrs. Potter
and Polly to take supper
with me tonight?

78
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,546
What then?
Sometime during the evening...

79
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,781
I might be able to get
the key out of her bag.

80
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,655
Now you're talking.
That sounds more like old times.

81
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,990
And now I will try and get rid
of Bob Adams for you.

82
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,295
Look, this is Cocoanut Manor.
You know that hill?

83
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,169
What a question.
Do I know that cunning little hill?

84
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,540
It's cunning, all right.
But that's why there hasn't been
any development here.

85
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,602
Couldn't it be cut down?

86
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,342
Too expensive.
Now, here's what happened.

87
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,884
John W. Berryman
was here to see it last month.

88
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,719
You know, Berryman practically
built Palm Beach and Miami,
but he said he wouldn't touch this.

89
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,749
Now when a man like that passes
a place up, no one wants it.

90
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:59,662
Do you know anything
about architecture?
No, but I'd love to learn.

91
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,828
Well, I made a drawing
of the whole place showing the hills.

92
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,465
It's a built-up scheme,
without cutting down the hill
or having it get in the way.

93
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,704
I made the hill fit in
with the architectural scheme.

94
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,802
I sent Berryman a copy last week,

95
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,712
and his secretary
wrote me a nice note saying
they were studying my plans.

96
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,012
That's thrilling.
Does Mr. Hammer know about it?

97
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,112
Not yet. But if he takes it,
I'll design the buildings.

98
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,123
Say, I may be an architect yet.

99
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,752
If he only does, I'm sure it
will be the most beautiful
place in the world.

100
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,525
It would be...
if you lived there.

101
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,931
Look, see what I've written?

102
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,766
"Heaven for Polly and me."

103
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,239
That looks great.
When do I move in?

104
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,368
Any day now.
It's a lovely dream, Bob.

147

Will you look at that?
I am looking.

148
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:20,388
Well, it's darn cute.
I wonder who it can be.
Let's find out.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,959
Then little Red Riding Hood
said to the wolf,
"Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf."

152
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,373
She generally is,
and she generally finds me.

153
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,538
You know Mother.
Thanks a lot.

154
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,641
It was a lovely story, Mr. Adams.
I'd like to hear
the rest of it sometime.

155
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,845
Good-bye.

156
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,617
I wonder if I could
hear it sometime.

157
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,784
With pleasure.
How about you, Yates?

158
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,456
No, thanks.
You know what happens
to bad little boys who tell stories?

159
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,160
Certainly. They marry
the beautiful princess.

160
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,260
So long.

161
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,602
And I'll be there

162
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,472
With you

163
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,536
When my dreams

164
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,549
Come

165
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,085
<i>True</i>

166
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,387
Nice boy. The kind who usually
gets what he wants.

167
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,760
Not always.
I might win out yet.

168
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,892
Well, miracles do happen.

169
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,464
Well, Polly, you've been
out again with Mr. Adams.

170
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,599
But only for a little while,
Mother.

171
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,974
Why a daughter of mine should
fool around with a hotel clerk...

172
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,843
when she has the opportunity of
marrying one of the Boston Yates...

173
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,849
is more than I can understand,

174
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,886
Oh, who cares
about the Boston Yates?

175
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,513
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk.
He's an architect.

176
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,251
He's only clerking
until he can get started.

177
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,351
One who clerks, Polly,
is a clerk, and that settles it.

178
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,621
And I want you to remember
that no Potter...

179
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,226
has ever been involved
in a single scandal.

180
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,294
How about Uncle Dick?

181
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,567
Polly, it's a well-known fact...

182
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,771
that your uncle was drunk at the time.

183
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,337
<i>And another thing, young lady,</i>
<i>I'm quite tired of your</i>
<i>sitting out on the beach...</i>

184
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,508
<i>all hours of the night.</i>

185
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,213
Hey. Hey. Why don't you take
something for that insomnia?

186
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,621
You ought to cut out drinking
so much coffee.
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,627
Say, any luck with the 4:30?
Yes, it didn't hit me.
That's the only luck I had with it.

188
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,925
Mr. Hammer, I think I know
what's wrong with the hotel.

189
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,966
I think I know too. You're fired.
Get your hat and my coat
and get out.

190
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,902
Maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.

191
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,439
Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.
In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.

192
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,307
Yes, and making the beds.
Go on, get out of here.
I can handle this rush myself.

193
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,574
600 rooms in the hotel
and you have to sleep here.
How do you do, Mr. Hammer?

194
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,480
Why don't you whistle at the crossing?
You're just the woman I'm looking for.

195
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,348
Now whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna tell you
about Florida real estate.

196
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,186
It's the first time it's ever
been mentioned down here, today.
I'm sorry, but...

197
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,159
Do you know that property values
have increased 1929 since 1,000%?

198
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,923
Do you know that this
is the biggest development
since Sophie Tucker?

199
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:09,127
Do you know that Florida is the show spot
of America and Cocoanut Beach
is the black spot of Florida?

200
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,329
You told me about this yesterday.
I know, but I left out a comma. Look.

201
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,841
In a little while we're gonna
hold an auction sale at Cocoanut Manor,
the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.

202
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,208
You must come over.
There's gonna be entertainment,
sandwiches and the auction.

203
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,543
If you don't like auctions,
we can play contract.

204
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,573
Here it is. Cocoanut Manor,
42 hours from Times Square
by railroad.

205
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,144
1,600 miles as the crow flies,
1,800 as the horseflies.

206
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,352
There you are, Cocoanut Manor
glorifying the American sewer
and the Florida sucker.

207
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,021
Why, it's the most exclusive
residential district in Florida.
Nobody lives there.

208
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,328
And the climate... Ask me
about the climate, I dare you.
Very well. How...

209
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,803
I'm glad you brought it up.
Our motto is, Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice and no business.

210
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,465
Do you know that Florida is
the greatest state in the Union?
Is it?

211
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,668
Take its climate. No, we took that.
Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.

212
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,611
Take all the alligator pears
and keep 'em. See if I care.

213
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,740
Do you know how alligator pears
are made?
Haven't the slightest idea.

214
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,445
That's because
you've never been an alligator,
and don't let it happen again.

215
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,012
Do you know that it sometimes
requires years to bring the pear
and the alligator together?

216
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,853
They don't like each other.
No.

217
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,123
No. Do you know how many alligator
pears are sent out of this state every year
and told not to come back?

218
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,528
I don't think I do.
All they can get a hold of.

219
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,000
Florida feeds the nation,
but nobody feeds me and that's
what I wanna talk to you about.

220
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,367
Mr. Hammer...
Another thing,
take our cattle raising.

221
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,306
I don't mean anything personal.
But here is the ideal cattle
raising section.

222
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,935
We have longhorns, shorthorns
and shoehorns.

223
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,104
Mr. Hammer, will you let me
say something, please?

224
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,876
I hardly think so,
and there's something else
I wanna bring to your mind.

225
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,646
Where will you be when you're 65?
That's only about three months from now.

226
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,281
If I were to buy, I should prefer
someplace like Palm Beach.

227
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,793
Palm Beach?
The Atlantic City of yesterday?
The slums of tomorrow?

228
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,852
Do you know that the population
of Cocoanut Beach
has doubled in the past week?

229
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,889
Has it?
Three bulldogs were born.
We're expecting a nanny goat in the morning.

230
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,629
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I must be going.
Aw, now, don't go.

231
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,332
Before you go, let me show you
a sample of our sewer pipe
we're gonna lay.

232
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,740
Look at it. Nobody could fool you
on a sewer pipe, can they,
a woman like you?

233
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,745
Now this is the eight-inch pipe.

234
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,475
But of course, all property
owners will be allowed to vote
on the size of their pipe.

235
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,680
In case of a tie, it goes to the Supreme Court,
and I can give you a little
inside information in advance.

236
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,957
The chief justice is crazy
about this type of sewer.

237
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,391
Here, put it in your pocket.
I'll see you later.

238
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,191
Mr. Hammer, I can't use this.
I don't want it.

239
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,294
[Ringing]

240
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,734
Hello. Yes?

241
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,506
Ice water in 318?

242
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,548
Is that so?
Where'd you get it?

243
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,083
Oh, you want some?
Oh, that's different.

244
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,449
Have you got any ice?
No, I haven't.

245
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,580
This is Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice.

246
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,352
Get some onions.
That'll make your eyes water.

247
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,418
What? You too!

248
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,390
Oh, Mr. Hammer.
Mrs. Thompson wants to know...

249
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,264
if you'd reserve a table for dinner
for her in a nice quiet spot.

250
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,497
A nice quiet spot?
Yeah.

251
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,436
Tell her she can eat in the lobby.

252
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,603
We ought to dress this place up a bit.
It looks terrible.

253
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,044
Front. Front.

254
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,048
Front. Here, front.

255
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,711
Here, front.
Here, front, front, front, front.

256
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,584
Jamison, what's become of our front?
Are we all out of front?
I haven't seen 'em.

257
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,352
I'm gonna fire some of those people.
Give me the fire bell.

258
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:25,124
Why don't you stick around here.
If anybody comes in that looks like
a customer, tie 'em and brand 'em.

259
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,427
Yes, sir.

260
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,764
Look at him.
He's dressed better than I am.

261
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,838
[Horn Honking]

262
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,635
[Whistles]
Hey, come on. Come on.
[Honking]

263
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,812
Hey, come here. Come here.
Come here!

264
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,319
- <i>Gentlemen, how do you do?</i>
- How do you do?

265
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,515
Are you boys giving me
the runaround? Come over here.

266
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,127
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.

267
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,131
We send you a telegram.
Oh, you're the boys
that sent the telegram?

268
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,396
How do you do?
That's a coincidence.
I used to send telegrams myself.

269
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,402
How are you?
And how are you?
[Honks]

270
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,897
That's all right. Don't worry.

271
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,794
Say, you can stay, but you'll have
to take that groundhog out of here.

272
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,795
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.

273
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,024
We make a "reservash."
"Reservash"?

274
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,090
Yes. We want a room
and no bath.

275
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,604
Oh, I see. You're just here for the winter.
Well, step this way and
I'll see what I can do for you.

276
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,698
All right. We stay for the summer too.
I'm sorry, boys,
but we haven't got any vacancies.

277
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,675
He's got no vacancies?
<i>We got plenty of rooms.</i>

278
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,837
That's all right, we take a room.
You want a room?
[Honks]

279
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,747
All right, we take a vacancy.
<i>Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.</i>

280
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,149
Hey, what are you...

281
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,210
<i>[Bell Dings]</i>

282
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,956
Hey, hey, do you know
that suitcase is empty?

283
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,993
That's all right.
We'll fill it up before we leave.

284
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,654
Oh, you will, eh?
Well, you'll empty it before I go out.

285
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,292
Step this way, boys.
Just put your moniker on there
and everything will be "A.K."

286
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,696
Look what he do.
Don't do that.

287
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,706
Step right this way, boy.
Three shots for five.
He never misses.

288
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,800
This boy wins the gold cigar.
Anybody else? Step right this way.

289
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,641
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't throw that.

290
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,841
That's only for long distance.
All right, all right.

291
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,316

No, I was in... You was up...

441
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,728
You were inside out and I was up...
Uh, no...

442
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,791
I'll tell you, if you don't hear
from me by next Friday,
the whole thing's off.

443
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,535
I don't think I understand.
I mean, your eyes... your eyes,

444
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,805
they shine like the pants
of a blue serge suit.

445
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,403
What? That's an insult.

446
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,746
That's not a reflection on you.
That's on the pants.

447
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,217
What I meant was
if we had a nice bungalow...

448
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,517
and I came home from work
and you were standing by the gate...

449
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,048
No, you came home from work
and I was standing by the gate.

450
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,187
That's more like it.
And we came down the path...

451
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,959
and we went inside
and the shades were drawn...

452
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,992
and the lights were low,
and, uh... then, uh...

453
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,935
Are you sure
your husband's dead?

454
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,133
Why, yes.

455
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,405
There seems to be a trace
of uncertainty in that "yes."

456
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,845
You know, a yes like that
was once responsible for me
jumping out of a window.

457
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,612
And I'm not the jumper
I used to be.

458
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:20,248
What I meant was, you're gonna
be here all winter and I'm
stuck with the hotel anyhow,

459
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,191
why don't you grab me until
you can make other arrangements?

460
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:27,561
My dear, Mr. Hammer,
I shall never get married
before my daughter.

461
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,430
You did once.

462
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,162
Oh, but I love you.
I love you.

463
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,830
Can't you see how
I'm pining for you?

464
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,067
What in the world
is the matter with you?

465
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,373
Oh, I'm not myself tonight.
I don't know who I am.

466
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,380
One false move and I'm yours.

467
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,179
I love you.
I love you anyhow.

468
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,913
I don't think you'd love me
if I were poor.

469
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,013
I might, but I'd keep
my mouth shut.

470
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,719
I'll not stay here any longer
and be insulted this way.

471
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,126
No, don't go away
and leave me here alone.
You stay here and I'll go away.

472
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,930
I don't know what to say.
Say that you'll be truly mine,
or truly yours or yours truly.

473
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:08,267
Don't you know that I'm...
Will you keep your hands
to yourself!

474
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,069
Come on.
I'll play you one more game.

475
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,269
Come on.
The three of you.

476
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,436
Ohhh.

477
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,680
Can you come down
a little bit?

478
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,447
Just think, tonight... tonight...

479
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,082
when the moon
is sneaking around the clouds,
I'll be sneaking around you.

480
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,285
I'll meet you tonight
under the moon.

481
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,158
Oh, I can see you now...
you and the moon.

482
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,164
You wear a necktie
so I'll know you.

Send up some ice water right away.

That's right. Thank you.
<i>[Knocking]</i>

486

Thank goodness.
Close the door.

487
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,947
Did you get the key?
Yes. It's one of these.

488
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,120
Oh, that's fine. Now, listen.
We can't take any chances on this job.

489
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,664
How do you mean?
There's bound to be trouble
when she misses the necklace.

490
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,223
Well?
We can't have it found on us.

491
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,498
I should say not.
We've got to play it safe
and hide it somewhere for a while.

492
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,505
Hide it?
Just for a few days.

493
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,564
Yes, but where?
Anywhere but in here.

494
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,905
Hide it?
I know just the place.

495
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,571
A hollow tree stump about a mile
from here. Will that do?

496
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,877
Fine, but how do I get there?
It's Cocoanut Manor.
You've been out there.

497
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,783
I'm not so sure, Harvey.
Here, I'll show you.

498
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:53,381
Now, you... you go
right out Cocoanut Road.

499
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,391
Then there's Augustine Road,
like this,

500
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,984
but instead,
you take the Granada Road.

501
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,759
Suddenly, you come to a clearing
with a fringe of trees around it.

502
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,993
That's Cocoanut Manor
where the stump is.

503
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,697
It's about 20 feet
from the edge of the clearing.

504
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,332
That's where you put the jewels.
You can't miss it.

505
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,433
Now you take the necklace
right out there, see?

506
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,673
I've got to go back downstairs,
or Mrs. Potter will be suspicious.

507
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,340
And be careful.
I will.

508
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,227
Cocoanut Manor, Granada Road,

509
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,095
20 feet from the clearing.

510
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,000
Everything's going along
swimmingly now.

511
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,499
Do you remember me?
The prince of Wales?
Why, yes, of course I do...

512
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,132
Mr. Hammer, how dare
you come into my room?
<i>[Door Slams Shut]</i>

513
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,699
If there's gonna be
two people in this room,
it'll be 50 cents extra.

Anybody.

Well, everything seems
to be all right in here.

Come over here. I wanna see you.
Now listen to me.

I'm not gonna have
that red-headed fellow
running around the lobby.

552
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,083
If you wanna keep him up in the room,
you'll have to keep him in a trap.

00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,095
I can't catch him.
Who is he?

That's a my partner, but he no speak.
Oh, that's your silent partner.

555
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,726
Well, anyhow, you wired me
about some property.
I've thought it over.

556
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,828
Now, I can let you have
three lots watering the front,

557
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,533
or I can let you have three lots
fronting the water.

558
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:42,170
Now, these lots cost me $ 9,000
and I'm gonna let you have them
for 15 because I like you.

559
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,079
I no buy nothing.
I ain't got a no money.
What?

00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,447
You got a no money?
I no got a one cent.

561
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,679
How are you gonna pay
for your room?
That's your lookout.

562
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,018
Oh, you're just an idle "roomer."

563
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,921
Well, you see, we come here
to make money.

564
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,790
I read in the paper and it say,
"Big Boom In Florida."
So we come.

565
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,353
We're a couple of big booms too.
I'll show you how you can
make some real money.

566
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,959
I'm going to hold an auction
in a little while in Cocoanut Manor.

567
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,335
You know what an auction is, eh?
I come from Italy
on the <i>Atlantic Auction.</i>

568
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,706
Well, let's go ahead
as if nothing happened.

569
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,710
I say I'm holding an auction
at Cocoanut Manor.

570
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,076
And when the crowd
gathers around, I want you
to mingle with them.

571
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,583
Don't pick their pockets,
just mingle with them...
I'll find time for both.

572
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,915
Well, maybe we can
cut out the auction.

573
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,454
Here's what I mean.
If somebody says $100,
you say two.

574
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,513
If somebody says two, you say three.
Bid up.

575
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,617
That's right. Now,
if nobody says anything,
then you start it off.

576
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,892
How am I gonna know
when they no say nothin'?
Well, they'll probably notify you.

577
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,433
You fool, if they don't say anything,
you'll hear 'em, won't you?

578
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,164
Well, maybe I no listen.
Well, don't tell 'em.

579
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,174
Now then, if we're successful
in disposing of these lots, I'll see
that you get a nice commission.

580
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,837
And how about some money?
Well, you can have your choice.

581
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,642
Now, in arranging these lots,
of course, we use blueprints.

582
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:55,014
You know what
a blueprint is, huh?
It's oysters.

583
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:59,021
How is it you never got
double pneumonia?
I go around by myself.

584
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,588
Do. You know what a lot is?
Yeah, it's too much.

585
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,493
I don't mean a whole lot.
Just a little lot with nothing on it.

586
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,464
Anytime you got a too much,
you got a whole lot.
Look, I explain it to you.

587
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,933
Sometimes you no got a enough.
Sometimes you got a whole lot.

588
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,867
Sometimes you got a little bit.
You no think it's enough.

589
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,531
Somebody else maybe
think it's a too much.
It's a whole lot too.

590
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,202
Now, a whole lot is a too much,
too much is a whole lot.
Same thing.

591
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,303
The next time I see you,
remind me not to talk to you,
will you?

592
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,543
All right...
Come over here, Rand McNally,
and I'll explain this thing to you.

593
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,849
Now look, this is a map and diagram
of the whole Cocoanut section.

594
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:35,415
This whole area is within
a radius of approximately
three-quarters of a mile.

595
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:40,259
Radius. Is there a remote possibility
that you know what radius means?

596
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,596
It's a W.J.Z.
Well, I walked right into that one.

597
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,535
It's gonna be a cinch explaining
the rest of this thing to you,
I can see that.

598
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,301
I catch on quick.
That's a rodeo you're thinking of.

599
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,572
Look, Einstein.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.

600
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,909
No matter what you say,
this is Cocoanut Manor.

601
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,744
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Heights.

602
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,682
That's a swamp.

603
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,882
And right over here
where the road forks,
that's Cocoanut Junction.

604
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,618
Where have you got
Cocoanut Custard?

605
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,626
That's on one of the forks.

606
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,754
You probably eat with your knife,
so you won't have to worry about that.

607
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,527
Now, here is the main road
leading out of Cocoanut Manor.

608
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,659
That's the road
I wish you were on.

609
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,102
Now, over here on this site
we're gonna build
an eye and ear hospital.

610
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,902
This is gonna be
a sight for sore eyes.

611
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,408
You understand?
That's fine.

612
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,639
Now, right over here,
this is the residential section.

613
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,738
People live there, huh?

614
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,010
No, that's the stockyards.

615
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,450
Now all along here,
this is the riverfront,

616
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,479
and all along the river...
all along the river,
those are all levees.

617
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,787
That's the Jewish neighborhood?

618
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,291
Well, we'll pass over that.

619
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,297
You're a peach, boy.

620
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,064
Now, here is a little peninsula,
and here is a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.

621
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,764
Why a duck?
I'm all right. How are you?

622
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,502
I say here is a little peninsula,
and here's a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.

623
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,238
All right. Why a duck?

624
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,974
I'm not playing Ask Me Another.
I say that's a viaduct.

625
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,506
All right. Why a duck?
Why a duck? Why a no chicken?

626
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,610
I don't know why a no chicken.

627
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,713
I'm a stranger here myself.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.

628
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,123
You try to cross over there a chicken,
and you'll find out viaduct.

629
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,357
I no go someplace...
It's deep water, that's why a duck.

630
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,954
It's deep water.
That's why a duck.

631
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,865
Look, rube. Suppose you were
out horseback riding...

632
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,495
and you came to that stream
and wanted to ford over.

633
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,539
You couldn't make it.
It's too deep.

634
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,803
But what do you want with a Ford
if you got a horse?

635
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,901
Well, I'm sorry the matter
ever came up.

636
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,446
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
Look. All right.

637
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,312
I catch on to why a horse,
why a chicken, why a this, why a that.

638
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,352
I no catch on to why a duck.

639
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,582
Well, I was only fooling.
I was only fooling.

640
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,817
They're gonna build a tunnel
there in the morning.

641
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:51,588
Now, is that clear to you?
Yes, everything except
why a duck.

642
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,028
Well, that's fine. Then we can
go ahead with this thing.

643
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,032
Now, look, I'm gonna take you down
and show you our cemetery.

644
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,194
I've got a waiting list of 50 people
at that cemetery just dying to get in.

645
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,135
But I like you.
You're my friend.

646
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,639
I like you and I'm gonna shove you
in ahead of all of them.
I know you like me.

647
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,074
I'm gonna see that
you get a steady position.
That's a good.

648
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,578
And if I can arrange it,
it'll be horizontal.

649
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,171
Now remember,
when the auction starts,
if somebody says $100...

650
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,739
I say 200.
That's grand.

651
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,842
Now, if somebody says 200.
I say 300.

652
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,046
That's great.
Now, you know how
to get down there?

653
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,986
No...
Now, look.

654
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,218
You go down there,
down that narrow path there...

655
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,385
until you come
to that little jungle there.

656
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,396
You see it?
Where those thatched palms are.
Yes, I see.

657
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,261
And then there's
a little clearing there...

658
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,665
a little clearing with
a wire fence around it.

659
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,670
You see that wire fence there?
All right. Why a fence?

660
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,605
Oh, no, we're not gonna go
all through that again.

661
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,073
You come along with me
and I'll fix you up.

662
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,973
I know what you mean.
Bid 'em up. Go higher.
One say 100, 2... 200, 300.

663
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,143
That's it. If somebody says
$100, you say 200.
If somebody says two, you say three.

664
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,382
Help me put this deal over,
you can have anything you got.
I got a nothing.

665
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,390
Be alert. That's it. Be alert.

666
00:49:54,458 --> 00:50:00,124
Be alert, or papa don't go out at all.
I be alert. I don't know
what it is, but I be it.

667
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,429
All ye suckers
who are gonna get trimmed,
step this way for the big swindle.

668
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,369
Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding
with the main business of the day,

669
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,770
which is the selling
of these lots at any price,

670
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,401
we're gonna have
a little entertainment...
very little.

671
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,811
I wanna present to you
Miss Polly Potter,
the best paying guest in the hotel.

672
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,315
In fact, the only paying guest
in the hotel.

673
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:24,013
She will sing for you and for me too.
Miss Potter.

674
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,816
Monkeys upon a tree

675
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,884
Never are very blue

676
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,930
They never seem to be

677
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,989
Under par
That is true

678
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,058
Not like the ones you see

679
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,071
On a bar in the zoo

680
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,107
Monkeys upon a tree

681
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,302
Do the monkey doodle doo

682
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,473
Oh, among the mangoes
where the monkey gang goes

683
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,039
You can see them do

684
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,575
The little monkey doodle doo

685
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,681
Oh, a little monkey playing
on his one key

686
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,386
Gives them all the cue

687
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,828
To do the monkey doodle doo

688
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,492
Let me take you by the hand

689
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,229
Over to the jungle band

690
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,737
If you're too old for dancing

691
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,467
Get yourself a monkey gland

692
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,942
And then let's go, my little dearie

693
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,945
Here's the Darwin theory

694
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,174
Telling me and you

695
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,649
To do the monkey doodle doo

696
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,993
<i>[Ends]</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

697
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,733
That's Florida, folks...
singing, dancing and entertainment.

698
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,741
After the entertainment,
there'll be sandwiches.

699
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,869
But remember,
if there are no lots sold,
there will be no sandwiches.

700
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,280
Florida, folks... sunshine, sunshine.
Perpetual sunshine
all the year around.

701
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,910
Let's get the auction started
before we get a tornado.

702
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,681
Right this way.
Step forward, everybody.

703
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:55,054
Friends, you are now
in Cocoanut Manor,
one of the finest cities in Florida.

704
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,889
Of course, we still need
a few finishing touches,
but who doesn't?

705
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,829
This is the heart of
the residential district. Every lot is
a stone's throw from the station.

706
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,526
As soon as they throw enough stones,
we're gonna build a station.

707
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,092
800 wonderful residences
will be built right here.

708
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,899
Why, they're as good as up.
Better.

709
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,906
You can have any kind
of a home you want to.

710
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,374
You can even get stucco.
Oh, how you can get stuck, oh.

711
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,809
Now is the time to buy
while the new boom is on.

712
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,507
Remember that old saying,
"a new boom sweeps clean"?

713
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,812
And don't forget the guarantee...
my personal guarantee.

714
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,616
If these lots don't double
in value in a year, I don't know
what you can do about it.

715
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:30,558
Now, we'll take lot number 20,
right at the corner of DeSota Avenue.

716
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:33,790
Of course, you all know who DeSota was?
He discovered a body of water.

717
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,492
You've all heard of the water
that they named after him...
DeSota Water.

718
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,364
Now this lot has a 20-foot frontage,

719
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,337
a 14-foot "backage"
and a mighty fine gobbet.

720
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,636
Now, what am I offered for this lot?
Anything at all? Anything at all?

721
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,177
$ 200.

722
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,372
Ah, a gentleman bids $ 200.
Who'll say 300?

723
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,814
$300.

724
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,311
Another gentleman says $300.
Do I hear four?

725
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,355

01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,965
Why, the whole thing
is ridiculous.

865
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,597
It's absurd!

for one moment that...

Oh, I... I don't care what
you think, any of you.

Polly, you know it's a lie,
don't you?

It was just a harmless flirtation,
and then, well, he lost his head.

Don't you know it's a lie?
Of course I do.

a silly story like that, do you?

Mother, I don't believe it!

never to speak to my daughter again.
But, Mrs. Potter...

You'll stay here.

Yes, Polly.

Don't keep it up any longer.

out of him in half an hour.

Now we'll take lot number 27.

I've been so unsuccessful
in disposing these other lots,

885

a half a pound of tea with
every lot I sell from now on.

886

There's only one way
to wipe out this disgrace.

887
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,566
You must make people forget
that you ever knew this young man.

Mother! What are you saying?

You see what's come of your way.
Now I'm going to have mine.

Mr. Yates?
Yes, Mrs. Potter?

891
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,008
My daughter has reconsidered
her answer to you.
Mother!

892
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,918
Your engagement
will be announced tonight.

893

That's wonderful, Polly.

894

I shall give a dinner at the hotel...
A dinner? A dinner?

895

You want the 30-
or 40-cent dinner?
You may invite everyone.

It's 50 with Jell-O,
and, oh, how you can Jell-O.

Oh, hello.

1014
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:01,112
I didn't know you were
going to be here.
Anywhere that you are.

1015
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,348
How do you do?
How do you do?
Is Mr. Hammer coming?

1016
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,414
Mr. Hammer? Yes.
He'll be here directly.

[Laughing Continues]

1019
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,662
Mr. Hammer,
your costume is wonderful.

1020
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,832
This costume has been condemned
by <i>Good Housekeeping.</i>

1021
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:29,274
I love the color scheme.
That isn't a scheme.
It's a conspiracy.

1022
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:33,781
Senor Chico Joseph Maria de Accunia,

1023
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:36,818
Count de Elsinore.

1024
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,217
On Track 25.

Aha!

[Italian]

1027
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:51,526
Listen, Count. As soon as the guests leave,
I'd like you to take the ashes out.
[Italian]

1028
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,300
His Excellency,
the ambassador from San Rafaelo,

[Gasps]

1033
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,895
Hey, nix on that stuff.

1034
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,872
[With Irish Accent]
Sure, and it's just
a breath of old Ireland.

1035
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:38,504
I can see me old mother
comin' down the old path.
And I can see in the mornin'.

1036
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,014
And I can see the old...

Whoo, goes the weasel

[Whistling Jig]

1040
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,323
There goes the weasel now.

1041
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,394
I'm awfully glad you came,
Mr. Hennessy.
That's all right, madam.

1042
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:05,406
At a party like this,
you've got to have the law around.

1043
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:10,036
Now, a nice woman like you
needs protection, and I'm here
to see that you get it.

1044
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:14,674
There's a couple of shady characters
hanging around that I'm going
to keep an eye on.

1045
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,241
What's that you gave him?
I no give a nothing.

1046
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,810
Give me that, I tell you!

1047
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,483
Who got my shirt?
What's become of my shirt?

1048
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,992
I want my shirt.

1049
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:30,157
Hey, you've lost your shirt.
Yes.

1050
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:33,429
Uh, can you describe this shirt?
What's that?

1051
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,470
Here. Now, look.

1052
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:39,268
This cross... This cross marks the spot
where the shirt was last seen.

1053
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,674
Cut that out.
Now, remain quiet,
will you please?

1054
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,882
Just as I thought.

1055
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:57,414
You birds are all in on this thing,
and you're all trying to keep me
from finding my shirt.

1056
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:00,791
That's a lie, you whelp.
Whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp.

Whelp, whelp, whelp.

01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,832
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.

He's got it, he's got it
He's got it, he's got it
I've got my shirt back

Thank God, I've got my shirt
I've got my shirt
He's got it, he's got it, he's got it

I've got my shirt

You'll never know
how deeply I was hurt
He's got it, he's got it, he's got it

1075
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,239
I thought I'd lost my shirt

he's got it, he's got it

by my brother Bert

The beautiful shirt

Now that I've found my shirt

1081
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:21,898
Good-bye

1082
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,336
And now, friends, now that
we've found Hennessy's shirt,

1083
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:29,212
would you all mind looking for
a collar button that I lost here?

1084
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,946
Size 131/2.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1085
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,648
if you'll all find places
at the table,

1086
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,283
we'll have a short entertainment
before supper.

1087
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,691
Eat, eat, eat. Come on!

1088
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:43,857
How about you and I
giving this joint the air and indulging
in some snappy necking?

1089
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,866
What?

1090

[Tapping Table]
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:01,404
Mr. Hammer will now act
as master of ceremonies.

1093
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,508
Mr. Hammer.

[Guests Voicing Approval]

1095
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,251
Ladies and gentlemen...

1096
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,055
Two hundred dollars.

1097
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,824
In behalf of the Rotary Club
of Minneapolis,

1098
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:19,128
I want to take this occasion
of welcoming you to Waukegan.

1099
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,637
No, no, I mean, in recognition
of my many years of service
with the railroad,

1100
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,798
you have presented me
with these ties.

1101
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:28,900
And that, of course, reminds me
of the story of the Irishman.

1102
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:31,138
[Laughing]

1103
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,444
[All Laughing]
It's so funny.
I wish I could think of it.

1104
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,610
Oft in the stilly night,

1105
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:40,177
the trembling of a leaf
can be heard...

1106
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,587
sighing through the trees.

1107
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,922
And the babbling brook,
as it wends its way onward,

1108
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,053
babbling and...

1109
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,937
Well, I got rid of one.

1110
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:58,939
And one like that is worth
three ordinary ones.
Where was I?

1111
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,100
Oh, yes, on this chair.
That's right.

1112
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,111
Western cattle opened
at 15 and a quarter.

1113
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,841
Yearlings and spring veal
showed a firm tone.

1114
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,884
And eggs were a little touchy
on a falling market.

1115
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:13,114
Well, my mother and father
talked it over, and they finally
moved to New York.

1116
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,281
They took a little house in the Bronx.

1117
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:19,623
And it was in that little house
that Abraham Lincoln was born,
much to my father's surprise.

1118
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,562
And that, boys and girls, was
the beginning of the Lincoln Highway.

1119
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,395
And now, friends, in view of the fact
that Miss Potter's engagement...

1120
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,902
is being celebrated here tonight,
so to speak,

1121
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,905
I think a few words from her mother
would be revolting.

1122
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,567
I now take great pleasure
in presenting to you...

1123
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,406
the well-preserved
and partially pickled Mrs. Potter.

1124
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,414
Come on now.
Give the little girl a big hand.
Speech. Speech.

1125
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,416
Big speech.
Speech. Speech.

1126
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,748
My good, good friends,

1127
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,912
if I could only tell you...

1128
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:51,049
how rosy-hued everything
seems to me tonight.

1129
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,495
<i>As I look into your faces,</i>
<i>they're all lit with gay laughter.</i>

1130
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:03,596
The whole world,
and everything in it,

1131
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:08,267
is bathed in a soft,
glowing, luminous haze.

1132
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,903
The old gal is stewed
to the eyebrows.

1133
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:15,575
And now I want to wish you all
a most enjoyable evening.

1134
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,881
As for myself, I'm sad.

1135
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,222
I simply can't go any farther.

1136
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,852
I'll get off with you.

1137
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:31,262
Now, friends, I want to take
great pleasure in presenting to you...

1138
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:34,358
the groom Mr. Yates,
Mr. Harvey Yates.

1139
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,034
Good evening, radio fans.
We are now back in the studio.

1140
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,942
Stand by for your station announcer.

1141
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,743
My dear, dear friends,

1142
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:55,388
<i>I,</i> uh...

1143
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,550
<i>I,</i> uh...

1144
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,220
I, uh, really don't know
what to say.

1145
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,699
Well, shut up.

1146
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,431
What a splendid suggestion.
Good, eh?

1147
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,497
I feel highly honored,

1148
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:16,601
but I'm afraid I'm not much
of a speech maker.

1149
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:19,772
Nevertheless, Mr. Hammer,
it was very nice of you
to call on me.

1150
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:22,442
You must call on me sometime.
I was just about to...

1151
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:25,611
Yes, come up and see my flower bed.
What I intended to say...

1152
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,951
I want you to see my pansies.
Well...

1153
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:31,287
I got short pansies and long pansies.
I was just going to say that...

1154
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,385
Next spring I'm gonna get
some early bloomers.

1155
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,129
As I was about to say...

1156
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:45,434
There seems to be a steady stream
flowing in and out over there.

1157
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:49,341
I wouldn't dream of taking up
any more of your time.

1158
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,072
I really wanted
to thank you all.
Yeah.

1159
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,913
And as I said before,
I hadn't intended to make
a speech at all.

1160
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,544
Well, you certainly succeeded.

1161
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,554
Now, friends...

1162
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,595
Now what's the matter
with him?

1163
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,188
That's that good Gulf gas.

1164
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,359
Goodness.

1165
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,332
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,510
Hey, hey. What are you doin'?
Don't do that.

1167
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:30,016
Come on.
That's a not a good.

1168
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,215
Mr. Hammer.

1169
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,216
Mr. Hammer,
can't you do something?

1170
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,660
I don't have to.
They're doing plenty.
[Honks]

1171
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,663
Oh, this is awful.

1172
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,535
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the, uh...

1173
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:53,973
the first musical, uh, number
that we intend to portray...

1174
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:58,945
will be the, uh, beginning
and the ending of a very...

1175
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:02,881
We're gonna have music.
Music. We're gonna have music.

1176
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,190
Now, the first musical number
on the program...

1177
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,423
will be a piccolo solo
which we will skip.

1178
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:19,489
And the second number
will be Senor Pastrami,
the Lithuanian pianist.

1179
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:26,506
The Senor, for his first selection,
will play " A Cup of Coffee,
a Sandwich and You"...

1180
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:29,270
from the opera, <i>Aida.</i>

1181
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,905
Senor, allow me
to escort you to the diet.

1182
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,576
Uh, Senor Pastrami,
what is the first number?

1183
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:39,415
Number one.

1184
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,624
[Classical]

1185
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,583
And now, friends, I want to present
to you a charming little lady.

1186
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,847
Down in front.
Hey, sit down.

1187
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:58,881
What's wrong with you?
The little lady who is to become
Mrs. Harvey Yates,

1188
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,053
over my dead body.

1189
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,896
I know I have the sincere wishes
of all my friends...

1190
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,493
and can only tell you
how much I appreciate it.

1191
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,007
I think I can honestly say this is
the happiest moment of my life.

1192
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,100
Look what I have here.

1193
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:31,287
It's a little engagement present
just given me by Mr. Yates.

1194
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,589
He wrote it just now,

1195
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:37,097
but he wrote another yesterday
when a necklace was stolen.

1196
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:41,033
They are both
in his handwriting.
Let me read it to you.

1197
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,094
It shows how to get to Cocoanut Manor
and the hollow tree stump...

1198
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,437
and reads,
"Hollow stump, jewels."

1199
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:52,170
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.

1200
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,441
Yates is gone.
Yates is gone?

1201
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:57,279
And I gave him a check this morning
for a thousand dollars.

1202
01:30:57,351 --> 01:31:00,787
It's a good thing
it was my personal check.
Mr. Hammer.

1203
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:04,848
There's a man outside who wants
to see you with a black mustache.
Tell him I've got one.

1204
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:07,520
Well, I think you
will want to see him.

1205
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,688
His name is Mr. John W. Berryman.

1206
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:13,632
He has accepted my architectural plans
for the development of Cocoanut Manor.

1207
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:16,261
Well, happy days, old boy.
Thank you. Thank you.

1208
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:18,669
[Italian]
Thank you.

1209
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:23,009
He also wants to know
if you can accommodate
400 guests for the weekend.

1210
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,170
400 guests?
400 guests.

1211
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:27,806
What in the world's
the matter...

1212
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:29,941
Mother, you must admit
you were mistaken.

1213
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:33,077
Mr. Adams, how can you
ever forgive me?

1214
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,281
Oh, please, Mrs. Potter.

1215
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:41,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all invited to attend
the wedding of my daughter.

1216
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:45,330
The wedding will take place
exactly as planned.

1217
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:48,163
That is, with the exception
of a slight change.

1218
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,865
She will be married
to Mr. Robert Adams.

1219
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,373
[All]
Hooray! Hooray!

1220
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,570
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

1221
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,738
The skies

1222
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:04,376
Will all be blue

1223
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,977
When my dreams

1224
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:11,821
Come true

1225
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:15,624
<i>And I'll be smiling</i>

1226
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,062
<i>Through</i>

1227
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,692
<i>When my dreams</i>

1228
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:24,329
<i>Come true</i>

1229
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:27,806
<i>That Spanish castle</i>

1230
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:31,038
<i>I built in my mind</i>

1231
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:34,309
<i>Will be our love nest</i>

1232
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:38,751
The practical kind

1233
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,753
And I'll

1234
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:42,755
Be there

1235
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:46,350
With you

1236
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:50,090
When my dreams

1237
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:53,258
Come

1238
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:57,327
<i>True</i>
