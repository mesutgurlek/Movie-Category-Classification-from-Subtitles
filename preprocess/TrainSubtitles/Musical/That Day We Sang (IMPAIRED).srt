00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,993
# I'm a wife, just a wife

320
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,230
# And I'm happy to manoeuvre
round my hubby

321
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,470
# And I just fit in with him

322
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,472
# I'm proud of my house
and I'm handy with the Hoover

323
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,438
# And the Harpic
and the Ajax and the Vim

324
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,592
# But my life's complete
When he takes me out to eat

325
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,274
# To an eatery
that's posher than the pub

326
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,797
# When we journey in
to the Berni Inn

327
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,792
# It's number one with me, for grub

328
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,798
# Once you've had your starter
steak with grilled tomarter

329
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,677
# Shows you are a diner with finesse

330
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,829
Ooh, I'm having that!

331
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,399
# You have to learn the blarney

332
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,754
# Fancy words like garni

333
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,910
# That just means they bung on bits of cress

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,989
Oh.

335
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,878
# Once you've learned to grapple
with gammon and pineapple

336
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,554
# You can face the world without chagrin

337
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,677
# That remote ravine
that is haute cuisine

338
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,230
# Come and cross it at the Berni Inn

339
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,517
# What we have, who we are
well, it isn't accidental

340
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,478
# We have battled for the life
that we have built

341
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,597
# We're refined to be frank
We are almost continental

342
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,513
# Well, we do have a continental quilt

343
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,672
# But it seemed so neat
to invite you out to eat

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,593
# To show you some of what you haven't got

345
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,911
# To journey in to the Berni Inn

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,355
# To show you that we know, what's what

347
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,551
# Now please alert your colon

348
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,039
# Loosen off your roll on

349
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,997
# Can we say we'll do desserts all round?

350
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,115
Oh, yes.

351
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,158
# Ices in the chiller
# Only got vanilla

352
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,470
# Or the sweet for which we are renowned

353
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,592
# In shit hole or in chateau

354
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,033
# They know Black Forest Gateau

355
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,759
# Though ours has never been too near Berlin

356
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,512
# It's wrong to brag

357
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,356
# It's just cake in drag

358
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,037
# But it's gateau at the Berni Inn

359
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,358
# On my grave will be chipped
by a monumental mason

360
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,398
# There could never be a better
life than Frank's

361
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,959
# Had a wife, had a child

362
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,953
# Had an avocado basin, bath
And lavatory from Armitage Shanks

363
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,758
# And it feels so sweet

364
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,193
# To have given you this treat

365
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,113
# And that is why we felt we must insist

366
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,352
# That we journey into the Berni Inn

367
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,193
# To demonstrate the life you've missed #

368
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,709
Sorry.

369
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,791
Can I just stop you a second.

370
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,359
We're leaving.

371
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,796
We don't want to spend any more time
with you this evening,

372
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,949
or ever.

373
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,679
You're not staying for coffee?
It's lrish coffee.

374
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,193
After dinner mints come with.

375
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,032
No, we're going for a nice cup of tea.

376
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,789
Tea?

377
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,756
I just felt he was belittling me. Well us.

378
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,832
He was trying, but we shall not be belittled.

379
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,675
We shall fight them in the chip shop!

380
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,194
We shall fight them in the Kardomah!

381
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,318
We shall never surrender!

382
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,313
(CHUCKLES) Sorry, that was a terrible
Diana Dors impression.

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,035
On the house.

384
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,429
-Anne, you're a bobby dazzler.
-I know I am.

385
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
-Help yourself.
-Oh, no. I'm full.

386
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,909
Anyway I'm on a diet supposedly.

387
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,034
I'm doing it with Pauline, the girl I work with.

388
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,588
She wants to lose three stone
and take all her hems up.

389
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,669
She's got chunky knees.

390
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,953
Well, yours aren't chunky, if I may say.

391
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,836
No, but office solidarity.

392
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,355
You were very manly in there,
when you took charge.

393
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,590
No, I surprised myself.

394
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,035
Don't know what's going on with me
at the moment.

395
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,872
"It's all happening!" (CHUCKLES)

396
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,188
Didn't I hear you say
that your mother had just died?

397
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,599
Yes, she did.

398
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,750
-And did you live with her?
-Yes.

399
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,712
House to myself now.

400
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,950
So thank god for this place!

401
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,351
But she didn't like music.

402
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,873
She struggled.

403
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,315
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.

404
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,715
Well, it is.

405
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,834
-Actually, do you mind if l...
-No, please. I may have over vinegared.

406
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,070
-Oh, not for me. I love vinegar.
-(CHUCKLES)

407
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,360
-So, your office is in Peel House.
-Mmm.

408
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,393
I've got clients on the fourth floor.

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,630
My office is just across the square.

410
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,550
-We're on the first floor, Stanley Brothers...
-Hmm...

411
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,631
Pop in some time. Pauline loves a visitor.

412
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,314
Right. I shall. I shall pop!

413
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,474
Please.

414
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,918
Are you Jimmy Baker?

415
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,433
-Yeah.
-ls your mother in?

416
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,833
-No, she's at her other job.
-All right.

417
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,319
Well, how you doing?

418
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,274
-Have you been out playing?
-Singing, I am in a choir.

419
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,555
I sing, with a dance band.

420
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,951
We've been on the wireless.

421
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,395
So I have actually sung on the wireless.

422
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,794
I gave you a rubber ball once,
you remember?

423
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,912
You would have been about three.

424
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,558
It was a big coloured ball.

425
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,189
Have you not still got it?

426
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,998
-I had better go in.
-Hang on a minute.

427
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,712
I am off to Canada.

428
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,590
Pastures new, as they say.

429
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,510
Have you heard that?
Pastures new? No?

430
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,959
Anyway,

431
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,671
I'm leaving this behind.

432
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,318
Do you want to take it?

433
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,470
-What is it?
-It's a gramophone.

434
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,152
Go on, take it.

435
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,595
-Who have I to give it to?
-No-one. You.

436
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,113
It's for you.

437
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,234
It's new.

438
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,839
There's a record in it, Happiness Street,

439
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,913
I'm singing on it.

440
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,350
-All right, Sal?
-What's this?

441
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,838
I'm sailing to Canada.
I've brought him this.

442
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,309
Right.

443
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,114
I'll send you my address, shall l?

444
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,953
Well, I will.

445
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,636
Jimmy, go and get washed.

446
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,233
And remember...

447
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,110
Always hold the record by its edges.
Yes?

448
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,872
Is this all right, Mam?

449
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,313
Yeah. Go on.

450
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,435
(SlGHS)

451
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,592
Well, I'll probably not see you.

452
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,669
No.

453
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,631
You know how I'm fixed.

454
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,955
Yeah.

455
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,070
-ls she going with you?
-Yes.

456
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,393
It makes sense.

457
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,433
Course it does.

458
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,633
You bugger.

459
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,392
-Mam!
-Wait!

460
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,319
What did he say?

461
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,079
-Who?
-Him.

462
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,793
Nothing. He said he'd given me
a ball or something.

463
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,074
A ball.

464
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,753
He didn't say to come with him
or anything, to Canada?

465
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,558
-No.
-No.

466
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,034
You're staying with me, aren't you?

467
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,918
Mam, can we play the record?

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,433
No, I told you.

469
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,518
-But why?
-Because I don't want to hear it.

470
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,193
Now fasten it up.

471
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,077
You don't get it out,
you don't show it anybody.

472
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,072
And you don't tell anybody. I mean it!

473
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,476
She said, "Pop in".

474
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,471
She wants me to pop in.

475
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,557
I'm not making this up, am l?

476
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,349
She wants me, Tubby Baker,

477
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,715
to come and see her in her office.

I don't think you walk as slow as me.

I can do.
I like walking slow.

And if I walk on the side ofyour cold leg

533
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,797
it might warm it up
and then it might feel better.

You can lean on me. I'm dead strong.

# For Enids never get seduced

795
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,678
# Your inner Enid rules the roost

796
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,799
# Your love life will not be your claim to fame

797
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,715
# You won't inspire a Byron

798
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,553
# Be a temptress or a siren

799
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,553
# A courtesan, a diva or a dame

802

# When Enid is your name

803
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,789
# Enids are not kissed

804
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,348
# Under skies that are starry

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,393
# We don't go on safari

806
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,948
# With some chisel jawed man

807
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,832

# Tights are 45 denier

00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,308

# There's a whiff of Swarfega

00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,512

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,875
# Oh, I need to show

833
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,431
# That I am more than just my name

834
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,589
Sorry, just hang on a minute.

835
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,559
What was I saying? Oh, yes, Enids.

836
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,598
# Will we feel passion

837
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,874
# Or something akin to

838
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,278
# That we have to give in to

839
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,071
# I'm guessing we won't

840
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,189
# There are chasms

841
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,511
# Between those who feel spasms

842
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,637
# And have great big orgasms

843
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,871
# And the Enids who don't

844
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,993
# One day I'm gonna master this hurdle

845
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,674
# I'm gonna fling off my girdle

846
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,833
# And get ahead of the game

847
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,879
# I'm going

848
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,309
# To try and get my juices flowing

849
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,797
# I have a bit of life still owing

850
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,797
# And I am more than just my name #

851
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,233
Evelyn, do you want a Nescaff?

852
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,877
Do you want a Nescaff?

853
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,149
This came for you yesterday. I forgot.

854
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,758
Here. Trot down to the mail room with that.

855
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,718
Take the stairs, get a bit of that weight off.
I'm back at four, Enid.

856
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,831
I'll take it down, Pauline. Sorry.

857
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,195
Why are you apologising for him, Enid?

858
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,152
He doesn't bother me.
I don't have to see him in my lunch hour.

859
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,798
Or with his clothes off.

860
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,669
Who else knows?

861
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,876
No-one.
You come back on a Tuesday afternoon

862
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,396
with flat hair and different tights on,
I just button my lip and keep typing.

863
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,239
Do you think the worse of me?

864
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,311
No, I don't think the worse ofyou
for sleeping with him.

865
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,392
We've all got a few regrettable
bedspreads in our past.

866
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,075
But to pass up the chance of a nice bloke
who's itching to treat you properly,

867
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,354
that is barmy.

868
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,509
It's complicated.

869
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,477
Is it heckers like Enid?

870
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,233
I've just seen him now, Tubby,
on my way back.

871
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,556
He's just gone into Duncan and Fosters.

872
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,470
God, Enid! Go and find him,

873
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,154
tell him you've been a bloody idiot
and you want to go out with him.

874
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,794
-Shall l?
-Yes!

875
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,632
Go on, hurry up.

876
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,318
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?

877
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,110
Just tell him, it is 1969! For frig's sake!

878
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,713
What it is.

879
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,438
That's not really a sentence.

880
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,598
-Thank you for the photo.
-Oh! No trouble.

881
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,994
The other day when I said I was going out
with somebody, I wasn't really.

882
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,277
So I don't know ifyou want to, still,
go out with me.

883
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,109
Well, I can't just decide on the spot,
I will have to think about it.

884
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,430
No, of course. Absolutely.

885
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,229
I've thought about it.
Yes, I would and where shall we go?

886
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,073
Oh! Oh, you really want to?

887
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,870
You've no idea. You have no idea.

888
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,029
Wow!

889
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,194
Crikey!

890
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,271
I ordered sausage egg and chips
to cheer myself up. I could send it back!

891
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,834
(SlGHS)

892
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,519
Could I hold your hand?

893
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,309
Yes.

894
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,753
Hang on! Let's do this thing properly.

895
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,474
So,

896
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,632
none of my beeswax, but I am a man

897
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,757
so obviously a bit thick
as regards these matters.

898
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,719
Were you going out with somebody or not?

899
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,314
-Well, I was seeing somebody.
-Oh!

900
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,356
We didn't really go out.

901
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,634
And I haven't actually told him yet,

902
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,870
he'll probably be furious
but we're used to that.

903
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,315
-Who's we?
-Oh, me and Pauline.

904
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,594
It's my boss.

905
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,150
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.

906
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,718
Oh! I thought he was married.

907
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,039
Well, yes. That's been the complication.

908
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,633
-The boss I met? Mr Stanley?
-Yes.

909
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,637
But he is married, I heard him saying
something about his wife.

910
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,188
They don't get on.
They're all very show jumpy.

911
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,192
-Who are?
-The wife and the daughters.

912
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,194
-He's got daughters?
-Yes. Two. They do dressage.

913
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,991
But you haven't had an affair with him?

914
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,874
Well, yes.

915
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,069
Well, what did you think
you were doing to them?

916
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,358
What I was doing?

917
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,872
To their family.

918
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,433
You had no right.

919
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,438
He was somebody's husband.

920
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,191
And he was somebody's father.

921
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,996
That's wrong, Enid. That's just...

922
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,599
I'm sorry, I can't hold hands with you.

923
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,075
I had no idea that you...

924
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,438
I thought you were like me.

925
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,398
I thought you'd missed the boat somehow.

926
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,794
Getting involved with a married man.

927
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,478
That's not who I thought you were.

928
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,630
Stephenson, Sutcliffe, Taylor,

929
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,075
Ward, Williamson, Yardley.

930
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,432
Right.

931
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,239
Have a look around at your tram group.

932
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,918
If you don't see those faces
at the tram stop tomorrow morning,

933
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,718
you are on the wrong tram,

934
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,517
and you will not be making a record
with the Halle orchestra. Oi!

935
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,352
That was a waste of a ha'penny,
wasn't it, Hewitt?

936
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,799
These trams have been put on specially
for you to get to the Free Trade Hall.

937
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,556
We don't want anybody coming on milk floats
or getting lifts on a dust cart.

938
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,119
Yes, Baker, I'm looking at you.

939
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,235
(CHlLDREN TlTTERlNG)

940
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,596
You're not on the tram,
you're not coming in.

941
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,995
In fact, I am going to say
that anyone not arriving on time

942
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,353
will not only be prevented from taking part
in the recording, but will be asked

943
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,396
to leave the choir altogether.

945

Singing tomorrow is going to be
the happiest moment of my life.

946
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,029
Very good. You get off.
Big day tomorrow. I can manage.

947
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,669
So our record that we're making Mr Kirkby,

948
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,797
if they sell it in Woolworths,
I'm going to buy it for mam and play it her.

949
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,752
Play it her on what? A mangle?

950
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,791
No, I've got a gramophone.

951

Come on, Mr Kirkby, come with!

953

Very nice model.

Would it be possible to have a word?

1008

I'm the first to wade in
when there's been a misdemeanour.

Bang. Ears boxed.

-needs a punishment.

I don't believe in God.

It's just that he had this surprise for you

1018
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,313
and I was going to take him out to tea,
possibly the Kardomah.

1019
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,630
Because he's been a help to me.
I've got this leg...

1020
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,590
-...Iack of.
-What surprise?

1021
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,875
It's a photograph of Baker.

1022
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,953
I took a little snap of him.

1023
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,793
I borrowed a Box Brownie
from a chap in my digs.

1024
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,553
He didn't want you to think
you had to buy the, the big one.

1025
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,916
Because that's going to be sizeable.

1026
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,395
So I thought after the recording,
with it being a day off,

1027
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,759
we could get the photo, and then maybe
go somewhere, as I say, like the Kardomah.

1028

Make a day of it.

1030
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,239
He's a good little lad.

1031
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,720
You know he's saving up
to buy you the record.

1032
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,675
I don't suppose you want a cup of tea
with a non-believer.

1033
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,918
Well, you believe in tea,

1034
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,753
and to me that's only just outside
the Holy Trinity.

No, I will. I absolutely will.

1105
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,238
Now, obviously when you came
round to the office that Tuesday

1106
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,675
and said did I want to have
a sandwich in Peel Square,

1107
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,830
that was my opportunity to say,

1108
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,718
"I'm afraid I can't because I'm just
about to go and have sex

1109
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,678
"with that red faced man who is my boss",
who then told you to hop it.

of which there have been many.

but I had got a bit stuck
with the Malcolm situation.

1113
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,828

it's a wonder I could see to put my tights on!

And you were quite right, he is married

1115
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,639
and he does have children
and it was deceitful.

1116
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,951
But it was quite light hearted
in the early days.

Come with me!

01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,358
You stay where you are
if you want to keep your job.

1258
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,079
-I love you, Enid!
-And don't let him back in.

1259
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:24,358
Come on, then, you know I didn't mean it.
You can go.

LlONEL: All sorted, Sir H.

1261
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,552
Ready to record when you are.

01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,108
Thank you, Lionel. (SlGHS)

1263
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,589
Now this...

1264
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,389
Hears everything and forgives nothing.

1265
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,877
It is a cruel mistress.

1266

-We can have no mistakes.
-(BOY CLEARS THROAT)

Perfection only will do.

01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,150
Complete clarity, total concentration,

1269
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,715
and of course a lovely happy sound.

MALCOLM: Pauline, go and phone
the coffee order through.

1271
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,915
Right.

1272
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,792
MALCOLM: What was I supposed to say?

1273
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,277
Yeah, you're right, fatso,
we have it away every Tuesday?

1274
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,273
Bloody idiot.

1275
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,111
Is he a drinker? Yeah.

1276
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,316
You don't want to bother with him.

1277
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,356
-I do want to bother with him.

Do you want this hand cream? Atrixo.

-Lovely, thanks.
-No. Don't be like that, Enid.

1281
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,832
Honestly, in bed between you and Moira...
Well, no contest.

1282
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,831
You might want to switch off
the intercom, Malcolm.

1283
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,154
Oh!

Oh, good. A critique on my sex life has gone
through to everyone in Planning.

1286
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,953
Hadn't you better catch him up?

1287
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,076
You don't want him taking
the hump again.

1288
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,833
Oh, Lord, he could be anywhere.
I'll see you at Popmobility.

1289
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,593
-Yeah.
-Thanks for everything! Bye!

1290

Bye.

you don't have to fling me into
the gutter by the seat of my trousers.

It's not the Beano.

He's too late though, isn't he sir?
Because he didn't come on the tram, sir.

jump down and I'll catch you!

Get in your place!

Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton.

Baker was just helping me up.

Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge.

1307

Good man.

1308
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,474
I was Naval Reserve, North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.

1309
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,828
-You said Baker hadn't turned up.
-No.

1310
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,911
-You said he'd missed his tram.
-No!

1311
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,188
You did Mr Kirkby.
We had a whole conversation about it.

1312
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,316
I might have been hallucinating.

1313
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,550
-Hallucinating?
-From shell shock.

1314
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,349
Do you suffer from shell shock?

1315
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,873
Occasionally.

1316
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,196
I can't let you back in.

1317
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,828
I know.

1318

She's stuck in there with that idiot.

1319
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,197
I want to rescue her,
I want to run away with her.

1320
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,513
-Does she know that?
-Probably not.

1321
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,912
The whole thing's been a series
of half-cocked blunders.

1322
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,434
Of which me shoving him in the chest

1323
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,830
and failing to give him a cactus
is the last in a long line.

1324
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,117
Well, she's only on the first floor.

1325
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,839
Doesn't matter what floor she's on
if you can't let me back in.

1326
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,317
Of course, if you were to rush past me,

grab a decorator's ladder
and put it up against her window,

1328
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,391
there wouldn't be much I could do about it.

1329
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,869
Wouldn't there?

1330
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,190
I'm not very quick on my pins.

1331

Have you seen a gentleman,

01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,037
I think he was probably
just thrown out of the building.

He's got a lovely face,

well, he's quite stout which I actually like.

Uh, oh! His name's Mr Baker

Jimmy? Jimmy Baker?

Up there.
