[Girl Narrating] That's my sister
Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,603
And that's me.
Well, I'm Djuna. D-J-U-N-A.

43
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:43,764
Oh, and everyone calls me D.J.

Now, I'm gonna level with ya.

45
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,878
We are not the typical kind of family
you'd find in a musical comedy.

46
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,914
For one thing, we got dough.

47
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,179
And we live right here on Park Avenue
in a big apartment; a penthouse.

48
00:03:56,252 --> 00:04:00,916
Dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him
"Dad," but actually he's stepdad.

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,620
There's original Dad
who married Mom and they had me.

50
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:09,461
And there's stepdad. Well, he had
two kids with his first wife when...

51
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:12,524
Look, maybe this is all
getting a little confusing.

52
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,729
You see, there's Lane and Laura.

53
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,238
Those are my half-sisters,
and they're really great.

54
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,242
A little twitty at times,
but we love each other...

55
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,801
and we have
a million laughs together.

56
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,814
And, of course, my stepbrother
Scott, who's very smart...

57
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,975
but currently on the outs
with the family...

58
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,076
because he's become
a conservative Republican...

59
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,553
which has caused my stepfather
to have a stroke...

60
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:34,556
since we're all liberal Democrats.

61
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,058
How can you expect
people on welfare...

62
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:39,856
to develop any sort of incentives
if they're getting handouts?

63
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:43,831
What are you saying? Somebody who can't work
for one reason or another has to be discarded?

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,028
Welfare does not work. It's the same
outmoded liberal fantasy world...

65
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:51,199
as affirmative action, not allowing
school prayer and coddling of criminals.

66
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:55,040
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my own flesh and blood.

67
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:59,480
Unless some large Republican pea pods are in
the basement and have taken over your body.

68
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,414
Not pods, Dad. Ideas.

Virile, modern ideas.

A strong America.
The right to bear arms.

71
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,023
- Arms? What are you... Guns?
- Yes!

72
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:12,221
Are you crazy? What the hell is the matter
with you? I don't understand you anymore.

73
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,025
- Why... Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- Relax, Bob.

74

of my will and an eraser, okay?

[D.J. Narrating]
If Dad's a liberal Democrat,

76
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,996
then you'd have to say Mom
is the one thing more extreme.

77
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,064
She's a guilty liberal Democrat.

78
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:30,010
Well, he grew up poor and he knows
what it is to work like a dog.

79
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,343
But Mom came from money and luxury...

80
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,511
and, you know, spends all her time
doing volunteer work for everybody.

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,182
She's with the American Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales...

82
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,091
and she raises dough for the
Whitney Museum and Lenox Hill Hospital.

83
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,152
She's always got something going,

84
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,564
like throwing some chic soiree
to help the New York Philharmonic.

Her mom's a shrink on Central Park West.

00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,768
Years ago, Claire drilled
a secret hole in the wall,

99
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:38,830
and we get our kicks after school
sometimes kinda tuning in on her clientele.

100

I've been having these fantasies
about... other men,

and, uh... you know,

Oh, I ha... Um, I had
that elevator dream... again.

You have to keep your eye on him.

and got on line in Times Square.

We had to send Frieda to get him back.
Oh, she's our maid.

They're all friends, though, and they

In fact, if I get the Concorde,
I could be dead three hours earlier,

kind of signs you think she gave me?

00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,272
- Can't we find somebody?
- I've been trying since we got divorced...

153
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:33,406
to find the right woman for him,
somebody to match up with his personality.

154
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,916
But I'm beginning...
Honey, bring another glass.

155
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,853
I'm beginning to wonder if the world
population of women isn't too limited.

156
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,856
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean...

157
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,985
- You've had really bad luck. - No, he hasn't.
He's had an unerring sense of poor choice.

158
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,499
And the question is, does he want to spend
his golden years with somebody or not?

159
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,626
- What, are you into
my golden years suddenly? - Yes.

160
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,672
- You have to think about those things.
- Men age differently than women.

161
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,732
- Two more years, I'm gonna look
like your son. - Oh, that was so mean.

162
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,675
- [Laughing]
- Don't you laugh.

163
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,146
Don't talk about my golden years.
She's got me in a home already.

164
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:09,343
What about Madeline?
After me.

165
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,115
Madeline was won... Madeline was
an archaeologist. She was fabulous.

166
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,123
Madeline was a nymphomaniac.

167
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,819
Yeah, okay, she had
a little problem with fidelity.

168
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:21,090
- I didn't happen to see it. But she was
a brilliant woman. - What about Carol?

169
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,427
Remember Carol what's-her-name?

170
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:27,560
- Carol was a poet, and a member of MENSA.
- She was a heroin addict.

171
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,571
She was also a heroin addict,
but I thought it was insulin.

172
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,097
- You know what the problem is? Listen.
- This is the problem.

173
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,612
- He's still in love with you.
I've always said this. - Oh, honey.

174
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,205
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.

175
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,217
- Ah, come here. Come here, my two men.
- That's the problem.

176
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,651
Two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.

177
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,916
We're gonna get somebody
who's nearly normal.

178
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,120
I don't know if we're gonna get
somebody. This is the problem.

179
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,164
- Hey.
- [D.J.] Hey.

180
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,532
Hey. What's all the secrecy about?
Why Harry Winstons?

181
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:04,403
Listen... I want you to help me pick out
an engagement ring for Skylar.

182
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,270
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

183
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,607
[Salesman] So, you're looking
for an engagement ring?

184
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,612
We're getting married.

185
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,978
Uh, I'm getting married.
Not to her.

186
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,109
Now, what size did you have in mind?

187
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,518
- What size?
- Uh-huh.

188
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,581
Oh, um... Well, she's not huge.

189
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,059
I mean, she's not bony either.
She's got flesh.

190
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,062
Something simple, but elegant?

191
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,622
- That's it.
- Simple, but elegant. Exactly. [Whispering]

192
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,932
- Like this one. - Oh, my God,
that's beautiful. That is beautiful.

193
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,169
- Look at that. - That's the mos
beautiful thing I ever saw. Hello.

194
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,733
So, what is that gonna cost me?
I like it.

195
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:46,339
- Fifty-five thousand.
- Fifty-five thousand dollars, you say?

196
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:50,818
Uh, well, let me take
this off then because...

197
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:54,413
I don't think that...
Actually, as I look at it, it's really...

198
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,551
To Skylar's taste, it's kind of...
tacky. She's not a mafia bride.

199
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:01,027
- Will you help me out?
- Here's a lovely one.

200
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,564
- That is... That is pretty.
- Pretty simple.

201
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,566
[Clears Throat]
Well, I don't...

202
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,159
What is that gonna cost me?
About fifteen-hundred, 2,000?

203
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,797
- Eight thousand.
- Eight thousand dollars.

204
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,898
- Um...
- It's more in the ball park.

205
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,273
- It's in the range.
- It's the right neighborhood.

206
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,472
- Not my neighborhood, but... [Exhales]
- But it's a better neighborhood.

207
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,005
What the hell. Right? 'Cause
we're getting married. Let's do it.

208
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:26,384
- It's pretty.
- I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.

209
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:29,549
# My baby don't care for rings #

210
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,093
# Or other expensive things #

211
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,790
# My baby just cares for me #

212
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,566
# My baby don't go
for big Rolls-Royces #

213
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,770
# There's sometimes a doubt
about her choices #

214
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,871
# My baby don't care to own #

215
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:56,145
# Some 14-karat stone #

216
00:13:56,218 --> 00:14:00,382
# She's sensible as can be #

217
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,419
# My baby don't care who knows it #

218
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,461
# My baby just cares for me #

219
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,932
# He's so happy since the day #

220
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,907
# He fell in love in a great big way #

221
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,911
# And the big surprise
is someone loves him too #

222
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:29,083
# It's difficult for us to see #

223
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:32,450
# Just what she could
possibly see in he #

224
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:37,356
# But it simply goes to prove
what love can do #

225
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,125
# His baby don't care for shows #

226
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,189
# His baby don't care for clothes #

227
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,930
# My baby just cares for me #

228
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,837
# Nobody else will do #

229
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:57,470
# His baby don't care
for furs and laces #

230
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:03,348
# His baby don't care for going
to the races or high-tone places #

231
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,946
- # My baby's not much for sports #
- # Gets out of sorts #

232
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,752
- # Like runnin' 'round tennis courts #
- # No, no #

233
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,056
# I must say
I'm glad that she #

234
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,222
# He's glad to say that she #

235
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:22,203
# Has made such a fine selection #

236
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,570
# My baby just cares for me #

His baby just #

241
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,526
# My baby just cares for me ##

242
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,968
Mrs. Holden Spence.

243
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,529
Skylar Spence!
I love the sound of that.

244
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:35,065
- He's taking her to Le Cirque for
dinner tonight. - Le Cirque? No kidding.

245
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:38,307
- He's gonna propose.
- I don't wanna blow my own horn here,

246
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,814
- but I'm the one who introduced them.
- We've heard it.

247
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,647
I did!
He came to work at our law firm...

248
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,449
The first day he was there,
I said, " This kid is great!

249
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,184
His feet are on the ground.
He's perfect for her."

250
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,192
Frieda, the pasta has no sauce.

251
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,287
It's Bavarian pasta! It doesn't need
any sauce! Italian pasta needs sauce.

252
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,959
- The Italians were weak!
- Okay, fine. Just gimme some pepper.

253
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,899
I cannot understand you!

254
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:04,097
Your solution to rampant crime
is let criminals go free?

255
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,142
- [Mother] No, Charles Ferry deserves
a parole. - What? What is this?

256
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,043
Are you kidding me? You want
somebody like this out on the streets?

257
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,072
"Armed robbery, assault, assault with
a deadly weapon, attempted escape."

258
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,744
- Scott, he was an abused child.
- [Dad] Have a little compassion.

259
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,017
He went to prison his whole entire life
because he had a horrible childhood,

260
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,456
which is something
you know nothing about.

261
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,652
- Then one mistake after the other.
- [Scott] One mistake?

262
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:29,892
Yes. It leads to bad crime, corrupt...
I don't wanna discuss this with you.

263
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,866
- I can't listen to any of this!
- I can't stand this.

264
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,028
- I need my wallet.
- Where are you going?

265
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,038
- Up to the Polo Grounds.
- No, no, no.

266
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,473
- Giants and Cardinals are having
a doubleheader. - Pop, you can't go out.

267
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,874
- If you wanna take a walk, you gotta
go with Frieda. - Good idea.

268
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:46,472
- But they're playing today. This is
Labor Day. - [Laura] It's June, Grandpa.

269
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,176
- It's June.
- The Polo Grounds closed years ago.

270
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,220
- Frieda, just take him for a short walk.
- Rained out?

271
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:56,246
- I'm not going with Frieda.
- All right, okay.

272
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,590
- I'm not going with her. I don't need
a German shepherd. - Take a nice walk.

273
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,289
- You know what the kids tell me?
- German shepherd. I feel so...

274
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,959
They think that Holden is gonna give
a little surprise to Skylar tonight.

275
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:09,162
If you keep gossiping about it,
there's gonna be no surprise.

276
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,503
- Honey, please...
- I'm going out.

277
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,236
- Have a nice time. - If Minnie calls,
tell her I went to the Polo Grounds.

278
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,904
[Laura] Minnie's been
dead for 20 years, Grandpa.

279
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,711
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying
if she calls, I'll be home later.

280
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,252
You know,
21 is too young to get married,

281
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,413
but if this was anybody but Holden,
I'd be against it.

282
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,788
Well, there's no way I'm getting married
'til I'm 35 and I've lived,

283
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,420
...and then I'll probably move in with
a woman. - Why do you make these jokes?

284
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,589
- You like Holden, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

285
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:40,328
The problem isn't Holden, it's Skylar.
She's a romantic twit.

286
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,735
- Yeah. Her problem with Holden is
he's not romantic. - So what?

287
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,207
- She's gonna marry him, right? - [Lane]
I hope so. I want her room when she does.

288
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm serious. I don't see any reason
why he should not leap at this guy.

289
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,906
Skylar suffers from
"white knight" syndrome.

290
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,279
Ever since her hormones kicked in,

291
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,944
she's been waiting for
some charismatic figure...

292
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,954
to come and sweep her
off her feet.

293
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,684
So Holden is that young Lochinvar.

294
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:06,660
- He's that young schnook. - He's a
schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.

295
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:10,323
- He's wonderful, and you... - What an
embarrassment. I'm never bringing a guy home.

296
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,835
- You have to listen.
- In the first place...

297

# I'm a dreamer #

298
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,879
# Aren't we all #

299
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,921
# Just a dreamer #

300
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:45,023
# Aren't we all #

301
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,900
# In my dreams #

302
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:53,067
# Each night it seems #

303
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:57,305
# My sweetheart comes #

304
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,780
# To call #

305
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,477
# He's so charming #

306
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:10,218
# Strong and tall #

307
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,086
# It's alarming #

308
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,996
# How I fall #

309
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,196
# He's ideal #

310
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:26,764
# But then he isn't real #

311
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:30,778
# And I'm a fool #

312
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,978
# But aren't we all ##

313
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:49,119
- I've been thinking. Can I tell
you how I see us? - How?

314
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,688
[Chuckles]
Okay, well, we get married...

315
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,758
and we live near
my parents in Sharon.

316
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,030
Oh, I could never leave New York.

317
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:59,631
We leave my parents in Sharon.
We'd live in New York, of course.

318
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,405
It's just, at some point, we may want a
little more space if we have four kids.

319
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:06,276
I want two children.

320
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,216
Two kids is... Two is perfect!
Two is... Two is perfect for me.

321
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,378
Because four is really a lot.

322
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,446
[Clears Throat] And you'll be able
to stay at home with them and...

323
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,492
No, I'll be working.

324
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,857
I mean, when not working full-time.

325
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,260
Of course, you're gonna have
a career: journalism.

326
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,925
- Architecture.
- [Sighs]

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,161
Architecture? Since when?

328
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,033
I don't know.
It's just some thoughts I've had.

329
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,699
Thoughts you...
You majored in journalism, but...

330
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,368
[Clears Throat] The point is...
The important thing is...

331
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:38,345
I think we agree with each other
on just about everything.

332
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:41,940
[Clears Throat]
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?

333
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:45,350
Oh, is... It's time for dessert.
Yes, it is.

334
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,254
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll just attend to a small matter.

335
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,885
- It's ready just as you wished, Mr. Spence.
- You think it's gonna work?

336
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,055
- Here we are, sir.
- Oh, look at... That's... That's perfect.

337
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:59,362
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Now, let me show you my end of the deal.

338
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,595
- Whoo! That's a honey, huh?
- Oh-ho. Oh, yes.

339
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,503
Look at that.
It set me back just a little bit.

340
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,441
It's a brilliant idea, sir.
Very romantic.

341
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,911
- Yes, well, that's the kind of guy I am.
- Oh, I can see that.

342
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,006
- I'm just gonna lay that right down there.
- [Chuckling]

343
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,575
- Is that gonna knock her socks off?
I think so. - Yes, sir. Shall we?

344
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:22,089
- I'm relying on you, Umberto.
- Good luck, sir.

345
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,492
Is everything okay?

346
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,494
- All taken care of.
- Shall we order dessert?

347
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,496
- I took the liberty.
- You did?

348
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,022
I know you like a take-charge kind
of guy and I'm comin' through for you.

349
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,035
- It's not like you. [Gasps]
- Anything for you.

350
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,799
- Umberto, will you please do the honors?
- Parfait!

351
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,807
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, mmm!

352
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,834
Oh, my God, it's delicious!
And peach, my favorite flavor.

353
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,348
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

354
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,680
- What are you doing?
- Where's the rest of the dessert?

355
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:52,242
- What do you mean? - Where the whipped
cream and the cherry are.

356
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,413
- I ate it.
- You ate the ring?

357
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,957
- What ring?
- Honey, I bought you a diamond ring!

358
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,959
- You did?
- I went to Harry Winston's.

359
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,495
- Where is it?
- I put it in the parfait.

360
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,622
- Why?
- I thought it would be romantic!

361
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,633
You thought it would be romantic
to put a ring on ice cream?

362
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,727
- This was not my idea.
This was D.J.'s idea! - D.J.?

363
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,797
She said it would give it
dramatic flair. I don't believe this.

364
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,603
I ate a diamond ring?

365
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:18,134
I turn around for two seconds and
there's $8,000 going down your throat.

366
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:21,307
- I swallowed a... Oh, my God!
- Take it easy. Stay calm.

367
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,352
- How big was it?
- It was tasteful, believe me.

368
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,910
- It was a big rock.
- I swallowed a what? A karat?

369
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,548
- It was a karat and a half, easily.
- You'd like two carrots?

370
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,558
- I'm dying!
- You're not dying!

371
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:35,653
- Something wrong, sir? - She just swallowed
a little jewelry. It's all right.

372
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,664
- How could you?
- How could I?

373
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:41,259
- Most people look at their food before
they lunge into it. - [Choking]

374
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,203
- Let me check your mouth.
- [Gagging]

375
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,832
I don't think this is going
to present much of a problem.

376
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,376
It's lodged in an accessible place.

377
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:52,072
It's an absolutely beautiful ring!
A solitaire.

378
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,513
A classic. A brilliant choice.
Congratulations.

379
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,711
Oh, congratulations, girl.
It is beautiful.

380
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,051
Katie! Katie, look.
She got engaged.

381
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:04,183
- So, uh, what is it, about two karats?
- No, a karat and a half.

382
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,454
- White gold?
- No, it's solid platinum.

383
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,462
- Solid?
- Harry Winston's.

384
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,464
- What'd you pay?
- Eight thousand.

385
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,298
I can get this same ring for you
for six from my brother-in-law.

386
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,135
I am so happy for you!
He is a wonderful man.

387
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,436
Yeah. Am I gonna scar?

388

# Doctors look at X-rays
but they seldom grin #

[D.J. Narrating] Summer came and Lane and
Laura got jobs at the Metropolitan Museum...

417
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,713
and spent weekends
at the beach.

418
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:20,084
Mom put together a group
of artists and writers...

419
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,749
to petition for the parole
of Charles Ferry,

420
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,758
her new pet cause.

421
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:28,421
She even visited the prison and
was just appalled by the conditions.

422
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:31,556
What we need are open prisons.

423
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:36,593
Space. Space where the damaged
human spirit can heal.

424
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,469
I say give them an opportunity
to participate...

425
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:44,001
in decorating their own cells
with their own personal decorators.

426
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,277
And better cuisine.
European menus.

427
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,616
[D.J. Narrating] As for me, well, over the
years I was used to splitting summers up;

428
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,145
July with Mom in New York
and August with Dad in Europe.

429
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,887
Usually it was Paris,
but this time he took me to Venice.

430
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,761
Well, I think he still wanted to get
over memories of Giselle dumping him.

431
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:07,768
Well, all I can say is, if we're
gonna talk about romantic cities...

432
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,430
I mean, they've got
the most gorgeous guys there...

433
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,735
and they can't keep
their hands off you.

434
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:15,970
It's great. The whole first week
was just heaven for me.

435
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:19,605
I was just having a ball,
sailing around on gondolas.

436
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,775
But Dad, well, he just seemed
to hang around the hotel.

437
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,843
Giselle was still haunting him.

438
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,253
# I'm thru with love #

439
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,350
# I'll never fall again #

440
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:36,090
# Said adieu to love #

00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,128
# For I must have you #

443
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,365
# Or no one #

444
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,234
# And so I'm thru #

445
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,007
# With love #

446
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,810
# I've locked my heart #

447
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:01,378
# I'll keep my feelings there #

448
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:05,187
# I've stocked my heart #

449
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,696
# With icy, frigid air #

450
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:12,164
# And I mean to fall #

451
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,565
# For no one #

452
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:21,599
# Because I'm thru with love ##

453
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:26,544
I just feel so guilty.
I mean, I'm having all the luck.

454
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,548
- You should have fun.
- I am.

455
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,107
I still can't figure out
what went wrong with Giselle.

456
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,246
You know, I always thought
she was a little flighty.

457
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:38,088
- You want a drink? I'm gonna have a beer.
- Yeah. A Bellini.

458
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,628
- Let me give you this advice.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,291
In life, when a relationship breaks up
that you're in... I hope they don't...

460
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,733
- Thank you. - It's better
to be the leaver than the "leavee."

461
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:53,206
'Cause the leaver leaves, but
the "leavee" is left, and it's terrible.

462
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:57,870
The worst that happens to the leaver
is a little survivor guilt,

463
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:01,245
and survivor guilt is the worst thing
that should ever happen to you.

464
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:04,217
Yeah? Well, tomorrow
I'll spend with you.

465
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,879
- It's not necessary, really.
- No, it's okay.

466
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:10,550
Don't turn around. That's the couple.
Don't turn around.

467
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,721
- Who? - I told you about her.
I watched her check in the other day.

468
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:18,027
She's really lovely,
but I think married.

469
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,659
- Isn't she...
- Oh, my God!

470
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,568
- She's beautiful, right?
- I know who she is.

471
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,572
You're kidding?

472
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,404
Why didn't I think of it?
She's perfect for you.

473
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,036
How could she be perfect for me?
She's married.

474
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:33,842
No, she's not happily married.
You'd love her.

475
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,850
Tell me, who is she?
How do you know her?

476
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,354
My friend's mother is her shrink.
I know everything about her.

477
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,855
- You're kidding. What's her name?
- I don't know.

478
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,054
- What do you mean, you don't know?
Stop teasing me. - I'm serious.

479
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,894
- Who is she? - She's an art historian
and she's here to see the Tintorettos.

480
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,627
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm thinking?

481
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,226
- You got that look on your face.
- This is perfect.

482
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:59,000
- She jogs every morning alone.
- Yeah?

483
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,598
You could go and bump into her
and meet her.

484
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,735
No, thank you.
She's a married woman.

485
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,405
I'm telling you,
she's not happily married.

486
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:10,349
- Mm-hmm? - Complete
mismatch. The guy's some actor.

487
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:13,285
Anyway, it won't interfere
tomorrow because he sleeps late,

488
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:15,288
so you'll have no problem.

489
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:18,723
You can meet her. She'll definitely
be alone. I know this for a fact.

490
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,727
It's perfect.

491
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm out of shape.
I can't jog. I can't do it.

492
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,665
I haven't touched my treadmill
in weeks... 572 weeks. That's 11 years.

493
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:32,137
- I wheeze. Stop looking at me like that.
- No.

494
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,834
- I'm not gonna do this.
- We're gonna get you some jogging clothes.

495
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:38,345
- She is really something.
- Tomorrow morning... you're gonna jog.

496
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,226
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

497
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,322
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you all right?

498
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,493
- Yeah. - You don't happen
to know which way the Gritti is?

499
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,629
Uh... I think it's back that way.

500
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,639
- [Panting] Over there?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,700
- 'Cause jogging in Venice,
everything is so serpen... - Labyrinthine.

502
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,712
- Labyrinthine!
- Yes. You okay?

503
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,714
[Panting]
Yes, I'm fine.

504
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:50,580
You gotta keep in shape.
I jog every day. You?

505
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,745
- Yes, I do.
- You an American?

506
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,278
- I... Yeah.
- It's a great country, isn't it?

507
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,019
- It's beautiful.
- The mountains and the prairies.

508
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,654
- Oh, Amer... Yeah, America. - The oceans,
you know, white with foam and everything.

509
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,994
So... [Groans]

510
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,967
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yes.

511
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,231
- Sit down.
- No, I'm okay. [Coughs]

512
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,135
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

513
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,573
I have a pain in my chest
that's radiating down my arm.

514
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:19,704
- That's your heart. - No. In my case,
it's stress. I get it every other day.

515
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,408
- Okay. Breathe.
- What is your name?

516
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:24,815
- Von! Oh, here you are.
- Hi.

517
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,855
I was just giving him
directions. Are you okay?

518
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,653
- Okay. You said you wanted to do
three miles. Come on. - You okay?

519
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,853
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Breathe, breathe.

520
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,828
Nice shoes.

521
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:39,526
[Panting] First I nearly
drop dead. I couldn't breathe.

522
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,534
Then her husband showed up.

523
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,196
Her husband did come, huh? That's rare.

524
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,173
Rare? So is a coronary
thrombosis in our family.

525
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,209
Oh, did you get her name?

526
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,768
Von. Vonnie.

527
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:55,805
Listen, she's passionate about Tintoretto.
She's working on a book about him.

528
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:59,683
Obviously she's here to visit
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

529
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,780
I don't know what all this means.
What are all these art books?

530
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:06,850
She'll be at the Scuola. He
won't. They have nothing in common.

531
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:09,795
You bump into her again. Now
the groundwork's been laid.

532
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,389
You say, " Hello.
Didn't we meet jogging?"

533
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,799
I was the guy who had the sudden stroke.

534
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,600
Then you impress her with your
knowledge of her favorite painter.

535
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:21,801
Hey, you gotta be kidding. My
knowledge of art is limited...

536
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,743
to Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh.

537
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,542
- What the hell do I know about this?
- Trust me, Dad.

538
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:31,608
Before we leave Venice, your
lips will be pressed to hers.

539
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:35,315
Yes. Unfortunately, I left
my Chapstick in New York.

540
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:42,962
What is this? "The rapidity
of his brush strokes..."

541
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,466
"Chiaroscuro outbursts of color..."

542
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:49,162
[D.J. Narrating] I told Dad
everything I knew about Von...

543
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,501
and he studied his Tintoretto book.

544
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:55,303
I told him her likes, her
dislikes, her deepest feelings,

545
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:58,834
everything from her passion for Bora
Bora and "Mahler's Fourth Symphony"...

546
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,847
to her favorite flower:
the African daisy.

547
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,849
I mean, it was everything.

548
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,148
When he showed up at the
Tintoretto Museum that afternoon,

549
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,054
he could've given a
course on the subject.

550
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:14,151
- Hello again.
- Hi. Goodness.

551
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,696
You lived. How are you? I was concerned.

552
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:20,097
Oh, no, I was fine. I just
went back to the hotel before...

553
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:23,331
and had the concierge...
oil my pacemaker.

554
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,840
- [Chuckles] - You know, I...
Incidentally, my name is Joe Berlin.

555
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,035
Vonnie Sydell.

556
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,544
It's a funny coincidence I see you here.

557
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:36,015
You know, two New Yorkers jogging in
Venice and we bump into each other.

558
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,881
- How did you know I was a New Yorker?
- No, I didn't.

559
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,184
But, you know, I, like,
assumed that, you know...

560
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:45,191
You're completely correct
to ask that question.

561
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,285
It's a good question. You
should not be ashamed of it.

562
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:51,559
Well, I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?

563
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:55,830
In Paris. Well, I-I was a New
Yorker, but now I settled in Paris.

564
00:35:55,903 --> 00:36:00,203
But I come back to New York all
the time 'cause I love it there.

565
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,139
What brings you here?

566
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,738
Oh, I wouldn't think of being in Venice
without checking out the Tintorettos,

567
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:10,443
because he was... he's my
favorite... master in the world.

568
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:13,112
I just adore his work.
I'm crazy about it.

569
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,121
He was a very deep genius.

570
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:19,990
The deepest. Th-The
rapidity of his brush work.

571
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:23,292
Th-The chiaroscuro...
outbursts of color.

572
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,731
His capacity for controlled gesture.

573
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:31,295
[Clears Throat] Born in 1519,
only to die again in 1594,

574
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:35,570
but that's... the way
it happens to most of us.

575
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,840
So you have a real
appreciation of his work.

576
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:42,815
How could I not have an appreciation
of a man who was short in stature...

577
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:45,910
but with a proud and obstinate nature,

578
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:50,185
who painted outside the,
the academic convention...

579
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:54,024
of 16th century Venice? [Chuckles]

580
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,029
What do you do, Mr. Berlin?

581
00:36:56,097 --> 00:37:00,466
You can call me Joe. I'm-I'm-I'm
a writer. Novelist, mostly.

582
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:03,594
Joe Berlin. I saw one of your books.

583
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:07,038
I did. I remember it.
It had a very sexy cover.

584
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:10,839
It was at the stalls on
Fifth Avenue, the 99-cent bin.

585
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:14,109
Well, you know, probably... [Clears
Throat] the get-acquainted price.

586
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,274
- Oh.
- They'll do that sometimes.

587
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,944
In the United States, I'm
considered controversial,

588
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,547
but in Paris, where they have
an ear for literature, I...

589
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,558
You know, they were quick
to recognize the genius...

590
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:28,220
of Poe and Faulkner and myself.

591
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,799
Well, basically, you
see, I'm a simple guy.

592
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,963
My idea is just to live in
Paris and maybe, you know,

593
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,336
fall in love and...

594
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:42,570
and take walks, uh, in the rain...

595
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,339
and-and, uh, listen to music,

596
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:49,076
like, uh, particularly,
maybe "Mahler's Fourth."

597
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,245
- This could be me talking. "Mahler's
Fourth" destroys me. - Could it?

598
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,347
Ah, yes, "Mahler's Fourth," no question.

599
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,120
I... I... See, I'm not... I'm not a, uh...

600
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,855
what you'd call a, uh,
uh, a technology guy.

601
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:04,557
- I hate technology.
- I know. I could tell by looking at you.

602
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:07,100
I-I-I, uh... I'm...
I still work on...

603
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:11,298
one of those old-fashioned antique
portable typewriters that-that...

604
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,773
Are you telling me you haven't
succumbed to the cerebral computer age?

605
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:18,107
[Scoffs] You know, I'm telling
you, I like the simple life.

606
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,647
I like to sit in my
room in Paris and write,

607
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,207
maybe visit New York a certain
amount in the summertime.

608
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:29,587
Maybe spend some time some place
romantic, like, um, Bora Bora.

609
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,493
I... I love Bora Bora.

610
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,189
Since the first time I went there,
I can't get it out of my mind.

611
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:38,697
Well, naturally. You
know, it's beautiful.

612
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:41,894
At night, the stars are so
luminous you can practically...

613
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,903
- Read by them.
- read by them.

614
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,963
Yes. Are you okay?

615
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:51,535
A little mist appeared in your eye then.

616
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,104
I thought you were gonna cry. I
swear, I thought you were gonna cry.

617
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:57,207
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.

618
00:38:57,284 --> 00:39:00,879
- Are you sure? Is something wrong?
- No, um...

619
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,288
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
Something's so exactly right.

620
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,292
- Yes?
- Yeah.

621
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,591
Wait here one second.
I'll be right back.

622
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:20,696
# All my life #

623
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:27,773
# I've been waiting for you #

624
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:32,177
# My wonderful one #

625
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:37,748
# I've begun living #

626
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,791
# All my life #

627
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:51,928
# All my love #

628
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:59,337
# Has been waiting for you #

629
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:04,807
# My life is sublime #

630
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:11,120
# Now that I'm giving #

631
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,993
# All my love ##

632
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,199
I got you a present.

633
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,463
An African daisy. This is my favorite.

634
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:25,733
You know, what are you doing tonight?

635
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:29,298
I think Greg and I have plans.

636
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,901
- [Door Opening]
- Hey, how'd it go?

637
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:35,847
She was absolutely great. Whatever
you told me was right on the money.

638
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,180
- I feel guilty.
- Why?

639
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:42,951
Because, you know, I made her cry.
She said that she felt close to me.

640
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,857
So? You've established a beachhead.
Now you go on and win the battle.

641
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:51,091
Don't forget to blow on her back between
her shoulder blades. It makes her crazy.

642
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,292
Hey, I'm not gonna do that.

643
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,302
What goes on between her
and her shrink is private.

644
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,862
What are you gonna do, give me
a map of her erogenous zones?

645
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,376
- Dad, are you seeing her tonight?
- No, she's married!

646
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:07,881
Listen, I'm not that guy. I don't
know Bora Bora from Walla Walla.

647
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:10,382
What the hell do I
know about Tintoretto?

648
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,148
I can't tell the difference between
his chiaroscuro and his segretto sauce.

649
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,883
Don't forget to blow
between her shoulder blades.

650
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:19,391
I'm not gonna blow between
her shoulder blades.

651
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,224
Plus, I use a word
processor, not a typewriter.

652
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:26,460
I hope you have something great to wear
tonight, 'cause we're going to a party.

653
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:28,468
A party? I...

654
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,936
I wanna introduce you to someone.

655
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,399
- Dad.
- [Kisses Cheek]

656
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,377
This is Alberto.

657
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,606
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

658
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,945
Who are all these people? This is, uh...

659
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:46,578
- Venetians. Friends, guests in town.
- Yes?

660
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,122
Did your enjoy your staying in Venice?

661
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,852
Fabulous. It's the best. Absolutely
the best. She'll tell you.

662
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,862
Dad, I wanted you to meet Alberto because
I think you should be the first to know:

663
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,864
We're getting married.

664
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,594
Wonderful. Let me know what
century, I'll rent a tux.

665
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,533
This January.

666
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,594
- Pardon me?
- This January.

667
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:07,539
This January. [Chuckles]
You're joking, of course.

668
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,838
I am in love with Djuna.

669
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,640
We all love this little
girl because she's adorable.

670
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,409
But... But you are... This is a jest.

671
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:20,317
It is January 15, to be exact.
It's his mother's birthday.

672
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:24,756
- A joke. A jest, right? Am I right?
- Not at all.

673
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,884
Excuse... Excuse me one second. Come on.

674
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:31,489
I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Come
over here. Just for a second. Right here.

675
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:34,898
What are you talking about?
Tell me this is a joke.

676
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,903
Otherwise, there's gonna be carnage.

677
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,235
We're crazy about each other.

678
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,504
How can you be crazy... You
met this guy... five days ago.

679
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,171
- So? - What do you mean, so?
Are you having a breakdown?

680
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:48,181
Why, because I'm in love?

681
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:51,013
What do you mean, you're in
love? With what? What does he do?

682
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,747
- He's a gondolier.
- A... No, thank you.

683
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,984
- He's one of those guys with the
striped shirt and the hat? - No hat.

684
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,855
- What do you mean, no hat?
- He doesn't wear a hat.

685
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,363
This is crazy. What are
you, you know... Talk to me.

686
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,763
- Are you gonna... Are you talking
about getting married? - Yes.

687
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,768
- That's insanity.
- Why is it insanity?

688
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,294
Because you have to go to school.
You're gonna go back to Columbia.

689
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:15,638
You're gonna major in journalism
or law, not... not rowing.

690
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:19,145
People have dropped out of
Columbia before. It's been done.

691
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:22,239
You are not going to
run off with a guy...

692
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:24,841
who you just met and who's a gondolier.

693
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:27,045
- He's a poet.
- He's a poet?

694
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:30,454
Let me tell you what rhymes
with gondolier: no lira.

695
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,685
- Okay? So, forget it.
- Oh, God, Dad.

696
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,067
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, again.

697
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:46,664
- My God, what a coincidence.
- This is, uh... Joe, Greg.

698
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,605
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hi.

699
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:52,510
- Were you... You were running this
morning... with the heart? - That was me.

700
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,843
Have you seen Bernardo
Bertolucci? Is he here?

701
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:57,941
I wouldn't recognize him
'cause it's a madhouse in there.

702
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,510
- Do you mind if I go ahead? If you want
to talk. Okay. - It's an absolute madhouse.

703
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:03,522
I'll get you a drink.

704
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,683
- Incredible. I mean...
- Is it?

705
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,786
Have you seen this place? I was
just going home. It's unbelievable.

706
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:14,630
- They have a... The whole thing is like
it's an old palazzo. - Oh, wow.

707
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:16,829
- And it's really, really beautiful.
- [Gasps]

708
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,134
But, you know, frantic in there.

709
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,333
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh.

710
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,002
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

711
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,479
- Why?
- I don't know. I can't take a compliment.

712
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:30,210
You look terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.

713
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:33,014
No, it's my problem. [Laughs]

714
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,784
- Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.

715
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:39,417
You seem to have all
the answers, don't you?

716
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:41,825
I think it makes you feel guilty.

717
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:46,559
I think that you must have fantasies
of maybe somebody coming along that...

718
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:50,501
You probably have dreams about boats...

719
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:52,698
or... ships, maybe,

720
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:57,437
or maybe even, you know,
like an elevator that...

721
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:01,038
You're on an elevator and it goes
higher and higher to the top floor...

722
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,709
and then it doesn't stop at the top,

723
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,116
it just goes right through the roof...

724
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,451
and it just sort of
flies you over the ocean.

725
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:14,460
I think I'm gonna faint. I do.

726
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,787
- Are you okay?
- Uh, uh, no.

727
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:20,766
I'm... I'm a little overwhelmed...

728
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:24,531
and I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.

729
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:26,800
[Blowing]

730
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,819
[D.J. Narrating] The next
morning, we left Venice.

731
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:53,094
Dad made a flight to Paris
and I went to New York.

732
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,227
I couldn't wait to tell
Mom about marrying Alberto.

733
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,897
He was so beautiful, so sensitive.

734
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:03,272
My plan was to drop out of Columbia
after the fall term and move to Italy.

735
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:08,347
- Uh, excuse me. That's mine.
- No, it's...

736
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,406
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

737
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:12,850
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's not mine.

738
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,356
- It's okay. We both like shopping
at Hunting World. - That's where I got it.

739
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:19,358
- Oh, God, now I know it's mine.
- It's all right. I'll give you a hand.

740
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,519
- Thanks.
- Um... your bra.

741
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:24,462
- [Chuckles] Thank you. Yeah.
- Underwear.

742
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,590
Petrarch's sonnets. What do you do?

743
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,932
Um, depends who the guy
is. No, just kidding.

744
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:34,235
Um, I actua... 'Cause I work
for the Colombian drug cartel.

745
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,243
- Yeah, I gift wrap
the cocaine. - Mm-hmm.

746
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,474
Why am I so nervous? I'm
a student at Columbia.

747
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,015
- Oh, is that right? My uncle teaches there.
- No.

748
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:46,678
Yeah. Math Department.
I'm, uh, Ken Grisley.

749
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:48,846
Djuna Berlin.

750
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:52,255
[D.J. Narrating] Did I really want
to spend my life making pasta...

751
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,692
and riding around in gondolas?

752
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:57,992
To tell you the truth, those
canals are awfully polluted.

753
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,192
I mean, Alberto was cute,

754
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:03,464
but Ken was... hot.

755

# Lovey mine #

00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:17,773
# Cuddle up and be my little #

758
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,820
# Clinging vine #

00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:26,592
# I like to feel your cheeks so rosy #

760
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,324
# Like to make you comfy-cozy #

761
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:36,165

762
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:39,603

## [Both Singing In Hindi]

765
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,446
[D.J. Narrating] While I'd been
away, an awful lot had happened.

766
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,751
Mom bought Skylar a
drop-dead wedding dress,

767
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,792
and Holden's father and
my stepdad became friends.

768
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:35,828
They discovered a common
interest: horse racing.

769
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,524
So, they chipped in and
bought a thoroughbred.

770
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,727
And Lane and Laura had a
great time at the beach.

771
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,863
But one hot summer weekend, with
everyone else in New York away,

772
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:48,464
they found themselves in town.

773
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,758
- So, we're probably the only ones left
in the city this weekend. - Yeah.

774
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:15,131
We usually go to South Hampton, but
this weekend we had tickets to a show.

775
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,797
I love the city when it's empty.

776
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,806
- Me too.
- Me too.

777
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:26,103
[D.J. Narrating] To make a long
story short, they've all become close.

778
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:30,047
His name... if you can believe
it... is Jeffrey Vandermost,

779
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:32,483
and he's heir to the
Vandermost millions.

780
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,852
Meanwhile, they're both in love with him,
and one of them's heading for a broken heart.

781
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:41,393
[D.J. Narrating] Fall was
particularly beautiful this year.

782
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:44,396
I think I like it even
better than spring,

783
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:47,456
and with October comes Mom's birthday.

784
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:50,992
This year we invited Holden's
parents over to celebrate,

785
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,802
but just before they arrived
we had an unexpected visitor.

786
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,809
That's a gorgeous color.

787
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,811
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

788
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,814
- These are from your ex-husband,
my biological father. - Oh! Joe!

789
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,817
- Oh, look, everybody!
- You know what that is? That's caviar.

790
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:08,321
Frieda, could you put this on
ice? Nothing like sturgeon eggs.

791
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,322
- Are you expecting Mr. Ferry?
- I am, yes.

792
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,324
- [Bob] You are?
- Charles Ferry?

793
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:15,327
He just got out of prison. He has
no family. I figured, you know...

794
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:17,329
- So he can join our family?
- What?

795
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:21,333
- You're letting a criminal come into this
house? - He's paid his debt to society.

796
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,835
Don't start. I don't wanna hear this.

797
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:27,840
No! Society forgave him his debts.
He did not pay his debt to society.

798
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:31,344
How did I wind up with a kid on the other
end of the political spectrum from me?

799
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,845
- Where did I fail?
- You didn't fail, Dad.

800
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:36,849
- If I was you, I'd start hiding the
silverware. - Don't be rude, Scott.

801
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,852
- [Doorbell Rings]
- He's coming over for just a drink.

802
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,854
[Steffi] You guys have everything.

803
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:45,517
Mr. Ferry, hi. I'm... I'm Bob
Dandridge. This is my wife Steffi.

804
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:48,527
Hello, Mr. Ferry. Welcome
to our home. Welcome.

805
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,530
I'd like you to meet my daughter Skylar.

806
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:54,032
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- This is Skylar and her fiance Holden.

807
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:56,035
[Clears Throat] I'm... I'm the fiance.

808
00:50:56,103 --> 00:50:59,095
- Uh, can I get you something to dr...
- Nobody gets behind me.

809
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:01,106
- [Nervous Chuckle]
- Right. Okay. Sure.

810
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:04,302
- Uh, can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, vodka.

811
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:07,312
Right. Maybe, uh, on
the... Uh, or, or...

812
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,314
- Maybe right in the arm.
- Just... Just...

813
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:11,816
I'll, I'll get you a... Straight up.

814
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,819
Honey, Mr. Perr... Mr. Ferry. Sorry.

815
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:17,983
Uh, he's been living amongst vicious
killers. No wonder he's skittish.

816
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:20,993
- A lot of times a guy'll come up
behind ya and... Swish! - "Swish"?

817
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,996
You get your blade out quick, you
stick it in him, or you're dead.

818
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:25,998
- Ahh.
- The blade. The blade.

819
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:29,001
H-Have you stuck a lot of
other inmates, Mr. Ferry?

820
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,003
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Enough.

821
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:33,005
- Uh, the d... the doorbell.
- That's enough for me.

822
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:35,007
- How many is "enough"?
- How is that?

823
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:37,509
- Would you like another one?
- Oh, it's your parents.

824
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,841
- Hi! Hello. How are you?
- Ohh!

825
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,847
- Good to see you, dear.
- Hi, Arnold.

826
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:45,351
- Happy birthday, Steffi.
- Oh, thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.

827
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:48,353
Hi, Arnold. I have
someone I want you to meet.

828
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,356
Mr. Ferry. Mr. Ferry. I'd
like you to meet Mr. Ferry.

829
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:53,858
This is my good friend Lynn.

830
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:55,861
- And this is Arnold.
- I must say...

831
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,864
- Mr. Ferry is just out of prison.
- Yes, I'm aware.

832
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:02,368
I'm lucky the parole came through, but
I was gonna get out one way or the other.

833
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:04,995
- What exactly does that mean?
- Ice the guard.

834
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:07,005
- No pictures, sister.
- I'm sorry.

835
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:09,507
What do you mean, "ice the guard"?

836
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:12,010
- Get out through the ventilation shaft.
- Ice. Really?

837
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:15,514
Come up behind him with a box
cutter, rip out his carotid artery.

838
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,516
- Oh.
- What's a box cutter?

839
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:20,519
- May I have a glass of white wine?
- We have white wine.

840
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,521
You gotta be careful, though.

841
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:26,025
Guy on cell block four tried it,
didn't have all the angles figured.

842
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:29,027
- Got his tit caught in the wringer.
- His tit? Really?

843
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:32,155
- Oh, uh, the terrace.
- Let's go up to the terrace.

844
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,167
- Good idea. Let's get some
wine. - Big, wide-open spaces.

845
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,169
Are you sure this guy is rehabilitated?

846
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,172
Honey, he was in prison,
not a finishing school.

847
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,174
Well, you know my sentiments,

848
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,176
but very happy birthday.

849
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,303
A birthday song for Steffi.

850
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:53,682
# Looking at you while
troubles are fleeing #

851
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,586
# I'm admiring the view #

852
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:58,783
# 'Cause it's you I'm seeing #

853
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,623
# And the sweet honeydew #

854
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:07,930
# Of well-being settles upon me #

855
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:11,500

00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:13,630
# That shines when you enter #

857
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:16,471
# Like a star in the night #

858
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:21,571
# And what's to prevent her
from destroying my sight #

859
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:28,986
# If you center all of it on me #

860

# Looking at you #

861
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,418
# I'm filled with the essence of #

00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:38,590
# The quintessence of joy #

00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:40,860
# Looking at you #

864
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:43,835
# I hear poets tellin' of #

865
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:47,067
# Lovely Helen of Troy #

866
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,131
# Darling #

867
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:51,837
# Life seemed so gray #

868
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:56,849
# I wanted to end it
'til that wonderful day #

869
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,317
# You started to mend it #

870
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:02,549
# And if you'll only stay #

871
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:04,920
# Then I'll spend it #

872
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,516
# Looking at #

873
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:10,586
# You ##

[Kisses]

875
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,960
[Steffi] Sweetie. [Continues Kissing]

876
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:17,970
- Ohh.
- [Bob] Is that okay?

877
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:19,972
Okay? Honey.

878
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,975
- I'm gonna grab a few drinks.
You want anything? - No, thanks.

879
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:26,479
But before you do, would you get Steffi's
present for me? I left it in the car.

880
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:29,777
- Oh, yeah.
- Holden, here.

881
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:33,551
[Skylar] Are you enjoying the view?

882
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,953
I like any view after years and
years in that stinkin' rat hole.

883
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,321
Oh. That's very vividly put.

884
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,326
S-Sweetly honest.

885
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:44,329
You know what it's like
in solitary confinement?

886
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:46,831
No, I can't say that I do.

887
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,835
I went to N.Y.U. I didn't
even stay in the dorm.

888
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:53,839
- You know how long it is since I smelled
perfume? - Oh, do I have too much on?

889
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:57,343
No, to me you smell like what
I think heaven would smell like.

890
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,844
Oh. Well, thank you. That's really nice.

891
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:04,612
When you shook my hand before, I
thought my heart was gonna stop.

892
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:06,618
Oh, that's sweet. [Chuckles]

893
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:10,122
Uh, but remember, you've been
very deprived of female contact.

894
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,626
I used to lie in my cell at night
and dream of somebody like you.

895
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:15,957
[Laughs] Yeah.

896
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:19,430
Oh, uh, I took, um, a
criminology class in college.

897
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:22,127
- A very insight...
- You have very sensual lips.

898
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:25,933
Oh. O-Oh, well, i-it's a
part of me I rarely think of.

899
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:29,339
- Can I smell your hair?
- You wanna smell my hair?

900
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,140
Okay. You know what? It's
gonna be all gone soon.

901
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:36,649
I was thinking of cutting it. I
think Holden might like it short.

902
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:39,651
You know what I would
do if you were my girl?

903
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,983
It's a little chilly outside.

904
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:45,991
- Maybe I should get a shawl. - I would
make love to you in every room in the house.

905
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,761
On every bed.

906
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:52,263
On every rug.

907
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:55,096
On every tabletop.

908
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:59,104
We also have some lovely
early American chandeliers.

909
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:02,607
Let's go for a drive.

910
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:07,980
Um, no. I don't think that
that would be such a good idea.

911
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:12,007
I haven't seen the ocean or been
up to Harlem or Chinatown in years.

912
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:14,417
Oh, no, i-it's out of the question.

913
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:17,888
- Okay, but you can't blame me for tryin'.
- No.

914
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,892
I think that we should
get back inside before...

915
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,894
Before what?

916
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,396
Before you break your parole.

917
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:30,402
If I took you in my arms and kissed
you right now, would you dime on me?

918
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,938
- "Dime"?
- Turn me in.

919
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:35,634
Oh. Let's not find out.

920
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,642
Mmm.

921
00:56:48,054 --> 00:56:50,079
How was it?

922
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,090
Uh...

923
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,822
Very interesting.

924
00:56:56,896 --> 00:57:00,332
I've never been kissed
by a sociopath before.

925
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,129
I kissed you the best I could,

926
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:07,139
considering the only practice I
had kissing in the last 10 years...

927
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,141
is with Vincent "The Thumb" Adatto.

928
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:22,320
Jeez.

929
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:25,323
Vincent "The Thumb" doesn't
know what he's missing.

930
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,860
Can I see you again?

931
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,862
[Sighs] Well...

932
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,300
You know, I'm getting married.

933
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:42,564
# I could show the world how to smile #

934
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:45,236
# I could be glad #

935
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:49,145
# All of the while #

936
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:53,174
# I could change the
gray skies to blue #

937
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:56,586
# If I had you #

938
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:04,023
# I could leave the old days behind #

939
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:06,827
# Leave all my pals #

940
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,768
# I'd never mind #

941
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:14,864
# I could start my life all anew #

942
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:18,570
# If I had you #

943
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:26,816
# I could climb the
snowcapped mountains #

944
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:32,119
# Sail the mighty ocean wide #

945
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:37,687
# I could cross the burning desert #

946
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:43,031
# If I had you by my side #

947
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:47,232
# I could be a king, dear, uncrowned #

948
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:49,707
# Humble or poor #

949
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,609
# Rich or renowned #

950
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,976
# There is nothing I couldn't do #

951
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:02,249
# If I had you ##

952
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:13,356
- Oh, wow. I can't believe this.
- Shut up, for once.

953
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:16,368
He's en route to New York now,

954
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:18,370
and he's wonderful.

955
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:20,872
It's been, like, a chance meeting,

956
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,875
after all these years,
with a true soul mate.

957
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:25,877
He senses my every need.

958
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:28,379
It's like he knows what I'm thinking.

959
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:31,042
- It's like your fantasy come true.
- I... It is.

960
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,608
I-I still can't believe it.

961
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:37,679
You know, it's... it's not
that he's tall or handsome,

962
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:41,056
but he's, um... he's magical.

963
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:45,655
[Von] And he feels me in a way
that no man ever has before.

964
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:49,998
It's... He's romantic and he's sexy.

965
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:53,334
I had this dream that
I was in bed with him...

966
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:56,739
and he was kissing my earlobes...

967
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,870
and then he started
stroking my shoulder blades.

968
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:03,507
I nearly had an orgasm.

969
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:06,518
[D.J. Narrating] I had lots
of neat stuff to tell Dad.

970
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:09,453
He'd really made a big score with Von.

971
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,457
But now I've got to stop for a minute,

972
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,790
because as much as we humans
like to think we control things,

973
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,296
that's not the way it works.

974
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,800
Suddenly, with no warning, Grandpa died.

975
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,804
It was in his sleep,
peaceful, with no suffering,

976
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,466
but it made philosophers of all of us.

977
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,476
When your number is
up, your number is up.

978
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,808
That's why it's very important...

979
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,973
that we cherish each moment,

980
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,244
each moment of our lives,

981
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,252
and not smoke.

982
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,254
Smoke?

983
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:46,258
Wh... I mean, he... Pop
smoked for 70 years, you know.

984
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:48,760
- Well...
- He never exercised. He ate everything.

985
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,763
He ate cholesterol and, and fatty foods.

986
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:54,265
He died at a healthy, ripe old age.

987
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:57,269
I haven't had steak in
so long. I love steak.

988
01:00:57,337 --> 01:00:59,771
- Now you got him talking about food.
- Disgusting.

989
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,273
I'd kill for some marbleized meat.

990
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:07,473
They say six cups of coffee a day
prevents, like, prevents colon cancer.

991
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:10,414
Last week it was bad for you.

992
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:13,543
[Steffi] What's it all about? I mean...

993
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,554
What are we doing? We're
rushing, we're rushing.

994
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:18,556
- Th-That's right.
- Where are we going?

995
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:21,559
- [Laura Whispers] They're so old.
- Into the void.

996
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:24,619
That's it. The void is it, you
know. I never believed in God.

997
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:27,632
- Oh...
- No, I didn't, not even as a little kid.

998
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,134
I used to think... I remember this...

999
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:33,639
...even if He exists, He's done
such a terrible job, - Dad!

1000
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:36,641
it's a wonder people don't file
a class action suit against Him.

1001
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:38,643
You shouldn't be talking about...

1002
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:41,646
There's gotta be some reason we're
here. It can't just be the new physics.

1003
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:43,648
You gotta believe in something.

1004
01:01:43,716 --> 01:01:45,650
[Bob] The dignity of Man.

1005
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:48,653
The flat tax, the right to
bear arms and school prayer.

1006
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:51,656
- If there's nobody out there,
who are they praying to? - Stop fighting.

1007
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:53,658
- [Steffi] Please don't.
- [All Arguing]

1008
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:57,492
- Please don't start arguing in
front of Grandpa. - I can't believe you.

1009
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:01,090
Wait a minute. He wasn't an
atheist. He wasn't a Republican.

1010
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,193
- He wasn't even a Democrat.
- Well, Mom, he must've been something.

1011
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,534
- He was a foot fetishist.
- Yeah.

1012
01:02:06,606 --> 01:02:09,541
- It's the only group I remember
him belonging to. - That's true.

1013
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:11,543
He drove your mother crazy.

1014
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,637
- [Clears Throat]
- Pop, is that you?

1015
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:17,148
I've got just one message for you.

1016
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:21,619
You work and work for years and
years, you're always on the go.

1017
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:25,714
You never take a minute
off. Too busy makin' dough.

1018
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:30,024
Someday, you say, you'll have
your fun when you're a millionaire.

1019
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,326
# Imagine all the fun you'll have #

1020
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:34,332
# In your old rocking chair #

1021
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,834
# Enjoy yourself #

1022
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,969
# It's later than you think #

1023
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,138
# Enjoy yourself #

1024
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:50,409
# While you're still in the pink #

1025
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:54,783
# The years go by as quickly as a wink #

1026
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,981
# Enjoy yourself Enjoy yourself #

1027
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,455
# It's later than you think #

1028
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,583
# Bum bum-bah-bum
Bum bum-bah-bum #

1029
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,423
# Bum-bum-bum
Bum bum bum #

1030
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:04,486
# Another birthday's here and gone #

1031
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:06,759
# You've turned another page #

1032
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,926
# And suddenly you realize #

1033
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,128
# That you've reached middle age #

1034
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,468
# Just think of all
the fun you've missed #

1035
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,473
# It makes you kind of sad #

1036
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,600
# It's better to have had your wish #

1037
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,009
# Than to have wished you had #

1038
01:03:55,882 --> 01:03:57,941
- # Enjoy yourself #
- # It's later #

1039
01:03:58,017 --> 01:04:00,076
- # It's later than you think #
- # Later and later #

1040
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:02,143
- # Enjoy yourself #
- # Even later #

1041
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:04,382
- # While you're still in the pink #
- # Later and later #

1042
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,516
# The years go by #

1043
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,560
# And quickly as a wink #

1044
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:10,755
# Enjoy yourself Enjoy yourself #

1045
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,889
# It's later than you think #

1046
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:15,092
# Enjoy yourself Enjoy yourself #

1047
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,260
# It's later than you think #

1048
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:19,395
# Enjoy yourself Enjoy yourself #

1049
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,531
# It's later than you think ##

1050
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,541
That...

1051
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,543
was unbelievable.

1052
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,172
Just every...

1053
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,276
thing you did and...

1054
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:37,880
all the things you did.

1055
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,059
Absolutely perfect.

1056
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,561
[Clears Throat] Well,
actually, it wasn't perfect.

1057
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,793
There was a moment in there when I
stroked when I should have hickeyed,

1058
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:50,461
but, you know, I apologize.

1059
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:52,470
I feel...

1060
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,631
I feel limp. [Sighs]

1061
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:58,234
You know, I'd really love
you to come to Paris with me.

1062
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,245
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?

1063
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,247
Paris?

1064
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,249
And then Bora Bora.

1065
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,252
Well, well, yes, Bora
Bora, but Paris first.

1066
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,312
Then we'd work our way down
to a least one of the Boras.

1067
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:13,017
We can live in your garret.

1068
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:16,084
Uh, t-technically,
w-when I say "garret"...

1069
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,323
I.. It's funny. It is a garret, and yet...

1070
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:21,798
- And drink wine and eat snails
'til the dawn comes up. - Snails?

1071
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:24,301
Yeah. Remember?

1072
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:27,806
You said how you also loved waking
up in the middle of the night,

1073
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:30,808
...sitting in bed eating snails,
drinking wine. - Yes, yes. Yes.

1074
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:33,071
I said it was such a great coincidence.

1075
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:35,079
Well, they're... they're mollusks.

1076
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:37,081
I-I-I love, uh,
a good mollusk.

1077
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:38,582
[Giggles]

1078
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:41,586
W-W-What do you mean,
the wedding is off?

1079
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:44,782
- Exactly what I said. I gave back his ring.
- Why?

1080
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:48,293
Because there's someone else
I can't get out of my mind.

1081
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,296
- But y-you're in love with
Holden! - No, Dad, I'm not.

1082
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:55,300
At least I'm not sure I am, and I can't
cheat on him while I figure it out.

1083
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,303
- Cheat on Holden? He's gonna
be your husband! - No, Dad!

1084
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,307
- In November. I'll show you. I got receipts from
caterers. - Bob, calm your denial mechanism.

1085
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,309
It's not that Holden isn't wonderful.

1086
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,813
It's just that somebody else has come
into my life and I must see where it goes.

1087
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,747
- It wouldn't be fair to Holden if I didn't.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

1088
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:13,751
Now that we've bought you
this fabulous wedding dress,

1089
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:17,255
would you mind telling me who this new
Prince Charming is that suddenly emerged?

1090
01:06:17,323 --> 01:06:20,258
- Well, you don't kn... You do, but not
like I do. - I'm sick.

1091
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:23,762
- Honey, what's the matter?
- My esophagus is going into spasms.

1092
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:27,265
- If my necktie goes up and down...
- Look what you're doing to your father.

1093
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,268
Tell me who has come
between you and Holden.

1094
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,770
- Well, he's bright and charming...
- Yeah?

1095
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:35,773
and rough to the outside,
but that can change.

1096
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:39,174
- Are you gonna tell us, or is this
like a game show? - [Clears Throat]

1097
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,179
You remember Charles Ferry?

1098
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,181
- Pardon me?
- Charles Ferry.

1099
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,184
For a minute I thought
she said Charles Ferry.

1100
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,187
- Now my esophagus is starting to move.
- Charles Ferry?

1101
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,189
- Honey!
- The escaped convict?

1102
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,192
- Skylar! - Ex-convict.
He has a college degree.

1103
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,194
No, Skylar, let me tell you something.

1104
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,197
You're having a psychotic
episode. You need help!

1105
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,200
- You need shock treatment, or
industrial-strength Prozac. - Calm down.

1106
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,202
Mom, you understand.

1107
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,205
There is something incredibly
animalistic about him.

1108
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,707
- We'll turn him over to the zoo.
- Oh, honey.

1109
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,211
- And yet he's like a child.
- Okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.

1110
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,713
- He's a criminal!
- Mom, I'm shocked.

1111
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,716
You've done nothing but
sing his praises for months.

1112
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,718
Well, yes, as a social symbol.

1113
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,721
But as an actual person
to be with my child?

1114
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,520
- How are you going to go out with this man?
- Guys, get out of here.

1115
01:07:27,593 --> 01:07:30,027
You can't get behind
him. He won't let you!

1116
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,530
You try to scratch his
back, he'll knife you!

1117
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:35,533
[Skylar] Under all that veneer
is a very soulful young attorney.

1118
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:38,536
In fact, I was hoping you might
find a place for him in your firm.

1119
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:41,539
[Bob] I'll make him treasurer.
He can share a room with Holden.

1120
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,542
Speaking as a woman, Holden
can be very animal too.

1121
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,545
- Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
- Oh, that's not...

1122
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:50,548
- Get out of here!
- As your father, I forbid you...

1123
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:52,550
to see this man Charles Ferry.

1124
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:54,552
You will marry Holden as planned.

1125
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:58,147
As head of this house, I
command it! I decree it!

1126
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:00,158
Thou shalt wed thy intended!

1127
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:02,319
- Okay, come on, let's have...
- That's it.

1128
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:05,659
Let's get a drink. You're
sounding tiresomely Biblical.

1129
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:09,599
"Tiresomely Biblical"? What is
this, Noel Coward with hockey?

1130
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:13,104
- She's not gonna waste her life like this
on a gangster. - Oh, she's a grown woman!

1131
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,106
- You!
- What?

1132
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:18,109
- You got him out of jail!
- This is my fault now?

1133
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,873
- [Sobbing]
- Honey, what? What's wrong?

1134
01:08:20,946 --> 01:08:24,382
Jeffrey Vandermost asked
Lane out and not me.

1135
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,384
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God!

1136
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:29,387
How am I gonna face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?

1137
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:31,389
Is that all you're thinking about?

1138
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:33,391
We bought a race horse together.

1139
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,893
He's gonna want to cut it in half!

1140
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:38,896
We both liked him, and today
he asked if we could talk alone,

1141
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:40,898
so I got all excited.

1142
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:44,595
And then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him...

1143
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:47,104
if he asked her to a
dance in Connecticut...

1144
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:49,607
and that he had a mad crush on her.

1145
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:53,111
Ohh. These things happen. Feelings
are feelings and sometimes...

1146
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:57,843
# I'm thru with love
I'll never fall again #

1147
01:08:57,917 --> 01:09:01,250
What are you saying? You're 14
years old. You'll fall again.

1148
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,255
Oh, you guys, I am so sorry.

1149
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:08,123
I thought you'd be happy for me.
I hope in time you understand.

1150
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:12,494
- # I'm thru with love I'll never fall
again # - What are you singing about?

1151
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,500
You're not in love with Holden, are you?

1152
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,334
# I'm thru with love #

1153
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,806
# I'll never fall again #

1154
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:26,777
# Said adieu to love #

1155
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:29,280
# Don't ever call again ##

1156
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:32,283
[D.J. Narrating] While Skylar was breaking
up with Holden, - ## [Continues]

1157
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:35,582
I broke up with Ken, the
guy I met at the airport,

1158
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:37,645
because I met this rap singer.

1159
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:41,352
I mean, this guy is just
so talented and sexy...

1160
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,362
and, you know, he just says it all.

1161
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,863
# Check it I'm thru with love #

1162
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,364
- # I'm thru with all you motherfuckers #
- # Yeah #

1163
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,594
# Feelin' mad, shitty
Gotta burn down the city #

1164
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:52,159
# Takin' over for the brothers I'm
raisin' a ruckus up on you suckers #

1165
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,173
# Gotta burn it up Come
on, blow it up, yeah ##

1166
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,870
[Ferry] # Your eyes of blue #

1167
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,140
# Your kisses too #

1168
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:06,583
# I never knew what they could do #

1169
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,984
[Ferry, Skylar] # I can't believe #

1170
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:13,388
# That you're in love with me ##

1171
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:22,967
[Ferry] I love the country.
The air smells so fresh.

1172
01:10:25,537 --> 01:10:29,974
Um, Charles, where did you get
the money to pay for everything,

1173
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:32,101
and... and this car?

1174
01:10:32,177 --> 01:10:36,079
Uh, well, you know, loans.

1175
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:41,644
Oh, this is a great idea to
take a walk here. It's beautiful.

1176
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,813
Yeah, yeah. What time is it?

1177
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:45,823
Um, 4:00.

1178
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,825
Oh, good.

1179
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:52,660
I just thought you'd wanna walk
around a little, see the fall leaves.

1180
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:54,665

01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:24,598
and, and he can be difficult,

1330
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:29,636
and we've had our ups
and downs, certainly.

1331
01:19:29,714 --> 01:19:32,649
- Since when did you have all these...
- I don't know.

1332
01:19:32,717 --> 01:19:37,484
It's just, I've... I've
always had this fantasy, okay,

1333
01:19:37,556 --> 01:19:39,490
that, um...

1334
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:42,652
that one day I would
meet the perfect man...

1335
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:46,458
and he would fulfill my
dreams and I would have...

1336
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,965
the perfect life.

1337
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:52,162
That fantasy, I think,

1338
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:57,504
always sort of, um, was part of this
dissatisfaction that I had with Greg...

1339
01:19:57,576 --> 01:19:59,510
and, and my life.

1340
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:03,173
And then you came along
and you seemed to know...

1341
01:20:03,248 --> 01:20:06,513
every secret thing about me.

1342
01:20:08,487 --> 01:20:11,285
Let me put it this way.

1343
01:20:11,356 --> 01:20:14,291
I have seen my dream come true,

1344
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:17,886
and my fantasy no longer tortures me.

1345
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:20,397
I can deal with it.

1346
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,292
Yeah, but that's so neurotic.

1347
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:28,305
Well, I know. I'm crazy.

1348
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,476
Well, but supposing I said to you...

1349
01:20:32,544 --> 01:20:34,978
that none of this was really true;

1350
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:38,641
that this was all a facade
that I've been putting on;

1351
01:20:38,717 --> 01:20:42,949
that-that-that somehow
I had, you know, access...

1352
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:46,582
to your deepest feelings and your
needs and all your secret thoughts...

1353
01:20:46,658 --> 01:20:49,593
and, and I've been, I've
been playing this character...

1354
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:52,129
just to, just to win you over,

1355
01:20:52,197 --> 01:20:55,132
to get you to like me, make you happy.

1356
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,862
If that's what you told me,

1357
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,370
then I'd say you were crazy.

1358
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,671
So that's exactly why I'm
not going tonight. You know?

1359
01:21:05,744 --> 01:21:08,679
Instead, I-I have plans
to go to Napoleon's tomb.

1360
01:21:08,747 --> 01:21:13,013
- I'm gonna lie down next to him. That's
Christmas Eve for me. - That's so sad.

1361
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:16,019
- The women you pick.
- No, you're going out.

1362
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:18,021
- Aaaaah-choo! -
Somebody's gotta take Mom.

1363
01:21:18,089 --> 01:21:21,024
- He's so sick.
- You're too sick to go out this evening?

1364
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:24,528
- I'm fine, as long as I don't move
my eyeballs. - He has a 101 temperature.

1365
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:27,531
- You're not going anywhere tonight.
- But I'm not in a Groucho mood.

1366
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:29,533
- Aw, come on. You'll love it. Go.
- It's Christmas Eve.

1367
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:31,535
It's Paris. There's a ball.

1368
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:35,539
Besides, you're on the committee that
arranged the party for the Cinematheque.

1369
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:39,270
- You have to go. Enjoy yourself.
- I'll go for a couple hours.

1370
01:21:39,344 --> 01:21:42,279
I gotta stay here, but
there's no reason you don't go.

1371
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:44,315
It's later than you think.

1410
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:47,663
- ## [Orchestra] - Do you remember
our first Christmas Eve in Paris,

1411
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:50,299
the month before we got married?

1412
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,309
I do, because that was...

1413
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:55,813
that was when I knew that someday I
would absolutely have to live here.

1414
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,815
Mmm. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1415
01:24:00,218 --> 01:24:03,654
I don't wanna panic you.
That was decades ago.

1416
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:06,657
- I mean, decades, not, not...
- I know, I know. It was decades ago.

1417
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:09,592
Do you remember that
cafe we used to go to?

1418
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:13,097
Cafe Therese, or whatever,
with the cats? Do you remember?

1419
01:24:13,164 --> 01:24:15,928
- Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- Yeah.

1420
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,436
I hated that cat. I
mean, I-I-I hated...

1421
01:24:19,504 --> 01:24:22,940
Well, maybe that's why you were
scratching yourself all night.

1422
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:26,443
Was I scratching myself all night?
Is that what you noticed about me?

1423
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,445
I certainly... I certainly did.

1424
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:31,448
Well, I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it.

1425
01:24:31,516 --> 01:24:34,952
But now that cafe is right around
the corner from where I live.

1426
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:37,954
- You're joking. - Why would
I joke about something like that?

1427
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:41,287
- You wanna go have a drink there?
- No.

1428
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:43,452
- Why not?
- Because we're drinking here.

1429
01:24:43,528 --> 01:24:47,464
Well, yeah, but... We can take our
mustaches off. Nobody's gonna know.

1430
01:24:47,532 --> 01:24:50,626
- What, are you having a nostalgic,
a sudden... - Yeah, I'm having a thing.

1431
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:53,637
Sue me. I just thought
it would be kind of fun.

1432
01:24:53,705 --> 01:24:57,641
- No, we can't sneak out... - Come on,
we'll take our mustaches off. No problem.

1433
01:24:57,709 --> 01:25:00,143
- That I'd like to do.
- Wouldn't you? Me too.

1434
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:03,703
I never thought I'd hear you
say, "Take my mustache off."

1435
01:25:03,782 --> 01:25:05,716
Please. [Laughing]

1436
01:25:05,784 --> 01:25:08,651
Anyway, we'll go. I-I'm
a little... I feel good.

1437
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,655
I've had three glasses of
champagne. I feel fabulous.

1438
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:15,318
- Let's go see this place. - Yeah,
but y-you really wanna sneak out?

1439
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:18,829
I do. It's not... We snuck
out before. Do you remember?

1440
01:25:18,897 --> 01:25:22,594
Remember that party with the
Hamilton-Wainwrights? It was so boring.

1441
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,601
Oh, yes. Yes.

1442
01:25:24,669 --> 01:25:29,197
- I remember because we snuck out
through the toilet window. - Right!

1443
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:32,903
The guy was singing "Climb Every
Mountain," and we couldn't bear it.

1444
01:25:32,977 --> 01:25:35,912
You knocked over the punch
bowl, if I remember correctly.

1445
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,916
Yes, but you were the one who let out
the piercing shriek that got us caught.

1446
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:43,112
Oh, and do you remember how
we made love? You know...

1447
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:45,622
- Ooh. Oh, I dropped...
- You dropped your cigar.

1448
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:48,625
I know. Give me my cigar.
I dropped the cigar and...

1449
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,627
- You're so drunk.
- [Giggling]

1450
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,289
I remember us making love, I, uh...

1451
01:25:53,364 --> 01:25:56,390
- Candlelight. - I remember
the candles; I remember the hotel.

1452
01:25:56,467 --> 01:26:00,028
I just don't remember you, unless
you were the one who was under me.

1453
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:03,403
- Oh, now you're in character.
- I don't know where I am.

1454
01:26:03,474 --> 01:26:05,908
- I'm... I'm lost.
- Come on, let's go.

1455
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:08,844
No, it's cold out there.
Our coats are in the car.

1456
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,847
Forget it. It's a warm night.

1457
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,849
Come on. Pretend you're young.

1458
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,852
- Well, I could for you.
- [Giggling]

1459
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,023
You're better off without her.

1460
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:23,527
How do you know? You never met her.

1461
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,529
I know you.

1462
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,531
Yeah. So? What does that mean?

1463
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,534
A good psychiatrist
that listened to you...

1464
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,628
would think that every time I get
involved with a woman, you get jealous.

1465
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:35,639
- [Giggles]
- What are you laughing?

1466
01:26:35,707 --> 01:26:39,643
"Jealous." Joe, I just wish you'd pick
somebody that could make you happy.

1467
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:42,009
- Like who?
- I made you happy.

1468
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,015
- Yeah... I didn't say you didn't.
- I made you very happy.

1469
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,143
- Hey... - When we weren't,
you know, at each other's throats.

1470
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:51,746
- Does this ring a bell? This is
why I took you here. - [Gasps]

1471
01:26:51,823 --> 01:26:55,054
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Is this... Is this where we...

1472
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,061
This is it, yes. That's why
I dragged you all over town.

1473
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,427
Oh! Ohh! Oh, my God!

1474
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:03,433
- You remember this?
- This is where we stayed up all night.

1475
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,096
I know. I held you in my
arms 'til the light came up.

1476
01:27:07,171 --> 01:27:09,639
- Do you remember that? Do you
remember that song? - Yeah, I do.

1477
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:13,143
'Cause I still sing that song.
I first heard it from you.

1478
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:15,702
That was the first time. Remember?

1479
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,647
# I'm thru with love #

1480
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:21,685
# I'll never fall again #

1481
01:27:21,753 --> 01:27:24,813
# Said adieu to love #

1482
01:27:24,889 --> 01:27:27,983
# Don't ever call again #

1483
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:31,153
# For I must have you #

1484
01:27:31,229 --> 01:27:33,163
# Or no one #

1485
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:39,227
# And so I'm thru with love #

1486
01:27:40,538 --> 01:27:43,302
# I've locked my heart #

1487
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:46,502
# I'll keep my feelings there #

1488
01:27:46,577 --> 01:27:49,205
# I have stocked my heart #

1489
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,147
# With icy frigid air #

1490
01:27:52,216 --> 01:27:55,379
# And I mean to care #

1491
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:58,013
# For no one #

1492
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:03,918
# Because I'm thru with love #

1493
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:11,062
# Why did you lead me
to think you could care #

1494
01:28:11,135 --> 01:28:16,505
# You didn't need me
for you had your share #

1495
01:28:16,574 --> 01:28:21,443
# Of friends around you
to hound you and swear #

1496
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:24,845
# With deep emotion #

1497
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:29,080
# Devotion to you #

1498
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:32,088
# Good-bye to spring #

1499
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:35,148
# And all it meant to me #

1500
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:38,354
# It can never bring #

1501
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:41,762
# The things that used to be #

1502
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:45,360
# For I must have you #

1503
01:28:45,436 --> 01:28:48,530
# Or no one #

1504
01:28:50,141 --> 01:28:53,975
# And so I'm thru #

1505
01:28:54,045 --> 01:28:58,948
# With love ##

1506
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:54,164
You know, over the years I often
wondered what would have happened...

1507
01:30:54,232 --> 01:30:56,166
had we stayed together.

1508
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,665
That's something we're never gonna know.

1509
01:31:01,839 --> 01:31:03,773
We've managed to produce...

1510
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:05,775
a fabulous daughter, though.

1511
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:08,277
- I mean, she is
unbelievable. - Mm-hmm.

1512
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:11,042
She's got your looks, fortunately,

1513
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:14,551
and my... my magic personality.

1514
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:17,053
- Yeah, she is wonderful.
- She's great.

1515
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:20,613
And-And you've been very happy with
Bob, so that's been a good thing.

1516
01:31:20,691 --> 01:31:23,125
- Oh, he's wonderful.
- I think he's great.

1517
01:31:23,194 --> 01:31:26,630
I don't think you could've done
better. I think he's a fabulous guy.

1518
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:29,632
Of course there have been
a few times, you will admit,

1519
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,635
that, uh, you did call
me in dire emergency...

1520
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:35,638
and I had to come by and bail you out.

1521
01:31:35,706 --> 01:31:38,641
- I know you did.
- Two major fights with Bob, I remember,

1522
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:42,645
and one disgusting lump that
turned out to be completely benign,

1523
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:45,147
though you were panicked beyond belief.

1524
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:48,652
- You were there for me.
That's the main thing. - And you for me.

1525
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,653
And I appreciate it.

1526
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,656
I think, actually, that
we-we've been better friends...

1527
01:31:53,724 --> 01:31:55,658
than, than, than husband and wife.

1528
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:57,990
Yeah, probably we have.

1529
01:31:58,062 --> 01:32:01,088
But, you know, nobody made
me laugh the way you did, Joe.

1530
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:04,100
I love Bob with all my
heart. It isn't that.

1531
01:32:04,168 --> 01:32:08,537
It's just that you could always,
you know, you could push that button.

1532
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,598
- Why is that so important?
- I don't know.

1533
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:14,440
I don't know. Maybe we're crazy.

1534
01:32:14,512 --> 01:32:16,446
[Giggling]

1535
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:19,449
[Sighs]

1536
01:32:19,517 --> 01:32:23,112
So, did that girl that dumped
you today, did she make you laugh?

1537
01:32:23,187 --> 01:32:28,124
I don't know, I... I
have to put that behind.

1538
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,294
You know.

1539
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,400
- Funny how life goes.
- It's amazing. Amazing.

1540
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:06,254
Let's go. It's late.

1541
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:08,696
It's definitely late.

1542
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:10,700
Christmas Eve and late.

1543
01:33:10,768 --> 01:33:12,702
Let's go.

1544
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:16,972
# Everyone says I love you #

1545
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:20,499
# The cop on the corner
and the burglar too #

1546
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:22,773
- ## [Continues]
- [D.J. Narrating] Christmas Eve in Paris.

1547
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,781
What a year.

1548
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,114
And that sort of brings
us to the end of our story.

1549
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:31,120
I told Skylar someone should
write it up as a movie.

1550
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:35,591
She said, " Better make it into a
musical, or no one's gonna believe it."

1551
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:39,994
By the way, that night
I met a terrific guy.

1552
01:33:40,064 --> 01:33:42,794
I mean, talk about sexy.

1553
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,030
# There are only eight little letters #

1554
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:50,130
# In the phrase you'll find #

1555
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,801
# But they mean a lot more #

1556
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:57,541
# Than all the other words combined #

1557
01:33:57,615 --> 01:34:01,051
# Everywhere the whole world through #

1558
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:04,747
# The king in the palace
and the peasant too #

1559
01:34:04,822 --> 01:34:08,087
# The tiger in the jungle
and the monk' in the zoo #

1560
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,457
# Says I love you #

1561
01:34:19,503 --> 01:34:22,734
# The preacher in the pulpit
and the man in the pew #

1562
01:34:22,807 --> 01:34:25,037
# Says I love you #

1563
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:37,451
# The captain and the sailor
and the rest of the crew #

1564
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:39,853
# Says I love you #

1565
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,835
# Everywhere the whole world through #

1566
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:03,437
# The king in the palace
and the peasant too #

1567
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:07,348
# The tiger in the jungle
and the monk' in the zoo #

1568
01:35:07,418 --> 01:35:09,852
# Says I love you #
