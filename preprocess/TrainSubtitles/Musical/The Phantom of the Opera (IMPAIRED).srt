1
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,370
Sold. Your number, sir? Thank you.

2
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,747
Lot 663, then, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:04,334
A poster from this house's production
of Hannibal by Chalumeau.

4
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:07,754
- Showing here.
- Do I have 10 francs?

5
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:10,882
Five, then. Five I am bid. Six.

6
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,802
Seven. Against you, sir, seven.

7
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,303
Eight?

8
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:20,558
Eight once. Selling twice.
Sold, to Monsieur Deferre.

9
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,644
Thank you very much, sir.

10
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:27,023
Lot 664, a wooden pistol
and three human skulls ...

11
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:30,819
from the 1831 production
of "Robert le Diable" by Meyerbeer.

12
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:34,739
Ten francs for this.
Ten, thank you. Ten still.

13
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:37,826
Fifteen, thank you. Fifteen I'm bid.

14
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,245
Going at 15.

15
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,581
Your number, sir?

16
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:46,459
Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen ...

17
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:50,797
a papier-mâché musical box
in the shape of a barrel organ.

18
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:56,845
Attached, the figure of a monkey
in Persian robes playing the cymbals.

19
00:02:57,012 --> 00:03:01,391
This item discovered in the vaults
of the theater, still in working order.

20
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,685
Showing here.

21
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,654
May I commence at 15 francs?

22
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:16,406
Fifteen, thank you.

23
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,117
Yes, 20 from you, sir.
Thank you very much.

24
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:25,039
Madame Giry, 25. Thank you, Madame.
Twenty-five I'm bid. Do I hear 30?

25
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,877
Thirty. And 35?

26
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:37,135
Selling at 30 francs, then.
Thirty once, 30 twice ...

27
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:41,639
Sold for 30 francs
to the Vicomte de Chagny.

28
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:42,807
Thank you, sir.

29
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,733
A collector's piece indeed

30
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,819
Every detail

31
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,864
Exactly as she said

32
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:05,872
Will you still play
When all the rest of us are dead?

33
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,876
Lot 666, then.

34
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:13,046
A chandelier in pieces.

35
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:19,677
Some of you may recall the strange affair
of the Phantom of the Opera.

36
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:23,097
A mystery never fully explained.

37
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:28,269
We're told, ladies and gentlemen,
that this is the very chandelier ...

38
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:31,940
which figures in the famous disaster.

39
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:37,695
Our workshops have repaired it and wired
parts of it for the new electric light.

40
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:43,618
Perhaps we can frighten away
the ghost of so many years ago ...

41
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:46,371
with a little illumination.

42
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,541
Gentlemen?

43
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:45,550
The trophy
From our saviors

44
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:53,307
From our saviors

45
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:58,479
From the enslaving force

46
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:02,316
Of Rome!

47
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,111
Madame.

48
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,488
With feasting and dancing and song

49
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:13,327
Tonight in celebration
We greet the victorious throng

50
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:16,581
Returned to bring salvation!

51
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,421
I've got them, monsieur.

52
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:27,425
Vicomte, welcome.

53
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:31,137
The trumpets of Carthage resound

54
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:34,557
Hear, Romans, now and tremble

55
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:37,018
Hark to our step on the ground

56
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:40,772
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!

57
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,691
You make my dress train too long.

58
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:52,992
Sad to return
To find the land we love

59
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,413
Threatened once more
By Roma's far-reaching grasp

60
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,290
Gentlemen, gentlemen --

61
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,252
Rehearsals are under way for a new
production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.

62
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,049
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ...

63
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:11,677
ladies and gentlemen, please,
if I could have your attention?

64
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:15,389
As you know, there have been rumors
of my imminent retirement.

65
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:20,728
I can now tell you that these were all true,
and it is my pleasure to introduce you ...

66
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:24,023
to the two gentlemen who now own
the Opera Populaire ...

67
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:28,111
Monsieur Richard Firmin
and Monsieur Gilles Andre.

68
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:32,782
I'm sure you have read of their recent
fortune in the junk business.

69
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,743
Scrap metal, actually.

70
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,121
They must be rich.

71
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:43,084
And we are deeply honored
to introduce our new patron.

72
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:46,045
The Vicomte de Chagny.

73
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:50,508
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.

74
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,468
It's Raoul.

75
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,058
Before my father died,
at the house by the sea ...

76
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:03,354
I guess you could say we were
childhood sweethearts.

77
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:06,899
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.

78
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,778
My parents and I are honored
to support all the arts ...

79
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:14,240
especially the world-renowned
Opera Populaire.

80
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:20,454
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli,
our leading soprano for five seasons.

81
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,331
- Brava! Brava!
- Brava! Brava!

82
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,376
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.

83
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:33,342
An honor, signor. I believe
I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.

84
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,430
I will be here this evening to share
your great triumph. My apologies.

85
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,098
Thank you, monsieur.

86
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:43,477
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me. He love me.

87
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:48,065
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful
words. So inspiring and encouraging ...

88
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,319
He wouldn't recognize me.

89
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,155
- He didn't see you.
- If you please. Monsieur.

90
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:01,370
We take particular pride
in the excellence of our ballet.

91
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,039
I see why.

92
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,666
Especially that little blond angel.

93
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,419
My daughter, Meg Giry.

94
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:13,257
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?

95
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,303
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.

96
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,223
Very promising.

97
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,891
Daae, did you say?

98
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:25,353
No relation to the famous
Swedish violinist?

99
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,188
His only child.

100
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:31,359
Orphaned at 7 when she came
to live and train in the ballet dormitories.

101
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,778
An orphan, you say?

102
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,780
I think of her as a daughter also.

103
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:39,951
Gentlemen, if you would kindly
stand to one side.

104
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,496
Hannibal's friends!

105
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:46,791
Ah, me! Not on my dress! Why?

106
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,095
The trumpeting elephants sound

107
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:02,723
Hear, Romans, now and tremble

108
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,643
Hark to their step on the ground

109
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,729
Hear the drums!

110
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:17,863
Hannibal comes!

111
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,163
All day!

112
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,958
All they want is the dancing!

113
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:32,378
Well, the Vicomte is very excited
about tonight's gala.

114
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:41,762
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls
as your new managers ...

115
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,016
because I will not be singing!

116
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,355
Get my doggy, bring my doggy. 
Bye-bye.

117
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:53,566
- What do we do?
- Grovel.

118
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,318
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.

119
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:59,864
- I'm going now. It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.

120
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,576
Bella diva.

121
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:05,286
Goddess of song.

122
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,498
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there
a rather marvelous aria for Elissa ...

123
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,626
in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora --

124
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:18,883
Because I have not my costume for
Act 3. Because somebody not finish it!

125
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:21,469
And I hate my hat!

126
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:26,098
Signora, as a personal favor, would you
oblige us with a private rendition?

127
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,894
Unless, of course,
Monsieur Reyer objects.

128
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:40,571
If my managers command.

129
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:46,285
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.

130
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,287
Yes, I do.

131
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,164
Everybody, very quiet.

132
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:53,042
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.

133
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,711
- I see.
- You as well!

134
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,133
Signora.

135
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,260
Maestro.

136
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:13,604
Think of me
Think of me fondly

137
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:21,028
When we've said goodbye

138
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:26,575
Remember me once in a while

139
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:34,417
Please promise me you'll try

140
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,299
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart back

141
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,218
And be free --

142
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:53,144
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.

143
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:56,730
- Lift it up!
- He's here. The Phantom of the Opera.

144
00:14:56,898 --> 00:15:00,943
Signora, are you all right? Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?

145
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:06,490
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.

146
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,201
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.

147
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:14,248
Or if there is, well, then,
it must be a ghost.

148
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:22,756
Signora, these things do happen.

149
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:26,093
For the past three years
these things do happen.

150
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:29,054
And did you stop them
from happening? No!

151
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,724
And you two, you are as bad as him.

152
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,518
"These things do happen."

153
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:40,232
Until you stop these things from happening,
this thing does not happen!

154
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:45,905
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.

155
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,909
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.

156
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:55,414
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.

157
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:02,046
Signora Giudicelli, she will be
coming back, won't she?

158
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,298
You think so, monsieur?

159
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:09,970
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!

160
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:13,474
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?

161
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,895
And commands that you continue
to leave box five empty ...

162
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:21,607
for his use. And reminds you
that his salary is due.

163
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,234
His salary?

164
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:27,071
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him
20,000 francs a month.

165
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,241
Twenty thousand francs?

166
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:34,203
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?

167
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:38,040
Madame, I had hoped to make
that announcement public tonight ...

168
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,709
when the vicomte was to join us
for the gala.

169
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:46,090
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel,
as it appears we have lost our star!

170
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:53,097
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!

171
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:57,476
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!

172
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:00,271
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.

173
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,148
What, a chorus girl? Don't be silly.

174
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:06,527
She has been taking lessons
from a great teacher.

175
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:11,073
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.

176
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,368
Let her sing for you, monsieur.

177
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,745
She has been well taught.

178
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,373
All right.

179
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,543
Come on, don't be shy.

180
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:25,462
Come on, come along. Just ...

181
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,758
From the beginning of the aria then,
please, mademoiselle.

182
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,638
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.

183
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:39,226
Think of me
Think of me fondly

184
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:43,606
When we've said goodbye

185
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:48,235
Remember me once in a while

186
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:53,115
Please promise me you'll try

187
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:56,910
When you find
That once again you long

188
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:01,498
To take your heart back
And be free

189
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:06,920
If you ever find a moment

190
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:13,677
Spare a thought for me

191
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:34,406
We never said our love was evergreen

192
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:38,285
Or as unchanging as the sea

193
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,375
But if you can still remember

194
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:49,880
Stop and think of me

195
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:58,472
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen

196
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
Don't think about the way

197
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:08,023
Things might have been

198
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:13,320
Think of me, think of me waking

199
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:17,449
Silent and resigned

200
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:22,371
Imagine me, trying too hard

201
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,458
To put you from my mind

202
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:30,546
Recall those days
Look back on all those times

203
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:35,175
Think of the things we'll never do

204
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:39,680
There will never be a day

205
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:48,313
When I won't think of you

206
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:55,446
Can it be?

207
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,365
Can it be Christine?

208
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,160
Bravo!

209
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:06,540
Long ago
It seems so long ago

210
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,627
How young and innocent we were

211
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:15,090
She may not remember me

212
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:21,054
But I remember her

213
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:24,349
Flowers fade
The fruits of summer fade

214
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:29,062
They have their seasons
So do we

215
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,568
But please promise me
That sometimes

216
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:40,407
You will think

217
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:06,558
Of me

218
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:37,589
Brava!

219
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:48,994
Brava, brava, bravissima

220
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:53,582
Christine, Christine

221
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,877
Christine

222
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:02,925
Where in the world
Have you been hiding?

223
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:07,554
Really, you were perfect

224
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,061
I only wish
I knew your secret

225
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:19,316
Who is your great tutor?

226
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:21,693
Meg ...

227
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:25,489
when your mother
brought me here to live ...

228
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,618
whenever I'd come down here alone ...

229
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:32,955
to light a candle for my father ...

230
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:37,292
a voice, from above ...

231
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:42,714
and in my dreams,
he was always there.

232
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,677
You see ...

233
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,138
when my father lay dying ...

234
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:54,351
he told me I would be protected
by an angel.

235
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,730
An angel of music.

236
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:03,527
Christine, do you believe?

237
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,863
Do you think the spirit of your
father's coaching you?

238
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:10,367
Who else, Meg? Who?

239
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:18,792
Father once spoke of an angel

240
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,423
I used to dream he'd appear

241
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:29,302
Now as I sing
I can sense him

242
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,392
And I know he's here

243
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:40,772
Here in this room
He calls me softly

244
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,652
Somewhere inside hiding

245
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,574
Somehow I know
He's always with me

246
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:55,454
He, the unseen genius

247
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:59,791
Christine, you must have been dreaming

248
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:04,713
Stories like this Can't Come true

249
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,176
Christine, you're talking in riddles

250
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:14,723
And it's not like you

251
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,021
Angel of Music
Guide and guardian

252
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:26,860
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?

253
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:32,783
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer

254
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,747
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel

255
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:41,833
He's with me even now

256
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:44,878
- Your hands are cold
- All around me

257
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:47,756
Your face, Christine, it's white

258
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:53,595
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened

259
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:06,775
No.

260
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:12,781
You did very well, my dear.

261
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,953
He is pleased with you.

262
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,382
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.

263
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,843
We've made quite a discovery
with Miss Daae.

264
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,679
Perhaps we could present her
to you, dear vicomte?

265
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:40,684
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit
I should prefer to make unaccompanied.

266
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,978
Thank you.

267
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,898
It would appear they've met before.

268
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:54,322
Little Lotte let her mind wander.

269
00:26:55,783 --> 00:27:00,787
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder
of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"

270
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:04,624
- Raoul.
- "Or of riddles or frocks?"

271
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:08,712
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "Or of chocolates?"

272
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:13,508
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other ...

273
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:16,261
dark stories of the North.
- No.

274
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:21,349
"What I love best," Lotte said,
"is when I'm asleep in my bed."

275
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:26,897
And the Angel of Music
Sings songs in my head

276
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:34,321
The Angel of Music
Sings songs in my head

277
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,367
You sang like an angel tonight.

278
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,747
Father said:

279
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:48,835
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will
send the Angel of Music to you."

280
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,714
Well, father is dead, Raoul.

281
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:55,425
And I have been visited
by the Angel of Music.

282
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,510
No doubt of it.

283
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,138
And now we go to supper.

284
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:02,057
No, Raoul.

285
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:05,936
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.

286
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,812
Raoul, no.

287
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,650
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.

288
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,902
No. Raoul, wait!

289
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:11,167
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion

290
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:15,755
Basking in your glory

291
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:20,885
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor

292
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:25,932
Sharing in my triumph

293
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,396
Angel, I hear you
Speak, I listen

294
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:36,860
Stay by my side
Guide me

295
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:41,823
Angel, my soul was weak
Forgive me

296
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:46,786
Enter at last, master

297
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:51,833
Flattering child, you shall know me

298
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:56,963
See why in shadow I hide

299
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:01,760
Look at your face in the mirror

300
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:08,183
I am there inside!

301
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:13,688
Angel of Music, guide and guardian

302
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:19,986
Grant to me your glory

303
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:25,658
Angel of Music, hide no longer

304
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:31,873
Come to me, strange angel

305
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:37,670
I am your Angel of Music

306
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:42,717
Come to me, Angel of Music

307
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:46,513
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?

308
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,893
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine. Christine!

309
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:56,940
Come to me, Angel of Music

310
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:26,553
In sleep he sang to me

311
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,640
In dreams he came

312
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:34,561
That voice which calls to me

313
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:38,565
And speaks my name

314
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:42,610
And do I dream again?

315
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,574
For now I find

316
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:54,622
The Phantom of the Opera is there

317
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,419
Inside my mind

318
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:10,638
Sing once again with me

319
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,350
Our strange duet

320
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,605
My power over you

321
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,609
Grows stronger yet

322
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:26,404
And though you turn from me

323
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:31,409
To glance behind

324
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:38,708
The Phantom of the Opera is there

325
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:42,921
Inside your mind

326
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,682
Those who have seen your face

327
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,645
Draw back in fear

328
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:02,732
I am the mask you wear

329
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,486
It's me they hear

330
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:10,657
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice

331
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:15,662
- In one combined
- In one combined

332
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:22,710
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there

333
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:28,132
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind

334
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:39,852
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

335
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:50,029
Sing, my Angel of Music.

336
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,038
Sing, my angel.

337
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,544
Sing for me!

338
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:18,349
Sing, my angel.

339
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:24,439
Sing for me!

340
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:39,329
I have brought you

341
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:44,167
To the seat of sweet music's throne

342
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:50,965
To this kingdom where all must
Pay homage to music

343
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:59,057
Music, you have come here

344
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:03,853
For one purpose, and one alone

345
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:08,524
Since the moment
I first heard you sing

346
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:13,780
I have needed you with me
To serve me, to sing

347
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:17,367
For my music

348
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:23,373
My music

349
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:35,134
Night-time sharpens

350
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:39,847
Heightens each sensation

351
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:44,852
Darkness stirs

352
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,316
And wakes imagination

353
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:55,321
Silently the senses

354
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:00,660
Abandon their defenses

355
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:17,593
Slowly, gently

356
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,931
Night unfurls its splendor

357
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:26,436
Grasp it, sense it

358
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:31,023
Tremulous and tender

359
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,527
Turn your face away

360
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:38,906
From the garish light of day

361
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,909
Turn your thoughts away

362
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:46,706
From cold, unfeeling light

363
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:54,797
And listen to
The music of the night

364
00:36:55,382 --> 00:37:02,096
Close your eyes and surrender
To your darkest dreams

365
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:08,895
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before

366
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,607
Close your eyes

367
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:17,779
Let your spirit start

368
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:26,913
To soar

369
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:36,756
And you'll live
As you've never lived before

370
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:45,431
Softly, deftly

371
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,685
Music shall caress you

372
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,940
Hear it, feel it

373
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:58,277
Secretly possess you

374
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,280
Open up your mind

375
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:05,576
Let your fantasies unwind

376
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:09,664
In this darkness that you know

377
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,875
You cannot fight

378
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:21,551
The darkness of
The music of the night

379
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:27,974
Let your mind start a journey
Through a strange new world

380
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:34,522
Leave all thoughts of the life
You knew before

381
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:38,109
Let your soul take you

382
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:46,075
Where you long to be

383
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:56,002
Only then can you belong

384
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,547
To me

385
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:07,054
Floating, falling

386
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:11,976
Sweet intoxication

387
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:17,732
Touch me, trust me

388
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,695
Savor each sensation

389
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:26,198
Let the dream begin

390
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:30,870
Let your darker side give in

391
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:38,753
To the power of the music that I write

392
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:48,012
The power of
The music of the night

393
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:23,047
You alone can make my song take flight

394
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,094
Help me make

395
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:33,349
The music of the

396
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:45,319
Night

397
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,192
Christine?

398
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,415
Like yellow parchment is his skin

399
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:09,547
A great black hole serves
As the nose that never grew

400
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:16,470
You must be always on your guard

401
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:21,433
Or he will catch you
with his magical lasso

402
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,727
Oh, my.

403
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,902
Those who speak of what they know

404
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:37,950
Find too late that prudent silence is wise

405
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:42,496
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue

406
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:47,376
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.

407
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:20,409
I remember there was mist

408
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:28,000
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake

409
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:31,921
There were Candles all around

410
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:36,967
And on the lake there was a boat

411
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:46,769
And in the boat there was a man

412
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:10,251
Who was that shape in the shadows?

413
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:15,714
Whose is the face in the mask?

414
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:27,559
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora

415
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:31,397
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?

416
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:35,943
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah

417
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:39,571
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free

418
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:42,157
Damn you!

419
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,577
Curse you!

420
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:53,085
Stranger than you dreamt it

421
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:57,756
Can you even dare to look

422
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:01,719
Or bear to think of me?

423
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:07,933
This loathsome gargoyle
Who burns in hell

424
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:13,147
But secretly yearns for heaven

425
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:16,900
Secretly, secretly

426
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,070
Christine

427
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:26,368
Fear can turn to love

428
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:31,373
You'll learn to see
To find the man

429
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:35,544
Behind the monster, this

430
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:41,300
Repulsive carcass
Who seems a beast

431
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:46,513
But secretly dreams of beauty

432
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:50,976
Secretly, secretly

433
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:55,230
Oh, Christine

434
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,849
Come, we must return.

435
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:33,769
Those two fools who run
my theater will be missing you.

436
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:38,917
"Mystery after gala night"

437
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,920
It says
"Mystery of soprano's flight"

438
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:44,256
"Mystified"
All the papers say

439
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:47,217
"We are mystified
We suspect foul play"

440
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:51,972
Bad news on soprano scene
First Carlotta, now Christine

441
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,434
Still at least the seats get sold

442
00:48:55,602 --> 00:49:01,690
Gossip's worth its weight in gold

443
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:05,319
What a way to run a business

444
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:08,447
Spare me these unending trials

445
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:11,909
Half your cast disappears
But the crowd still cheers

446
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,118
Opera!

447
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,162
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal

448
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,790
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?

449
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,376
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout

450
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:25,506
It's publicity, and the take is vast
Free publicity

451
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:27,424
But we have no cast

452
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:30,344
Andre, have you seen the queue?

453
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:35,557
It seems you've got one too

454
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:42,731
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala
Christine was, in a word, sublime

455
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:46,443
We were hardly bereft
When Carlotta left

456
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:48,570
On that note, the diva's a disaster

457
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,490
Must you cast her
When she's seasons past her prime?"

458
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:54,117
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder

459
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:56,954
My salary has not been paid

460
00:49:57,121 --> 00:50:01,667
Send it Care of the Ghost
By return of post PTO

461
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:05,504
No one likes a debtor
So it's better if my orders are obeyed"

462
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:09,299
Who would have the gall to send this?

463
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:13,470
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.

464
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,223
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost

465
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,476
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position

466
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:22,354
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition

467
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:25,315
To expect a large retainer
He is clearly quite insane

468
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,067
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?

469
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:28,902
l mean, Miss Daae
Where is she?

470
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,862
- How do we know?
- I want an answer

471
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,365
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?

472
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:35,242
- Of Course not
- Don't look at us

473
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,327
- She's not with you?
- Of Course not

474
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:40,872
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?

475
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,709
And what is it that
We're meant to have wrote?

476
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,794
Written.

477
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:49,590
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.

478
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:53,760
The Angel of Music
has her under his wing.

479
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:57,180
Make no attempt to see her again."

480
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:59,933
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?

481
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:02,644
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?

482
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:04,438
- What is it?
- I have your letter

483
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,940
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?

484
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:09,151
- Of Course not
- As if he would

485
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:11,445
- You didn't send it?
- Of Course not

486
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,781
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?

487
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:17,242
And what is it
That I'm meant to have sent?

488
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,915
"Your days at the Opera Populaire
are numbered.

489
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:27,544
Christine Daae will be singing
on your behalf tonight.

490
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:30,130
Be prepared for a great misfortune ...

491
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:33,508
should you attempt to take her place."

492
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,057
Far too many notes for my taste

493
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:42,809
And most of them about Christine

494
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:47,773
AII we've heard since we came
Is Miss Daae's name

495
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,734
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear

496
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:53,820
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?

497
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:56,323
I thought it best she was alone

498
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,283
She needed rest

499
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:01,370
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one

500
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:03,455
Will she sing? Will she sing?

501
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:06,541
- Here, l have a note
- Let me see it

502
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:08,293
Please.

503
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:16,718
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several
notes of the most amiable nature ...

504
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:20,472
detailing how my theater is to be run.

505
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:24,476
You have not followed my instructions.

506
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:28,313
I shall give you one last chance.

507
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:33,151
Christine Daae has returned to you

508
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:40,575
And I am anxious
Her career should progress

509
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:45,497
In the new production of Il Muto

510
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:49,167
You will therefore Cast Carlotta

511
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:51,712
As the pageboy

512
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:58,927
And put Miss Daae
In the role of countess

513
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:04,141
The role which Miss Daae plays

514
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:07,644
Calls for charm and appeal

515
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:11,648
The role of the pageboy is silent

516
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:17,446
Which makes my casting
In a word, ideal

517
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:23,994
I shall watch the performance
from my normal seat in box five ...

518
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,788
which will be kept empty for me.

519
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:29,124
Should these commands be ignored ...

520
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:33,754
a disaster beyond
your imagination will occur.

521
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:39,760
I remain, gentlemen,
your obedient servant. O.G."

522
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,553
- Christine
- Whatever next?

523
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:44,473
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane

524
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,892
I know who sent this
The vicomte, her lover

525
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:50,061
- Indeed! Can you believe this?
- Signora

526
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:53,565
- Signora
- You are our star

527
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,525
- And always will be
- Signora

528
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:57,569
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders

529
00:53:57,737 --> 00:54:02,657
Miss Daae will be playing
the pageboy, the silent role.

530
00:54:02,825 --> 00:54:05,243
Carlotta will be playing the lead

531
00:54:05,411 --> 00:54:10,499
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her

532
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,044
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her

533
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,808
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me

534
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:31,853
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me

535
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:35,065
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me

536
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:36,858
Please, signora, we beseech you

537
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:39,903
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears

538
00:54:40,071 --> 00:54:43,406
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?

539
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:47,828
Signora, sing for us
Don't be a martyr

540
00:54:47,995 --> 00:54:54,417
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!

541
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:03,051
Would you please give this
to Miss Daae? Miss Daae?

542
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:08,849
Your public needs you.

543
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,643
We need you too.

544
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:15,814
Would you not rather have
Your precious little ingénue?

545
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:18,733
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.

546
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:23,780
The world wants you

547
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:32,289
Prima donna
First lady of the stage

548
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:35,750
Your devotees
Are on their knees

549
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:39,504
To implore you

550
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:46,845
Can you bow out when
They're shouting your name?

551
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:53,977
Think of how they all adore you

552
00:55:54,353 --> 00:56:01,026
Prima donna
Enchant us once again

553
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:08,241
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater

554
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:14,789
Can you deny us
The triumph in store?

555
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:19,669
Sing, prima donna
Once more

556
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:27,010
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna

557
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:30,263
Your song shall live again

558
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,390
- Think of your public
- You took a snub

559
00:56:32,558 --> 00:56:35,977
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice

560
00:56:36,145 --> 00:56:38,688
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice

561
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:45,070
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support

562
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:48,865
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight

563
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:53,787
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial

564
00:56:53,996 --> 00:56:59,751
Prima donna
Your song shall never die

565
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:04,005
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings

566
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:07,342
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences

567
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:13,139
Think how you'll shine
In that final encore

568
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:17,185
Surely there'll be further scenes
Worse than this

569
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:22,023
I must see these demands are rejected

570
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:25,694
Who'd believe a diva happy
To relieve a chorus girl

571
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:27,821
Who's gone and slept with the patron?

572
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:31,408
Raoul and the soubrette
Entwined in love's duet

573
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:34,953
Although he may demur
He must have been with her

574
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:38,498
You'd never get away
With all this in a play

575
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:41,918
But if it's loudly sung
And in a foreign tongue

576
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:45,255
It's just the sort of story
Audiences adore

577
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:49,300
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera

578
00:57:49,468 --> 00:57:55,473
Prima donna, the world is at your feet

579
00:57:55,641 --> 00:58:02,105
A nation waits
And how it hates to be cheated

580
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:06,151
Light up the stage

581
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,156
With that age-old rapport

582
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:17,370
Sing, prima donna

583
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:29,049
Once more

584
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:47,025
Go on, go, go.

585
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:03,792
They say that this youth
Has set my lady's heart aflame

586
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:06,211
His Lordship, sure
Would die of shock

587
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:08,379
His Lordship is a laughingstock

588
00:59:08,547 --> 00:59:13,093
Should he suspect her, God protect her
Shame, shame, shame

589
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:19,891
This faithless lady's
Bound for Hades

590
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,685
Shame, shame, shame

591
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:32,028
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect

592
00:59:32,363 --> 00:59:35,281
Why, who can this be?

593
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:39,494
Gentle wife
Admit your loving husband

594
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:44,874
That's exactly the sort of thing
the public loves.

595
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:51,881
My love, I'm called to England
On affairs of state

596
00:59:52,049 --> 00:59:56,261
And must leave you
With your new maid

597
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:03,518
Though I would happily
take the maid with me.

598
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:06,771
The old fool is leaving.

599
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:12,277
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.

600
01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:15,238
Nothing like that ever happened
in the junk business.

601
01:00:15,406 --> 01:00:16,614
Scrap metal.

602
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:34,841
Serafimo, away with this pretense

603
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:40,388
You cannot speak
But kiss me in my husband's absence

604
01:00:45,102 --> 01:00:47,896
Poor fool, he makes me laugh

605
01:00:53,986 --> 01:00:58,448
Time I tried to get a better
Better half

606
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:01,409
Poor fool, he doesn't know

607
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:11,961
If he knew the truth
He'd never ever go

608
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:17,967
Did I not instruct that box five
was to be kept empty?

609
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:29,395
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.

610
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:33,691
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.

611
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:37,278
A toad, Madame?

612
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:40,281
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.

613
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:49,415
Why you spray on my chin
all the time, huh?

614
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:04,472
Serafimo, away with this pretense

615
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,394
You cannot speak
But kiss me in my --

616
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,941
Gentlemen, please, please.

617
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:24,701
Poor fool, he makes me laugh

618
01:02:28,622 --> 01:02:30,123
She's lost her voice.

619
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:34,502
Mother!

620
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:42,844
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?

621
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:46,556
Get off.

622
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:50,435
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.

623
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:57,275
The performance will continue
in 10 minutes' time ...

624
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:03,489
when the role of the countess
will be played by Miss Daae.

625
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,117
Thank you.

626
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:08,536
Go, go, hurry up. Hurry up.

627
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:13,791
Until then, we would crave your
indulgence for a few moments.

628
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:19,297
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you
the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.

629
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,674
- What?
- Maestro ...

630
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:24,010
the ballet, bring it forward, please.

631
01:03:24,178 --> 01:03:27,305
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.

632
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:31,976
Thank you.

633
01:03:36,982 --> 01:03:39,150
You're fired.

634
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:39,061
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.

635
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,984
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats.

636
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:48,821
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.

637
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:50,031
An accident.

638
01:05:51,492 --> 01:05:53,701
Why have you brought me here?

639
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:56,078
- We can't go back there
- We must return

640
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:59,123
He'll kill you
His eyes will find us there

641
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:01,792
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn

642
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,922
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men

643
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:09,800
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill

644
01:06:09,968 --> 01:06:13,513
Believe me
There is no Phantom of the Opera

645
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,643
My God, who is this man
Who hunts to kill?

646
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:22,104
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him

647
01:06:22,272 --> 01:06:25,107
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will

648
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:30,446
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth

649
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:32,823
Where night is blind

650
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:38,829
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there

651
01:06:38,997 --> 01:06:40,790
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind

652
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:45,294
There is no Phantom of the Opera

653
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:49,257
Raoul, I've been there

654
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:52,510
To his world of unending night

655
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:57,848
To a world where the daylight
Dissolves into darkness

656
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,477
Darkness

657
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:06,566
Raoul, I've seen him

658
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:10,278
Can I ever forget that sight?

659
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:14,073
Can I ever escape from that face?

660
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:20,329
So distorted, deformed
It was hardly a face

661
01:07:20,497 --> 01:07:24,375
In that darkness

662
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,879
Darkness

663
01:07:31,758 --> 01:07:40,141
But his voice filled my spirit
With a strange, sweet sound

664
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:47,523
In that night
There was music in my mind

665
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:53,821
And through music
My soul began

666
01:07:54,281 --> 01:08:01,704
To soar

667
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,541
And I heard

668
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:11,339
- As I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream

669
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:16,344
And nothing more

670
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:21,265
Yet in his eyes

671
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:27,938
All the sadness of the world

672
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:33,444
Those pleading eyes

673
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:37,114
That both threaten

674
01:08:37,282 --> 01:08:44,705
And adore

675
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,296
Christine

676
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:55,966
Christine ...

677
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:41,303
No more talk of darkness

678
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:45,433
Forget these wide-eyed fears

679
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,854
I'm here
Nothing can harm you

680
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:54,358
My words will warm and calm you

681
01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:58,738
Let me be your freedom

682
01:09:59,072 --> 01:10:02,825
Let daylight dry your tears

683
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:07,204
I'm here with you, beside you

684
01:10:07,372 --> 01:10:12,168
To guard you and to guide you

685
01:10:12,836 --> 01:10:16,338
Say you love me

686
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:22,553
Every waking moment

687
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:25,598
Turn my head

688
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:32,104
With talk of summertime

689
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:37,568
Say you need me with you

690
01:10:37,736 --> 01:10:42,156
Now and always

691
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:44,575
Promise me

692
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:50,956
That all you say is true

693
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:59,924
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter

694
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,803
Let me be your light

695
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:07,848
You're safe
No one will find you

696
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:12,520
Your fears are far behind you

697
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:16,106
All I want is freedom

698
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:19,860
A world with no more night

699
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,531
And you always beside me

700
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:27,284
To hold me and to hide me

701
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:31,330
Then say you'll share with me

702
01:11:31,498 --> 01:11:36,043
One love, one lifetime

703
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:39,171
Let me lead you

704
01:11:39,339 --> 01:11:44,134
From your solitude

705
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:49,515
Say you need me
With you

706
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:53,769
Here beside you

707
01:11:54,437 --> 01:12:01,694
Anywhere you go
Let me go too

708
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:03,696
Christine

709
01:12:03,864 --> 01:12:06,991
That's all I ask of you

710
01:12:07,158 --> 01:12:10,703
Say you'll share with me

711
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:15,749
One love, one lifetime

712
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:24,675
Say the word
And I will follow you

713
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:28,721
Share each day with me

714
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:33,309
Each night, each morning

715
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:42,526
- Say you love me
- You know I do

716
01:12:43,069 --> 01:12:45,321
Love me

717
01:12:45,488 --> 01:12:52,036
That's all I ask of you

718
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:26,070
Anywhere you go, let me go too

719
01:13:27,113 --> 01:13:29,990
Love me

720
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:40,167
That's all I ask of you

721
01:13:48,843 --> 01:13:50,761
I must go

722
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:52,638
They'll wonder where I am

723
01:13:52,806 --> 01:13:54,765
Come with me, Raoul

724
01:13:54,933 --> 01:14:00,813
Christine, I love you

725
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:05,901
Order your fine horses

726
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:08,946
Be with them at the door

727
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:11,949
And soon you'll be beside me

728
01:14:12,117 --> 01:14:15,035
You'll guard me and you'll guide me

729
01:14:34,472 --> 01:14:39,393
I gave you my music

730
01:14:40,437 --> 01:14:46,066
Made your song take wing

731
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:51,864
And now
How you've repaid me

732
01:14:52,032 --> 01:14:58,412
Denied me
And betrayed me

733
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:06,211
He was bound to love you

734
01:15:06,379 --> 01:15:11,008
When he heard you sing

735
01:15:11,176 --> 01:15:13,510
Christine

736
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:30,819
Say you'll share with me

737
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:36,700
One love, one lifetime

738
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:47,086
Say the word
And I will follow you

739
01:15:48,963 --> 01:15:54,343
Share each day with me

740
01:15:54,511 --> 01:15:59,306
Each night, each morning

741
01:16:01,017 --> 01:16:04,937
You will curse the day

742
01:16:05,105 --> 01:16:09,108
You did not do

743
01:16:09,901 --> 01:16:14,363
All that the Phantom

744
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:24,081
Asked of you

745
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:48,457
Monsieur Andre.

746
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,417
Monsieur Firmin.

747
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:54,129
Dear Andre, what a splendid party

748
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:56,882
The prologue to a bright new year

749
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:00,177
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best

750
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:02,763
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city

751
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:05,682
What a pity that
The Phantom Can't be here

752
01:18:09,437 --> 01:18:11,563
Masquerade!

753
01:18:11,731 --> 01:18:13,774
Paper faces on parade

754
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:15,317
Masquerade

755
01:18:15,485 --> 01:18:19,947
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

756
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:22,491
Masquerade!

757
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:24,952
Every face a different shade

758
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:26,370
Masquerade

759
01:18:26,537 --> 01:18:30,249
Look around
There's another mask behind you

760
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:33,627
Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose

761
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:37,089
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast

762
01:18:37,257 --> 01:18:39,800
- Faces! Take your turn
- Take a ride

763
01:18:39,968 --> 01:18:42,427
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race

764
01:18:42,595 --> 01:18:45,722
Eye of gold, thigh of blue
True is false, who is who?

765
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:49,226
Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown

766
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:51,645
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up

767
01:18:51,813 --> 01:18:54,273
Till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound

768
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,899
But who can name the face?

769
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:58,318
Masquerade!

770
01:18:58,486 --> 01:19:02,447
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade

771
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:05,492
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you

772
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:09,246
Masquerade!

773
01:19:09,414 --> 01:19:11,456
Burning glances, turning heads

774
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:13,000
Masquerade

775
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:17,129
Stop and stare
At the sea of smiles around you

776
01:19:18,089 --> 01:19:19,381
Masquerade

777
01:19:20,383 --> 01:19:22,551
Seething shadows, breathing lies

778
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,136
Masquerade

779
01:19:24,304 --> 01:19:28,265
You can fool any friend
Who ever knew you

780
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:31,601
Masquerade!

781
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,312
Leering satyrs, peering eyes

782
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:35,272
Masquerade

783
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,401
Run and hide
But a face will still pursue you

784
01:19:39,569 --> 01:19:40,944
- What a night
- What a crowd

785
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:42,821
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud

786
01:19:42,989 --> 01:19:45,866
- All the crème de la crème
- Watching us watching them

787
01:19:46,034 --> 01:19:48,744
- Three months of relief
- Of delight

788
01:19:48,911 --> 01:19:51,621
- Of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last

789
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:53,290
- No more notes
- No more ghost

790
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:56,418
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year

791
01:19:56,586 --> 01:20:00,714
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade

792
01:20:00,882 --> 01:20:02,883
What a blessed release

793
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:04,676
And what a masquerade

794
01:20:04,844 --> 01:20:06,470
Think of it

795
01:20:06,637 --> 01:20:10,849
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.

796
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:13,560
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?

797
01:20:13,728 --> 01:20:16,938
What have we to hide?
You promised me.

798
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:19,983
- No, Raoul. Please don't. They'll see.
- Let them see.

799
01:20:20,151 --> 01:20:22,861
It's an engagement, not a crime.

800
01:20:23,029 --> 01:20:26,907
Christine, what are you afraid of?

801
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:30,327
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue

802
01:20:30,495 --> 01:20:32,746
- Please pretend
- I can only hope

803
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:38,168
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time

804
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:55,162
Masquerade!

805
01:21:55,455 --> 01:21:59,082
Paper faces on parade

806
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,500
Masquerade

807
01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:04,421
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

808
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,883
Masquerade!

809
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:11,803
Every face a different shade
Masquerade

810
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:15,807
Look around
There's another mask behind you

811
01:22:17,226 --> 01:22:19,269
Masquerade!

812
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:23,315
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade

813
01:22:23,483 --> 01:22:27,527
Stop and stare
At the sea of smiles around you

814
01:22:28,779 --> 01:22:31,239
Masquerade!

815
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:35,327
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade

816
01:22:35,495 --> 01:22:40,624
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you

817
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:05,106
Why so silent, good messieurs?

818
01:23:06,025 --> 01:23:10,237
Did you think that
I had left you for good?

819
01:23:11,697 --> 01:23:14,783
Have you missed me, good messieurs?

820
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:18,745
I have written you an opera

821
01:23:21,082 --> 01:23:25,210
Here, I bring the finished score

822
01:23:25,378 --> 01:23:28,129
Don Juan Triumphant

823
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:34,511
Fondest greetings to you all

824
01:23:35,263 --> 01:23:40,809
A few instructions
Just before rehearsal starts

825
01:23:41,644 --> 01:23:45,105
Carlotta must be taught to act

826
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:50,151
Not her normal trick
Of strutting round the stage

827
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:54,948
Our Don Juan must lose some weight

828
01:23:55,116 --> 01:23:57,075
It's not healthy

829
01:23:57,243 --> 01:24:00,370
In a man of Piangi's age

830
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:04,791
And my managers must learn

831
01:24:04,959 --> 01:24:08,503
That their place is in an office

832
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:12,215
Not the arts

833
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:16,553
As for our star

834
01:24:17,555 --> 01:24:20,098
Miss Christine Daae

835
01:24:23,394 --> 01:24:27,439
No doubt she'll do her best

836
01:24:27,607 --> 01:24:31,526
It's true her voice is good

837
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:37,657
She knows, though
Should she wish to excel

838
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:41,202
She has much still to learn

839
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:47,167
If pride will let her
Return to me

840
01:24:47,335 --> 01:24:52,589
Her teacher

841
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:30,168
Your chains are still mine!

842
01:25:30,336 --> 01:25:31,753
You belong to me!

843
01:26:06,706 --> 01:26:09,666
- Madame Giry --
- Please, I know no more than anyone else.

844
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:12,961
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.

845
01:26:13,129 --> 01:26:16,172
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?

846
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,341
Please, Madame Giry ...

847
01:26:18,509 --> 01:26:20,176
for all our sakes.

848
01:26:23,389 --> 01:26:25,515
Very well.

849
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:49,748
It was years ago.

850
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,210
There was a traveling fair in the city.

851
01:26:54,795 --> 01:26:56,671
Gypsies.

852
01:26:57,882 --> 01:27:00,008
I was very young.

853
01:27:00,676 --> 01:27:03,303
Studying to be a ballerina.

854
01:27:04,972 --> 01:27:06,973
One of many.

855
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:10,059
Living in the dormitories
of the opera house.

856
01:27:19,487 --> 01:27:22,363
See the wonder from the East!

857
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,870
Come.

858
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:30,955
Come inside.

859
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:36,294
Come and see the Devil's Child.

860
01:28:09,036 --> 01:28:14,582
Behold, mesdames and messieurs,
the Devil's Child!

861
01:28:22,174 --> 01:28:24,467
Devil's Child.

862
01:29:03,132 --> 01:29:04,966
Murder!

863
01:29:05,134 --> 01:29:07,510
- Murder!
- Which way?!

864
01:29:07,678 --> 01:29:10,471
That way! That way!

865
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,057
He's getting away!

866
01:29:42,463 --> 01:29:46,633
I hid him from the world
and its cruelties.

867
01:29:48,052 --> 01:29:50,553
He has known nothing else
of life since then ...

868
01:29:50,721 --> 01:29:53,056
except this opera house.

869
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:57,769
It was his playground ...

870
01:29:58,187 --> 01:30:00,021
and now his artistic domain.

871
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:01,940
He's a genius.

872
01:30:02,107 --> 01:30:05,526
He's an architect and designer.

873
01:30:05,694 --> 01:30:08,905
He's a composer and a magician.

874
01:30:09,073 --> 01:30:12,241
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry ...

875
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:15,078
genius has turned to madness.

876
01:31:32,406 --> 01:31:33,906
- Monsieur.
- Where to?

877
01:31:34,074 --> 01:31:35,450
The cemetery.

878
01:32:15,908 --> 01:32:18,826
To my father's grave, please.

879
01:32:35,469 --> 01:32:38,805
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.

880
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:57,949
In sleep, he sang to me

881
01:32:58,117 --> 01:33:02,453
ln dreams, he came

882
01:33:02,788 --> 01:33:07,416
That voice, which calls to me

883
01:33:07,584 --> 01:33:11,921
And speaks my name

884
01:33:51,336 --> 01:33:55,214
Little Lotte thought of everything
and nothing.

885
01:33:56,967 --> 01:34:02,138
Her father promised her that he would
send her the Angel of Music.

886
01:34:04,266 --> 01:34:12,565
Her father promised her.

887
01:34:20,908 --> 01:34:27,788
You were once
My one companion

888
01:34:27,956 --> 01:34:34,045
You were all that mattered

889
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:43,221
You were once
A friend and father

890
01:34:44,514 --> 01:34:51,187
Then my world was shattered

891
01:34:52,022 --> 01:34:58,653
Wishing you were somehow here again

892
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:04,867
Wishing you were somehow near

893
01:35:05,744 --> 01:35:11,499
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed

894
01:35:11,667 --> 01:35:18,005
Somehow you would be here

895
01:35:19,132 --> 01:35:25,304
Wishing I could hear your voice again

896
01:35:25,806 --> 01:35:31,519
Knowing that I never would

897
01:35:32,187 --> 01:35:38,567
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do

898
01:35:38,735 --> 01:35:44,615
All that you dreamed I could

899
01:35:45,826 --> 01:35:51,872
Passing bells and sculpted angels

900
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:58,045
Cold and monumental

901
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,257
Seem for you

902
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:05,594
The wrong companions

903
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:13,269
You were warm and gentle

904
01:36:27,784 --> 01:36:33,748
Too many years
Fighting back tears

905
01:36:33,915 --> 01:36:40,463
Why can't the past just die?

906
01:36:40,672 --> 01:36:48,095
Wishing you were somehow here again

907
01:36:48,889 --> 01:36:55,686
Knowing we must say goodbye

908
01:36:55,896 --> 01:37:01,942
Try to forgive
Teach me to live

909
01:37:02,194 --> 01:37:07,782
Give me the strength to try

910
01:37:08,075 --> 01:37:14,997
No more memories
No more silent tears

911
01:37:15,165 --> 01:37:18,918
No more gazing across

912
01:37:19,086 --> 01:37:27,176
The wasted years

913
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:32,807
Help me say

914
01:37:32,974 --> 01:37:39,230
Goodbye

915
01:37:41,024 --> 01:37:45,861
Help me say

916
01:37:46,655 --> 01:37:55,037
Goodbye

917
01:38:10,137 --> 01:38:15,850
Wandering child
So lost, so helpless

918
01:38:16,017 --> 01:38:21,272
Yearning for my guidance

919
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:27,570
Angel or father
Friend or phantom?

920
01:38:27,737 --> 01:38:33,242
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?

921
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:38,789
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings

922
01:38:38,957 --> 01:38:44,378
Echo in this whisper

923
01:38:44,546 --> 01:38:49,216
Too long you've wandered in winter

924
01:38:49,384 --> 01:38:53,679
Far from my fathering gaze

925
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:58,893
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist

926
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:05,107
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys

927
01:39:05,775 --> 01:39:11,572
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you

928
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:17,995
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty

929
01:39:18,163 --> 01:39:23,292
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector

930
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,838
- Come to your strange angel
- Come to me, strange angel

931
01:39:28,006 --> 01:39:33,344
I am your Angel of Music

932
01:39:33,678 --> 01:39:36,222
Come to me, Angel

933
01:39:37,015 --> 01:39:38,724
- Of Music
- No, Christine! Wait!

934
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:41,393
Wait!

935
01:39:42,145 --> 01:39:44,313
- Raoul!
- Whatever you believe, this man ...

936
01:39:44,481 --> 01:39:46,607
this thing is not your father!

937
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:03,559
No, Raoul!

938
01:41:03,768 --> 01:41:05,227
No.

939
01:41:05,562 --> 01:41:06,812
Not like this.

940
01:41:33,214 --> 01:41:37,301
Now let it be war upon you both.

941
01:41:43,141 --> 01:41:45,559
We have all been blind

942
01:41:45,727 --> 01:41:49,396
And yet the answer
is staring us in the face

943
01:41:49,564 --> 01:41:52,274
This could be the Chance

944
01:41:52,442 --> 01:41:54,693
To ensnare our Clever friend

945
01:41:54,861 --> 01:41:56,945
- We're listening
- Go on

946
01:41:57,113 --> 01:41:59,948
We shall play his game

947
01:42:00,116 --> 01:42:03,869
Perform his work
But remember, we hold the ace

948
01:42:04,037 --> 01:42:08,082
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend

949
01:42:08,249 --> 01:42:12,086
- We are certain the doors are barred
- We are certain the police are there

950
01:42:12,253 --> 01:42:13,754
We are certain they're armed

951
01:42:13,922 --> 01:42:15,798
The Curtain falls

952
01:42:15,965 --> 01:42:17,549
His reign will end

953
01:42:46,913 --> 01:42:48,831
Raoul, I'm frightened.

954
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,876
Don't make me do this.

955
01:42:54,921 --> 01:42:56,630
Raoul.

956
01:42:56,798 --> 01:42:59,007
It scares me.

957
01:42:59,759 --> 01:43:02,886
Don't put me through
this ordeal by fire.

958
01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:06,223
He'll take me.

959
01:43:07,267 --> 01:43:08,851
I know.

960
01:43:10,061 --> 01:43:12,396
We'll be parted forever.

961
01:43:12,856 --> 01:43:14,690
He won't let me go.

962
01:43:17,694 --> 01:43:19,987
What I once used to dream ...

963
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,823
I now dread.

964
01:43:24,325 --> 01:43:27,244
If he finds me, it won't ever end.

965
01:43:27,746 --> 01:43:30,998
And he'll always be there

966
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:34,418
Singing songs in my head

967
01:43:34,586 --> 01:43:37,379
He'll always be there

968
01:43:37,547 --> 01:43:43,135
Singing songs in my head

969
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:52,728
You said yourself

970
01:43:52,896 --> 01:43:59,818
He was nothing but a man

971
01:44:02,071 --> 01:44:06,992
Yet while he lives

972
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,205
He will haunt us

973
01:44:11,372 --> 01:44:18,837
Till we're dead

974
01:44:22,634 --> 01:44:25,594
Twisted every way

975
01:44:25,762 --> 01:44:29,139
What answer can I give?

976
01:44:29,307 --> 01:44:31,850
Am I to risk my life

977
01:44:32,018 --> 01:44:35,521
To win the Chance to live?

978
01:44:35,688 --> 01:44:38,273
Can I betray the man

979
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:41,902
Who once inspired my voice?

980
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:44,988
Do I become his prey?

981
01:44:45,156 --> 01:44:47,407
Do I have any choice?

982
01:44:47,575 --> 01:44:49,993
He kills without a thought

983
01:44:50,161 --> 01:44:52,788
He murders all that's good

984
01:44:52,956 --> 01:44:55,624
I know I can't refuse

985
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:58,293
And yet, I wish I could

986
01:44:58,461 --> 01:45:00,838
Oh, God, if I agree

987
01:45:01,005 --> 01:45:04,132
What horrors wait for me

988
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:10,264
In this, the Phantom's opera?

989
01:45:11,474 --> 01:45:14,977
Christine, Christine

990
01:45:15,144 --> 01:45:19,439
Don't think that I don't Care

991
01:45:19,607 --> 01:45:23,819
But every hope and every prayer

992
01:45:23,987 --> 01:45:29,324
Rests on you now

993
01:45:48,219 --> 01:45:51,305
Seal my fate tonight

994
01:45:51,472 --> 01:45:57,311
I hate to have to cut the fun short

995
01:45:57,478 --> 01:46:01,064
But the joke's wearing thin

996
01:46:01,232 --> 01:46:04,693
Let the audience in

997
01:46:04,861 --> 01:46:09,615
Let my opera begin

998
01:46:36,309 --> 01:46:39,144
Here the sire may serve the dam

999
01:46:39,938 --> 01:46:43,899
Here the master takes his meat

1000
01:46:44,233 --> 01:46:47,861
Here the sacrificial lamb

1001
01:46:48,029 --> 01:46:51,198
Utters one despairing bleat

1002
01:46:51,741 --> 01:46:54,076
Poor young maiden

1003
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:58,455
For the thrill on your tongue
Of stolen sweets

1004
01:46:58,623 --> 01:47:01,458
You will have to pay the bill

1005
01:47:01,626 --> 01:47:05,420
Tangled in the winding sheets

1006
01:47:06,005 --> 01:47:10,133
Serve the meal and serve the maid

1007
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:16,098
Serve the master so that when
Tables, plans and maids are laid

1008
01:47:16,391 --> 01:47:20,268
Don Juan triumphs

1009
01:47:20,436 --> 01:47:30,445
Once again

1010
01:47:42,917 --> 01:47:45,836
Passarino, faithful friend

1011
01:47:46,004 --> 01:47:48,505
Once again recite the plan

1012
01:47:48,673 --> 01:47:51,341
Your young guest believes I'm you

1013
01:47:51,509 --> 01:47:54,720
l, the master
You, the man

1014
01:47:55,096 --> 01:47:59,224
When you met you wore my cloak
She could not have seen your face

1015
01:47:59,392 --> 01:48:03,895
She believes she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place

1016
01:48:04,063 --> 01:48:07,858
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff
Stealing what, in truth, is mine

1017
01:48:08,026 --> 01:48:12,320
When it's late and modesty
Starts to mellow with the wine

1018
01:48:12,488 --> 01:48:15,866
You come home, I use your voice
Slam the door like Crack of doom

1019
01:48:16,034 --> 01:48:20,537
I shall say, "Come hide with me
Where, oh, where? Of course, my room!"

1020
01:48:20,997 --> 01:48:24,791
- Poor thing hasn't got a chance
- Here's my hat, my cloak and sword

1021
01:48:24,959 --> 01:48:29,713
Conquest is assured
If I do not forget myself and laugh

1022
01:48:38,181 --> 01:48:45,604
No thoughts within her head
But thoughts of joy

1023
01:48:45,897 --> 01:48:49,483
No dreams within her heart

1024
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:56,656
But dreams of love

1025
01:49:02,038 --> 01:49:03,955
Master?

1026
01:49:04,207 --> 01:49:06,333
Passarino

1027
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:12,631
Go away, for the trap is set

1028
01:49:12,799 --> 01:49:18,887
And waits for its prey

1029
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:26,061
You have come here

1030
01:49:26,646 --> 01:49:31,066
In pursuit of your deepest urge

1031
01:49:31,234 --> 01:49:35,195
In pursuit of that wish
Which till now

1032
01:49:35,363 --> 01:49:38,532
Has been silent

1033
01:49:38,741 --> 01:49:41,576
Silent

1034
01:49:42,578 --> 01:49:46,873
I have brought you

1035
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:51,336
That our passions may fuse and merge

1036
01:49:51,504 --> 01:49:55,674
In your mind
You've already succumbed to me

1037
01:49:55,842 --> 01:50:01,555
Dropped all defenses
Completely succumbed to me

1038
01:50:02,181 --> 01:50:04,808
Now you are here with me

1039
01:50:04,976 --> 01:50:07,769
No second thoughts

1040
01:50:08,187 --> 01:50:12,732
You've decided

1041
01:50:14,777 --> 01:50:18,530
Decided

1042
01:50:22,243 --> 01:50:26,872
Past the point of no return

1043
01:50:28,374 --> 01:50:31,126
No backward glances

1044
01:50:31,294 --> 01:50:34,880
Our games of make-believe

1045
01:50:35,047 --> 01:50:38,925
Are at an end

1046
01:50:41,637 --> 01:50:46,016
Past all thought of "if" or "when"

1047
01:50:47,768 --> 01:50:50,103
No use resisting

1048
01:50:50,646 --> 01:50:53,148
Abandon thought

1049
01:50:53,316 --> 01:50:58,653
And let the dream descend

1050
01:50:58,821 --> 01:51:03,658
What raging fire shall flood the soul?

1051
01:51:03,826 --> 01:51:07,787
What rich desire unlocks its door?

1052
01:51:07,955 --> 01:51:15,712
What sweet seduction lies before us?

1053
01:51:17,006 --> 01:51:21,509
Past the point of no return

1054
01:51:22,887 --> 01:51:25,138
The final threshold

1055
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:29,768
What warm, unspoken secrets

1056
01:51:29,936 --> 01:51:33,396
Will we learn?

1057
01:51:33,564 --> 01:51:38,401
Beyond the point of no

1058
01:51:39,654 --> 01:51:45,533
Return

1059
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:50,247
You have brought me

1060
01:51:50,414 --> 01:51:54,584
To that moment when words run dry

1061
01:51:54,752 --> 01:51:58,255
To that moment when speech disappears

1062
01:51:58,422 --> 01:52:01,716
Into silence

1063
01:52:02,134 --> 01:52:04,928
Silence

1064
01:52:05,096 --> 01:52:09,182
I have come here

1065
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:13,728
Hardly knowing the reason why

1066
01:52:13,896 --> 01:52:17,399
In my mind I've already imagined

1067
01:52:17,566 --> 01:52:23,363
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent

1068
01:52:23,531 --> 01:52:26,533
Now I am here with you

1069
01:52:26,951 --> 01:52:29,869
No second thoughts

1070
01:52:30,037 --> 01:52:35,667
I've decided

1071
01:52:37,837 --> 01:52:43,341
Decided

1072
01:52:45,303 --> 01:52:50,056
Past the point of no return

1073
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,476
No going back now

1074
01:52:53,644 --> 01:53:01,318
Our passion play
Has now at last begun

1075
01:53:03,487 --> 01:53:08,533
Past all thought of right or wrong

1076
01:53:09,452 --> 01:53:11,953
One final question

1077
01:53:12,121 --> 01:53:15,623
How long should we two wait

1078
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:19,669
Before we're one?

1079
01:53:20,087 --> 01:53:24,424
When will the blood begin to race?

1080
01:53:24,592 --> 01:53:28,136
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?

1081
01:53:28,304 --> 01:53:31,806
When will the flames at last

1082
01:53:31,974 --> 01:53:37,520
Consume us?

1083
01:53:38,022 --> 01:53:43,276
Past the point of no return

1084
01:53:44,987 --> 01:53:48,239
The final threshold

1085
01:53:48,407 --> 01:53:51,034
The bridge is crossed

1086
01:53:51,744 --> 01:53:57,707
So stand and watch it burn

1087
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:05,882
We've passed the point of no

1088
01:54:06,592 --> 01:54:10,762
Return

1089
01:54:30,616 --> 01:54:35,453
Say you'll share with me

1090
01:54:35,621 --> 01:54:38,206
One love

1091
01:54:38,374 --> 01:54:41,584
One lifetime

1092
01:54:42,169 --> 01:54:45,880
Lead me, save me

1093
01:54:46,048 --> 01:54:50,343
From my solitude

1094
01:54:53,305 --> 01:54:58,184
Say you want me with you

1095
01:54:58,352 --> 01:55:03,565
Here beside you

1096
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:08,236
Anywhere you go

1097
01:55:08,404 --> 01:55:12,907
Let me go too

1098
01:55:13,075 --> 01:55:15,577
Christine

1099
01:55:15,744 --> 01:55:21,040
That's all I ask of --

1100
01:56:08,631 --> 01:56:10,006
Go!

1101
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:30,318
Piangi, my love!

1102
01:56:34,532 --> 01:56:35,949
Oh, my God!

1103
01:56:36,116 --> 01:56:37,742
We're ruined, Andre. Ruined!

1104
01:56:50,714 --> 01:56:52,298
Where did he take her?

1105
01:56:52,466 --> 01:56:54,676
Come with me.
I will take you to him.

1106
01:56:54,843 --> 01:56:58,012
But remember, keep your hand
at the level of your eyes!

1107
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:00,181
- I'll come with you!
- No, Meg, no.

1108
01:57:00,349 --> 01:57:02,892
You must stay here.
Come with me. Do as I say.

1109
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,561
No!

1110
01:57:06,146 --> 01:57:11,901
Down once more to the dungeons
Of my black despair

1111
01:57:12,236 --> 01:57:17,991
Down we plunge to the prison
Of my mind

1112
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:21,786
Down that path into darkness

1113
01:57:21,954 --> 01:57:25,790
Deep as hell

1114
01:57:29,878 --> 01:57:33,423
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?

1115
01:57:33,757 --> 01:57:37,677
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!

1116
01:57:40,139 --> 01:57:46,060
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!

1117
01:57:46,228 --> 01:57:47,812
Hounded out by everyone

1118
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,897
Met with hatred everywhere

1119
01:57:50,065 --> 01:57:52,108
No kind words from anyone

1120
01:57:52,276 --> 01:57:54,694
No compassion anywhere

1121
01:57:54,862 --> 01:57:56,237
Christine

1122
01:57:57,698 --> 01:58:02,160
Why?

1123
01:58:05,914 --> 01:58:11,169
- Your hand at the level of your eyes
- At the level of your eyes

1124
01:58:11,337 --> 01:58:13,921
At the level of your eyes

1125
01:58:14,089 --> 01:58:16,758
This is as far as I dare go.

1126
01:58:17,885 --> 01:58:19,344
Thank you.

1127
02:00:04,575 --> 02:00:06,868
Have you gorged yourself at last

1128
02:00:07,035 --> 02:00:09,579
In your lust for blood?

1129
02:00:13,208 --> 02:00:15,418
Am I now to be prey

1130
02:00:15,586 --> 02:00:18,129
To your lust for flesh?

1131
02:00:21,383 --> 02:00:25,887
That fate which Condemns me
To wallow in blood

1132
02:00:26,889 --> 02:00:32,185
Has also denied me
The joys of the flesh

1133
02:00:33,228 --> 02:00:35,563
This face, the infection

1134
02:00:36,106 --> 02:00:39,066
Which poisons our love

1135
02:00:40,569 --> 02:00:45,031
This face which earned

1136
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:49,285
A mother's fear and loathing

1137
02:00:49,453 --> 02:00:51,245
A mask

1138
02:00:51,413 --> 02:00:58,753
My first unfeeling
Scrap of clothing

1139
02:00:58,921 --> 02:01:01,339
Pity comes too late

1140
02:01:01,507 --> 02:01:05,051
Turn around and face your fate

1141
02:01:05,219 --> 02:01:08,846
An eternity of this

1142
02:01:10,182 --> 02:01:13,935
Before your eyes

1143
02:01:26,448 --> 02:01:30,368
This haunted face

1144
02:01:30,536 --> 02:01:38,167
Holds no horror for me now

1145
02:01:40,712 --> 02:01:45,132
It's in your soul

1146
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:54,141
That the true distortion lies

1147
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:59,730
Wait! I think, my dear
We have a guest

1148
02:02:00,691 --> 02:02:01,941
- Sir
- Raoul!

1149
02:02:02,317 --> 02:02:05,820
This is indeed an unparalleled delight

1150
02:02:06,446 --> 02:02:08,739
I had rather hoped

1151
02:02:08,907 --> 02:02:10,533
That you would come

1152
02:02:11,994 --> 02:02:14,662
And now, my wish comes true

1153
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:16,664
- You have truly made my night
- Let me go.

1154
02:02:16,832 --> 02:02:18,124
Free her!

1155
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,668
Do what you like
Only free her!

1156
02:02:20,836 --> 02:02:23,629
- Have you no pity?
- Your lover makes a passionate plea

1157
02:02:23,797 --> 02:02:26,340
- Please, Raoul, it's useless
- I love her

1158
02:02:26,508 --> 02:02:28,843
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!

1159
02:02:29,011 --> 02:02:32,388
- Show some compassion
- The world showed no compassion to me!

1160
02:02:32,556 --> 02:02:36,517
Christine, Christine
Let me see her

1161
02:02:36,685 --> 02:02:39,520
Be my guest, sir

1162
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:46,319
Monsieur, I bid you welcome

1163
02:02:46,486 --> 02:02:52,116
Did you think that I would harm her?

1164
02:02:52,284 --> 02:02:56,120
Why would I make her pay

1165
02:02:56,288 --> 02:03:00,791
For the sins which are yours?

1166
02:03:02,044 --> 02:03:05,046
Order your fine horses now!

1167
02:03:05,213 --> 02:03:07,715
Raise up your hand
To the level of your eyes!

1168
02:03:07,883 --> 02:03:09,884
Nothing can save you now

1169
02:03:10,052 --> 02:03:12,261
Except perhaps Christine

1170
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:16,223
Start a new life with me

1171
02:03:16,391 --> 02:03:18,935
Buy his freedom with your love

1172
02:03:19,686 --> 02:03:22,271
Refuse me, and you send
Your lover to his death!

1173
02:03:22,439 --> 02:03:24,273
This is the Choice!

1174
02:03:24,441 --> 02:03:30,613
This is the point of no return!

1175
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:37,578
The tears I might have shed

1176
02:03:37,746 --> 02:03:40,873
For your dark fate

1177
02:03:41,041 --> 02:03:44,752
Grow Cold and turn

1178
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:48,673
To tears of hate

1179
02:03:50,342 --> 02:03:53,636
Christine, forgive me
Please, forgive me

1180
02:03:55,138 --> 02:04:01,268
- I did it all for you and all for nothing
- Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend

1181
02:04:01,436 --> 02:04:03,187
- We had such hopes
- Too late for turning back

1182
02:04:03,355 --> 02:04:05,606
- Now those hopes are shattered
- Too late for prayers and pity

1183
02:04:05,774 --> 02:04:09,610
- Say you love him
- All hope of cries for help

1184
02:04:09,778 --> 02:04:14,031
- And my life is over
- No point in fighting

1185
02:04:14,199 --> 02:04:21,330
- For either way you choose you cannot win
- But either way you choose he has to win

1186
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:25,626
So do you end your days with me?

1187
02:04:26,044 --> 02:04:29,463
Or do you send him to his grave?

1188
02:04:29,631 --> 02:04:37,179
Why make her lie to you
To save me?

1189
02:04:37,764 --> 02:04:42,476
- Angel of Music
- Past the point of no return

1190
02:04:42,644 --> 02:04:44,937
- Christine, say no!
- Who deserves this?

1191
02:04:45,105 --> 02:04:49,650
- Don't throw your life away for my sake
- His life is now the prize

1192
02:04:49,818 --> 02:04:55,489
- Which you must earn
- I fought so hard to free you

1193
02:04:56,950 --> 02:05:06,125
- You've passed the point of no return
- Angel of Music

1194
02:05:06,293 --> 02:05:10,838
You deceived me

1195
02:05:12,507 --> 02:05:15,760
I gave you my mind blindly.

1196
02:05:16,678 --> 02:05:18,971
You try my patience.

1197
02:05:19,139 --> 02:05:21,015
Make your choice.

1198
02:05:34,321 --> 02:05:40,367
Pitiful Creature of darkness

1199
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:46,957
What kind of life have you known?

1200
02:05:47,125 --> 02:05:51,670
God give me courage to show you

1201
02:05:52,631 --> 02:05:58,886
You are not alone

1202
02:06:51,773 --> 02:06:55,276
Track down this murderer

1203
02:06:55,902 --> 02:06:58,863
Take her! Forget me
Forget all of this

1204
02:07:00,991 --> 02:07:02,575
Leave me alone

1205
02:07:03,034 --> 02:07:05,161
Forget all you've seen

1206
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:07,872
Go now
Don't let them find you

1207
02:07:09,708 --> 02:07:12,793
Take the boat
Swear to me never to tell

1208
02:07:14,588 --> 02:07:17,631
The secrets you know
Of the angel in hell

1209
02:07:17,799 --> 02:07:23,971
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Deep down below

1210
02:07:24,139 --> 02:07:25,639
Go now

1211
02:07:25,807 --> 02:07:28,893
Go now and leave me!

1212
02:07:54,169 --> 02:07:56,170
Masquerade

1213
02:07:57,339 --> 02:08:00,007
Paper faces on parade

1214
02:08:00,175 --> 02:08:02,384
Masquerade

1215
02:08:02,552 --> 02:08:08,933
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

1216
02:08:19,194 --> 02:08:26,909
Christine, I love you

1217
02:09:20,005 --> 02:09:24,216
Say you'll share with me

1218
02:09:24,384 --> 02:09:30,347
One love, one lifetime

1219
02:09:30,515 --> 02:09:33,934
Say the word

1220
02:09:34,102 --> 02:09:40,107
And I will follow you

1221
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:46,697
Share each day with me

1222
02:09:46,865 --> 02:09:53,120
Each night, each morning

1223
02:09:53,913 --> 02:09:59,293
You alone can make my song

1224
02:09:59,461 --> 02:10:01,295
Take flight

1225
02:10:02,714 --> 02:10:05,466
It's over now

1226
02:10:05,633 --> 02:10:08,886
The music

1227
02:10:09,054 --> 02:10:15,351
Of the night
