- Um... Oh. Pantry.

1281

Yeah. Good. Alright.
Well, I'll see you... Oh!

1282

I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.

Oh. Bag.

1284
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,178
Cherry, you've been great.
Thanks very much.

1285
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,214
Oh. No worries.

- Hello?
- James!

1289
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,070
I've got something really big to tell you

1290
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,026
and you're not gonna like it.

1291
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,611
Oh, God. What?

1292
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:05,574

- James.

1295
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:13,126
ELSPETH: James!

1296
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,753
There's a web cam hidden in your kitchen

1297
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:16,539
and everybody's watching you on the internet.

1298
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,752
What?!

1299
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,337
There's a web cam in your kitchen.

1300
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,094
I have to go.
They're coming.

1301
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,021
James!
James! James!

1302
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,064
James!

1303
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,785
Bugged

1304
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,704
I'm so sorry, Cassandra.

1305
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:00,124
- I can't come. I'm not coming.
- This is just nerves...

1306
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,088
I don't want to be the next big thing.

1307
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,628
Stop. Let's just
get in the car...

1308
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,967
All this time, I have been blaming James and the kids

1309
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,507
for making me a nobody.

1310
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,426
But it's them that have turned me into somebody.

1311
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:14,313
No-one is asking you
to leave your family behind.

1312
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,394
Don't you see?
That's exactly what will happen.

1313
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,605
Three months this time.

1314
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,316
- Longer next time, until...
- Get her bags.

1315
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,108
No, Cassandra.
I'm not coming.

1316
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,403
You signed a legally binding contract.

1317
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,493
RALPH: Actually, she didn't.

1318
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,499
I went to pick up the contract last night

1319
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,251
and she hadn't signed it.

1320
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,005
She... said that she was gonna
bring it this morning,

1321
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:43,384
but she's obviously...
ripped it up... or something.

1322
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,092
That's right.
There is no contract.

1323
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,882
Idiot.

1324
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:59,900
Women like me spend years doing the hard yards,

1325
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,935
creating opportunities for girls like you.

1326
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,230
And what do you do?

1327
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,114
You nancy about with all of this vague,

1328
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,321
feel-goody,
New Agey crap

1329
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,907
and piss it all away!

1330
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,492
Well, if it means ditching my husband

1331
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,783
so that I can break through the <i>glass</i> ceiling, yeah.

1332
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,872
I choose to piss it all away.

1333
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,663
(MOANS SOFTLY)

1334
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:27,428
Don't you presume to know anything about me.

1335
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,931
I didn't ditch my husband.

1336
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,558
He left me because I couldn't have children.

1337
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,015
And guess why I don't tell that story to anyone.

1338
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,805
I didn't...

1339
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:42,147
Because that story makes me a sad, lonely loser.

1340
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,188
So forgive me if I spin the story

1341
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,574
in a way that seems superficial to you, Elspeth,

1342
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,451
but that is not how I see myself.

1343
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,284
That is not who I am.

1344
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,824
I am Cassandra Wolfe.

1345
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:01,746
I run the most successful agency
in the Asia-Pacific.

1346
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,132
And I am fabulous!

1347
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,336
You are fabulous, Cassandra.

1348
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,308

1349

He's not wearing any wings.

1362
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,650
Oh, yeah. I...
I just suggested it, and...

1363
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,481
I hope you don't mind.
I just...

1364
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,396
We just thought we'd save them for special days.

1365
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,566
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

1366
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,952
Where's their father?

1367
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,666
- Hi.
- Hey.

1368
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,957
I know you're angry with me.
I know why.

1369
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,801
I had no choice.

1370
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,712
That's it?
That's the apology?

1371
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:19,383
I was desperate for some sort of contact.

1372
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,472
So that makes it OK to expose our kids

1373
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,763
to every perv and weirdo who decided to log on?

1374
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,931
No, that was a mistake -
I left the web cam on

1375
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,850
to keep an eye on the nanny, that's all.

1376
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,235
As soon as I knew everyone was watching, I called you.

1377
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,611
- Who's the bloke?
- What bloke'?

1378
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,363
Oh, come on, Elspeth.
Don't do this.

1379
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:36,241
- Rory? He's just a friend.
- Not Rory, Neil.

1380
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,902
- Who's Rory?
- Neil?

1381
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,661
Yeah, Neil, who sent you perfume.

1382
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,197
Neil sent me perfume?

1383
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,991
Oh, well...
He's just a boy, Jimmy.

1384
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,409
He helped me install the web cam.

1385
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,043
Why would he send you perfume?

1386
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,751
Because I smell?
I don't know.

1387
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,631
So who's this Rory?

1388
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,258
Nobody.

1389
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,636
I'm sorry everyone got to watch you,

1390
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,796
but I'm not sorry that I got to watch you,

1391
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,510
because I fell in love with you.

1392
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,926
I didn't even know I'd fallen out of love with you

1393
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,639
until I fell in love with you again,
