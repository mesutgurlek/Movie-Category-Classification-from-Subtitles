1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,442
So here's what you missed on Glee:

2
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:02,559
<i>Shelby is back with Beth</i>

3
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,099
<i>and she's starting her own
show choir at McKinley.</i>

4
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,832
<i>Mercedes is on board
because she's tired</i>

5
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:07,306
<i>of Rachel and the Glee Club.
I've outgrown you.</i>

6
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:08,492
<i>But Quinn's only playing nice</i>

7
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:09,832
<i>so she and Puck
can get the baby back.</i>

8
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>Kurt, Rachel and Brittany
are all</i>

9
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,777
<i>running for senior class
president,</i>

10
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,678
<i>and Sue's running
for Congress so she</i>

11
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,319
<i>can cut funding
for glee clubs everywhere.</i>

12
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:17,961
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

13
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,243
Glee S03E04
"Pot O' Gold"

14
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:22,269
Made by Mikhel for: Subtitulos.es
== SPREAD THE WORD ==

15
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,472
Top o' the mornin', Brittany.

16
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:29,332
Okay, first of all,
you look magical and amazing,

17
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:30,650
but I don't understand
what you're saying.

18
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:32,751
So if you want
to make it in this land,

19
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,804
you really need
to speak English.

20
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,360
How's your first day
of school?
It's grand.

21
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,697
Hey, Irish.

22
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,207
(chuckling)

23
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,759
Wait. Other people can see you?

24
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:45,562
But only because you
let them see you.

25
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,881
That's right.

26
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,108
BRITTANY:
I've thought
about it a lot,

27
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,686
and I know what I want
as my first wish.

28
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,043
Your magical race,

29
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:53,582
they make my favorite
cereal, Lucky Charms.

30
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,979
I really wish
that you

31
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:56,670
would make me a box
of Lucky Charms

32
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:59,247
with all marshmallows.
You're in luck.

33
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:01,756
Lucky the Leprechaun
happens to be my cousin.

34
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,150
And he lives two
toadstools down.

35
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:05,681
Thank you.

36
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,707
Though I don't understand
most of what you just said.

37
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,780
Work on it.

38
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:12,958
Go back to Mexico.

39
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,387
(school bell ringing)

40
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,728
Hello.

41
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:28,817
Hi.
We got you
something.

42
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,667
Concealer?
To help
with the bags.

43
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:36,282
PUCK:
Don't get us wrong,
Ms. Corcoran.

44
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,622
I mean, you are still

45
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,852
the most tappable teacher
at McKinley, by far.

46
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,459
You've been
looking tired.

47
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:42,931
Which makes sense.
You're a single mother.

48
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:45,050
You've relocated.
You have a new job.

49
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,509
It's no wonder
you've stopped working out.

50
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,390
Let us babysit Beth
for a couple of hours,

51
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,446
any night your choosing,
for some me time.

52
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,406
Have you ever
babysat before?

53
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,460
Mmm. Ask Mr. Shue.

54
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:55,631
We took care of

55
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,942
his sister-in-law's
three demon spawn,

56
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,362
and they were
practically purring

57
00:01:58,393 --> 00:02:00,552
by the end
of the night.

58
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,556
Please.

59
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:06,553
You said you wanted us
to get to know Beth.

60
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,828
(sighs)

61
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,610
I got a bee in my bonnet,

62
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:15,040
and that bee's name
is government waste.

63
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:16,954
Earlier today,
I saw a state employee

64
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,465
in the person
of one Verna the lunch lady

65
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:23,712
throw away 300 pounds of
precious, expired turkey gravy

66
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,656
simply because Uncle Sam said

67
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,550
there were too many
weevils in it.

68
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,099
Well, you know what
has no expiration date, voters?

69
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,609
My rage.

70
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,779
I have in my hand the budget

71
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,371
<i>for the McKinley High production
of West Side Story,</i>

72
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:42,333
a musical about a race war
that glorifies gang violence,

73
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,468
yet still seems
extraordinarily gay.

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,461
This is a top secret
document, Ohio,

75
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,234
and we're opening it up tonight.

76
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,104
$2,004, Ohio.

77
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,274
That's a year's salary
for a public school math teacher

78
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,770
wasted on fake switchblades

79
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,664
and the soft packing
of teen dance belts.

80
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:06,815
If this nation wants to impress
its future Chinese overlords,

81
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,057
we need to get
our priorities straight.

82
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,997
And that's why I encourage
every Ohioan

83
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:15,155
to call McKinley High School
and sing them this song.

84
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,377
"I'm fed up and angry, too,

85
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:20,741
and I agree with Candidate Sue."

86
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:24,150
And that's how Sue... sees it.

87
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,676
(phone ringing)
McKinley High.
Please hold.

88
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,592
McKinley High. Please hold.
McKinley High. Please hold.

89
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,067
You can't just cut the musal.

90
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,890
Sue's pom-pom budget
is $4,000 a month.

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,059
Can't put a price
on cheer, William.

92
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,504
I really expected more
from you, ggins.

93
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:37,437
I thought you
were a friend of the arts.

94
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,548
William, I'm caught
between a rock and a different,

95
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:41,747
yet equally hard, rock.

96
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:42,885
Just this morning,

97
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,582
I was assaulted
in the parking lot.

98
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,749
You! My son can't read,

99
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,588
and you want him
to sing and dance?

100
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,253
(screams)

101
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,696
The Clinton years are over.

102
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:55,580
We're in a
recession, William,

103
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:57,713
that's about to double-dip
into a piping hot

104
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,979
Crock-Pot of voter fury.

105
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,095
And if this school doesn't
learn some priorities,

106
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,580
well, come November,

107
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:06,340
the voters will gladly
teach you some.

108
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,685
What if I can get
the money myself?

109
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,510
Ha. Good luck with
that, William.

110
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,603
The arts are going down.

111
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:14,911
Today the musical,

112
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:16,665
tomorrow the Glee Club.

113
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,843
Next week, NPR and opera
and brunch and Tom Bergeron.

114
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,710
(school bell ringing)

115
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,774
Hi, Santana.

116
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,672
How many solos did you get
in Glee Club last year?

117
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:34,944
A few.

118
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,347
One: "Valerie."

119
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,717
And I loved it.

120
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:40,078
<i>I was also the lips
in Rocky Horror.</i>

121
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,492
Listen, if you and I
were in Shelby's group,

122
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,629
we'd get all the
solos and the duets.

123
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,635
Our voices sound
amazing together.

124
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,840
Plus, it's an all-girl group.

125
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:50,595
Why would I care about all-girl?

126
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:52,727
It's all lady power
all the time.

127
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,571
I mean, Shelby's
a great teacher.

128
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,987
I'm... I'm hitting notes
I didn't even know existed.

129
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:00,059
She gets me--
what I have to give.

130
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,582
It feels good.

131
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,954
SANTANA: You know, honestly,
I wish I could, but...

132
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,460
somebody's got to look out
for Brittany.

133
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,131
I mean, that special place
where she lives,

134
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,677
yeah, it's
beautiful, but...

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,849
someone's got to help her
cross the street.

136
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,198
I could never
just leave her.

137
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:15,647
Get her to
come with you.

138
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:24,525
SANTANA:
You know what,
girl Chang?

139
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:27,295
If you cry every time
someone gets a hangnail,

140
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,303
it kind of starts toose
its effect.

141
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,726
It's not a hangnail.

142
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,076
Mercedes was one of Glee's
original members.

143
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:35,315
I feel naked in here
without her.
Yeah, well, get used to it,

144
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:36,691
'cause without her
singing for us,

145
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,058
we're going to have
to perform naked

146
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,650
for the judges to vote for us
at Sectionals.

147
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,176
No. I will not let this setback
crush our spirits.

148
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,825
I mean, we have handled worse.

149
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,297
Than losing one
of our best singers?

150
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,216
Kind of hard not to blame you,
Mr. Shue.

151
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:49,063
Think you were too hard on her
at Booty Camp.

152
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,385
TINA:
I blame Artie.

153
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,279
Why couldn't you have just
given Maria to Mercedes?

154
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,501
ARTIE:
Because that would
have damaged

155
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,805
my integrity as an artist.

156
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,229
Sorry I am late.

157
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,443
I was putting up
posters for my...

158
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,732
for my campaign.

159
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,521
Did you airbrush out your jowls?

160
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,658
No.
Look, let'
stop it, everybody.

161
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:03,991
So we lost a singer.

162
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:05,634
So they canceled the musical.

163
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,994
Wait, what?
No, no, no, no.

164
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,926
You can't cancel my musical.

165
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,204
Sue cut the funding.

166
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,253
The point is, right now,
we shouldn't

167
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,882
be turning on each other.
I agree.

168
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,027
I can only speak from my
experience with the Warblers,

169
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,532
but no show choir is just
one person; it's a team.

170
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:20,373
When we lost a Warbler, we just
replaced him with another one.

171
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,702
Which is easy when your
waiting list has a waiting list.

172
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,634
Dude, I know you're
a big deal at Dalton

173
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,887
or whatever, but we don't
wear blazers her

174
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,847
so have a seat--
I'm trying to give a pep talk.

175
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:30,851
Didn't you just say
something about us

176
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:31,863
not turning on each other?

177
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,431
No, you can't cancel my musical.

178
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,947
Okay? I was considering
changing my name to Maria.

179
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:38,359
The musical is not canceled.

180
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:41,087
As for Mercedes, yes,
that is a huge loss for us,

181
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,281
but we will deal
with replacing her later.

182
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,831
Right now, we need to focus
on putting on this musical.

183
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:46,829
How?

184
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:49,125
We sell ads in the program.

185
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,397
I figure we
can get ten,

186
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,592
maybe 20 bucks
apiece for them.

187
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,060
So we'll only have
to sell about 200.

188
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,066
Well, I think it's
a brilliant idea.

189
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,081
And I volunteer myself
to spearhead the charge.

190
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,108
It'll give me a great
opportunity to, uh, bust out

191
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,337
<i>my Banana Republic
Mad Men collection.</i>

192
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:03,365
Okay. All right.
Let's break off

193
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,148
into smaller groups, figure out
who's going to canvass

194
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,820
which parts of the city.
And guys, I don't care

195
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,203
what Sue does or who leaves us--

196
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,630
everyone in this
group's dreams

197
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,341
are going to come
true this year.

198
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's do it.
Hey, Santana.

199
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,932
Ready to help out the team?

200
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,887
Yeah, ofourse. Why?

201
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,865
Just checking.

202
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,688
Hey.

203
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:30,113
Finn Hudson.
You know who I am?

204
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,527
I've seen you on YouTube,
losing Glee Club Nationals

205
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,268
after tongue-kissing
your girlfriend for ten minutes.

206
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,211
Uh...
I'm a big, big fan.

207
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,670
Thanks.

208
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:38,818
At ease.

209
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:44,274
So... who are you?
Me name's Rory Flanagan.

210
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm a foreign exchange
stent from Ireland.

211
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:48,647
And I love everything
about America,

212
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,749
especially NASCAR,
your half-black president

213
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,663
and Victoria's Secret catalogs.

214
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,106
Yeah. Cool. Me, too.

215
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,567
I'm staying at the home
of Brittany S. Pierce,

216
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,349
and she thinks
I'm a leprechaun.

217
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,337
Yeah, she'kind of like
Rain Man with boobs.

218
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,286
She said if I grant her
three wishes,

219
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,634
I can get into
her pot of gold.

220
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,060
So I'm pretending to be
a leprechaun.

221
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,727
Her first wish was for
an all-marshmallow box

222
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,729
of Lucky Charms.
Ah.

223
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,055
I really want to snog her.

224
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,642
I'm still a virgin.

225
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:14,851
Have you made any friends yet?

226
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,375
Not really,
except for Brittany.

227
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm really lonely, you know?

228
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,109
I thought America was all about
different unique people

229
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:22,660
coming together
and accepting one another.

230
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:24,466
That's a pretty old
brochure, dude.

231
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,168
I could really use
some more friends.

232
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,467
Would you be my friend, Finn?

233
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,650
Whoa, whoa.
It would be an honor.

234
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:33,341
In America, dudes don't
ask dudes to be their friends.

235
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:36,169
Except on Facebook, but even
then, it can take years.

236
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,463
Okay.

237
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:43,290
I'll be your friend.

238
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:45,318
But first, you
got to help me.

239
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,666
One of the best singers in
Glee Club quit recently,

240
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,430
and there's talk of
more defections.

241
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,530
You're staying at
Brit's house, right?

242
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,931
If you hear anything,
let me know.

243
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,766
I will.
All right.

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,541
Thanks.
No problem.

245
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:57,757
See you around.

246
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,229
Finn Hudson--
that's Irish, right?

247
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:02,427
Nah. Nah, my mom's from Toledo.

248
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,605
Okay, uh, I got my iPod,
my cell phone.

249
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:09,692
You have my number?

250
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,239
You wrote it on my hand.

251
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,288
Okay. Okay.

252
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,539
All right, honey.
I'm going to go.

253
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,078
I'll be back soon, okay?
Give Mama a kiss.

254
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,081
If she gets upset,
you just do a little

255
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,345
"Itsy Bitsy Spider."
She loves that.

256
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:20,251
(Beth crying)
It's okay, boo-boo.

257
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,438
It's okay.

258
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,586
Mommy will be
right back, okay?

259
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,649
It's okay. She'll stop
as soon as I leave.

260
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,202
I know she'll
stop, okay?

261
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,989
So don't worry.
Thank you guys so much.

262
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,610
Okay. I really
appreciate it.

263
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,891
Have a good run.

264
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,807
"Itsy Bitsy Spider," guys.
It's okay.

265
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:36,763
Here. Let me take her.

266
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:38,840
She likes me.
(crying stop

267
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:40,895
It's okay. Big Daddy's got you.

268
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,978
What are you doing?

269
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:45,064
Proving that Shelby
is an unfit mother.

270
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,635
First we plant the stuff,
then we call child services.

271
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,170
Starting in
the bathroom.

272
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,321
Let's put you down.

273
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,926
Baby botulism.

274
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,688
Saw this lady on TV who
made her kid's forehead

275
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,608
as smooth as his butt.

276
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,978
People practically
lynched her.

277
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,533
You don't think she's
going to notice?

278
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,199
She's only sleeping
four hours a night.

279
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,619
She barely knows her name.

280
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:11,360
Baby sacrifice makes me sad.

281
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,528
What's wrong with Shelby
eating Mexican?

282
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,246
Is that, like,
a boob milk thing?

283
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:16,884
It's illegal to give hot sauce
to babies.

284
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,304
This mom used to put a drop

285
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:19,854
on her kid's tongue
when he was bad.

286
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,208
She went to jail for a year.

287
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,350
Jail seems a little extreme.

288
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:24,832
Shelby's a good mom.

289
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,132
Do you want our baby back
or not?

290
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,616
Yeah, I do.

291
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,004
Hey, Dad.

292
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:34,914
I wanted to show
you my program

293
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,575
<i>for McKinley's production
of West Side Story.</i>

294
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,528
It's inspired by my
favorite 1920s musicals.

295
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,807
Sounds great, Kurt.

296
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,474
Some reason you're showing this
to me right now?

297
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,902
I was hoping that you
might be interested

298
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,410
in purchasing some ad space
to help save the show.

299
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:50,621
Save the show?
We lost the funding.

300
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:52,009
We're hoping to sell
enough ad space

301
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,248
to cover the cost
of the show.

302
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:54,588
They're only ten dollars each.

303
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,469
And I've already talked
to the Lima Mortuary Society

304
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:58,808
about buying a couple, and
we... we need about 200.

305
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:00,776
You fund
Sue's cheerleading squad,

306
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,862
but you can't find
a couple grand for the musical?

307
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,393
Figgins, allow me
to introduce you

308
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:07,295
to some friends of mine
down at the Rotary Club.

309
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:08,806
These are the owners of
Lima's three funeral parlors.

310
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,053
Well, strictly speaking,
mine is a pet funeral parlor.

311
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,792
And mine is a crematorium.

312
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,661
So we also bake and delir
delicious brick oven pizza.

313
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:19,379
These three businessmen
wrote a check today

314
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:22,434
<i>to fund West Side Story
in completion,</i>

315
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,786

in the program for the musical.

317

SHOR:
I'm a big fan of the show,

318
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,615
just because there are
so many deaths in it.

319
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,550
BURT:
So, Will, unless I'm mistaken,

320
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,002
I think this means
the show is back on.

321
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,961
Burt, I think
you're right.

322
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:35,339
Gentlemen, thank
you so much.

323
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:36,876
Appreciate it.
Really appreciate
your generosity.

324
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:38,150
All right, thank you.
Thank you.

325
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,274
Burt, I can't
thank you enough.

326
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,062
Hey. Sue!

327
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,884
(school bell ringing)

328
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,359
Just thought I'd let you know
we got the money,

329
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,534
so the musical's back on.

330
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,585
Why, if it isn't
Porcelain's dad,

331
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,542
who may or may not
have a baboon heart.

332
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,183
I thought I smelled blue collar.

333
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,928
Just so you know,
after the musical's done,

334
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,152
I'm going to organize
as much money as I can

335
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:58,558
to make sure
you don't get elected.

336
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,581
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

337
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:00,897
Hold up there,

00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,235

my fist throught

341
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,046
and pull out your still-pumping
artificial heart

342
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,216
which I will then
hook up to my car,

343
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,126
power us down
to the lumberjack convention

344
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:15,141
for some deep discounts on
the Midwest's largest selection

345
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,884
of ill-fitting
flannels.

346
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,604
Bullies don't have
a very good track record

347
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,778
of messing with the Hummels.

348
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:23,432
I heard, and I am literally
horny with fear.

349
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,153
You know, you might want
to sneak a handful of

350
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,449
Will Schuester's patented
Butter-Flavored Follicle Cream,

351
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:28,672
put some on your melon.

352
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,128
That way, you don't have to keep

353
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:34,770
wearing those baseball caps that
are fooling absolutely no one.

354
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,974
Don't know how she does it.

355
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:43,143
I would just like to see
that woman lose, just once.

356
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:46,287
No, Mummy, America's wonderful.

357
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:48,863
I've made a ton of friends.

358
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:51,383
No, I haven't met
Colin Farrell yet, Ma.

359
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,385
Mummy?

360
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,570
(gasps)

One all-marshmallow box
of Lucky Charms, as requested.

362
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,744

00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,759
Oh, my God.

364
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,385
Thank you so much,
Rory Leprechaun.

365
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:17,716
You know, now
you're only, like,

366
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,263
two wishes away
from getting my pot of gold.

367
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:21,940
I have another
story to tell you.

368
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:25,440
Every night, I feed Lord
Tubbington nougat and sprinkles,

369
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,578
and then I rub his belly seven
times with glitter sticks,

370
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:28,936
but so far
nothing works.

371
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,450
You do that because...?

372
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,473
I want Lord Tubbington
to poop candy bars.

373
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,823
What? Does everybody
wish for that or something?

374
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,280
Brittany, I was wondering

375
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:41,181
if maybe you'd like
to do dinner tonight?

376
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,620
Oh, I can't.

377
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:43,994
I have plans
with a friend.

378
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,316
And you're not supposed
to eat anything

379
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,582
but four-leaf clovers
anyways, so...

380
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,594
Thanks.

about, um,

404
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:46,424
you know, that thing
that we never talk about.

Wasn't last week when we were
taking a bath together,

411
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,616
wasn't that a date?

412

Are you crying?

413
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,535
It's just that I'm really happy.

414
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,455
Well, I told you last year

415
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,479
that if I'm single
and you're single,

416
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,043
that we'd mingle.

417
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,686
And if there's any controversy
that interferes

418
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,734
with my presidential campaign,
then I'll use

Well, yeah. Rory's from Ireland.

422
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,321
That means he's, like,
made of magic.

423
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,004
Don't you have any wishes

424
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:25,339
that you really, really
want to come true?

425
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,094
Yeah, I do.

426
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:30,178
I'm thinking of joining
Shelby's new show choir.

427
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,051
If I did, would
you join me?

I'm so sick of always being
backup to Rachel Berry.

429

But I won't join without you.

431
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,025
I don't really want
to be known as a quitter.

432
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,243
Doesn't my presidential campaign
need continuity?

433
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:47,346
Can I think about it
for, like, a day?

434
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,324
Yeah.

435
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:49,884
No, totally. I understand.

436
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:51,507
Yeah, just think about it.

437
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,845
But in the meantime,

438
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,891
I do have one more wish.

00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,057
Mm-hmm?

440
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,921
I wish you'd hold my hand.

441
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,738
But, like, under the napkin.

469
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:08,413
Why don't you just
send Pony in?

470
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,429
No problem.

<i>But the problem with dreams
is there's always some naysayer</i>

473
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,224
<i>ready to crap all over them.</i>

474
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:21,967
How many pools
are there in Lima?

475
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,555
I don't know-- 25, 30?

476
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:27,626
You need to quit messing around
and get a real job.

477
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:31,083
Do you have any idea how much
it costs to raise a child?

478
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:33,487
I called Child Protective
Services, and they're backed up,

479
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,923
but we should have our baby back
within, like. two weeks.

480
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:38,157
Holy crap, I can't believe
you actually called them.

481
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,848
Everybody has their big plans--

482
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,643
colleges, New York,

483
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:44,100
even you have your stupid
pool cleaning business.

484
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,882
I mean, what do I have?

485
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,136
Beth is perfect.

486
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,572
She's my perfect thing.

487
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,381
Something even
I can't screw up.

488
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,397
Do you know how hard it is
to do something perfectly?

489
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:05,420
I'll never get the chance again.

490
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:12,604
So even if I never leave this
town or accomplish anything...

491
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,159
(sighs)

492
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:16,153
I'll have her to call mine.

493
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,586
(school bell ringing)

494
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,844
Puck. Hi.

495
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:21,931
Hey.

496
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:23,565
I was talking to
my condo manager,

497
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,244
and he's looking
for a pool boy.

498
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,745
It's an indoor pool,
so it could be a year-round job.

499
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:30,090
If you're interested,
I could give you a card.

500
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,131
Yeah.

501
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:32,959
Thanks, Shelby.

502
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,541
You're welcome.

503
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,663
(school bell ringing)

504
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:38,687
He knows about my leprechaun.

505
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,358
Okay, everyone, I have
some very exciting news.

506
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,541
Due to the collective spirit
of this club-- particularly

507
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:50,224
the hard ad sales work of Kurt
and the generosity

508
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,566
of the entire
Hummel-Hudson household--

509
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,932
it's my pleasure to announce
that we have raised the money

510
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,613
<i>to do West Side Story this year.</i>

511
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,881
(cheering)
All right!

512
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,723
Good job, everyone.
Great job.

513
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:02,966
Thank you and
thank you.

514
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,953
Blaine, you actually had
something you wanted to say,

515
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,953
right?
Yes, did.

516
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,621
I just wanted to acknowledge
that we've all had

517
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,804
a really rough week,
what with Mercedes leaving.

518
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:11,853
So I prepared a little something

519
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:13,329
to show what Mr.
Shue just said--

520
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:15,353
that the magic is still here.

521
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,106
So this is to remind us

522
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:19,480
of what Glee is all about,
which is just fun.

You guys, that song is amazing.

572
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:34,396
I think we should do
it for Sectionals!

573
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:37,226
So... no concerns about
showcasing any other voices

574
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,296
this year at the competition?

575
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:39,903
Oh, come on, Santana.

576
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,393
You were featured last
year at Sectionals.

577
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,215
Yeah, I know. And we won.

578
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,393
Oh! No, you know what?
I get it.

579
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,444
Since Mercedes is gone
this year, it's going to be

580
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,286
the Blaine and Rachel show.

581
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,437
Yay! You all
know it's true.

582
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,972
Noted.
Good to know.

583
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,144
WILL:
Thank you, Santana.

584
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:57,462
(school bell rinng)

585
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,077
Do not even think about talking

586
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,325
for the next
30 seconds, okay?

587
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,537
Nod so I know
you understand me.

588
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,659
Good. Here's the deal,
Pixie-boy.

589
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:10,313
You've got a crush
on my girl Brittany.

590
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,016
I understand.

591
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:13,618
She's beautiful,
she's innocent,

592
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,944
she's everything that's good

593
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,318
in this miserable, stinking
world-- do you agree?

594
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:17,873
Nod. Good.

595
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:19,704
Also, she thinks you're
a spritely, green

596
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,231
mythological creature,

597
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:22,675
but I know you're a
potato-eating poser,

598
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,022
but since Brittany likes
having a pet Irish,

599
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:27,499
I'm not gonna explode you.
Here's what'gonna go down.

600
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>Leprechaun, starring
a young Jen Aniston,</i>

601
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,206
is my favorite movie.
It learned me two things:

602
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,436
1) leprechauns like fixing

603
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,259
shoe buckles because
they're gay.

604
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:37,360
And 2) they grant wishes.

605
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,820
So you're gonna
grant me a wish.

606
00:23:57,455 --> 00:23:58,997
BRITTANY:
What are you doing?

607
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,246
Nothing.

608
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,143
What are you doing?

609
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:04,490
Lord Tubbington snuck out,
and I found him at Arby's.

610
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:07,301
How did you get
into my room?
I blinked.

611
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:08,319
Look.

612
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:11,503
I made your wish come true.

613
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,291
Look.

614
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,001
Oh, my God.

615
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,003
Oh, my God!
You did it, leprechaun!

616
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,172
Yum.

617
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:20,677
Which means...

618
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm just one wish away from
your pot of gold. Right?

619
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:24,832
Yep.

620
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:25,893
Cheers.

621
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,857
Lord Tubbington's poops
are crispy and delicious.

622
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:33,246
Brittany, I've got
something to tell you.

623
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:35,380
You're not the only one
who knows about me.
What do you mean?

624
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:37,050
Santana found out
about my secret,

625
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,017
and she only had one wish.

626
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,021
Okay, what was it?

627
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:44,636
She wished for you to
leave the New Directions

628
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,846
and join the all-new
girls' singing group.

629
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,686
I don't know what to do.
I love the Glee Club,

630
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,781
and I don't want to
abandon my friends, but...

631
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,041
if you wish on a leprechaun,
it has to come true.

632
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,816
And with just one wish, it
definitely has to come true.

633
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,321
Why couldn't she have
just wished for

634
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:03,837
Lord Tubbington
to quit smoking?

635
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:06,905
That's it, then. I have to
leave the New Directions.

636
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,122
(clears throat)

637
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,187
Hey, Burt?

638
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,549
Hey, Schuester.

639
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:15,665
Hey.

640
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,323
Finally came in to
get that muffler fixed?

641
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,029
Uh, no. It's kind of my
signature piece.

642
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,373
Listen, I really want to

643
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:23,013
thank you for what you
did for the musical.

644
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,227
It's about time
someone stood up to Sue.

645
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:28,265
You came all the way
down here to tell me that?
I got a phone, you know.

646
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:32,051
You are an impressive guy, Burt.

647
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,338
Sue is winning votes

648
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,378
by feeding off all
the anger and the fear

649
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,093
in the country right now.
What do you want, Schuester?

650
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,318
Someone needs to
run against her.

651
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:41,843
Why don't you do it?

652
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:43,812
Because I promised the kids
that I would be there

653
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,014
for them all year.

654
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:46,849
Besides, if an art
teacher runs against her

655
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:48,900
it looks like I'm just
trying to protect my job.

656
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,216
We need someone who is
a man of the people,

657
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,233
a working man who
voters can relate to.

658
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,853
When that guy says the
arts are worth saving,

659
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,489
people might listen.

660
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:00,199
That guy sounds like a good
dude. I'd vote for him.

661
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,964
I'm talking about you.

662
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:05,284
I'm way ahead of you.

663
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,699
I had Carole check out
the election rules.

664
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,425
I'm too late to
get on the ballot,

665
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,246
but I can still run as
a write-in candidate.

666
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:13,545
Yeah, some chick
in Alaska won

667
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,330
doing it last year. Her name was
way harder to spell than Hummel.

668
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,675
Wait, are you serious?

669
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:19,190
I mean, you-- you
really want to do this?

670
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:24,891
Your Glee Club saved
my kid's life. All right?

671
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:28,938
I mean, turns out art
can do that, you know?

672
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,717
And whether it's through
singing or dancing

673
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:32,599
or painting
a freaking picture...

674
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:34,087
I want to be your
campaign manager.

675
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,786
Well, Kurt already
claimed the gig,

676
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,007
but I guess he's gonna need
some adult supervision, so...

677
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,361
welcome aboard.

678
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,686
That's right.

679
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:41,848
(laughing)

680
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,144
SHELBY (murmurs):
Okay.

681
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:46,987
(Beth fusses)
Co on, baby...

682
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,971
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

683
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:52,478
It's okay.

684
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:55,530
There you go.

685
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,293
(knocking)
(Beth cries)

686
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:03,371
Hold on, baby.

687
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,537
(sighs)
What is it, Puck?

688
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:12,606
Um, I justanted to
come by and say thank you,

689
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,800
for recommending me for the
pool cleaning job. I got it.

690
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,134
Oh. That's great.

691
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:22,954
Not a lot of people
believe in me, and...

692
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:24,637
Means a lot to me that you do.

693
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:25,618
(crying continues)

694
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,094
Okay, not a problem. Just...

695
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,953
It's just really
bad timing right now.

696
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,950
Okay, baby.

697
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,639
You mind if I
utilize your commode?

698
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:35,125
My tank's on full,
if you know what I mean.

699
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:36,634
Okay.

700
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:49,013
It's okay, baby.

701
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,104
Okay, honey.

702
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,185
All right.
It's okay.

703
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:56,739
I know. I know
you're tired. I know.

704
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:57,981
I know.
You're so tired.

705
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,354
Okay, honey. Okay.

706
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:03,142
Okay, okay.
No, no, no, Puck.

707
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,026
You know, I, just, I know
you're trying to help,

708
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:06,906
but I'm really overwhelmed right
now, could you just-just...

709
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:09,255
you have to go, okay?

710
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,450
She's really into me.

711
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:12,874
Look. You'll see.

712
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:16,918
("I've Been Waiting For a Girl
Like You" bens)

713
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,816
¶ So long

714
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,352
¶ I've been looking too hard

715
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:26,333
¶ I've been waiting too long

716
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:28,709
¶ Sometimes I don't know

717
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:31,636
¶ What I will find

718
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,294
¶ I only know
it's a matter of time ¶

719
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,854
¶ When you love someone...

720
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:50,945
¶ Won't you tell me if
I'm coming on too strong? ¶

721
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:55,685
¶ This heart of mine
has been hurt before ¶

722
00:28:55,697 --> 00:29:00,078
¶ This time I wanna be sure

723
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:02,322
¶ I've been waiting

724
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:05,868
¶ For a girl like you

725
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:10,224
¶ To come into my life

726
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,068
¶ I've been waiting

727
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:15,404
¶ For a girl like you

728
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:19,877
¶ And a love that will survive

729
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,255
¶ Yeah, waiting

730
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,135
¶ For a girl like you

731
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:30,375
¶ To come into my life...

732
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:40,673
It's everything I wanted.

733
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:43,249
To be a mom.

734
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:47,516
But...

735
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,724
it's just so
damn hard.

736
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:53,766
Hard to do it alone.

737
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:56,847
The mess, the stickiness,

738
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:59,605
the... the crying...

739
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:03,928
Books about ducks wearing
yellow rubber boots...

740
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,386
it's all of it
by myself, you know?

741
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:09,160
But the hardest part
isn't any of that stuff.

742
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,057
It's when the amazing
things happen.

743
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:15,057
It's when Beth first stood.

744
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:19,252
I just wanted to be
able to look over, and...

745
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:21,749
and share that moment with
someone that loves her

746
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:24,187
just as much as I do.

747
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:29,861
But... no one's there.

748
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,546
Listen...

749
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:37,194
If you ever need any help...

750
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:39,593
I'm here for you.

751
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,160
Always.

752
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:53,399
Finn! I've got top-secret intel,
and you're not gonna like it.

753
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,568
(school bell ringing)

754
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,869
Is it true?
No. Of course not.

755
00:30:57,932 --> 00:30:59,428
You're not leaving
New Directions?

756
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,176
Oh. I thought you
were talking about

757
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,570
the Selena Gomez
pregnancy rumors.

758
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,274
Uh... yes.
I'm quitting Glee Club.
We need you!

759
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:09,000
We're like a big family, and
this is our year to win it all!

760
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,365
That's right, Double-Stuffed-
Fatty-Gassy-McGravPants.

761
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,885
We are just one, big,
happy-happy family.

762
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,919
Santana, stay out of this...

763
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:17,001
You are such a
bacon-wrapped-bugeyed hypocrite.

764
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,554
It's freaking hilarious how
jealous of Blaine you are.

765
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,764
Every time he opens his
dreamboat acapella mouth,

766
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,923
you're just itching to kick
him right in the Warblers.

767
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,094
Brittany, we can't survive
any more defections.

768
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:28,129
And I know you
don't want to leave.

769
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:29,541
No, I know.
It's just that Santana,

770
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,951
she made a wish on
Rory my leprechaun...

771
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,981
Brittany, there's no such
thing as leprechauns.

772
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:36,576
And all that stuff about
Santa being real last year

773
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,461
was cute, but this
leprechaun crap?

774
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,764
I mean, at some point
you just gotta grow up
and stop being such an idiot.

775
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:48,132
What did you just call me?
Brittany, I didn't mean
it... like that...

776
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:50,369
Yeah. All the guys in
Glee Club call me that.

777
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,038
And you're the leader, so that
makes you the worst of them all.

778
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:55,515
You cannot call your
future president an idiot.

779
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:58,510
It's mean, it's bullying,
and I won't accept it.

780
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,314
Hey, Mercedes, wait up!

781
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:06,604
Whoo!
Hey.

782
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:09,332
Okay. So who else is in this
girl group besides us?

783
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,811
(gasps)
(school bell ringing)

784
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:13,537
Okay! All finished.

785
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,597
You are nowhere
near finished.

786
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,696
You made me look 26. I asked
you to make me look 22.

787
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,611
Uh, excuse me, sweetie.

788
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,116
Susan, we have a problem.

789
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:27,516
You're a candidate for office,
so campaign law says

790
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,784
we have to give your new
opponent equal time.

791
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,769
What new opponent?

792
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,633
BURT:
Hi, folks.

793
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,957
My name is Burt Hummel, and
I want to be your congressman.

794
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,529
Now, Sue Sylvester, she's
gotten a lot of mileage,

795
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:42,461
coming on this show and
scaring you into thinking

796
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,250
that a high school
putting on a musical

797
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:45,662
is the reason why your
neighbor's house got

798
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,005
foreclosed on. Now, what
she doesn't tell you is how

799
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,934
she spends twice the entire
McKinley High School Arts budget

800
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,496
on things like leg-warmers
for her Cheerios.

801
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,587
She wants you to think that
the arts are a luxury

802
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:58,138
we just can't afford,
but she's got it backwards.

803
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:01,148
You know, in this economy, art,
music, theatre, dance,

804
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:02,899
these are things we can't afford
to lose.

805
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:06,182
Now, Sue Sylvester thinks that
fostering a student's creativity

806
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:07,695
is a waste of money.

807
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:11,376
I think it's the way you invest
in this country's future.

808
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:13,684
We all need to get creative.

809
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,551
You got an idea how we can boo
jobs in this district?

810
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:17,147
I want to hear it.

811
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,932
You send it to Hummel Tires
and Lube-- Lima, Ohio.

812
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,800
And if you think I'd make
a better representative

813
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:25,470
for this community
than Sue Sylvester,

814
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:26,941
write in Burt Hummel.

815
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:28,528
Just don't let Sue
shortchae our kids.

816
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:30,579
My name is Burt Hummel.

817
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:32,454
And that's how I see it.
(school bell rings)

818
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:34,097
Motta Mia.

819
00:33:34,132 --> 00:33:37,609
Tomato, To-Motta.

820
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,981
Loco-Motta!

821
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,450
(indistinct voices)

822
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,137
Awesome, more back-up for me.

823
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:46,394
Oh, okay, you know what? I did
not just leave one diva-driven

824
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,851
Glee Club to join another.

825
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,892
So let me write you a reality
check, Richie Bitch.

826
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,583
I've seen what you can do,
and what you can do is

827
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:57,558
stand in the back, sway,
and sing very, very quietly.

828
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:02,802
I, um... just wanted to be
on the winning team for once

829
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,130
Then turn down the 'tude,
and you will be.

830
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,802
Ladies. Welcome.

831
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,307
We were just brainstorming
names for our new group.

832
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,202
Perfect.
Hot Bitches.

833
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:13,136
Or Hot Messes.
Free Beer.

834
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,342
Uh, okay, I was thinking
something that more captured

835
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,869
our essence, sums up who we
want to be, who we really are.

836
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:21,832
What we are is trouble
for the other groups.

837
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:22,974
(others murmuring)

838
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,358
The Troubletones... I like it.

839
00:34:26,392 --> 00:34:27,577
That's good.

840
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,121
I like that, too.

841
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,764
¶ Tarzan and Jane were swingin'
on a vine ¶

842
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,686
¶ Candyman, Candyman ¶

843
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,363
¶ Sippin' from a bottle of vodka
double wine ¶

844
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,711
¶ Sweet... sugar... candy man

845
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,766
¶ Hey, hey, yeah

846
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,617
¶ I met him out for dinner
on a Friday night ¶

847
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,091
¶ He really had me working up
an appetite ¶

848
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:54,006
¶ He had tattoos up and down
his arm ¶

849
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:56,701
¶ There's nothing more dangerous
than a boy with charm ¶

850
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,699
¶ He's a one-stop shop,
kes the panties drop ¶

851
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:02,511
¶ He's a sweet-talkin',
sugar-coated candy man ¶

852
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,883
¶ Sweet... sugar... candy man

853
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,895
¶ He's a one-stop, gotcha-hot,

854
00:35:07,915 --> 00:35:10,747
¶ Sweet... sugar... candy man

855
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,637
¶ He's a one-stop, got me hot,

856
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,122
¶ Sweet... sugar... candy man

857
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,133
¶ He's a one-stop, get it while
it's hot, baby, don't stop ¶

858
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:20,451
¶ Sweet... sugar...

859
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:24,807
¶ He had those lips

860
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,330

00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:30,262

862
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:32,972
¶ He's a sweet-talkin',
sugar-coated candy man ¶

863
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,532
¶ Hey

864
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,534
¶ Candy man

865
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:38,797
¶ Candy man

¶ Hey!
¶ Candy man

867
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:44,896
¶ Candy man!

868
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,603
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

869
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:52,283
Man, this is trouble.

870
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:54,461
Big trouble.

871
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:59,244
Seriously, Sectionals
should just give us the
trophy; you know it's ours.

872
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:00,368
Hey.

873
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,080
I saw you guys perform,
and it was incredible.

874
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,803
I don't want it to
be this way, but...

875
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:11,421
I understand. I just... want
what's best for all of you.

876
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,628
Brit, I need to apologize.

877
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,287
What I said wasn't cool.

878
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:20,262
I don't want to ruin
our friendship.

879
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:22,303
Any of our friendships.

880
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:27,664
I accept your apology.

881
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,153
Thanks.

882
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,450
(mutters)

883
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:34,652
Um... I guess I'll see
you guys around.

884
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:35,827
Okay.
Bye.

885
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,376
Bye, Finn.

886
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:40,468
Be nice.

887
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,339
Brittany, Brittany.

888
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,647
Your third wish has come true.

889
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:49,021
You wished that by quitting
Glee Club, you wouldn't
hurt anyone's feelings,

890
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,337
and Finn was all
happy and smiling.

891
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:53,004
So...

892
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:54,682
I'm ready for my pot of gold.

893
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,590
Okay, no, my wish
didn't come true.

894
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:00,492
He wasn't smiling
because he was happy.

895
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:02,829
He was heartbroken.

896
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,467
Leprechauns don'exist;
I realize this now.

897
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,912
It would be really cool
if they did, but they don't.

898
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:13,881
Oh, I have one final wish,
Leprechaun.

899
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:17,098
Would you do this whole school
a favor, and just disappear?

900
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,274
(crashing thud)

901
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:26,082
So, anyways, I know this
happened really fast, I figured

902
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:28,140
you might have some questions.
I mean, I got some questions...

903
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,487
Yeah. Um, if we
win, what happens?

904
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:31,937
Do we just move
to Washington?

905
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:33,963
Well, it'd be, you know,
maybe, half and half.

906
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:36,415
But you know, Kurt's gonna
be in college and you know,

907
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:38,950
you're gonna be...
technically an adult, too.

908
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:43,829
You know, on a football
scholarship or... I don't know.

909
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,699
I'm going to need a lot of
help at the tire shop.

910
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:49,029
Like... running it?

911
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,369
Only if that's something
you want.

912
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:53,485
This should be good for all of
us, not just for Burt and me.

913
00:37:53,675 --> 00:37:57,178
But for now, we need
to support your dad.

914
00:37:57,212 --> 00:37:58,551
Pretty quiet over there.

915
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:02,478
I want you to do this, Dad.
But think about the stress.

916
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:05,196
You were just in the
hospital, almost dead.

917
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,567
And Sue's going to make
your life a living hell.
I know she will.

918
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,562
She's gonna have a
field day with this whole
having a gay son thing.

919
00:38:09,596 --> 00:38:11,724
I'm proud of you, Kurt.
Don't care who knows it.

920
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:14,261
And yeah. I almost died.

921
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:16,566
But a thing like that makes
you really realize what matters.

922
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,549
And when things are in
the dumps like this, you
gotta stand up and fight.

923
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,740
Right? You understand.
You taught me that.

924
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:25,679
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
family time. (chuckles)

925
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,575
I just wanted to welcome you
to the race.

926
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:30,806
And in celebration, I brought
you a Breadsticks classic:

927
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,972
The Gutbuster Extreme.

928
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:35,535
It's on me. You know,
I really need to thank you.

929
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,517
Your Burt's Corner last night
was a real wake-up call.

930
00:38:38,543 --> 00:38:40,218
You know, I'd
lost track of why

931
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,695
I wanted to run
in the first place.

932
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,613
And it wasn't about the arts.

933
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:44,985
It was about my sister.

934
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:47,690
So... you... you're not
cutting the arts program?

935
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,886
Sweet Porcelain, so naive.
Of course I'm cutting the arts.

936
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,041
You know what public
school program is the
first to go in a recession?

937
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,507
Special Education.

938
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,523
There are special needs
kids at McKinley,

939
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:00,748
yet there's no special ed
classes, no special ed teacher.

940
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:03,609
I think that might be a better
use of school funds than flying

941
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,732
the Glee Club to New York
without a set list, only to lose

942
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,563
at Nationals with a song they
made up the night before.

943
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,565
Have a good aneurism.

944
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,751
Anyone mind if
I just dig in?

945
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:19,435
Say U2's over-rated.
Say it.
Never!

946
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:21,052
Hey! Leave him alone.

947
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:23,611
Or what, Pigskin? You're gonna
run crying to Mr. Shue?

948
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:24,890
Oh, I'm shakin'.

949
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:26,901
No. Not Mr. Shue.

950
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:28,715
Coach Beiste.

951
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,692
Thanks, Finn Hudson. I've
got no reason to expect you

952
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:42,306
to be nice to me after
I ruined your Glee Club.

953
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,163
I get it. You were just
trying to make friends.

954
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:49,131
I know it's not easy being
the new kid around school,
not fitting in anywhere.

955
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:53,169
And when no one stood
up for you, I should
have stood up for you.

956
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,533
Look, I'll tell you what: I
know you're not a leprechaun,

957
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,690
so, I'll grant you a wish.

958
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:05,467
Awful lot of empty chairs
in here.
This is a disaster.

959
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,540
This is not the way that
senior year of Glee Club
was supposed to be.

960
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:11,176
Look, guys, I know this is
gonna be hard.

961
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,882
This isn't how I pictured
starting out this year, either.

962
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:16,869
Then I guess we've got our work
cut out for us.

963
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:18,739
What happens when the pope dies?

964
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:19,714
Heaven, you'd think.

965
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,583
You get a new pope.

966
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,341
There's always new
talent to be found.

967
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,058
Always a new voice,
right, Mr. Shue?

968
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,267
Well, everybody, I'd like to
introduce my friend

969
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,398
Rory Flanagan. He's interested
in joining Glee Club.

970
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:31,747
Can this kid even sing?

971
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:35,089
I sing at Mass every Sunday,
and I love American music.

972
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,793
If you don't mind, I'd like to
dedicate this song

973
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:40,231
to my family,
who I miss so much.

974
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:43,477
(slow ballad plays)

975
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:53,292
¶ It's time for us to part

976
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:59,444
¶ Yeah, it's best
for us to part ¶

977
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,463
¶ Oh, but I love you

978
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:07,532
¶ Ooh

979
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:11,273
¶ I love you

980
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:18,897
¶ Take care of yourself

981
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,286
¶ I'll miss you

982
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:31,485
¶

983
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:40,224
¶ And no more tears to cry

984
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:45,065
¶ I'm out of good-byes

985
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:46,649
He's magical.

986
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:54,958
(falsetto):
¶ It's time for us to part

987
00:41:54,992 --> 00:42:01,862
¶ Although it breaks my heart

988
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:06,400
¶ Oh, 'cause I love you

989
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:09,042
¶ Ooh

990
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:13,935
¶ I love you

991
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,747
¶ Take care of yourself

992
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:25,965
¶ Take care
of yourself ¶

993
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:30,931
¶ Take care of yourself

994
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,093
¶ I love you.

995
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,779
