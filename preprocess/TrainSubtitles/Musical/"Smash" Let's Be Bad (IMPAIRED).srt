00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:14,823
which reminds me...
I tried breaking the ice

634
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:16,191
with your friend Tom.

635
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:17,742
He's a hoot.

636
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:19,577
What's your problem
with Tom?

637
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:22,864
- He's just so gay.
- Sam, you're gay.

638
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:25,817
- You're gay?
- He's so gay.

639
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,204
I'm not that gay,
just gay.

640
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:30,922
I don't think
I should have to wear a banner.

641
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:34,042
Come on!
Where's your defense?

642
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:35,743
You might want
to wear a banner...

643
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,879
Maybe a little rainbow bracelet
or something.

644
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,681
Anyway,
I'm done playing games.

645
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:41,216
I should just ask Derek
where I stand.

646
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,084
- Please don't.
- Why shouldn't she?

647
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:44,519
Wouldn't you rather know
one way or the other?

648
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,204
- I know I would.
- Yeah, that's it.

649
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:49,024
- I'm doing it.
- Me too.

650
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,425
It was humiliating.

651
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:52,093
First, he had me sing
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

652
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:53,445
in front of everyone.

653
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,430
Then he made me give her
a private lesson.

654
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:57,232
How is that humiliating?

655
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,034
It sounds like he's got
a lot of faith in you.

656
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,785
"Faith" is not exactly
the word.

657
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,705
It's all payback for the first
time I sang it to him.

658
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:06,875
He owes you payback?
For singing <i>Happy Birthday?</i>

659
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:10,045
He's just a piece of work,
and so is that Ivy.

660
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,781
Well, office politics...
You can't escape them.

661
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,451
Oh, come on, my love,
we're gonna be late.

662
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:17,969
Like,
she's a walking bombshell.

663
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:21,139
So maybe I'm not all...
You know, all the time.

664
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:23,058
I'm sorry,
but I wasn't raised that way.

665
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:26,561
I always looked down on girls
who were all about being sexy.

666
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:28,596
It just seemed so desperate.

667
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,316
Oh, I was hoping
you might wear something,

668
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,800
you know, sexier.

669
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:34,819
Did you even hear
a word I just said?

670
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:36,154
Look, cut me a break here.

671
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:37,805
I'm under a lot of pressure
at work.

672
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,607
I'm fighting to get
this promotion,

673
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:41,242
and I don't even know
who I'm up against.

674
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:42,944
What I do know is,
I've got a hot girlfriend,

675
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:45,313
and it wouldn't hurt
to show you off

676

at a big party
on the <i>Intrepid</i> tonight.

Poor Marilyn.

678
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,920
This was what her life
was like every day.

679
00:28:51,954 --> 00:28:54,105
I mean, this is what drove her
to booze and pills, you know.

680
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,790
This is what killed her.

681
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:58,626
Yeah, well, a sexy dress
is not going to kill you,

682
00:28:58,644 --> 00:29:00,678
but I might,
if you don't hurry up.

683

Come on, you know I love you
for your mind.

I'll meet you there.

There are no extra seats
at this table. Sorry.

794
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:47,975
Where do I go... the kitchen,
the West Side highway?

795
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,494
No, it's...
It's just there.

796
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,463

uh, helicopter.

Perfect.

used to smoke a little doob

- Michael!

She said she tried it
once at camp.

810

You are such a liar.

Okay, Leo,

Michael, I am calling you

813

I don't know what happened
to the last one.

Stop laughing.
[Laughs]

815
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:31,702
Yes, hi.
It's 428 Carroll, again.

816
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,738
I'm sorry.
I just assumed he knew.

817
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:37,074
What else does my mom do
after a tough rehearsal?

818
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,076

819

[Door closes]

Well, it's... it's not
on Broadway yet.

822
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:50,204
It's a workshop based
on Marilyn Monroe's life.

823
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:53,341
Are you Marilyn?

824
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,060
Yes, yes.
Yeah, I am.

825
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,562
That's wonderful.

826
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,347
So do they have you
in a little blonde wig

827
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:01,882
- and a skirt that blows up?
- Okay.

828
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,902
Sorry, but, hey,
you wear a dress like that,

829
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:07,388
you got to like it
that we look.

830
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,525
Oh, that's right.
That's why I wore this...

831
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,361
So that men everywhere
could enjoy looking at me

832
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,279
and think
about having sex with me.

833
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,731
- Oh!
- Was that too direct?

834
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:19,233
- That's pretty direct.
- [Laughs]

835
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,736
So is the dress, and we
already know you like that.

836
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,206
- I'm seeing the Marilyn.
- You want to see some more?

837
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,793
Maybe I should sing you
<i>Happy Birthday, Mr. President.</i>

838
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:30,578
Would you like that?

839
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:34,582
How about<i>Happy Birthday,</i>
<i>Mr. Press secretary?</i>

840
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,135
- Press secretary?
- That's right.

841
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:40,805
You're looking at
the next mayoral press secretary

842
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:41,922
of New York City.

843

Really?
Wow.

844
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,445
So, uh, do you work
for the city?

845

Well, not this one
right now... D. C.

to politics?

You sing for me
back at my hotel,

849
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,658
and I buy you room service?

to try.

Tom, I think
it's safe to say

00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,747
that what we just had was in
no way anywhere near "wow" sex.

Oh, my God. Thank God.

I thought it was great sex?

It was terrible sex.

"wow, that was terrible" sex.
