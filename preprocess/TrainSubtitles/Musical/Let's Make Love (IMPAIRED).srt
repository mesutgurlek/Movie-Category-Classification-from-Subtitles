1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,640
Here we sit, and we chatter

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,280
What are we thinkin' of?

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's not make with the patter

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Baby

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,720
Let's make love

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,880
If you roar like a lion

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,560
I could coo like a dove

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,320
If you're sold, begin buyin'

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,720
Baby

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,880
Let's make love

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,640
No, don't turn TV on

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,360
Instead just turn me on

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,120
I light up like neon

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,320
Just a tiny section
of your affection in my direction'll do

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,040
You'll just love my embraces

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,720
Cos they'll fit like a glove

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,360
We'll be off to the races

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,200
Baby

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,760
Kiss me, baby

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's make love

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't just lay there.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
Honey, do something.

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,240
(giggles)

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,280
One of the great fortunes of the world

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,160
began here on the outskirts
of Tours in 17th-century France.

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,680
Jean-Marc Clément was a farmer,
but not a very good one.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,360
Contemporaries state that with fertile land
and plenty of water, he couldn't grow mud.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,760
But he didn't have to. While hoeing
for potatoes, he found a chest of gold.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,920
This is thought to be the origin
of the phrase "lots of potatoes."

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,520
From then on, Jean-Marc farmed money.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,000
In Paris, the second
Jean-Marc was the kind of man

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,760
who could form a syndicate
in an empty room.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
Balloons were the rage of France.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Jean-Marc bought
a balloon factory and prospered.

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,720
He was a completely dedicated man,
interested in balloons of every kind.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,920
He died in 1777,
leaving well over 300,000 francs.

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,160
The cause of death was listed as...
"excessive interest in balloons."

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,520
The third Jean-Marc Clément
just happened to own a cannon factory.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,880
He supplied munitions for the French army.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,560
He was so fair-minded,
people say he supplied the enemy also.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,560
His interests grew and grew,

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,520
until the day the munitions factory blew up.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,960
Unfortunately, it was one of
the few mornings Jean-Marc reported to work.

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,920
He left millions and was
the first Clément to die vertically.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,760
The fourth Clément carried on
the basic traditions of the family,

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,240
which is to say, a prudent marriage
plus a lively interest in balloons.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
This lively interest led to a duel.
The result was officially listed as a tie,

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,600
but Jean-Marc took
a short sabbatical in New York.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,520
While there,
he picked up 800 acres of property.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
It was in the low-rent district
then known as Wall Street.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,440
He returned to the gay life of Paris
and threw his life away.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,440
His indiscretions with rich widows brought in
less than a million francs a year.

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,880
The fifth Clément was
a man who went first-class.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,280
He liked railroads.
By 1855 he owned 43 of them.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,560
And steamships.
He owned a total of 19 different lines.

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,240
His dash for power ended the next year,

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,120
when negotiations for the purchase
of the Atlantic Ocean broke down.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,640
The sixth Clément was pure patriot.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
He pioneered the Statue of Liberty,

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,840
and talked a Mr. Eiffel into building
some sort of sightseeing tower.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,760
At the time, Jean-Marc controlled all the steel
in France. He died in 1890, leaving 400 million.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,280
His son immediately
set out to make money.

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
He'd run across a man who had
some old blueprints in the attic.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,400
The basic patent rights on this notion
brought a good steady income,

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
more than enough
to cover his losses on horses,

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,640
and women, most of whom were courted
on a yacht called "The Harem."

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,480
And of course, there was the old
family devotion to sightseeing towers.

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Jean-Marc put up
700 of them near Waco, Texas.

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,480
He died mysteriously at the age of 91
aboard a yacht, "Harem III."

70
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
After the usual deductions were made,

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,280
he left a fortune estimated
on the foreign exchange mart as $1 billion.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,880
As a guide to those in the audience
who may not have a billion dollars,

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,800
let it be stated that the interest on the interest
on a billion dollars is $70,000 a week.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is the New York office
of the worldwide Clément Enterprises.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
The current Jean-Marc Clément seems
to embody all the traits of his forebears.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,560
Good traits and, cynics point out,
perhaps a few bad ones.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,640
(laughter)

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,520
(French accent) I also like
the one I heard in Paris yesterday

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,520
about the man who taught
his dog to play poker.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,720
But the poor dog was a terrible gambler,

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,480
because every time
he got a good hand, he'd wag his tail.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,160
- So funny!
- Oh, that's marvellous.

83
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
- Oh, that's terrific.
- Goodbye.

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,360
A great storyteller.
And the way he tells a story is certainly...

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
Hi. I'm Coffman,
from Public Relations downstairs.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, yes. The gentleman with the emergency.

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,560
Mr. Wales expects you.

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,600
What emergency concerns Mr. Clément?

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,120
It's this item in the newspaper, sir.
I think you might like to see this.

90
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,120
I read no item in today's newspaper
concerning Mr. Clément.

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,680
This isn't a regular newspaper, Mr. Wales.
This is Variety, the theatrical paper.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,480
How could anything theatrical
concern Mr. Clément?

93
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,560
Would you read that, please?

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,280
Ah.

95
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,360
- Come with me.
- Right.

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,320
- Good morning, George. Feastyour eyes.
- What, more? How much?

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,680
- You don't measure art by money.
- I do.

98
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,360
This is the Meister collection
the Louvre and the National Gallery bid for.

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,040
- You outbid two governments?
- Oh, it was a pleasure.

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
The Renoir will hang in the Paris apartment.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
The Matisse, I think, in the Hong Kong office,

102
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,320
and the Van Gogh...

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Oh, I think it will be perfect on the yacht.

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,240
- How do you do?
- Oh, this is Alexander Hoffman... Coffman.

105
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,080
- Public Relations. Ours.
- How do you do, sir?

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,920
Jean-Marc... Ah.

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
It's something serious.
I can tell by the breathing.

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,600
Somebody's putting on a show,
and you're going to be portrayed in it.

109
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Really? I couldn't be more flattered.

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Listen to this. "Greenwich Village Revue
to caricature celebrities in the Theateround."

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,640
"Some of the public figures up for laughs
are Maria Callas, Elvis Presley, Van Cliburn

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
and Jean-Marc Clément, amongst others."

113
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,920
- You're going to be made ridiculous.
- (scoffs)

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,240
Do you mind if
Coffman leaves us for a moment?

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,280
- Of course not, George.
- Coffman.

116
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
No, no, no.
You'd better go in there. Thank you.

117
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,640
I knew something like this
was bound to happen.

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,960
All those women you take out in public.
This is the result.

119
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm not anxious to take them out in public,
George. They won't stay indoors.

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,320
Jean-Marc, your father's no longer here
to uphold the dignity of your name.

121
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,760
Now, I've put on this young man

122
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,000
to do nothing but keep your name
out of the newspapers.

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,120
I want you to take him seriously.
I want you to start at once.

124
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,480
Very well, George,
and try not to worry so much about me.

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,520
Oh, I've been worrying about you
since your christening at Notre Dame.

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,800
- Wouldn't mind a change at all. Coffman!
- Yes, sir?

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,480
What are you paid for?
Call this good public relations?

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,560
- No, sir.
- I want it stopped, understand?

129
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,880
It's an invasion of privacy.
If you can't stop it, I will.

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,360
- Is that correct, Jean-Marc?
- Absolutely.

131
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,440
Thank you. Run along.

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,120
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Coffman.

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll get on this right away.

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,200
"... by reason that they have agreed
to dissolve their partnership ..."

135
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,680
You may use the private elevator.

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
"Now, therefore..."

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,600
- (secretary) Mr. Coffman?
- Yes?

138
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,440
You'll please return to Mr. Clément's office.

139
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
Yes, sir?

140
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,840
Beautiful, isn't it?

141
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh, yes. Very.

142
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm not especially thin-skinned about some
joke that might be made about me onstage.

143
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,680
But if it's too embarrassing about girls,
that can be serious.

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,320
Sit down.

145
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,120
Would it help if I got the show closed up?

146
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,280
Well, sir, then you run
the danger of getting more bad publicity

147
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
if you do something like that.

148
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, that's possible.

149
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,040
It's a very small theatre, isn't it?

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
Not many people would really
see an off-Broadway show?

151
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,120
Well, if they're successful,
people like Ed Sullivan

152
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,040
often use parts of them on television.

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
Life, Look, Paris Match even, might pick it up,

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,320
especially since they're using your name.

155
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Mm-hm. I may be
more thin-skinned than I suspect.

156
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't seem to relish being laughed at.

157
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,640
- Uh...
- Go on. You've thought of something. Say it.

158
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Well, I don't know if you'd care for this, but...

159
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,360
Would you consider
attending a rehearsal of the show, sir?

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,800
- What would that accomplish?
- It'd take the sting out of anything they do.

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,080
It would be disarming. If you show them
you have a sense of humor,

162
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,400
and can laugh at yourself, then the rest of the
laughter is good-natured. That's my opinion.

163
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,120
- Would they think it odd for me to attend?
- It's perfectly natural.

164
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You've read that you're being depicted in the
show, and have come to see what you're like.

165
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,360
They'd only be flattered. I've been
a press agent in the theatre. I know I'm right.

166
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,960
- Let's go.
- Now?

167
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,840
- They are rehearsing, aren't they?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,160
Time is money,
and I don't like to waste either.

169
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,320
Hmm?

170
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,280
Come on.

171
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,000
- Is this a theatre?
- Theatre-in-the-round, sir. Very informal.

172
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,120
Excuse me.

173
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,440
This is the stage door.

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
(jazz)

175
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,480
(music stops)

176
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,200
(man) These light cues are sure tricky.
You gotta hit 'em just right.

177
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,840
(jazz band strikes up)

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,920
Dip the blue.

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
(breathily) Boys!

180
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,880
My name is Lolita

181
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,480
And... I'm not supposed to

182
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Play... with boys

183
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Moi?

184
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Uh-uh!

185
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,960
Mon coeur est á Papa

186
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,920
You know le propriétaire

187
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,200
(whispers) No!

188
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,680
While tearing off a game of golf

189
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,560
I may make a play for the caddy

190
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,560
But when I do, I don't followthrough

191
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Cos my heart belongs to Daddy

192
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
If I invite a boy some night

193
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,720
To dine on my fine finnan haddie

194
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,680
I just adore his asking for more

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,240
But my heart belongs to Daddy

196
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,120
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy

197
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,320
So I simply couldn't be bad

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,080
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy

199
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,200
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da

200
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So I want to warn you, laddie

201
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,160
Though I know that you're perfectly swell

202
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,440
That my heart belongs to Daddy

203
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Cos my daddy

204
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,680
He treats it so

205
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,960
Ba-da, ba-da,
ba-da-ba-da-ba-da, ba-da-dee-da

206
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,320
Ba da-dee-da, ba-dee-da

207
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,640
Ba-dee-da-dee-da

208
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,760
While tearing off a game of golf

209
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,960
I may make a play for the caddy

210
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,040
But when I do, I don't followthrough

211
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,480
Shoo-ba-doo-ba-doo,
shoo-ba-doo-ba-doo, ooh, Daddy

212
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,880
If I invite a boy some night

213
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,480
To cook up a fine enchilada

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,520
Though Spanish rice is all very nice

215
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,200
Ba-da, ba-da,
ba-da-ba-da-ba-da, Dada, yes

216
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,440
My heart belongs to my daddy

217
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
So I simply... couldn't be bad

218
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Yes, my heart belongs to my daddy

219
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

220
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,320
So I want to warn you, laddie

221
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,560
Though I know you're perfectly swell

222
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,560
That my heart belongs to my daddy

223
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,120
Cos Daddy

224
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,600
My daddy

225
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,280
My little ol' daddy, he treats it so

226
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,520
That little ol' man, he just treats it so good

227
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,720
(man) Lights! All right, kids! Up you get.
That's terrific. Really good. Up you get.

228
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,600
- All those trying out as doubles, onstage.
- Elvis Presleys, Van Cliburns,

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Maria Callases, Jean-Marc Cléments, step up.

230
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Maria Callases over here. That's it. Jean-Marc
Cléments, Elvis Presleys, Van Cliburns...

231
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,560
Coffman.

232
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,440
- Yes, sir?
- Ask her to dinner.

233
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,400
- Dinner?
- Bring her to my place. Eight o'clock.

234
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,160
You're trying out for Clément, aren't you?

235
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,600
Hey, that's very good. Just what you're doing.

236
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,840
- That's just his stupid look.
- Say, now...

237
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
You don't look like anybody.
You can go home.

238
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,920
Come on onstage, fella. You got something.

239
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,560
Come on, Presleys. How about it? Let's go.

240
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,120
Form groups now, of three.
And you girls, you Maria Callases...

241
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,360
- Hey, Coffman.
- Hello.

242
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,480
- Miller.
- Al. What are you doing here?

243
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
You Broadway big shots
aren't allowed below 14th Street.

244
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm not on Broadway any more. I moved
into, um... industrial public relations.

245
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,440
Tighten it up. Cléments, please?
You guys all get together.

246
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,560
Move it. All right, yeah.

247
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,000
- Now, Presleys... Hit it, Elvis.
-- Well, she's my rock 'n' roll mama,

248
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
-- We're rockin' all the time...
- Thank you.

249
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
-- See that chick with the...
- Thank you.

250
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,640
(out of tune)
- I love her eyes, I love her lips

251
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,360
They taste even better than potato chips

252
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,040
Cool it, baby...

253
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,400
- That's enough.
- Excuse me. I am Jean-Marc Clément.

254
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,760
- I wonder if perhaps...
- Say something else. Go ahead.

255
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,560
- I beg your pardon, sir. I'm afraid...
- Listen to him.

256
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,120
It's amazing. I saw Clément in a newsreel.
Hey, you really got him down.

257
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,840
Come over here. I want to see something.

258
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
I want you to stand next to this man here.

259
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,280
That's it. No. You go in the middle.

260
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,920
Like that. That's right.
Well, that's not bad, hey?

261
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,080
- No doubt about it.
- OK. Take him, Kerry.

262
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,560
You in the middle, don't go away.
You two, dismissed.

263
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,760
Now I want to see the Van Cliburns.

264
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,920
- You're really French, aren't you?
- Yes.

265
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,440
Very much so.

266
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
- Been here long?
- I go back and forth.

267
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
My family's rather transatlantic.

268
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,640
That's good for the part.

269
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,400
I hear they're really
gonna make an idiot out of him.

270
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
- Who?
- Clément.

271
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,440
I can't get over the resemblance.

272
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,600
- You're much nicer, of course.
- Thank you. Why do you think so?

273
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,120
All you ever see him doing
is getting in and out of sports cars

274
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,560
- or some girl suing him again.
- You don't like that?

275
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,920
Well, it's all right, but think of what
he could do in this world with all that money.

276
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
I wish I was taking French,
now that you'll be with the company.

277
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,040
- I could practice on you.
- Oh, are you a college girl?

278
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,000
No, night school.
I'm getting my high-school diploma.

279
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,320
- Why are you doing that?
- I got tired of being ignorant.

280
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,440
I never knew what people were referring to.

281
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
I suppose you want to play
Shakespeare and Greek tragedy and...

282
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,120
Oh, no. This is my favorite kind of show.

283
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Um, have you been out of work long?

284
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,560
- Out of... No, I...
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get personal,

285
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,600
but I noticed how you acted before,
pretending you didn't want the job.

286
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
I figured you were pretty desperate.

287
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
You're very observant. I'm...

288
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,920
- What are you knitting?
- I haven't decided yet. Keeps my hands busy.

289
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
Hey, fella. I have to have your Equity card.

290
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,800
- My what?
- You don't have to join Actors' Equity.

291
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,320
- They could list you as a nonprofessional.
- Fine.

292
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,120
- Why don't you do that, Jimmy?
- All right. What's your name?

293
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,240
My name is Jean...

294
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,320
Oddly enough,
my name often startles people.

295
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
Why? What is it?

296
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,440
Alexander.

297
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
- NotAlexander Dumas.
- You know Alexander Dumas?

298
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,600
We had him last term. He wrote
The Three Musketeers. It's a lovely name.

299
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,400
- That happens to be my name.
- OK, Al.

300
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,040
Alexander Dumas?

301
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,120
- What a small world.
- Oh, it's a very common name in France.

302
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,800
I hope you'll help me.
I've never been onstage before.

303
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
- I knew. You can always tell an outsider.
- How?

304
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,440
Mostly the way they look at
girls in rehearsal clothes.

305
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
- How do people in show business look?
- They don't.

306
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,360
A girl can walk around backstage
with nothing on except her goodwill,

307
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,160
and nobody'll even turn his head.

308
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,080
The same girl, fully dressed, walks
down an aisle of clerks in an office,

309
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,280
pinched black and blue.

310
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
What's the matter with you people, anyway?

311
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,240
I think we're normal.
You're the ones in trouble.

312
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,680
I could give you a tip on
how to play Clément, if you're interested.

313
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,920
- Oh, yes, I'm here to learn.
- Try acting with more assurance.

314
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840
By that, I mean
he doesn't have your sensitivity.

315
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,320
Really? But I've always felt
that Clément is a really sensitive man.

316
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,520
- Of course, I don't really know, but...
- Oh, no. I've met those types.

317
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,160
You've gotta be a lot cruder, you know?

318
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,360
I never heard anybody
call Jean-Marc Clément crude.

319
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,720
For instance, a man like you,
you come over to me.

320
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,440
- You're unsure of yourself, yes?
- Well, yes, I suppose...

321
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,640
I mean, it's normal. I'm a girl.
You wonder whether I like you.

322
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,040
You're a little uncertain.
You even look a little nervous.

323
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,160
I wouldn't say I was nervous.

324
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,840
That's OK. I kinda like that in a man.

325
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,280
But when Jean-Marc Clément
comes up to a girl,

326
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,240
as soon as he tells her his name,
he expects her to drop dead with the honour.

327
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,440
Well, they do. I mean, I imagine that...

328
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,160
Sure, but why? Money, right?

329
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,360
I don't know. I imagine
women would find him rather charming.

330
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,600
Charming. Drops them after two dates,
has five others the same week.

331
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,640
Boy, you haven't had
much experience with women, have you?

332
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,680
Well, I like to think I have, but, uh...

333
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,080
If you want to be
this kind of person you characterize,

334
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,080
Clément is nothing but a rich louse.
Now, keep that in mind.

335
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,600
When you get up on the stage, first relax
and keep telling yourself, "I'm a louse."

336
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,760
"I'm a louse. I'm a louse."

337
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
Try.

338
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm... I think you're making
a big mistake, young lady.

339
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
- That's it. That's very good.
- What's very good?

340
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,600
The way you looked down and said "Young
lady." You looked like you had $50 million.

341
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,720
- I did?
- For a second, you looked like a spoiled brat.

342
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm glad to hear you say that.

343
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,640
How about having dinner with me? You are
teaching me so much. I'd like to learn more.

344
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,280
Can't. I only have time for a bite.
I've got geography at seven.

345
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,720
(drunk man singing) - Oh, give me a home...

346
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,360
- Don't tell me he's drunk.
- If he is, he's fired.

347
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Hello, sweetheart.

348
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Tony Danton. That's the kiddie.

349
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,520
Tony Danton.

350
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,480
(screams)

351
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Tony! Tony, are you all right?

352
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,600
Love is a many-splintered thing

353
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,440
- You meshugana!
- I'm sorry, Mandy.

354
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,680
I was just joking around.

355
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,600
Very funny. I just aged ten years.

356
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,920
Well, that's as funny as I can get, cold sober.

357
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,120
Have you got some sort of a parody? We
need a short one to cover a costume change.

358
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,840
- A songwriter at Lindy's did a good one.
- OK, let's hear it.

359
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,160
Well, this is
"The Lament of the... Pop Singer."

360
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,440
Records with gimmicks,
chipmunks and mimics

361
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,440
That's what the future spells

362
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,400
I said to my bosses "Look at my losses"

363
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,440
Gimme a song that sells

364
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,720
Music is dyin', nobody's buyin'

365
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,240
Mule trains are Jezebels

366
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,960
So how can a fella sing "Dardanella"?

367
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,800
Gimme a song that sells

368
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,760
Oh, come on, stop hiding that tune

369
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,240
Don't save all those hits for Pat Boone

370
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,280
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

371
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,840
A song that sells

372
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,000
I got a father to support,
a mother to support

373
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,520
A lazy, loafin'
good-for-nothin' brother to support

374
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,920
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

375
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,360
A song that sells

376
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,800
Funny, but how much does the writer want?

377
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,400
- $75.
- Well, try and pay less. We'll take it.

378
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,040
Kids, if you come across any other
parodies or jokes, bring 'em around.

379
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,360
- We can use a few between scene changes.
- OK, that's all today.

380
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,880
Tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock, on time.

381
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,840
Excuse me.

382
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,160
I have a rather amusing story you may like.

383
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,520
Let's hear it.

384
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,080
It's about a man
who taught his dog to play poker.

385
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,120
But the poor dog was a terrible gambler,

386
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,000
because every time he got a good hand...

387
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,080
- he wagged his tail.
- (all) He wagged his tail!

388
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Don't let that discourage you. New jokes.
Tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock, on time.

389
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
- OK, kill the work lights.
- New jokes!

390
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
See you tomorrow
at rehearsal at 11 o'clock sharp.

391
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,400
They do that to everyone
when they know the joke.

392
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,480
- (Tony) Mandy!
- Thank you.

393
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,840
- You coming?
- Coming.

394
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,640
I'll take that. OK.

395
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,440
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

396
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,040
(up-tempo jazz)

397
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,760
How would they all have known that joke?

398
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,200
People in show business know
the popular jokes, Mr. Clément.

399
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
That's why they buy new ones.

400
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,320
I got the girl's telephone number
from the stage manager.

401
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,120
Sir? I'll try to have her
at your place by eight o'clock.

402
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,320
- I'll try to have the girl...
- No, no, she's got geography.

403
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,640
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

404
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,320
How many hours a day
do these rehearsals usually go on?

405
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,280
All day long, sir. All night, too, sometimes.

406
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,640
When do they have time for, uh...

407
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,640
They make time. No, thank you, sir.

408
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,320
- Of course, there's always Sunday.
- Sunday? This is only Tuesday.

409
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,200
Perhaps she'd be willing to skip a class if
I told her you were Jean-Marc Clément, sir.

410
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm not so sure. She doesn't think
very highly of Jean-Marc Clément.

411
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,080
I never ran into that before. Odd.

412
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,400
I want you to buy me a joke.

413
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,680
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- I want an original joke. Something superb.

414
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,840
I do know one very good comedy writer.
Charlie Lamont. He's rather expensive.

415
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,680
Good. Go to the Investors National Bank.
They'll give you $1,000.

416
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,480
Be at my office tomorrow morning
with a new joke, and be sure it's brand-new.

417
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,520
I never buy anything used.

418
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,520
Excuse me, sir. Just so I'll know, are you
thinking of joining the cast of this show?

419
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,320
Oh, for a few hours, perhaps.

420
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,120
There's no other way.
I certainly couldn't wait till Sunday.

421
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
Are you sure you can think
in here, Mr. Lamont?

422
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,120
For a thousand bucks,
I could think in a coal mine.

423
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,240
I do my best work here. At home I got five
kids. What's the situation? Who is the guy?

424
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,360
A big dress manufacturer.
He's going to make a speech in Miami.

425
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,000
It's gotta be definitely a new joke.

426
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,080
New is easy. Funny is hard.

427
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,000
Could you hurry up? I don't know
if I'll have the strength to deliver it.

428
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,960
- I'm strictly a ski and toboggan man, myself.
- Don't go away. I'm the best.

429
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,560
Even the ghost writers come to me.
I ghost for the ghosts. Now, let's see...

430
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,280
Oh, I'm so glad you like it, sir.

431
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,720
- Quite funny, yes.
- Here's Wilson with his report.

432
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,320
- Good morning, Wilson.
- Morning, sir.

433
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,960
- Begin, Wilson.
- Miss Amanda Dell. Dell is her stage name.

434
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,320
Family name: Delson.
Non-married, American citizen by birth.

435
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,400
- She has...
- (chuckling)

436
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,400
She has occasional escorts but is mostly
seen with Tony Danton, her present costar.

437
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,400
I never imagined
people made up jokes for money,

438
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,920
but I guess
they have to come from someplace.

439
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,520
Am I to understand you're buying jokes?

440
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,320
Oh, just one joke for the rehearsal today.
Proceed, Wilson.

441
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,880
Miss Dell meets another man in private.

442
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,720
- He is not Tony Danton.
- Oh, what did I tell you?

443
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,400
He's evidently married and avoids being seen
with her. They meet at St Timothy's Church.

444
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,920
- Very ingenious.
- Miss Dell enters when the service is over.

445
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,160
- They spend a good deal of time together.
- This time I smell gunplay.

446
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,400
- Good day, Wilson.
- Shall we keep her under surveillance?

447
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,880
- No, I'll tend to that myself, thank you.
- Good day, sir.

448
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,280
- Are you feeling well?
- I feel fine.

449
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,160
Just lost a little weight
getting that joke, that's all.

450
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, Coffman.

451
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,440
The mail, Miss Manners. And cancel
all my appointments for... 24 hours.

452
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,080
She's meeting another man secretly.
Jean-Marc, you're walking into a scandal.

453
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,040
George, you must see her.

454
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,720
She comes down, you see.
Absolutely unbelievable.

455
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,400
Then she comes forward.

456
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,680
What will she do? You don't know.

457
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,240
All of a sudden: "My name is Lolita,
and I'm not supposed to play with boys."

458
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,560
I'll speak to San Francisco.
Yes to number two, no to number three.

459
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,560
George, will you take care
of this London business?

460
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,920
- Anything else?
- I had Cartier send this around.

461
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,760
- Oh, very nice.
- (George) For $10,000, it ought to be nice.

462
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,800
Who is it for? Miss Emerson?

463
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,960
- You asked for something for Miss Phillips.
- Of course. I'll drop it off myself.

464
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,280
Send flowers and a note to Miss Emerson.
I'll do the mail now.

465
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,080
(whistles)

466
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,200
- Good morning.
- Bonjour, monsieur.

467
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,200
To the Cairo office, please.

468
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,440
(speaking in Arabic)

469
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,120
Please, George. Please.
I hate to see you worried.

470
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,080
- I'm much more than worried.
- Oh, don't.

471
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,160
- To the Paris office.
- Oui, monsieur.

472
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,400
Mon cher Dupard, je pense que les licences
d'exportations sont faciles à obtenir.

473
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,880
Aussi je ne vois pas de raisons plausibles...

474
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,080
Tell Captain Swanson I want the yacht ready.
There will be one guest.

475
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,120
Jean-Marc,
I have some important business to see to.

476
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,520
Miss Manners... Miss Manners,
I want you to buy me a pair of old trousers.

477
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,840
Old trousers?

478
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
- Yes. To the Berlin office.
- Jawohl, mein Herr.

479
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,600
Mein lieber Schumann, es hat keinen Zweck...

480
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,000
And an old jacket, too, and a sweater.
Something an actor might wear.

481
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,200
And tell Captain Swanson to have
plenty of paper and pencils on board.

482
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
She might want to do some homework.

483
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,520
Es hat keinen Zweck,
dem Herrn Paff Stahl zu verkaufen,

484
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,320
wenn wir bereits die Gesellschaft besitzen.

485
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,400
Also, mein lieber Schumann...

486
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,720
(jazz)

487
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,200
What do you say, Al?

488
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,800
- Hello.
- Hi!

489
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,600
- Oh, you didn't get any sleep last night.
- I couldn't. That new song kept me awake.

490
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

491
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,600
You looktired.

492
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,920
Hey, you, with the crazy eyes

493
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,400
When you turn 'em on,
I'm gone right up to the skies

494
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,360
Hey, you, with the glowing glimmers

495
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,400
Do they come with dimmers?

496
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Tonight they're as bright as lightnin'

497
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,720
You, with the crazy lips

498
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,480
When we start to kiss like this,
my heart simply flips

499
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,040
Guess I might as well propose

500
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,440
Cos heaven knows
I'm in love with those crazy eyes

501
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,880
You, you, you with the crazy lips

502
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,760
When we start to kiss like this,
my heart simply flips

503
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,720
Guess I might as well propose

504
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,080
Cos heaven knows
I'm in love with those crazy eyes

505
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,760
Knocked out eyes

506
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,400
Kooky eyes

507
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Fractured eyes

508
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,080
Crazy eyes

509
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,160
Yeah!

510
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,920
- Oh, that's marvelous!
- You're doing great, Tony.

511
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,200
OK, let's go. Clear the stage.

512
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,920
- How's the geography?
- Oh, heartbreaking.

513
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,920
Did you know there's four million people
in Haiti, and the average wage is $25 a year?

514
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Imagine. I mean,
two tens and a five for a whole year.

515
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,120
Oh. You're...

516
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,800
- You have relatives in Haiti or something?
- No. I just found out about it, but...

517
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Well, why don't they do something about it?

518
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,280
Why are you smiling?

519
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,480
I just don't know what else to do.
l... Because, um...

520
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,520
Oh.

521
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
"Four-Square Pawnshop."

522
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,520
- Pawnshop.
- Don't be embarrassed.

523
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,840
- Well...
- No false pride. Come on, now. Chin up.

524
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,720
I wonder if you would have a little time
to give me some acting pointers.

525
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,600
I know you could really help me.

526
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Couldn't we have a little dinner tonight?

527
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,600
I can't. I've got a history exam tomorrow.

528
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,400
I've gotta study. I'm very weak in history.

529
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,000
History happens to be
one of my strong points.

530
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll help you with your history
and you help me with my acting.

531
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,840
- But first we'll have a quiet little dinner...
- New is easy. Funny is hard.

532
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,760
- I'm not promising anything.
- Charlie, do me a favor.

533
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
The show needs jokes. Just listen. If you
think of something good, do me a favor.

534
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
- We need jokes, Charlie. I'd appreciate it.
- Like I said, I'll take a look.

535
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,640
All right, hold it! Let's take it
from the opening for Mr. Lamont.

536
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,880
Mr. Burton.

537
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, Mr. Burton, I'd like to offer another joke.

538
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Let it wait until after rehearsal.
Mr. Lamont is a busy man.

539
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,280
- I promise you've never heard this one.
- OK, but make it snappy.

540
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,400
All right, clear the stage.

541
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,280
A man went to a psychiatrist.

542
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,360
Over each ear he had a piece of bacon,

543
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,760
and around his neck
an eight-foot snake for a necktie.

544
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,600
And he had a large television
antenna strapped to his head.

545
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,800
"Doctor," he said.
"I want to talk to you about my brother."

546
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,280
- Not bad. I never heard it.
- But I did!

547
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,880
You dirty crook.
Oh, let me get my hands on him.

548
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,400
- I'll break...
- What's the trouble?

549
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,720
That crook stole a joke that I wrote yesterday
for $1,000, for a dress manufacturer in Miami.

550
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
I don't double-cross my clients.

551
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm suing you for
damaging my professional integrity.

552
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,880
- We can get to the bottom of this in no time.
- Well, you better.

553
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,720
- Where did you get the joke?
- I bought it.

554
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,360
For how much?

555
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,720
- $10.
- $10?

556
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
From whom?

557
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,360
I have to ask you to tell me from whom you
bought this joke, or you're out of this show.

558
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,440
He couldn't have bought it. I just wrote it
yesterday in a Turkish bath. He's a liar.

559
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,280
- Don't throw the word "liar" around so easily.
- You're a liar.

560
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,760
- He bought the joke. I saw him.
- You saw him?

561
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,960
I had dinner at Lindy's last night,
and he was sitting in the next booth,

562
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,240
and I heard him buy it from a man.

563
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,280
Someone stole it and stuck him. It's
happened before. I promise we won't use it.

564
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,680
I'll say you won't use it.
I lost eight pounds on that joke.

565
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Take a break outside, everybody.

566
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,480
I seem to be following you.

567
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,240
- Buttermilk, please.
- For you, mac?

568
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,560
Coffee, black.

569
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,640
I want to thank you, Amanda,
for doing that for me.

570
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,840
- It's all right. It's nothing.
- Oh, I think it was a great deal.

571
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,280
Matter of fact, it's the most touching thing
that has happened to me in a long time.

572
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,040
- Why did you do it?
- Does there have to be a motive?

573
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,440
I rarely see anything done without a motive.
Almost never, Miss Dell.

574
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,440
Thank you.

575
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,480
I feel sorry for you. You must have had
a sad life. What do you do ordinarily?

576
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,520
- Do?
- When you're not imitating Clément.

577
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,920
You can't make a living doing just that.

578
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,120
l... I represent a French company.

579
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,640
I am a salesman.
I have a sample of my company's product.

580
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,800
- Would you care to look at it?
- It's very nice.

581
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,200
It's almost impossible
to tell from the real thing.

582
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,520
That's because we're indoors.
I've got some earrings like that.

583
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,080
In the outside light, though, you can tell
they're fake. How much d'you get for them?

584
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,960
- $5.
- The box looks like it's worth more than that.

585
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,840
Yes, it is. But I wish you'd buy it.

586
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
It's an introductory offer
to advertise the product.

587
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,080
All right. I'll take one to help you out.

588
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,160
Good. You're my first sale today.

589
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,160
May l?

590
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,640
It does shine... indoors, anyway.

591
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,000
It will shine at night, too.
It's a special process.

592
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,200
- What is it?
- Lily, only $5.

593
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,760
- His company's selling them for advertising.
- Just what I need. You got a necklace?

594
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,320
- We don't carry necklaces. We may later.
- OK, I'll take a bracelet.

595
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,920
That's the only sample I had. I'm sorry.

596
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,120
Oh. Tonight's my mother's birthday.

597
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
We'll never be through early enough
for me to get her anything.

598
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,320
- She's still in the hospital.
- Oh, Lily, take mine. I'll get another one later.

599
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,840
No, I don't know when we will get another.
There has been a strike at the factory.

600
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,200
I can wait for mine. You owe him $5.

601
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,080
(stage manager) OK, kids, let's go.

602
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,720
Sorry. Gotta go.

603
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,120
- Your ten minutes is up. Come on, kids.
- Here's your $5.

604
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,360
- Let's go.
- I hope your mother likes it.

605
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,000
My old lady's been dead for ten years.

606
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,520
I'm just nuts about this stuff. When you get
a necklace, show it to me. I may buy it.

607
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,280
I don't think the company'll ever
make necklaces. They'd be too dangerous.

608
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,320
- Dangerous?
- Mm-hm. Too much radioactivity.

609
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,960
Radio what?

610
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,920
These stones have been exposed
to atomic rays. That's why they shine.

611
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,040
A necklace would be too strong.

612
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,000
All those radioactive stones
bunched up around your neck like that...

613
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,760
You don't have to worry about the bracelet.
Just put Vaseline on your wrist every night.

614
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,840
Don't skimp. A thick layer of Vaseline.

615
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,200
Vaseline. Why?

616
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,480
It'll keep your wrist from peeling.

617
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Hey! What kind of jewelry are you sellin'?

618
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,680
Atomic-ray jewelry.
It's a new French company.

619
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,240
Well, they're not gonna
be in business long, making people peel.

620
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,320
You must be crazy.

621
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,240
Yes. We are going
to have to iron that bug out.

622
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,120
Hey, mac, aren't you forgettin' somethin'?

623
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,840
Oh, I beg your pardon.

624
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,000
- He'll pay you.
- Hold it.

625
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,560
Is he all right for 20 cents on your check?

626
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,520
- Yeah, I'll pay it.
- OK.

627
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,480
Thank you.

628
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,360
Ahem.

629
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,800
Harvey, bring me down a list
of all the real estate we own downtown.

630
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,680
I'm interested in whether there might be any
off-Broadway theatres in one of the parcels.

631
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,760
Right away, please.

632
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,240
(sighs)

633
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,880
May l?

634
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,640
You must be tired. How many times
did you do that dance today?

635
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,080
Oh, I lost count. Matter of fact,
sometimes I even trot home afterwards.

636
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,040
- You sleep better. You ever trot?
- You mean in the street?

637
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,440
Sure, nobody minds.
Come on. It keeps you in shape.

638
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,960
- Don't you think it will seem a little odd?
- Come on.

639
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,960
Amanda.

640
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,840
Amanda.

641
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,720
Let's get a taxi. Don't argue.

642
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,840
Please, will you call me a taxi?

643
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,920
Sure. You're a taxi.

644
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,560
The guy who calls the taxis'll be back
in ten minutes. I only park the cars.

645
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,840
- I want to see the manager.
- Come back in three months.

646
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,520
Maybe he'll be out by then,
with good behavior.

647
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,960
Come on. Alex, he's only kidding.

648
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,080
- Sorry. I don't like to be spoken to that way.
- Something the matter?

649
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,840
- No, no. I'm just thinking.
- About what?

650
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
About how happy you are.

651
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,600
- Me, happy?
- Mm-hm. You seem able to forget yourself.

652
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,280
That's the way you dance,
and you walk in the street that way, too.

653
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,680
You seem at home wherever you are.
It must be a great feeling.

654
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,280
Taxi!

655
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,080
- Get in.
- But where are we going?

656
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Uptown. Come on. Oh, can you lend me
a couple of dollars? I'm short.

657
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,280
I don't usually borrow money.

658
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,280
- Thank you.
- Why don't we take a subway?

659
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,760
- It's only 15 cents.
- The subway's too full of people. Here we go.

660
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,840
- Is this definite?
- Uptown.

661
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,800
- Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
- Amanda, you mustn't throw yourself away.

662
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,760
A girl like you could have
everything in the world.

663
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,600
You sound like the men who send invitations
to my room with their chauffeurs.

664
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,920
- Coming from you, it's kind of sweet.
- Amanda, you shouldn't work this hard.

665
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,240
Dear man, you've got a whole wrong idea.

666
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,880
You'll never get anywhere in the theatre
unless you work. When you walk home, work.

667
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,280
Imagine. What would
it be like to lift your finger

668
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,440
and be able to have
anything your heart desires?

669
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,480
What would that be like?

670
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,800
- I can't imagine.
- Well, think.

671
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,600
Let's say you want a limousine. You have it.

672
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,440
A whole building, a girl.

673
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,120
- Not all girls.
- Well, an awful lot, though.

674
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,440
He wouldn't know the difference anyway.

675
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,520
How do you know? Maybe he would.

676
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,520
- One time.
- That's a good idea. You're thinking.

677
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
A man like that, madly in love,
with all that power.

678
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,240
- You see? You're working.
- Oh, I am.

679
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,000
But don't stop now. Keep it up.
He's with a girl. He's saying good night.

680
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,440
- She says "Good night." And...
- And what would he do?

681
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,560
Probably grab for her.

682
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,680
- And what would she do?
- Well, there's your problem.

683
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,880
- Good night.
- Please. You make me feel full of talent.

684
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,840
- Couldn't we work more?
- I can't, not now.

685
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,920
Good night.

686
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,840
Sorry I'm late.

687
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,240
- Have you had supper, Papa?
- Just waiting for you.

688
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,920
Ah!

689
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,080
Probably another one of
those young hoodlums again.

690
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,680
Heavens, they've even got chauffeurs now.

691
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,560
I gotta use the phone, Willie.

692
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,240
- Say, Miller...
- Hi.

693
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,040
- What's going on?
- That's what I wanna know. What's going on.

694
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,680
Freeway Realty? Mr. Osgood, please.
Mr. Osgood? My name is Miller.

695
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,240
I'm general manager for the Theateround. I
just got your letter. There must be a mistake.

696
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,640
You're a real-estate firm. Perhaps you don't
realize this isn't the way theatres are rented.

697
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,320
Well, can't I even see you, sir?

698
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,960
(dial tone)

699
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,600
Gimme a scotch, Willie. They're crazy. They
want a year's rent on the theatre in advance.

700
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,280
Have you ever heard
of such a thing, Coffman?

701
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,000
- Can you get another theatre?
- We waited four months for this one.

702
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,680
We're committed with
contracts, costumes, scenery.

703
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,840
What'll I tell Burton?
He's mortgaged his car, his home.

704
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,680
He's borrowed from everyone. It'll kill him.

705
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,880
I just don't understand it.

706
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,880
I found it, Mr. Coffman. Freeway Realty.

707
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,800
Principal stockholder, Investors National,
which is controlled by Clément Enterprises.

708
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,720
- Anything else I can do?
- No, thank you, Susie.

709
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
Bourbon, please.

710
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,360
Six.

711
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
Doubles.

712
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,000
Somebody once said that rich people
are only poor people with money.

713
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,440
Well, he was lying.
Rich people aren't people, my friend.

714
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,320
Oh, they can be charming, democratic, polite.

715
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,000
You can hardly tell them
from the human beings sometimes.

716
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,640
Just be good and sure you don't cross them.

717
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,200
Sir.

718
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,520
Aha!

719
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,440
- Sit down.
- I will not.

720
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,040
- You've been drinking.
- No surprise to you.

721
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,800
I'm sure your Secret Service department
gave you a complete report on me.

722
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,400
When totally disgusted with the human race,
I become a social drinker. Mr. Clément...

723
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,080
You don't hold your liquor very well.

724
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,200
It's not leaking out anyplace.

725
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,320
And stop trying to interrupt me.

726
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,840
You're very talkative when you drink.
What's this all about?

727
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,440
Who's going to tell you
the truth when he's sober?

728
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,200
You're a very vain man, your majesty.

729
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,640
All those little jokes that
you just kill people round here with.

730
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,960
They didn't go over so big at that theatre,
did they? And how's it going with that girl?

731
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,120
Not so hot, huh, when you haven't
got the old green stuff going for you?

732
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,440
Money, my lord. That's all they
ever kissed when they kissed you.

733
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,880
- I believe you better go now, Coffman.
- Go? I quit.

734
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,720
Just one question, though.
How do you sleep nights

735
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,480
when you close a show, put 40 people
out of work and bankrupt a man,

736
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,640
all because he had the colossal gall to poke
a little fun at the great Jean-Marc Clément?

737
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,560
- Close the show?
- Oh, they'll never prove it in court.

738
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,600
But what a coincidence. You're the
biggest stockholder in Investors National,

739
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,440
which is the biggest
stockholder in Freeway Realty,

740
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,520
which suddenly wants a year's rent
in advance for the theatre.

741
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,960
Quite a coinci-dince! Dence.

742
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,240
I see. George Wales.

743
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,200
He raised me, you see.
He was worried about me.

744
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,880
I know nothing about this, Coffman.

745
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,440
Come here.

746
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,840
Oh, come, now. I listened to you politely.

747
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,280
Sit down.

748
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Sit down.

749
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,560
You're making one mistake. Very important.

750
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,400
It is true that people laugh too loudly
at my jokes because I am rich.

751
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,600
I know that.

752
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,360
But what can I do? I like to tell jokes.

753
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,640
Shall only poor people tell jokes?

754
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,440
It is also true I give out many bracelets.

755
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
But I must. They expect bracelets.

756
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,080
You say I am vain.

757
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,960
No. If I were vain,
I would refuse to give bracelets.

758
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,800
I would say "You must love me
for my charming smile."

759
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,960
But is it ever possible
to love a rich man for his mind?

760
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,400
Look, you... yourself.

761
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,080
Whenever you speak to me,
you say "Sir, sir, sir, sir."

762
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,320
You respect me so much, Mr. Coffman?

763
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,800
Obviously not. It is my money you salute.

764
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,240
- That is true, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

765
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,320
But of course. It is always true...
excepting one person.

766
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,080
Only that girl has ever spoken to me.

767
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,200
Not to my money, not to my name, but to me.

768
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,840
And I do not intend to lose her.

769
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,920
Oh, I hope you don't.

770
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,200
Oh, I deeply hope you don't.

771
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,360
There is a job here, for an honest man.

772
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,840
Thank you, sir.

773
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,760
- I wasn't addressing your money that time.
- I'll see you in the morning.

774
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,080
And...

775
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,840
For your wife,
to forgive me for keeping you so late.

776
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,720
Don't tell me I'm buying your approval.

777
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,200
I am, but one can only give
what one has, and I give you that.

778
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,960
Get in early. There will be a lot to do.

779
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,360
I want my wife to be wonderful. I have to find
a way to put a lot of money in that show.

780
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,720
Your wife?

781
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,640
Hey, there, now.

782
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,400
So when Mr. Welsh here mentioned
that he'd like to invest in a show,

783
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,120
I said to myself, "I've seen part
of Burton's show. It's very good."

784
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,480
So as long as he has
the bug to take a flyer anyway,

785
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,040
why, I thought I'd bring you two together.

786
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,960
I'm flattered you liked the show enough
to recommend your friend put money in it.

787
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,960
But I'm not sure
we can use any additional money.

788
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,800
- Is that so?
- Yes. We're fully financed.

789
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,920
However, there may be —

790
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,400
I'm just saying there may be —
some small share of backing still open.

791
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,200
I'll have to go over the books.
And if there is, well, you can have it.

792
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,200
- That's very kind of you.
- May I speak frankly?

793
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,000
- Yes, of course. Go right ahead.
- I like you.

794
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,760
I like the notion of a retired merchant like you
being interested in show business.

795
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,440
- That's why I'm letting you in.
- I see.

796
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,280
Now, may I speak frankly?

797
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,720
- Go right ahead.
- Thank you.

798
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,280
I've been horse-trading across a desk
like this for the last 30 years,

799
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,160
and I don't think I've ever come across
anyone quite as bad at it as you.

800
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,440
- You're just awful.
- I beg your pardon?

801
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,120
Let me give you a sample of frankness.

802
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,640
Not only aren't you fully financed, Mr. Burton,

803
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,680
but you have to get together
a year's theatre rent in advance.

804
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,680
You foolishly mortgaged your home
and you can't raise any more money.

805
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,560
If I waited ten days, I could get your theatre
for nothing and probably your house as well.

806
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,160
That's frankness. Please close your mouth,
young man. Thank you.

807
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,520
Now, then, because I like you,

808
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,240
I'm prepared to finance your show
entirely and take only 51 percent.

809
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,960
Then you'll have control.

810
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,360
Of course. I never put money
into anything unless I have control.

811
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,280
I urge you to accept this offer,
Mr. Burton. It's very generous.

812
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,920
You wanna know something? It is.

813
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,360
- You're smarter than I thought, Mr. Burton.
- I'll read it after I sign it.

814
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,880
I've got 51 percent of the show.
Complete control.

815
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,960
(jazz)

816
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,800
(wolf whistle)

817
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,400
Hold it, kids! Hold it. Hold it, kids.

818
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,680
Gather round, everybody.

819
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,960
- Which one's the bride?
- She's not around.

820
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,640
I can't believe it. I didn't think
he'd ever get married. I'd given up.

821
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,600
- (grunts)
- What?

822
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,640
(Burton) Now gather in.
And you, come on in. You.

823
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,120
Ooh. There'll be children. Lots of children.

824
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,760
There's a bonus in this
for you if they get married.

825
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,720
- Double if there's a baby. A boy.
- I'll do whatever I can, sir.

826
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,360
I know you've heard the rumour
that I've been having money troubles.

827
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,360
Well, it was true. Wastrue.

828
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,080
I have here a cashier's check for
more than enough money to open this show.

829
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,560
I won't tell you how much because
you'll come around asking for raises.

830
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,240
I would like to introduce my new partner,

831
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,360
George Welsh, a retired merchant
interested in show business.

832
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,120
Mr. Welsh, your grateful company.

833
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,360
- Clear the stage.
- That doesn't mean anything, sir.

834
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,640
People in show business always throw their
arms around each other. They're exuberant.

835
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,960
Why can't she be exuberant
with Jean-Marc, for heaven's sake?

836
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,520
- "Specialization."
- Let's take it from the bridge, boys.

837
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,640
This is the number he was hired for, sir.
Now we'll see it.

838
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,560
-- Marc Clément
-- Ooh, ooh, ooh

839
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,000
-- Gives the gals the tremens
-- Ooh, doo-doo-doo

840
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:27,680
-- This Casanova sure has the rovin'est eyes
-- Ooh, doo-doo-doo-da

841
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,000
Specialization

842
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,600
Specialization

843
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,080
You'll rule the barnyard if...

844
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,560
Hold it! Hold it! You know what might
be cute if it didn't spoil the mood?

845
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,240
When she sings about him,
let him go "Cock-a-doodle-doo."

846
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,280
Yeah, that's very funny, Oliver.
Go on. Go "Cock-a-doodle-doo."

847
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,800
- Go on.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.

848
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,480
No, no, no, no. Like a real rooster,
you know? Cock-a-doodle-doo!

849
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,560
Like that.

850
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,360
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

851
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,320
- Again.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

852
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,000
No, louder. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Like that.

853
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,520
- Like that?
- Yeah.

854
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,360
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

855
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,160
Very good. We'll keep it in.
Practice that at home.

856
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,560
Get your costumes on and we'll try
the whole number from the top.

857
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,920
(stage manager) Dress rehearsal.
All doubles onstage. Come on, kids, let's go.

858
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,800
- Let's pick up on the cues faster.
- "Specialization."

859
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,120
(piano)

860
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,520
If you peruse the people in the news

861
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,560
The people that the magazines refer to

862
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,680
You'll find that they are naturally soigné

863
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,280
The special ones that all of us defer to

864
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,960
They've each a trait
that seems to state "first-raters"

865
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:01,000
Which separates them
from the small pertaters

866
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,400
-- Maria Callas
-- Ooh, doo-doo-doo

867
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,080
-- Is booked in Dallas
-- Ooh, doo-doo-doo

868
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,200
The carpet's rolled out
and they're sold out clear to the sky

869
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,640
Doo-be-doo-da

870
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:22,480
- Specialization

871
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,480
They'll love your high notes if

872
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,560
(sings high notes)

873
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,080
If you specialize

874
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,240

-- Ooh, doo-doo

875
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,920
-- Each critic notates
-- Ooh, doo-doo

876
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,520
It may look funny
but the money is what it supplies

877
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,520
Ooh, doo-be-doo-da

878
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,240
Specialization

879
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,480
Specialization

880
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,480
You'll meet the Colonel if

896
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,520
-- Caused us a high burn
-- Ooh, doo-doo-doo

897
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,080
While we were blushin'
some Russian gave him a prize

898
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,120
Ooh, doo-be-doo-da

899
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,080
-- Specialization
-- Da, da

900
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,600
Specialization

901
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,200
They'll give you medals if

902
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,160
-- They'll love your high notes
- (sings high notes)

903
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,000
-- You'll meet the Colonel
- (- Elvis-style guitar lick)

904
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,600
You'll rule the barnyard

905
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,280
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

906
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,720
If you specialize

907
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,560
I specialize.

908
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,640
Jean-Marc Clément a rooster.
His father's turning in his grave.

909
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,440
You're damn right it's no good.

910
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,720
I didn't count on looking that ridiculous.

911
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,800
He's got all the jokes
and I'm going "Cock-a-doodle-doo."

912
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,200
Well, you take his jokes
and let him go "Cock-a-doodle-doo."

913
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,440
- How about firing him?
- No, no. That would upset her.

914
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,640
You'll never impress her
by being a rooster unless she's a chicken.

915
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,720
You know, there are
definite ways to attract women.

916
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,400
When you're ten years old, they like it
if you walk on your hands for them.

917
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,280
When they're older, they like other things,
best of all if you're rich.

918
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,120
Jean-Marc, tell her who you are.
You'll be engaged within 15 minutes.

919
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,000
Or perhaps that's just what you're afraid of.

920
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,160
Perhaps I am, a little.

921
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,640
Nobody's loved for themselves alone.
You're loved for what you can do.

922
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,760
Now, then, if she could see you as I have,

923
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,240
holding the floor at
a director's meeting for an entire afternoon,

924
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,640
trying to persuade a nervous $10 million to
invest in a project, then she'd be impressed.

925
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,880
She might even fall
in love with you. That's you.

926
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,120
No, George, that is my power. That is five
generations of money. That is a billionaire.

927
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,560
But it is not me,
and this girl I want to fall in love with me.

928
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,000
Well, at the moment she's admiring
Tony Danton, she's kissing him,

929
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,960
and there's no big mystery
about human attraction.

930
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,320
She'll go on admiring him and
kissing him and they'll fall in love.

931
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,520
And you, with a billion dollars, can go cock
your doodle doo till you growfeathers.

932
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,560
Every man to his own battlefield, my boy.

933
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,160
On this one, you haven't got a prayer.

934
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,080
- Unless... Unless I get stronger ammunition.
- What do you mean?

935
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,040
It's only bought for him.
People write his jokes,

936
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,520
and not the best because
that show can't afford the best.

937
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,080
But I can. Do you have
any ideas or suggestions?

938
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:37,480
Not offhand... Oh, well, we do own
a large block of stock in NBC, don't we?

939
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,600
Now, let me think. Our two men
there are Comstock and Yale.

940
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,840
They both hold key positions on the board.

941
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,840
- Tell them I want a teacher.
- What?

942
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,800
Tell them to get me
the greatest comedian in the world.

943
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,240
That's flattering, but I can think of
greater comedians than myself.

944
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,000
For instance, there's, uh... There's, um...

945
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,400
Oh, uh... You know, maybe you're right.

946
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,080
Mr. Berle, I want you to
give serious consideration to my offer.

947
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,520
Oh, I have. This is
a very, very generous offer,

948
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,600
but Mr. Comstock and Mr. Yale will tell you
I'm under a long-term contract at the network.

949
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,600
Oh, that's all right, Milton.

950
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,920
Clément Enterprises
has a large block of shares in NBC.

951
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,240
I see. Well, sir, this is
a very, very fantastic figure.

952
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,600
At first, I didn't know if it was what you were
gonna pay me or my Social Security number.

953
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,800
Well, Mr. Berle, can you do the job?

954
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,080
Sir, it's all according
to how funny you're talking about.

955
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,160
Are you talking about
ha-ha funny or ha-ha-ha-ha funny

956
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,760
or hardy-har-har funny?

957
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:54,680
Now let me show you first my comedy walk.
It's a very big scream. My ankle bit.

958
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,480
See, I stand up and
I walk around on my ankles.

959
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,480
Now stand up, sir,
and let me show you how to do it.

960
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,440
- Now you gotta turn your ankles...
- Mr. Berle, Mr. Berle, I am not your pupil.

961
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,200
- You're not the gentleman I'm to teach?
- No.

962
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,200
- Well, then, who is?
- Jean-Marc Clément.

963
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,400
That's fine. That's better.
A little broader. Fine.

964
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,520
Now turn around the other way. You're doing
great, sir. That's it. Wonderful, wonderful.

965
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,640
- The worst thing I have ever seen.
- Am I doing something wrong?

966
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,640
Oh, no. You're doing it swell, but you have
to exaggerate more, sir. Watch me again.

967
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,160
Doh... doh... doh... doh.

968
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,760
You understand?
You say those words as you do it. Go ahead.

969
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,160
Doh... doh...

970
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,200
Doh... doh...

971
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,400
You sound as if "doh" doesn't mean
anything to you. And it probably doesn't.

972
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,680
Can you show me
something a little more sophisticated?

973
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,480
Sophisticated. Let's see.

974
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,960
I have it, baby... Pardon me.
Mr. Clément, I have it. I have a great idea.

975
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,960
- Sophistication you want?
- Yes.

976
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,240
This is gonna be great. You walk
out onstage very sophisticated-like.

977
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,880
Very debonair, suave,
classy, with dignity and charm.

978
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,840
And you stand there. You look
at the audience for a brief second.

979
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,080
And then you walk around like this.

980
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,080
The audience will scream. They'll scream.

981
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,400
Mr. Berle, I'd rather not.
This is more you than me.

982
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,320
I have... Oh, boy.
I have a gag that I always do.

983
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,800
It's dynamite. The best thing I've ever done.

984
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,160
Is this material original?

985
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,240
- Original?
- Mm-hm.

986
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,160
Forget it. We'll try something else.
Um... Let's see.

987
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,440
Oh, I have... I have a joke.

988
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,960
When I do it on television,
40 million Americans scream at this.

989
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,840
Here's the line. You listen.

990
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,840
(exaggerated accent) "I swear I'll kill you. I'll
kill you a million times." You like that?

991
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,800
- Yes.
- He likes that. Will you try it?

992
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,240
"I'll swear I'll kill you.
I'll kill you a million times." Say it. Go ahead.

993
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,960
- (whispers)
- That's it. Now say it.

994
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,280
I swear I'll kill you.
I'll kill you a million times.

995
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,240
- I'm sick.
- Sick?

996
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Yeah. Sick from laughing at you
cos you're great. Great.

997
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,320
Oh, you're very kind, Mr. Berle,
but I don't think I did it right.

998
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,320
Come on, Mr. Clément. You're wonderful.
Are you gonna listen to your Uncle Milty?

999
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:43,320
You're great. You're wonderful, but there's
only one little thing. It isn't the word "kill."

1000
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:47,400
It's "kiw." "Kiw." Let me hear you say it.

1001
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,480
- Kill.
- No, it's "kiw."

1002
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,560
- Kill.
- No, you have to purse your lips. May I...?

1003
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,080
- Please.
- Kiw.

1004
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,280
- Kill.
- Not "kill." Relax, relax.

1005
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,160
- Kiw.
- Kill.

1006
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,760
- No, the L is silent. Say "kiw."
- Keel.

1007
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,880
- Oh, no. Not "keel." No. "Kiw."
- Kee.

1008
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,800
- Kiw. Kiw.
- Kee. Kee.

1009
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,840
- No. Kiw. Kiw.
- Kill. Kill.

1010
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,360
Get the L out.
I mean, don't pronounce the L. Kiw.

1011
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,560
- Kill.
- No, a little... You gotta go "kiw."

1012
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,640
Kiw.

1013
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,680
Kill.

1014
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,960
Forget it. We'll try something else.

1015
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,720
This is murder.
What kind of a job did you give me?

1016
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,160
- Oh, I'm afraid it's useless.
- What do you mean? I'll make you so funny,

1017
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,800
your only problem will be to get her
to stop laughing long enough to have babies.

1018
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,480
No. Uh... show me what
I can do with a woman.

1019
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,760
After what I read,
I'm sure you can show me.

1020
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,360
No, I mean, something comical.
Something... something funny.

1021
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,040
Oh, I thought you meant...
What you can do with...

1022
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,160
I have it. I have a great boy-and-girl bit.
Boy-and-girl bit. Let's step down here.

1023
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,600
Look, in this scene, I'll be the girl
and you be the boy. Understand?

1024
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,960
- Yes.
- You're on a corner waiting for your girl.

1025
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,760
Ad-lib like you're impatient. "Where
is my girl? She's supposed to be here."

1026
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,320
I'll be the girl.
I'll go by the door and do it, OK?

1027
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,400
- OK.
- All right. Let's try it.

1028
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,360
Turn around. Face the audience.
That's the first thing you gotta learn.

1029
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,120
Look at the audience. Go ahead.
Now start. Look at your watch.

1030
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,080
(stilted) Where is she?
She's supposed to meet me here.

1031
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,600
Oh, she's late again.

1032
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,520
That's very good.
Remember, now, I'm the girl. I'm the girl.

1033
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,560
(feminine voice) Hi.

1034
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,640
I'm coming on.

1035
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,600
And 40 million Americans call you Uncle?

1036
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,120
(up-tempo Latin jazz)

1037
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,280
- Milton Berle's here.
- Right this way, Mr. Berle.

1038
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,880
- Milton Berle's here. Milton Berle's here.
- Uncle Milty.

1039
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,120
Hold it, hold it.

1040
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,840
- Mr. Berle to see you, Mr. Welsh.
- Thank you. Hi, Milton.

1041
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,680
Hiya, Georgie.
I didn't mean to stop the rehearsal.

1042
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,880
- Do you know Mr. Coffman?
- How do you do?

1043
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,560
- Hello.
- This is my producer Oliver Burton.

1044
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,920
- Glad to meet you, sir.
- I'm happy to meet you.

1045
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:51,040
I had no idea Mr. Welsh knew
any prominent theatrical people.

1046
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,520
Georgie? You must be kidding.
One of my first sponsors... on radio.

1047
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,920
- Watch a bit of the rehearsal.
- I'd be glad to.

1048
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,080
We rarely get advice from people like you.

1049
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,000
Oh, I just dropped by
to pay my respects to ol' Welshy boy here.

1050
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,800
By the way, as I was coming in just now
I saw your comedian rehearsing.

1051
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,560
Wonderful. I stopped to listen.
Professional curiosity, you know.

1052
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,560
Boy, he was doing a funny routine.

1053
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,400
Mr. Burton, you have
a great comedian on your hands.

1054
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,080
Mr. Berle, you don't know what that means to
us, to have someone like you compliment us.

1055
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,680
Get Tony. He can use the encouragement.

1056
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,680
Tony! Tony Danton!

1057
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,880
Come on, fellas, clear the stage.

1058
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,440
Yeah, here I am.

1059
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,040
- That's not him.
- It's not?

1060
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,640
- Tony, I want you to say hello to Mr. Berle.
- Hi, Tony.

1061
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,680
- Hello, Mr. Berle.
- I just wanted you to meet him.

1062
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,680
There's the fellow.

1063
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,120
- Him?
- That's the one, right there.

1064
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,040
(Burton) Oh, you. Come here, will you?

1065
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,640
No, I mean you. Yes, you.

1066
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,560
- What's the matter?
- Were you rehearsing out there?

1067
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,680
Oh, that. Just a little skit I put together
for a surprise party we're giving a friend.

1068
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,160
- It's not very funny.
- Milton Berle thinks it's funny.

1069
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,440
Milton...

1070
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,960
- Why, really, Mr. Berle?
- Yes, I think it was just wonderful.

1071
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,880
You're underestimating yourself, kid.

1072
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,600
Why don't you
do the routine for the gentlemen?

1073
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,600
- Oh, no.
- All right, clear the stage.

1074
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,680
(stage manager) Clear the stage, OK, fellas?

1075
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,920
Do the subway routine that I taught you.
It's the best bit that you do.

1076
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,680
May l?

1077
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,520
I'd like to give my impression of a man
going to work in the morning on the subway.

1078
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,720
He's great, great. Watch.

1079
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,480
Whoosh!

1080
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
He's beautiful.

1081
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,560
(scattered laughter)

1082
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,120
(laughter increases)

1083
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,880
Where is she? She's supposed
to meet me here. Oh, she's late again.

1084
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,920
(scattered laughter)

1085
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,640
(laughter)

1086
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,560
Oh, beautiful. Beautiful.

1087
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,640
How funny.

1088
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,720
Never seen it in my life!

1089
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,760
They'll ask you
to sign for the run of the play.

1090
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,600
- What's that?
- To stay with the show as long as it runs.

1091
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,800
But you're entitled to more money.

1092
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,720
- Hey, you were good.
- Really?

1093
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,440
Well, I gotta run along.

1094
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,600
- Very good, son. Lots of luck.
- Thank you, Mr. Berle.

1095
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,480
Welshy, old boy. Bye-bye.
My regards to the family.

1096
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,920
- I will. Yes, yes.
- So long.

1097
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,880
So long, kids. Happy show.

1098
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,960
(actors call out goodbyes)

1099
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,520
- We have to sign him right now.
- Certainly.

1100
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,400
- What's his name?
- I don't know. Al. Alphonse, I think.

1101
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,600
Oh, fella? Step over here, will ya?

1102
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,920
I'll ask for a $100 raise.

1103
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,080
I wouldn't dare ask
for more than 30, but go ahead.

1104
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,160
Don't be shy.

1105
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,000
- Nobody talk. Let me handle this.
- Yes, sir?

1106
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,120
- That wasn't bad.
- Thank you, sir.

1107
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,800
Say, I'm sorry, but what is your name?

1108
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,800
Dumas. Alex Dumas.

1109
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,400
You don't say.
Well, Alex, I think we can use your bit.

1110
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,600
I'm not promising. We may be over length.

1111
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,080
- Kerry, I wanna give Dumas a $10 increase.
- Very well, sir.

1112
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,480
- Have him sign the run-of-the-play contract.
- Right.

1113
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,560
Not bad, eh, Alex?

1114
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,400
A $10 jump.

1115
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,000
I don't think that's enough, Mr. Burton.

1116
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,960
I wonder if I heard you right.

1117
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,720
- I think so.
- I don't.

1118
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,800
Well, I'd like $50 more.

1119
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,720
Where did you get that absurd idea?

1120
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,040
- Milton Berle was laughing.
- He was just being polite.

1121
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,120
Now, look, Dumas.
You're new in show business.

1122
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,000
A $50 raise is unheard of. Ask anybody.

1123
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,320
I would like $50 more.

1124
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,480
It's out of the question.
Here. Amanda, tell him, will ya?

1125
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,320
He wants a $50 raise. Come over here, dear.

1126
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,160
You don't realize, Dumas.
This isn't a big business. You can't expect...

1127
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,440
I'm offering him a $10 raise. Isn't that fair?

1128
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Don't ask me. I'm not a...

1129
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,880
Honey, the fella's just beginning.
This is his first big part.

1130
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,200
He's getting a terrific opportunity.

1131
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,200
l... I know, but, well...

1132
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,800
Well, he only got the part
because he happens to look like Clément.

1133
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,040
That's not such an opportunity.

1134
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,600
- Did you tell him to ask for 50?
- Uh... no. Um...

1135
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,840
- But 40 is a...
- You lost your mind? 40?

1136
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,160
There's no need to shout at her.

1137
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,720
Don't tell me
how to run my company, will ya?

1138
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,880
You've no right to talk to her that way.

1139
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,160
- Will you take $10 or won't you?
- I certainly will not.

1140
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,000
Then you're fired. Please leave this theatre.

1141
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,200
- Am I fired?
- What? No.

1142
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,800
- What?
- He's a partner. He likes me.

1143
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,480
- I like him.
- See?

1144
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,480
Well, I don't. I want him
out of the show. Get outta here.

1145
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:50,240
Your 49 percent wants him out of the show
but my 51 wants him in, so he stays in.

1146
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,240
I'll settle the money question.
Come with me, young man.

1147
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,200
- What do we do now?
- I get a $50 raise.

1148
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,440
- When excited, you're just like your father.
- And she gets a $50 raise.

1149
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,720
What for? What's the purpose of that?

1150
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,800
Écoutez. L'incident est clos.

1151
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,600
Same sentence his father used to use.

1152
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,360
He gets a $50 raise and she gets a $50 raise.

1153
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,680
What? What for?

1154
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,760
Écoutez. L'incident est clos.

1155
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,480
- Start the rehearsal.
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,760
OK, Amanda, you wanna
get to wardrobe for "Let's Make Love"?

1157
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,440
Dress rehearsal. "Let's Make Love."

1158
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,120
May I help you?

1159
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,880
Boy, you sure got
a lot of different sides to your character.

1160
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,480
Oh, the gentle art of conversation

1161
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,480
Is deader than the Dead Sea Scrolls

1162
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,880
We've become the mutest kind of nation

1163
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,000
We're uncommunicating souls

1164
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,240
No one talks, no one talks

1165
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,760
It's something we seldom ever do

1166
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,720
No one talks, no one talks

1167
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,480
No one talks but... you

1168
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,760
Here we sit and we chatter

1169
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,040
What are we thinking of?

1170
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,560
Let's not make with the patter

1171
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,640
Baby

1172
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,360
-- Let's make love
-- My, oh, my, but it's stifling

1173
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,800
If you roar like a lion

1174
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,200
I could coo like a dove

1175
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,360
If you're sold, begin buyin'

1176
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,640
Baby

1177
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,360
-- Let's make love
-- Gosh, it's hot

1178
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,760
No, don't turn TV on

1179
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,000
Instead just turn me on

1180
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:33,200
I light up like neon

1181
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:38,360
Just a tiny section
of your affection in my direction will do

1182
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,960
Ooh

1183
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,800
You'll just love my embraces

1184
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,080
Cos they'll fit like a glove

1185
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,280
We could get down to cases

1186
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,360
Maybe

1187
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,600
Kiss me, baby

1188
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,240
Let's make love

1189
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,080
Plan some moonlight trips with me

1190
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,240
Come to grips with me

1191
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,200
Lips to lips with me, do

1192
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:42,840
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
you'll just love my embraces

1193
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,200
Cos they'll fit like a glove

1194
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,400
We could get down to cases

1195
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,640
Maybe

1196
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,240
Kiss me, baby, let's make love

1197
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,880
-- My, oh, my, but it's warm here
-- Let's make love

1198
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,720
-- I sure wore a tight collar
-- Let's make love

1199
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,840
I may need a salt tablet

1200
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,400
Do you know a good doctor?

1201
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,800
Let's

1202
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,880
Make love

1203
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,920
If you're getting anywhere,
my boy, it's much too slow.

1204
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,360
I feel it. I know it.

1205
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,960
I could learn to sing, and that will do it.

1206
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,560
He could be right. Between comedians
and singers, women always go for singers.

1207
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,360
I know. When I was younger,
I played Broadway shows.

1208
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,560
Some romantic baritone would come along,
and the girls would start breathing hard.

1209
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,120
Boy, if I had my life
to live over again, I'd be a singer.

1210
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,560
You want another teacher? I'll call one.

1211
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,320
- But the best.
- The guy that I have in mind is the greatest.

1212
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,440
Hello, operator?

1213
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,560
Good morning, Mr. Crosby.
Mr. Clément's expecting you.

1214
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,640
Will you step this way, please?

1215
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,800
Uh, give me a little run
on the piano there, Walter.

1216
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,880
Écoutez. Commencons.

1217
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,560
I'm susceptible to stars in the skies

1218
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,440
I'm susceptible to stars in the skies

1219
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,760
No, take that dip. That's where the money is.

1220
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,280
I'm susceptible to stars in the skies

1221
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,760
Let me hear it.

1222
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,920
-- I'm susceptible to stars in the skies
- Nice.

1223
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,800
I'm incurably romantic

1224
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,880
-- I'm incurably romantic
- Oh, no. "Romantic" is a very big word.

1225
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,080
Lay on it. Baste it with a lot of schmaltz.

1226
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,120
I'm incurably romantic

1227
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,160
I'm incurably romantic

1228
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,240
That's good. That's fine.

1229
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,640
-- Romantic, buh-ba-buh-ba...
- Oh, no.

1230
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,520
Don't do that around here.
You'll get arrested, now.

1231
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,240
If they're told to me all covered with sighs

1232
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,800
The wildest of lies seem too easy

1233
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,120
Run it all together like that. Keep it moving.

1234
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,320
- The whole thing.
- The breath?

1235
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,520
You and I will know you're out of breath,
but she'll think it's very sexy, you see?

1236
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,600
Let me hear it.

1237
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,120
If they're told to me all covered with sighs

1238
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,320
-- The wildest of lies
- Now a big breath.

1239
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,880
-- Seem true
- Oh, that's reeking with sex, believe me.

1240
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,400
Each time a lovebird sings

1241
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,120
See, that's showmanship.
Keeps her mind off your voice.

1242
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,400
- Each time a lovebird sings

1243
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,400
- (whistles) Can you whistle?
- Yes, but...

1244
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,400
It might be too tricky.
It might summon a lot of wild fowl.

1245
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,440
-- I have no defenses
-- I have no defensget youes

1246
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,600
-- My heart is off on wings
-- My heart is off on wings

1247
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,200
Along with my senses

1248
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,880
I'm a setup for the moon when it's bright

1249
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:07,040
-- I'm incurably romantic if they're told to...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1250
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,080
Better rest. Save your voice.

1251
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,080
(whistles)

1252
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,520
I hope you kiss better than you can sing,
or you're out of business.

1253
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,000
- No good, huh?
- If we could get you to move or dance...

1254
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,200
- Do you dance?
- No.

1255
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,600
You don't dance, huh?

1256
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,320
Wait a minute. I think I can swing it for you.

1257
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,840
If I can catch this guy, boy, you're a cinch.

1258
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,520
(piano)

1259
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,680
- Right, Mr. Kelly?
- Well, uh, the feet are right, Mr. Clément.

1260
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,480
- But we'll have to work on the style.
- Style.

1261
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,560
You'll have to, uh...

1262
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:56,080
I should say... Look, you must
express yourself the way an actor does.

1263
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,360
- Actor?
- Yes.

1264
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,320
You see, a dancer expresses
with his body what an actor does with words.

1265
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,360
- It's not just the feet.
- Right.

1266
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,120
This dance is what?
It's romance. It's a courtship.

1267
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,480
You have to say that
with your body. You have to...

1268
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,280
You say "Darling, I love you."

1269
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,920
- I see.
- You see, you must think that as you dance.

1270
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,000
Good. I'll try it.

1271
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,480
- Darling...
- Yes?

1272
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,640
- I love you.
- Good.

1273
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,720
Oh, darling.

1274
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,400
I'll try again.

1275
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,400
Darling...

1276
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,640
(hums)

1277
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,400
(man) On the double, everyone.
Over to the piano. Good news.

1278
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,560
(second man)
We're gonna run through a new number.

1279
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,640
Come on, kids. Let's go.

1280
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,080
I'm susceptible to stars...

1281
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,160
Stop. I'm awfully sorry, but he's not going
to sing it. I bought this number for Dumas.

1282
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,680
- Dumas?
- Yes, yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

1283
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,160
Miss Dell, would you be
so kind as to try it with Mr. Dumas?

1284
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,600
Well, this is a surprise.

1285
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,680
Let's go, kids.

1286
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,600
- I hope I don't ruin it for you.
- It's not your fault.

1287
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,120
Kids, this is a very expensive number.
Let's do it proud.

1288
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,800
Ahem.

1289
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,320
I'm susceptible to stars in the skies

1290
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,360
I'm incurably romantic

1291
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,400
If they're told to me all covered with sighs

1292
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:12,000
The wildest of lies seem true

1293
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,800
Each time a lovebird sings

1294
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,760
I have no defenses

1295
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:25,960
My heart is off on wings along with my...

1296
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,280
(Kerry) The spirit of this song
is intimacy, real intimacy.

1297
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,640
-- I'm a setup for...
- Put your arms around him. Closer.

1298
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,080
- Drape yourself over him.
-- I'm incurably romantic...

1299
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,240
Melt together.

1300
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,200
Your mouth closer to his cheek.

1301
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,120
Kiss it. Just a small one.
Now another one. Good.

1302
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,320
Like you

1303
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,720
-- But oh, your arms are nice
- Now nuzzle him.

1304
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,920
And it would be awfully nice...

1305
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,680
Hold it. What's the matter?

1306
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,280
- Matter?
- You're freezing.

1307
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,000
(whispering) Just relax.

1308
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,600
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- You've met Miss Dell, haven't you?

1309
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,480
- Yes...
- Well, let her get at you.

1310
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,240
- All right.
- Until your last line.

1311
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,440
Then you kiss her. Strong! Mean it.

1312
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,400
Make her know it.

1313
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,480
You can do that, can't you?

1314
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,200
I'll try my very best.

1315
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,560
Well, let's start again.

1316
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:39,200
But, oh, your arms are nice

1317
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,800
And it would be awfully nice

1318
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,720
If you turned out to be

1319
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:54,760
Starry-eyed like me

1320
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,640
And

1321
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,320
Incurably

1322
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,280
Romantic

1323
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,120
Too

1324
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,880
That's not bad. You've got the general idea.
We'll rehearse the rest again later.

1325
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,120
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

1326
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,000
May I take you to dinner tonight?

1327
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,200
We're rehearsing tonight.

1328
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,920
I've never met such a difficult girl to feed.

1329
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,000
(giggles)

1330
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,960
(Burton) Are you trying to kill yourself?

1331
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:55,520
Is this what I sat up nights with you for,
with cold towels on your head?

1332
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,840
Everybody said I was crazy
to hire you, but I believed.

1333
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,720
And look what you're trying to do to yourself!

1334
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,320
- Don't yell at him.
- He's starting with this again.

1335
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,360
- Give me that! Give me it.
- Tony, stop.

1336
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,680
You don't need that stuff any more. Come on.
Just because you had a tough break...

1337
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,920
No. No, kid. It's normal, for me.

1338
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,760
I see it all now. Three shows
in a row before this I had great numbers.

1339
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,120
All three closed out of town.

1340
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,880
I did my job, everybody said
I was great and nobody gets to see me.

1341
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,520
Well, finally I've got the message. I've had it.

1342
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,960
- But it's not your fault.
- That's just it.

1343
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,320
Forget it, Mandy. I want out.

1344
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,280
How do you get out?
You say "I quit"? That's not out.

1345
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:44,120
You're an actor. Wherever you go, whatever
you do, how do you leave it behind?

1346
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,600
No. I don't leave it behind.

1347
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,360
Look, I know I can do the number better
than he can. All I'm asking for is a chance.

1348
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,240
I'm entitled to show them what I can do
with it, but they won't even give me that.

1349
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,000
It's not fair. He should have
a chance at the number. He's entitled.

1350
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:04,120
- That backer won't listen. What can I do?
- Try to make him listen?

1351
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,520
- I believe you deserve...
- Then do it.

1352
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,480
How? He's got control now.

1353
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,680
I'll go out with Alex and
keep him out for an extra half-hour.

1354
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,920
Meantime, Tony, you can
show Mr. Welsh what you can do.

1355
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,560
Honey, how do I get the man to listen?

1356
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,880
How? Put him on the stage
as soon as I leave.

1357
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,480
He won't walk out of the theatre.
He's gotta listen.

1358
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,840
- I can use Lily. She knows the song.
- Good.

1359
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,280
All right. We'll give it a try.

1360
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,960
Come on now.

1361
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,640
(speaking Chinese)

1362
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,680
An old Chinese toast would be appropriate.

1363
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,400
(speaking Chinese)

1364
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,680
May our children like each other.

1365
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,600
Is that all? The Chinese is longer.

1366
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,320
Or else we'll have a noisy home.

1367
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,680
- How many languages do you speak?
- Five or six.

1368
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,720
Listen, don't worry about the check.
We'll go halves, OK?

1369
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,400
Thank you very much,
but I have quite enough to pay for this.

1370
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:29,040
I am very happy, Amanda.
I understand tonight why I was born.

1371
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,200
That's nice.

1372
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,440
Um... couldn't you get a better job
speaking all those languages?

1373
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,960
Someday you must go to France.

1374
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:42,880
This time of year, the sky over Paris
is exactly the color of your eyes.

1375
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,880
- Do you mind if I say something personal?
- Not at all.

1376
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,440
Maybe you're not ambitious enough.

1377
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,520
Because, now that I know you...

1378
01:36:55,240 --> 01:37:01,080
For instance, the United Nations or the
State Department. They could use you, I bet.

1379
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:04,800
Or some big business where
you'd deal with people from all over.

1380
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,280
- You have a way about you, you know.
- What way?

1381
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:13,320
Well, not elegant exactly,
but kind of... dignified.

1382
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,160
I say it because every once
in a while I can't place you.

1383
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,560
I think that's because
you're in the wrong line of work.

1384
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,640
- You always been a jewelry salesman?
- No, not always.

1385
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,200
- Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
- Please, don't be uneasy.

1386
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,360
It's all right. Let's have some more wine.

1387
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,960
Amanda, I am in love with you.

1388
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,800
- Now, Alex...
- I have never said this in my life.

1389
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,280
Amanda, I want to marry you.

1390
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,760
- Alex...
- What do you say to me?

1391
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:59,640
- Then, you're not married.
- Married? Why did you think...?

1392
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,920
You never said anything
about yourself, so what was I to think?

1393
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,960
I'm not married
and I have never been married.

1394
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,280
Darling, only your feeling is important.

1395
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,640
What do you feel for me? I must know that.

1396
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,840
- Was it something terrible?
- What are you imagining?

1397
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,920
Well, I've done some things in my life.
It's very painful to talk about.

1398
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:27,720
- No. No, darling.
- But people have to trust each other.

1399
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:32,960
Darling, I do trust you more than anyone
in my life, and now I will tell you everything.

1400
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,960
- What is it?
- I have to apologize.

1401
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:44,080
Here I am, asking you to trust me, and all this
time I'm playing an awful dirty trick on you.

1402
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,760
Me?

1403
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,240
I brought you here
to give Tony his chance at your number.

1404
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,640
- I see.
- He's doing it for Mr. Welsh now.

1405
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,680
- Well, we can go if you like.
- Of course, if you like.

1406
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,400
I am very sorry that
I came into your life too late.

1407
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,200
I hope you'll be very happy.

1408
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,320
Oh, I didn't mean that.

1409
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,760
I only wanted Tony to have his chance.

1410
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:16,480
Acting, for you, is just an extra job,
but for him it's his life.

1411
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,400
Please, darling, sit down. Sit down.

1412
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:24,640
I hope you're not mad,
because I like you, Alex.

1413
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,240
You do?

1414
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,480
Oh, my darling girl, marry me.

1415
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,920
- I adore you.
- But...

1416
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,080
Very well. I won't torture you any longer.

1417
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,760
I am not a jewelry salesman at all.

1418
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,280
I am a very wealthy man.

1419
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,600
As a matter of fact, I am Jean-Marc Clément.

1420
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,360
Ha.

1421
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,840
You don't believe it?

1422
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,240
- Come on, let's get some air.
- I'm not fooling you.

1423
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,680
You see, the other day
my public relations man came in my office...

1424
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,720
- Your what?
- Amanda, I am Jean-Marc Clément.

1425
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,480
I had just returned from the Hong Kong
office, and my public relations man said...

1426
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,120
- I got.. I left my...
- In the Variety...

1427
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,640
- Oh, I didn't even...
- In the Variety...

1428
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,000
- Oh!
- Amanda!

1429
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,080
Amanda! Amanda!

1430
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,720
I am a billionaire!

1431
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,640
I'm incurably romantic

1432
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,760
And I...

1433
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:32,400
- Could it wait so I could do it with Miss Dell?
- It's really her number.

1434
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:36,120
Well, I don't see what difference
it could possibly make.

1435
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,720
Amanda.

1436
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,280
- Amanda.
- Go away. I'm getting into my costume.

1437
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,960
Now, listen. The other day
I came here with my public relations...

1438
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,680
Darling, I am Jean-Marc Clément.

1439
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,520
Don't say that again.
You don't have to be Clément.

1440
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:00,640
But I do have to be. I can't help it.

1441
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,480
I saw you, I wanted you and before I knew it,
I was Alexander Dumas.

1442
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:08,800
You know what I did? I got Bing Crosby
to work with me on the song.

1443
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,800
I paid Milton Berle, and Gene Kelly, too, and...

1444
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,520
- Oh, darling.
- Yes?

1445
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:19,200
- It's all my fault. Come in. Lie down.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

1446
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:27,200
I told you to get into the character,
and that's wonderful.

1447
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,640
But now you've got to get out.

1448
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,560
- Amanda, you'll drive me crazy.
- Don't say that. Relax.

1449
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,480
It will all go away.

1450
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,560
Listen, there used to be an actor.

1451
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,760
He played Abraham Lincoln
for so many years... This is true.

1452
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,040
He grew his own beard.
He went around in a shawl.

1453
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,000
And you know what they used to say?

1454
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:53,160
"He looks like Lincoln, he talks like Lincoln,

1455
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,840
but he won't be satisfied till he gets shot."

1456
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:01,000
- I'll prove it to you.
- It doesn't matter. You don't have to be rich.

1457
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,600
- No?
- If you mean what you say.

1458
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,440
Money doesn't mean
anything to me. I get jobs.

1459
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,920
Forget all that, will you?

1460
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:18,400
Oh, my dear girl,
how long I have waited to hear that.

1461
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,360
I'm so glad.

1462
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,880
Oh, I'm so glad.

1463
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,200
Now tell me, who are you?

1464
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,200
Amanda, I am Jean-Marc Clément.

1465
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,400
Now, look, enough's enough, Alexander!

1466
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,720
OK, call Berle, call Gene Kelly,
call Bing Crosby. Come on!

1467
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,920
I'll go right out and get them on the phone.

1468
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,600
You get a kick out of this, whoever you are.

1469
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,280
- I can't stand anyone who makes fun of me.
- May I be of any assistance?

1470
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,320
- George, tell her who I am.
- Who you are, sir? He's Alexander Dumas.

1471
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,920
- No, George! Tell her the truth.
- The truth?

1472
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,360
- Yes!
- I beg your pardon. That's different.

1473
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:10,640
- Actually, he's Jean-Marc...
- Marc Clément!

1474
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,400
- What?
- Who are you? King Farouk, I suppose.

1475
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:21,280
I hope you both enjoyed it. It's true
what they say. There's no comedians left.

1476
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,360
But...

1477
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,360
I'm susceptible

1478
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:44,920
To stars in the skies

1479
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:51,320
I'm incurably romantic

1480
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:58,920
If they're told to me all covered with sighs

1481
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,600
The wildest of lies seem true

1482
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:11,160
Each time a lovebird sings

1483
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:15,840
I have no defenses

1484
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:21,800
My heart is off on wings

1485
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,720
Along with my senses

1486
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:32,520
I'm a setup for the moon when it's bright

1487
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,760
I'm incurably romantic

1488
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:42,320
And I shouldn't be allowed out at night

1489
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:46,960
With anyone quite like you

1490
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:55,840
But, oh, your arms are nice

1491
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:59,000
And it would be...

1492
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:02,360
Is it too much to ask
whether I like his performance?

1493
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,000
Of course you like it. That's not the problem.

1494
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:08,760
Turned out to be

1495
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:15,000
Starry-eyed like me

1496
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:27,200
And incurably romantic

1497
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,880
Too

1498
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,360
Listen. Get an injunction to close the show.

1499
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,880
Invasion of privacy.

1500
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,880
But he can't do this. It's impossible.

1501
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:54,560
Obviously he can.
This is a very legal document.

1502
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,600
This is the end. The story of my life.

1503
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,840
You'll have to cut "Specialization."

1504
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,280
You can't cut that. It's a wonderful number.
Oh, I love that number.

1505
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,280
Yes, but he resents the ridicule.

1506
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,040
Well, we'll get a lawyer. Who is he, Hitler?

1507
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,560
Excuse me. I have a suggestion.

1508
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,080
For every lawyer you get,
Mr. Clément will have five. That's no good.

1509
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,680
- You have a much better weapon.
- What's that?

1510
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,280
The one thing Clément cannot resist.

1511
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,200
- A beautiful woman.
- Say now.

1512
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,640
If Miss Dell would pay him a visit,
I feel sure she could charm him.

1513
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,440
- Charm him? I could murder him.
- You will adore him, I'm sure.

1514
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:36,160
What about that, Amanda? If you
told him what the show was really like...

1515
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,160
It would be a good idea,
young man, if you went along, too.

1516
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,560
- After all, they're both French.
- Right. Both of them are French.

1517
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,760
I would be glad to help if I can.

1518
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:48,800
Try it, will you? There's no time to fight
him in court if we're gonna open tonight.

1519
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,760
- I'm not going alone with him or his friend.
- No, honey, we'll all go.

1520
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:56,440
- I'll try to make an appointment.
- It might be better if I made the call.

1521
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,640
Swell! You can tell him in French!

1522
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,800
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1523
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,240
We want to see Mr. Clément.

1524
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:41,080
We're from the Let's Make Love company.
It's very important.

1525
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:52,360
(whispering) What's the matter with her?
Did I say something?

1526
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,120
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1527
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,840
Would you come in?

1528
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:03,240
- She didn't say it's all right, though, did she?
- No.

1529
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,480
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1530
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,240
We want to see Mr. Clément. Is he in?

1531
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,480
Yes, Miss.

1532
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,560
I suppose we may as well go in.

1533
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,240
What is this, a war of nerves?

1534
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,640
Alex! You can't sit there.

1535
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,720
You can't look through his mail!

1536
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,080
I'll do the mail now.

1537
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,920
You've got to see a doctor. Come.

1538
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,640
We gotta get outta here.

1539
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,000
Come. Come quietly. Quietly.

1540
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
We gotta get outta here...

1541
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,200
- Good morning.
- (greetings)

1542
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:44,480
To dottore Gino Martinelli, Milano.

1543
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,120
Mio caro amico, sua proposizione riguardo
automobile mi sembra molto ragionevole.

1544
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,200
Cionondimeno, io confirmerò mio
sentimento sulla questione in seguito.

1545
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:58,160
Però spero che lei troverà
qualche cosa abbastanza importante.

1546
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,400
I miei migliori complimenti
a lei e a sua moglie,

1547
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,200
senza dimenticare
la sua carina figlia Caterina.

1548
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,800
Vostro devotissimo, Jean-Marc Clément.

1549
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,040
Why don't you sit down? It won't take long.

1550
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,920
No, sir. I won't.

1551
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,560
That'll be all.

1552
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,240
Please, darling. Darling, darling.

1553
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,320
There was no other way.

1554
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,920
You...

1555
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,760
- Shame on you!
- Please understand.

1556
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,440
Letting me go on and on like a fool
when you knew how I felt about you.

1557
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,000
I apologize. I beg you. Darling.

1558
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,440
Forgive me, darling, I beg you.

1559
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,040
But look. Look what happened
the moment you knew who I was.

1560
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,000
Even you were impressed. Admit it.

1561
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,760
You no longer saw me. You saw only power.

1562
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:54,200
Really, I've never been
so humiliated in my life.

1563
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:58,400
- You could have told me who you are.
- I did tell you.

1564
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,520
- How did you expect me to believe it?
- Because it was true.

1565
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,600
That's no excuse.

1566
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,920
Listen, darling, listen...

1567
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,440
I never want to see you again
as long as I live!

1568
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,280
Amanda!

1569
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,800
Amanda!

1570
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,920
(Jean-Marc) Amanda.

1571
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,120
Amanda, darling, listen to me.

1572
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:33,080
I ask you to stop the elevator and come back.

1573
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,560
I will not.

1574
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,840
I'm up here on the top of the world, Amanda,

1575
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,800
but my soul is going
down to the street with you.

1576
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,720
So I beg you to understand
that I must stop the elevator.

1577
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,080
- Brace yourself, darling.
- You will not stop...

1578
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:04,560
And don't think you're going
to charm your way out of this.

1579
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,120
What a life.

1580
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,640
And all the time I'm trying to figure out
how to buy you a square meal.

1581
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,320
How could you bear watching me
make a fool of myself?

1582
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,440
Here we stand and we argue

1583
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,560
-- What are we thinking of?
- Alexander Dumas.

1584
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:29,120
- The Three Musketeers.
-- Let's not make with the...

1585
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,560
Baby

1586
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:35,720
- Faker.
-- Let's make love

1587
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,640
Why do I like you?

1588
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:43,480
You'll just love my embraces

1589
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:48,680
Cos they'll fit like a glove

1590
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:55,920
We could get down to cases maybe

1591
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,040
Kiss me, baby

1592
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,400
My, oh, my... It's warm here.

1593
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,200
Let's make love.

1594
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,480
Should I still get my diploma?

1595
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,680
Let's make love.

1596
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,880
Will they be surprised at night school!
