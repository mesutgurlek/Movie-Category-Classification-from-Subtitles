- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, Tony. How about a kiss?

- I don't kiss men.
- You don't? Well, put her there, then.

- Cigarette before you turn in, old man?
- I don't smoke.

- Oh, Janet, they're really great children.
- Thanks.

Well, I'm trying to teach them...

What am I trying
to teach them, Janet?

482
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:36,518
I don't know, dear,
but it's something useful, I'm sure.

483
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:40,396
Walter, he's certainly your son. Of all
the charmers. He looks like you too.

484
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,733
- You really think so?
- The spitting image.

485
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,736
Fortunately, those children
look just like their mother.

486
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,613
That's funny, because two of them
aren't ours, you know.

KITTY: What?
- I thought you knew that.

488
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:55,661
- Laura and Tony are adopted.
- No. This is the first I ever heard of it.

489
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:59,833
It isn't something you talk about.
I didn't even think about it myself.

490
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,793
As far as I'm concerned,
there's absolutely no difference.

491
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:05,005
But when did you do it?
I mean, why?

492
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:10,843
Because for the first three years of our
marriage, there was no sign of a family.

493
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:14,097
I was afraid I was gonna become
one of those frustrated women.

494
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:16,599
So out of desperation,
we decided to adopt one.

495
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:21,521
Then, brother. One, two, three in a row.
I was afraid to shake hands with her.

496
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:24,023
I guess it was because
I stopped worrying.

497
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,650
But you said Tony too.

498
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,860
JANET: His mother and father
died in an accident.

499
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:30,154
He wasn't quite 3 months old
when we got him.

500
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:33,491
I thought it might be a good idea
if you would consider...

501
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:34,909
Where did you get them?

502
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,786
JANET:
Through the Sarah Wilson Foundation.

503
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,914
I'll give you the address
in case you ever want...

504
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,377
- Well, I bows to you.
- And nods accordingly.

505
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:48,213
Likewise.

506
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:53,010
The reason we came out here
was to try and talk you two...

507
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,805
...into doing a television show.
That right, Kitty?

508
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,598
What? Oh, yes.

Why, you inconsiderate
city-bred fella, you.

510

Do you think I'd give up my book,
leave this farm for that?

- Unless, of course, it pays money.

512

- A mere pittance.

513

- Real money?
JACK: Oh, yes.

- We might as well go in and look.

Is there any law that says
we have to take one we don't like?

517
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:36,178
Oh, I think you can at least
pick and choose.

518
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:39,264
What do we have to lose?

519
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,852

Oh, yes, of course,
Mr. and Mrs. Pringle.

526
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:08,292
You'll want to use them
for one of your references.

527

- You'll need at least three.

What does that mean, "Oh-oh"?

Oh, there's nothing
to worry about, really.

537
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:39,323
It's just that we've had two or three
rather unfortunate experiences...

538
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,118
...with people from the stage,
and Mrs. Johnston...

539

That's she there on the wall.
... Sarah Wilson was her mother.

540
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:48,749
Well, she's a wonderful woman, but...

541
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:52,086
She doesn't think that actors
are parent material, is that it?

542
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:54,130
Oh, there's no set rule.

543
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:58,301
It all depends on the individual
and the kind of program that you do.

544
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,927
We have a comedy program.

545
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,846
Yes, and we've also been
known to sing and dance.

546
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:05,683
Oh, I suppose I should be ashamed
to admit it...

547
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,935
...but I never listen
to programs like that.

548
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,022
Squeaking doors, murder,
that's the kind of thing I like.

549
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:14,733
Just last night,
I was listening to this program.

550
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:17,110
There was a detective,
he was on a case...

551
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:20,072
...oh, I forget what it was,
but, oh, it was thrilling.

552
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:23,366
I don't know how they ever think
up all those things, do you?

553
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,368
It's one of the mysteries of the ages.

554
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,580
Would it be possible
to see the babies...

555
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:29,873
...and give you an idea
of what we'd like?

556
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:34,169
Oh, but there aren't any babies
available at the moment, Mrs. Moran.

557
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:36,296
It may take weeks, months.

have had to wait as much as a year.

- A year?
- Well, you should see our waiting list.

gonna turn out just the way you want it.

Sure. Well, thank you.

If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

In the meanwhile, I'm certainly
going to be watching for your program.

567

Then we ought to throw in
a few squeaky doors first.

568

That's all right, Mr. Moran,
I suppose I deserved that.

Yes. I should have married

When they wanna run a benefit,
the first people they call are actors.

581

They don't ask a truck driver
to drive for nothing.

582

All an actor's got is his talent.
He gives it for nothing.
