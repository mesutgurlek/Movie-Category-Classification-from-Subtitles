<i>I want you guys
to remember something.</i>

6
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:20,106
Glee Club is not
about competition.

7
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,242
It's about something deeper.

8
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:27,047
Glee is about
opening yourself up to joy.

9
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,317
ALL:
Whoa...!

10
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,721
It's time.

11
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,392
(sighs)

12
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:43,363
Can't remember the last time
I was this nervous.

13
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,365
Oh, well, you don't
look nervous at all.

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,700
You look great.

15
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,702
Are you ready?

16
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:50,403
Yeah.

Only one of these amazing teams

Would you mind
saying that again?

I-I'm not sure
I understood you correctly.

41
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,342
The District Board of
Education has decided

42
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:37,477
to make McKinley an arts school.

43
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,812
In a very short time from now,

44
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,146
you and I will be standing

45
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,149
in the choir room

46
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,850
of the William McKinley
High School

47
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,385
for the Performing Arts.

48
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,987
Wh-Wh-What happened?

49
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,322
To be completely honest, Will,

50
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:50,357
you happened.

51
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:52,325
Over the last decade,

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,327
school districts across the
country have been facing

53
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:55,495
multi-million dollar
budget shortfalls.

54
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,830
Yeah.

55
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,832
And our quick fix was

56
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,834
eliminating arts
programs altogether.

57
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,836
Prioritizing what we
would hope would be

58
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,239
more essential subjects
like math, reading, science.

59
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,374
You know what?

60
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,742
We were wrong.

61
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,177
Scores did not go up.

62
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,012
In fact, in some places,
they got worse.

63
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:16,249
But you... you refused
to let that stop you.

64
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:19,186
And I decided it was time
for me to stick my neck out

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,088
and make a pitch to the board.

66
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:25,892
And to my great surprise,
they agreed with me.

67
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,497
Superintendent Harris, I mean...
this is incredible news.

68
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,467
Please, please,
if-if there's anything

69
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,635
I can do to help,
just-just let me know.

70
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,771
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,285
I'm gonna have you
run the school.

72
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,742
Uh, I beg your pardon?

73
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,110
I'm making you principal, Will.

74
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,914
Congratulations.

75
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,655
WILL:
Okay.

76
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,424
Wait, now, remember.

77
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,758
What? That cookie
is for dessert.

78
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,093
Oh, come on.
Okay?

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,095
That is not an appetizer,
all right?

80
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,064
Now that you're the principal,
you have to set

81
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,066
a good nutritional example
for the other teachers...

82
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,001
I don't know if I can
live up to that standard.

83
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,955
You're just gonna have
to come have lunch with me

84
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,971
every single day.

85
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:11,972
Oh, my goodness, Will.

86
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:13,673
Will...!
(laughing)

87
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,243
We have to do everything
possible to be appropriate

88
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:19,079
and professional now
that you are management.

89
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,113
(sighs deeply)

90
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:21,748
I am never gonna have to worry

91
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,351
about getting funding
for another Glee Club costume

92
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,320
or paint brushes or tap shoes
for a kid who can't afford them.

93
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:31,992
Our son will be in the day care
that we set up in the gym.

94
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,528
And my beautiful wife

95
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:35,829
will be right down the hall,

96
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:37,864
working tirelessly to help kids

97
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,434
get into the best arts
colleges in the world.

98
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:42,068
Oh, my goodness.

99
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:46,106
I'm so proud of you, Will.

100
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,443
It has been quite a journey
to get to this place.

101
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:53,380
And you've made it the whole way
without losing your integrity.

102
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:55,148
Except for those days
when you were rapping.

103
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:57,184
(laughs)

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
Can I be honest with
you about something?

105
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,592
I am scared to death.

106
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:10,697
Do I have the talent
to actually do the job?

107
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:13,667
Will, you're the most
talented man in the world.

108
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,836
Or at least in Ohio.

109
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,037
That's more like it.

110
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,839
(chuckling):
Right.

111
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:21,374
I'm serious... you don't have
anything to be scared about.

112
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,411
I'm not saying that
it's gonna be easy,

113
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:27,080
but I am saying now is
the time for you and I

114
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,082
to relax and have fun...

115
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,117
Yeah.

116
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,419
...and be in
love, right?

117
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:35,088
Because if we don't like
something now, we can...

118
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:38,091
you know, we can fix it.

119
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:39,760
So no more bad guys.

120
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:42,696
It is just you and me

121
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,699
and the power of
our imaginations.

122
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,370
I love you so much.

123
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,906
I love you.

124
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,408
Now go get
your son, Mr. Shue,

125
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:55,909
and I will see you at school.

126
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:57,110
(sighs) All right.

127
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,752
You see that, Danny?

128
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:08,255
Dreams really do come true.

129
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:09,589
Yeah.

130
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,625
(chuckles)

131
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,930
Here he is!

132
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,799
(cheering, whooping)

133
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,446
Wow, um...

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,448
I have to say this is
the most exciting first day

135
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,450
of Glee Club
that we have ever had.

136
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,452
No offense to the alumni
who have been here

137
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,787
since the very first-ever
Glee Club meeting.

138
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,122
(sighs)

139
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,124
All right, please,
everyone, have a seat.

140
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,992
(clears throat)

141
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,262
So, Mr. Shue when are you
gonna start auditions?

142
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:50,731
KURT: Yeah, I think you're
gonna have trouble sticking

143
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,499
to your whole "whoever wants in,
gets in" rule.

144
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,101
Not true, Mr. Hummel.

145
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,669
The New Directions!
will be only one

146
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,237
of the glee clubs
at this school.

147
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,239
I'm bringing back
the Troubletones

148
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:01,808
and starting an all-boys version
called the Duly Noted.

149
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:04,144
And we're also gonna have
a junior varsity squad

150
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:06,446
for those who feel like they
need a little seasoning

151
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:08,248
before they're ready
for the big time.

152
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,984
So, wait, how are you gonna
teach all those glee clubs

153
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,319
and run a school?

154
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,587
I'm not.

155
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,155
I'm actually not coaching
any of them.

156
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,490
Not even the New Directions?

157
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,326
Well, uh, I've interviewed a...

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
a candidate for that particular
job that I really like.

159
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,096
But until then,

160
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:27,134
I wanted to say farewell
to you all

161
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,836
with a song that I prepared
for this occasion.

162
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,174
My life changed...

163
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,511
because of all the magic
that we created in this room.

164
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,513
And if I've learned one thing,

165
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,627
it's the message in the lyrics
of this song.

166
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:48,355
This is for you guys.

(applause, whooping)

209
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,504
(no voice)

210
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,809
(grunting):
Come on... a little...

211
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,780
Hey, what are you doing?

212
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,783
Oh, uh, just a little inventory.

213
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,452
We got to do it
before we sell all this stuff.

214
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,455
I mean, all these balls are
under one PSI, so...

215
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,291
they're basically, uh, useless

216
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,125
unless we fill them up
to 12.5.

217
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,396
So listen, um,

218
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,365
considering that you're
going to be unemployed

219
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,368
somewhat soon, I was wondering

220
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,270
you'd given
any thought to maybe,

221
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,172
I don't know,
moving back to New York.

222
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:05,441
We have this spare room
for you... it-it's perfect.

223
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,576
It's really small; it's more of,
like, a closet, really, but...

224
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:08,744
Uh, yeah.

225
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,012
No, we talked about this before.

226
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,547
I told you that
New York's not my speed.

227
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:12,615
It's too fast; it's too loud;

228
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,250
there's too many sports teams,

229
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:15,951
so I get confused on who I'm
supposed to root for.

230
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:18,120
We just root
for whichever one's winning.

231
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,089
Okay, that's something
Kurt would say.

232
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,991
That's what happens
when you get married.

233
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:25,895
Kurt and I are
really happy, all right?

234
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,464
That's good. W-We're having
a very good life together.

235
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,266
We see everybody...
We see Rachel,

236
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,268
we see Artie, Brittany,
Santana, Kitty...

237
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:35,137
It's a lot of fun,
but I miss my best friend.

238
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,139
Dude, I miss you,
too, man, you know?

239
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,575
But this is home, okay?

240
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,477
I need to be out in
the wide-open spaces.

241
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:43,479
I need to be able to just
go out on the weekends

242
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:44,833
and just shoot
stuff if I want to.

243
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,482
Look, I'm happy.

244
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:49,485
I am genuinely happy here, okay?

245
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,587
This is where I'm meant to be.

246
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:54,657
I just don't want you
to waste all of your talent.

247
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:57,993
I'm not... I'm using all of
my talent in my new job.

248
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,499
All right.

249
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,501
Congratulations to all of you.

250
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:08,504
You have been selected
as the best of the best.

251
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:12,208
You are this year's
New Directions!

252
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,849
Now I would like to introduce
you all to your new teacher,

253
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,884
Mr. Sam Evans.

254
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:25,855
Wait, hold on, no.

255
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,189
Y-You're taking over
the glee club?

256
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,224
Jealous?

257
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,792
Yeah.

258
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:32,128
I could not be more proud
to pass the baton off to you.

259
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,363
Go get 'em, buddy.

260
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,699
All right, all right, all right.

261
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,367
So look,
I've been thinking a lot

262
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:40,002
about the first week's lesson.

263
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,705
This week, your assignment is...

264
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,044
...country!

265
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,147
Uh-oh.

266
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,515
Let's see
where he goes with this.

267
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,518
Country and blues come
from the same roots.

268
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,019
The hardship of a rural life.

269
00:12:57,054 --> 00:13:00,689
Country uses little
personal stories

270
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:02,691
about breakups or
broken-down pickups

271
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:05,962
to express the deeper pains
of poverty and anxiety

272
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:09,966
that was in still, uh, such a
normal part of life

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,302
in the American South.

274
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:15,305
Now, if we want to be great,

275
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,375
we need to be able
to sing about hurt and loss.

276
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,210
And even if we can't
relate to the specifics,

277
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:21,845
make them our own.

278
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,315
So who wants to start us off
with a country song?

279
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,349
Let's do "She Thinks
My Tractor's Sexy."

280
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:29,352
(others enthusiastically agree)

281
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,387
MAN:
Yeah.

282
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:32,022
WOMAN:
Okay.

283
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:35,025
Well, looks like we're all
right where we belong.

284
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,539
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

285
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:39,929
MERCEDES:
Okay, wait.

286
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,865
Stop right there.

287
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,533
I just want you guys
to come in and listen,

288
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,735
because I have to get
through this without crying.

289
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:53,176
Okay, I have officially
been picked up

290
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,845
to be the opening act
for Beyoncé's new world tour.

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,447
(gasping, all talking excitedly)

292
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,321
MERCEDES:
Effective immediately.

293
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,885
- Yay!
- MERCEDES: I know.

294
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,255
You know,
ever since I've been back,

295
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,856
I've just been
walking these halls,

296
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,859
trying to remember
how invisible I used to feel.

297
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:12,195
And the funny thing is...

298
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:15,098
It's getting really hard
to remember that Mercedes.

299
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,866
Even when I got
the call earlier,

300
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,536
I didn't think, "Oh, this must
be some kind of mistake,"

301
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,539
or, you know,
"They must not mean me."

302
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,774
That's because of you guys.

303
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,776
Having friends like you
really did change me.

304
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,813
You made me know
that good things are possible.

305
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:37,620
It's not really... it's not
really that common to come by...

306
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,656
and I'll remember you guys
for it.

307
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,826
No, no, no, no,
do not come up here,

308
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,427
because that is not
even the hard part,

309
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:47,097
and if you come up here now,
I am gonna lose it,

310
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,666
and I am determined to walk out
of here with some class.

311
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,235
So, between

312
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,907
the tour and rehearsals and
me cutting an album right after,

313
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:01,144
I won't be seeing you guys
for a while.

314
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:04,814
Maybe even a-a long while.

315
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:08,952
You know, we'll keep in touch,
but it's not gonna be the same,

316
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,588
and I think that we've all had
enough group hugs

317
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,623
that can last us a lifetime.

318
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:19,629
So, I wanted to say good-bye
my way... with a song.

319
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:22,866
And then, I want to walk
out of here...

320
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,103
like I'm gonna be seeing
everybody in Glee Club tomorrow,

321
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:30,507
and like it's not
really good-bye.

Mercedes Jones has left
the building.

365
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,938
(Blaine clears his throat)

366
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,740
Oh, hello, Porcelain.

367
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,208
<i>Mrs.</i> Porcelain.

368
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,444
What are you doing, Sue?

369
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,145
Well, I just came in to, uh,

370
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,914
drink in the old office
one last time,

371
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,917
and to drop a hot one
in the middle of Will's desk.

372
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,452
But that seemed childish, so,

373
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,320
I, uh, just peed everywhere.

374
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:31,557
Can you have a seat
for-for a second?

375
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,959
We wanted to talk to you.

376
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:35,561
As you probably already know,

377
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:38,130
Blaine and I are leaving
for New York in a few days,

378
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,898
but before we leave,

379
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,568
we wanted to thank you for
getting us back together.

380
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:44,169
If it hadn't been for you,

381
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,405
we would still be apart,
and we would still be miserable.

382
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,940
BLAINE:
So...

383
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,575
thank you.

384
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,510
We really meant it:
thank you.

385
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,579
Porcelain...

386
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:54,813
(sighs)

387
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,815
The first moment
I laid eyes on you,

388
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,319
I truly didn't understand
what I was looking at.

389
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:02,287
With your hippo broaches

390
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:04,123
and your knee-length sweaters,

391
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,925
standing there all sassy
with your arms crossed

392
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,961
and your hips
all... cocked out,

393
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:12,064
and your eyes rolled back
as if to say, "Oh, how droll."

394
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,167
But then, I got to know you.

395
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,304
And even though
you still constantly annoyed me,

396
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:21,440
I got to watch you go through
what you went through.

397
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,342
The whole
coming-out thing

398
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,612
with your dad, the death threats
from the bully

399
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,480
whom Blaine later dated.

400
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,449
I never knew

401
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,451
I had thoughts and feelings
about those things

402
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,320
until I watched you
go through them.

403
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,989
But you expanded my mind.

404
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,191
You taught me things
about myself

405
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:42,061
that I would have never
discovered on my own.

406
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,664
And for that, I thank you.

407
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:49,034
Thank you.

408
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:52,905
Blaine...

409
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:54,907
I still don't really get you.

410
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,843
Um, I guess I just am not
a fan of your thing.

411
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,144
But, hey,

412
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,380
you're doing you...

413
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:03,182
and that's swell.

414
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:05,017
Thank you, Sue.

415
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:06,885
I feel the same way about you.

416
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,888
And now, if you'll excuse me,

417
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:12,191
there's somebody I need to see.

418
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,234
I was coming to see you!

419
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,604
I was coming to see you, too!

420
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:48,761
Oh!

421
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,596
Coach, I'm sorry that I said

422
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,765
those horrible things
to a horrible adult.

423
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,533
Oh, honey, I'm the
one who's sorry.

424
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:56,468
I've been treating you
like an unpaid intern,

425
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:59,138
when I should have been
treating you like a paid intern.

426
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:02,041
But honey, there's still one
last person I have to see.

427
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,776
- All right.
- All right, babe.

428

(piano plays intro to ABBA's

429
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:13,719

GERALDO RIVERA:
<i>Welcome back, everybody.</i>

468
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,408
President Jeb Bush will win
the crucial battleground state

469
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:52,411
of Ohio, and reelection
to a second term

470
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:54,413
as President
of the United States.

471
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:56,949
With me now, before she heads
down to Times Square

472
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,919
to meet the president and
the crowd of tens of thousands,

473
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:01,754
the vice president,
Sue Sylvester.

474
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:04,824
Madam Vice President, thank you
so much for being here.

475
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,091
Well, thank you, Geraldo.

476
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:07,446
And I just spoke
to the president,

477
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,928
and he was curious
about where I was,

478
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,996
and I told him
that victory rally could wait

479
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,632
until I had a chat
with my old buddy Geraldo.

480
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,334
Now, Madam Vice President,

481
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:16,936
I have to ask you,

482
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,238
will you be running
for president in 2024?

483
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:22,408
You bet your sweet ass, Geraldo.

484
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,077
Well, folks, you heard it here
first... the vice president.

485
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:27,613
Thank you very much.
Congratulations to you.

486
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,382
We'll be back with more election
night coverage right after this.

487
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:35,586
I wanted to make a time capsule
of my time at McKinley.

488
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,056
I know it's stupid, but it'd give me a
reason to come back every once in a while.

489
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,958
Oh, it's really, really sweet.

490
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:42,459
I have programs

491
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:44,461
from our show choir
competitions,

492
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,930
and... and oh, my<i> Rocky</i>
<i>Horror Picture Show</i> wig,

493
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,032
and oh, my Gaga
heels, and, uh...

494
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,702
and, oh, my favorite photo of
Finn, and oh, prom queen crown...

495
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:55,038
and, oh, our picture from prom, and
the ring you got me that Christmas.

Wh...

498
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:02,145
Wh-Why are you crying and
laughing at the same time?

499
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,148
(laughs): Because you're
the only person I know

500
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,150
that would do
something like this.

You're the only one.

And-and that is why
I love you so much.

00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:05,999
We want to use your songs
for the soundtrack.

640
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,001
Oh, my agent usually
handles that.

641
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:10,003
I am kidding. You can have
whatever song you like.

642
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:12,239
- Guys, come on. We're gonna be late.
- Oh, yeah.

643
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:13,974
BLAINE: Oh, did you
hear about Sam?

644
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,442
He already has a new girlfriend.
Can you believe that?

645
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,844
Come on, I don't want
to miss a moment.

646
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,079
MERCEDES: Well, then, why does
he keep texting me?

647
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,149
Knock, knock.

648
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,151
Come in!

649
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,652
Is it time already?

650
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:27,354
It's time!
We're all here!

651
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:29,289
- ARTIE: Hi! We're here!
- TINA: Hey, Rachel!

652
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,690
Oh, no, don't strain yourself.

653
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,459
Please. I've been sweating
my boobs off

654
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,327
at Tracy Anderson's
for the past nine months.

655
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,962
This baby can have my body now,

656
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,798
but then, after that,
Mama wants it back.

657
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,132
Well, we got you
some, uh, organic juice

658
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,934
from this special
place in Tribeca.

659
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,702
Thank you. It's supposed to
help the baby's brain grow.

660
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,704
Okay, hold on. So, I've heard
this story from Kurt and Blaine,

661
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,619
but now, I want
to hear your side.

662
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,708
What in the heck made you say
"yes" to being their surrogate?

663
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:52,112
Obviously, there's a full-circle
story based on how I was raised,

664
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,147
but these guys have just
been so amazing.

665
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,683
And I figured, they've given up
so much of their lives

666
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:58,351
to make me happy.

667
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:00,687
The least I could do was
give them nine months of mine.

668
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:01,855
Hi.
Hi.

669
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,056
Oh, I love you guys so much.

670
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,025
You're gonna be
the most amazing dads.

671
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,160
I can't wait for that.
Oh, here's my husband!

672
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,562
Because I'm ready to get started

673
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,363
on a little co-production
of our own.

674
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:12,632
(laughs) So romantic.

675
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,167
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Okay.

676
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,036
Wish us luck, you guys.
Bye, your guys.

677
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,337
Break a leg.
Bye.

678
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,538
You guys, we'll be praying...
Bye.

679
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:19,806
Bye. Have fun.

680
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,681
Fingers crossed.
(gasps)

681
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,711
JESSIE:
So, as a former Tony winner,

682
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,047
I feel like I need to
give you some pointers

683
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,382
of what you're gonna say
when you get up there.

684
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,185
I'm not gonna win. Yes, you are.
You are gonna win.

685
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,887
Really? Okay.

686
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,522
So, when you get up there,

687
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,191
you stand up straight,
you fake humility,

688
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,727
you cry only once when
you talk about your dads,

689
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,329
and you give all the credit

690
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,364
to your incredibly
talented director.

691
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,333
Well, he is pretty amazing
and handsome,

692
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,235
and has the best taste in women.

693
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,169
(laughs)

694
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:50,203
Here we are.

695
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:51,404
- You okay?
- Whew. Yeah.

696
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,006
ANNOUNCER:

...please welcome Broadway's
very own Andrew Rannells.

700
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:01,181
Bad dog!

701
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:02,449
(laughing):
Hey.

702
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:05,051
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh.

703
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,853
RANNELS (on TV):
The nominees for...

704

705
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,058
Maggie Smith in<i> Miss Jean</i>

00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:14,394

Anne Hathaway

710
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,769

00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,971

712
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:28,875
And Rachel Berry
in<i> Jane Austen Sings.</i>

713
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,479

00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:35,282
And the Tony goes to...

715
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,817
Rachel Berry

716
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,785
in<i> Jane Austen Sings.</i>
(applause and cheering)

717
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,454
(all gasping)

718
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,156
(applause and cheering)

719
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:44,558
Oh, my God.

720
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:45,659
(laughs) (whooping)

721
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,561
(indistinct chatter,
screaming and whooping)

722
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:49,162
♪ ♪

723
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,564
(whooping)

724
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:52,599
(applause and cheering)

725
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,775
(audience cheering, whooping)

726
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,810
(whistling)

727
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,586
Thank you.

728
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,788
Oh, my gosh, I, um... I-I want

729
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:18,158
to thank my amazing husband
and director, Jessie.

730
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,960
And I want to thank my

731
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,929
two dads for all of those
singing and dancing lessons.

732
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,931
Okay, I want to thank...

733
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,000
Carmen Tibideaux at NYADA

734
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,869
for giving me a second chance
at my degree,

735
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,872
and to all of my friends
at McKinley High.

736
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,674
Um, but I want
to dedicate this award

737
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,511
to the person who's responsible

738
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,513
for getting me
on this stage tonight,

739
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:41,114
and that is Mr. Will Schuester.

740
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,184
Um, Mr. Shue always taught
to my strengths

741
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:46,119
and not my weaknesses,

742
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:49,356
and he cheered the loudest
when I soared.

743
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,992
And he picked me up when I was
in a million pieces.

744
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:55,896
He taught me the one great thing
that all teachers do,

745
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,031
and there are
so many of them out there.

746
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,200
And that is, being a part
of something special

747
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,868
does not make you special.

748
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,204
Something is special
because you are a part of it.

749
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:05,705
Mr. Shue, I love you so much.

750
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,874
And to all of the boys
and girls out there,

751
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,143
I just want to say quickly
before I walk off the stage,

752
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:13,880
that dreams really do come true,
so, thank you.

753
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:15,916
(applause and cheering)

754
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,143
__

755
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,428
Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice
President of the United States.

756
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,629
(school bell ringing)

757
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,664
(applause)

758
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,804
Fantastic.

759
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,340
Becky? Becky?!

760
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:42,576
It's okay, honey.
He's clean.

761
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,948
You know, a great big fat person
once stood on this stage

762
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:50,151
and told a group of a dozen
or so nerds

763
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,186
in hideous disco outfits

764
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,822
that "glee,"
by its very definition,

765
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,792
is about opening yourself up
to joy.

766
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:00,628
Now, it's no secret
that for a long time,

767
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:02,630
I thought
that was a load of hooey.

768
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,132
As far as I can see,
the glee club is nothing more

769
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,134
than a place where a bunch
of cowardly losers

770
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,303
go to sing their troubles away,

771
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:11,572
and delude themselves
that they live in a world

772
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:15,643
that cares one iota
about their hopes and dreams,

773
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:17,645
totally divorced
from the harsh reality

774
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,747
that out in the the real world,

775
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:22,583
there's not much more
to hope for than disappointment,

776
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:25,219
heartbreak and failure.

777
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,154
You know what?

778
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:32,508
I was exactly right.

779
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,344
But I was wrong
about the cowardly part.

780
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,614
What I finally realize,

781
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:41,517
now that I'm well
into my late thirties...

782
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,452
It takes

783
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,355
a lot of bravery to look
around you, and see the world,

784
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,459
not as it is,
but as it should be.

785
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,062
A world where the quarterback
becomes best friends

786
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,131
with the gay kid,

787
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,966
and the girl with the big nose
ends up on Broadway.

788
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,403
Glee is about imagining
a world like that,

789
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:03,906
and finding the courage
to open up your heart

790
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,242
and sing about it.

791
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:09,211
That's what Glee Club is.

792
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,782
And for the longest time,
I thought that was silly.

793
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:15,551
And now, I think it's just about
the bravest thing

794
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,620
that anyone could do.

795
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:23,159
I'm honored to be here
to rededicate this theater

796
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:25,094
the Finn Hudson Auditorium.

797
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:33,736
William,
it is with your hard work,

798
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,772
in his memory, that you managed

799
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,908
to accomplish something
unimaginable.

800
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:41,243
McKinley High School
for the Performing Arts

801
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,312
has become
an overwhelming success,

802
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,516
a model for public schools
that showcase the arts,

803
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,086
now being replicated
all across the country.

804
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,088
(sighs)

805
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:53,756
Congratulations, Will Schuester.

806
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,658
You and your little Glee Club

807
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:58,494
have accomplished something
quite remarkable.

808
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:01,130
And now, without further ado,

809
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:02,999
it is my pleasure to introduce

810
