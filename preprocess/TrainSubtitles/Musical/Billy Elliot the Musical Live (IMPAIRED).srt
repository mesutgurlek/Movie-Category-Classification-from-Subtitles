You see,
there are two main theories about dance.

1110
01:02:46,157 --> 01:02:48,157
One is that it's basically technical,

1111
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:50,757
something you learn from the outside
and then repeat.

1112
01:02:50,836 --> 01:02:55,796
Or it's a very personal expression
that you realise from within.

1113
01:02:55,877 --> 01:02:57,517
What's she on about?

1114
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:02,157
Well, basically, it was all down to Diaghilev,
who ran the Ballets Russes,

1115
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,796
who wanted to revolutionise what had
become a purely decorative medium

1116
01:03:05,877 --> 01:03:10,596
and reconnect it with dance's chthonic roots
as a primordial means of expression.
