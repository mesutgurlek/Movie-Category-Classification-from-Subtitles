1
00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:01,814
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,175
<i>The Glee club is officially over</i>

3
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:05,013
<i>because the New Directions
didn't win at Nationals.</i>

4
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:07,297
<i>And since Sue's principal and only
wants winning teams at McKinley,</i>

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,861
<i>she made good on her promise to cancel it.</i>

6
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:09,346
Hold up.

7
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:12,192
<i>Which means if Will wants to coach
a Glee club, he has to find a new job</i>

8
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:13,048
<i>and he's got a baby on the way!</i>

9
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:14,750
- Oh, God, that's awful.
- <i>Blaine got into NYADA,</i>

10
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:16,051
<i>Artie's at film school</i>
<i>in Brooklyn,</i>

11
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:17,553
<i>and Sam's not going to college,</i>

12
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:19,688
<i>but he's in New York to try</i>
<i>his luck at modeling.</i>

13
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:21,690
So I'm going to skip college,
too, and become a male model.

14
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,225
Impossible. You're too fat.

15
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,394
<i>And Santana and Brittany are</i>
<i>off on an extended vacation</i>

16
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,108
<i>on The Isle of Lesbos,</i>
<i>and Rachel's six months</i>

17
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,231
<i>into her dream of playing</i>
<i>Fanny Brice in</i> Funny Girl

18
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,200
<i>that's about to open on Broadway
real soon. It's exciting!</i>

19
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,784
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

20
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,383
SIDNEY: Rachel, Rachel,
please, just a minute.

21
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,518
I'm-I'm sorry, Sidney,
I'm actually kind of late.

22
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:43,020
I have to go
and meet my friends.

23
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,615
Oh, that's not gonna
be a problem. Look,

24
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:47,424
I know this has been a couple
of very long months for you,

25
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:48,759
but you've been a trooper.

26
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:51,628
I mean, you know, having
to do the show on the road,

27
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:53,030
Santana quitting,

28
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,299
us having to re-stage
the entire play.

29
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,369
- I just wanted to say thank you.
- Thank you so much, Sidney.

30
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:00,738
No, no, no.
This is how I say thank you.

31
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:03,974
24/7, on call.

32
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,209
Is this for me?

33
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:07,711
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:11,949
No more crowded subways
in New York for my star.

35
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:13,317
So...

36
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,919
Thank you.

37
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:19,323
Now, the only question is:

38
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,992
where would
Ms. Berry like to go?

39
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,794
(squeaks)

40
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,796
Ah. Go ahead.

I can call him any time of day,
he's amazing.

97
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:04,421
He doesn't even say a word.
It's like living

- So, where we going for lunch?

100
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:10,661
Someplace cheap or free?

101

No, it is my treat and my ride.

102
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,165
You guys have been so great
and so emotionally supportive

of me during the entire
out of town<i> Funny Girl</i> run.

00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:18,669
And for your move
back to the loft,

105
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,272
which you never carried
your own clothes or furniture.

It's heavy.

107
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,475
Come on, we're going.
We're gonna go the Odeon.

108
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,944
Okay, like, I've been
really good lately.

109
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,813
- Oh, you have.
- Everyone from Broadway goes.

110
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:32,049
And it's so cool! I don't know,
probably just like...

111
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,717
rather than getting
a side salad.

112
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,286
Can we pop the trunk?

113
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,754
- Trunk is full.
- Can I sit in the front then?

114
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:37,921
Full, too.

115
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:40,024
Well...

116
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,159
Oh, it's okay. Sam and I can
just meet you there. Right, Sam?

117
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:43,794
Are you sure?

118
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,996
I guess.

119
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,531
Thank you.

120
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,637

Oh, that does smell good.

130
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:33,877
and Style section on Wednesday.

131
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,045
You know me so well.

132
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,647
Is there anything
I can do to help?

133
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:37,748
You can check

134
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:40,262
if the coffee is steeped
enough to press.

135
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,924
I still can't believe it.

136
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,025
We're really doing it.

137
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,527
Living together.
Building a future together.

138
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,596
In Bushwick.
Did you ever imagine that?

139
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,733
It's actually way, way better.

140
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,368
Every morning I get
to wake up next to you.

141
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:59,503
I get to walk you to the subway.

142
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,171
Then walk you to class.

143
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,706
And most days I get
to have lunch with you.

144
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:05,309
And even after all
of that amazingness,

145
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,877
I get to come home to you.

146
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:10,247
And I get to curl up in bed with
you, get under the covers...

147

Dudes!

191
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,910
I just made it all the way
to the original Nathan's

192
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,385
at Coney Island,
now I kind of stink,

193
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,747
so I'm gonna shower.

194
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,182
Ooh, ice cream.

195
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:26,317
Good job.

196
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,484
(door opens)

197
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,153
Okay, I know Sam is your bestie,

198
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:30,688
but he said he'd only
be couch-surfing

199
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,523
- with us for a few weeks.
- I know.

200
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,592
It's been months, okay?

201
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:35,960
This apartment has
too many people in it.

202
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,194
You've got to talk to him.

203
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,030

ARTIE:
<i>New York, new Artie.</i>

00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,202
<i>It was scary at first.</i>

206
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,605
<i>No space, no ramp van,</i>
<i>not cut-outs in the curbs.</i>

207
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,739
(screams)
Hey, I'm rolling here!

208
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,341
Watch where you're going!

209
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,942
<i>The city's alive,</i>
<i>always moving,</i>

210
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:53,511
<i>and I didn't know</i>
<i>if I'd be able to keep up.</i>

211
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:54,912
<i>But then I realized</i>

212
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,447
<i>I'm in a city</i>
<i>where everybody walks,</i>

213
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,716
<i>which actually puts me</i>
<i>at an advantage.</i>

214
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,551
<i>And as bonus, my biceps</i>
<i>aren't looking so bad,</i>

215
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:01,852
<i>thank you very much.</i>

<i>All of the cabdrivers</i>
<i>in New York</i>

217

<i>are required to take</i>
<i>wheelchairs,</i>

218
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,957
<i>and all the busses have lifts,</i>

219
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,926
<i>but real New Yorkers</i>
<i>take the subway.</i>

220
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,795

<i>There's music,</i>

00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,001
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>
<i>that's what I came here for.</i>

223
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,302
Hey-hey! Hey!

224
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:21,005
Hey! Hey!

225
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,240
I know, man. I'm sorry.

226
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,876
My laptop's in there!

227
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:27,378
Hey!

228
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:29,079
It's the only copy of my script!

229
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,054
(video game buzzing and beeping)

230
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:40,791
Bro, just completed Aqua
Park and Millennium Mines.

231
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,460
Now I'm ruling
Karts and Coasters.

232
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,929
<i>RollerCoaster Tycoon.</i>

233
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,397
It-it's amazing.

234
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:47,832
Sam, you've been sitting there

235
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,467
since I left this morning.

236
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,269
You-you've basically been
in that exact same spot

237
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:53,938
for months.

238
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,639
Yeah, well, Kurt's fancy
wire chairs hurt my back,

239
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:57,441
so this thing's the only thing
that's comfortable.

240
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,310
Look...

241
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,346
Uh, Kurt and I were talking.

242
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,981
- And, um, we just...
- You want me to move out.

243
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,050
I knew it. You know what?

244
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,051
Santana got
to stay here forever.

245
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:09,086
We don't want you to move,

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,254
per se, although it isn't

247
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,223
the worst idea I've ever heard.

248
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:13,457
We're just,

249
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:14,692
we're worried about you, man.

250
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:17,094
We know that work has been slow.

251
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,395
Try nonexistent, okay?

252
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,964
I've had
zero modeling auditions.

253
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,165
Zero.

254
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,800
I can't even get my
agent on the phone.

255
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,502
I just get
her lazy assistant Pam

256
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,403
who's like well, maybe
I should cut my hair

257
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:28,038
because I look
like a dirty hippie.

258
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:28,994
Well, maybe you should.

259
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:29,974
But I like it.

260
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,375
Okay, besides Mr. Shue said

261
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,576
that we shouldn't care
what people think.

262
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,578
We should just be ourselves.

263
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,280
What a load of crap, huh?

264
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:40,518
Well, Mr. Shue also said...

265
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,753
we should face our fears.

266
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:44,321
Remember that one?
So...

267
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,290
Buddy, I know this
is frustrating...

268
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:47,825
Maybe I just shouldn't
even be here, okay?

269
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:48,859
I hate New York, okay?

270
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,427
It's crowded, it's loud,

271
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,695
it smells like garbage

272
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,330
and everybody here is basically
paid to be rude to you.

273
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:55,032
Sometimes,

274
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,134
it's just easier
if you stay inside.

275
00:10:58,336 --> 00:10:59,303
All right.

276
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,138
Get up. Get up.

277
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:03,340
I-I don't want to watch you
waste away in here

278
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,342
when there is so
much to do out there.

279
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:07,077
Put on a clean shirt.

280
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,080
That's got, like,
five kinds of stains on it.

281
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:10,214
Come on, follow me.

282
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:11,215
We're going outside.

283
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,150
- Come on!
- (sighs)

- What?
- ARTIE: Except for not at all.

437
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,970

00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,807
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about replacing that computer,

440
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,110
I need a new school ID,
and to be honest,

441
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,011
I don't if I'm gonna feel safe
going in the subway anymore.

442
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,481
I just felt so vulnerable
and I don't...

443
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,648

444
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,717

how you feel, okay?

448
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,022
When I first moved to New York,

449
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,324
I gave this homeless
person ten dollars

450
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,558
when I just meant
to give him one,

451
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,060
and then when I
asked for it back,

452
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,895
everyone hissed and
they booed at me,

453
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,363
and I felt so violated
and vulnerable.

454
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,499
Oh, wait.
So you were out nine dollars?

455
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,367
But look, the next day

456
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,069
I just got right
back on that subway,

457
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,537
because overcoming
experiences like that

458
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,506
is what makes you
a real New Yorker.

BLAINE:
Your beverage, milady.

460
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,976
Oh, are those Meyer lemons?

461
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,011
No, I can't have that.

462
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,212
ARTIE:
You know what, Rachel?

463
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,714
Don't lecture me

464
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,015
about being a real New Yorker

465
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,184
with your lemon water
and your chauffeured limousine.

466
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,053
You're not even a
real person anymore.

467
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,854
Now, if you'll just excuse me,

468
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,249
I have to go figure out how
to put my life back together.

469
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,460
It's a town car,
not a limousine.

470
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,562
(hissing)

471
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,463
It's a town car.

472
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,931
Okay?

473
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,067
A town car.

474
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,769
So I found this song
by A Great Big World

475
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,571
that would be perfect

477
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,974

totally saccharine...

478
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,043
and you're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

479
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,211
I'm sorry.

480
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,345
I-I didn't get
any sleep last night.

481
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,447
Ooh, lucky you.

482
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,382
It's not like that.

<i>Blaine bought a couch</i>
<i>off the back of a truck,</i>

484
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,586
<i>because apparently</i>
<i>the furniture</i>

485
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,788
<i>I carefully chose</i>
<i>from Chelsea's finest</i>

486
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,290
<i>flea markets</i>
<i>isn't that comfortable.</i>

487
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,624
<i>It was a mid-century knockoff,</i>

488
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,093
<i>so I gave him</i>
<i>an "A" for effort,</i>

489
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,968
<i>but as soon as I lifted up</i>
<i>one of the cushions,</i>

490
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,996
<i>I saw that the entire couch</i>
<i>was riddled with...</i>

491
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,632
(screaming) Bedbugs!

492
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,911
<i>So we spent the entire night</i>
<i>disinfecting everything,</i>

493
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,903
<i>taking Silkwood showers,</i>

494
00:18:58,938 --> 00:18:59,904
<i>and disinfecting</i>
<i>everything again.</i>

495
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:00,739
(shudders)

496
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,273
And I know what I'm about to say

497
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,641
sounds like a bad Bravo show,

498
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,744
but I'm starting to
think that that couch

499
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,480
was an omen of
our relationship.

500
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,848
Seemingly fine from the outside,

501
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,850
but headed for certain disaster.

502
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,051
- Hmm.
- Does that sound crazy?

503
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,285
Absolutely.

504
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,421
Well, it's not just the couch.

505
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,922
I'm starting to
feel claustrophobic.

506
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,591
I mean, I wake up
next to Blaine,

507
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,925
I-I go to school
with Blaine,

508
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,927
I come home to Blaine. (laughs)

509
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,963
I feel like I'm starting
to lose my identity.

510
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,197
(sighs)

511
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,152
Okay, well, stop me if
you don't want my opinion.

512
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,603
Okay, when I first heard
you were engaged,

513
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,805
I thought, "Hmm-mm.
Big mistake.

514
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,140
Too young."

515
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,108
But you know what?
Seeing you guys together,

516
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,144
I think that what
you have is real

517
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,312
and worth fighting for
and I'm super jealous.

518
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,647
Still, though,

519
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,681
everyone needs time alone.

520
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,682
It's healthy.

521
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,951
So just set some boundaries.

522
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,787

00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,625
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You're-you're moving?

630
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
- Where you going to?
- Well, the agency's

631
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:31,062
putting me up in an apartment
with a bunch of other models.

632
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,331
I'm stoked.
My own place, sort of,

633
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:34,766
and you know, I'm not gonna be

634
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,401
taking up any more room
on the couch.

635
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,537
Well, you're gonna visit us,
right?

636
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:41,739
Um, yeah, if I have time,
you know.

637
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:45,410
But I-I-I might be traveling
to Paris and Milan

638
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,612
every week. Who knows?

639
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:50,048
I'm gonna pack everything up.

640
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:51,549
Yeah.

641
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:58,356
Hey! Oh, did you hear
Sam just got a job?

642
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,091
What are you doing?

643
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,366
Uh, this is, uh, something

644
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,328
I thought would make
a really great office area.

645
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,730
Back away from the lamp, okay?!
When someone enters

646
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,333
their sanctuary, they don't want
their eyes immediately drawn

647
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,601
to a hideous workspace!

648
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:10,735
I'm not done yet.

649
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,804
This isn't McKinley.
You can't just barge in here

650
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:14,105
and do whatever you want,
whenever you want, all right?

651
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,540
You could've at least
consulted me

652
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:18,243
before making design decisions
in my home!

653
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,645
I thought that this was supposed
to be<i> our</i> home, Kurt.

654
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,616
And believe it or not, not
every single design decision

655
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,751
you make is brilliant.
This whole privacy-

656
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,487
curtains-between-the-bedrooms
thing is stupid. Come on.

657
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:31,489
We can hear every single noise
our roomies make at night,

658
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:32,724
and God knows
what they hear from us.

659
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,259
You know what?
Elliott was right,

660
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:35,560
we're losing our boundaries.

661
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,061
I'm sorry, Elliott?
What-What does Elliot have

662
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:38,263
to do with any of this?

663
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:39,230
We were talking.

664
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:40,532
I bet you were talking.

665
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,432
He's my friend.

666
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:42,901
I bet he's your friend.

667
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:44,602
Calm down, psycho, all right?

668
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:46,771
And stop being so pouty
and weird. It's annoying.

669
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:49,507
All right, let's just be
adults and put everything back

670
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,942
where it's supposed to go.

671
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:53,378
Okay, I got an idea.
Why don't you put it back

672
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:55,413
where it's supposed to go
because it's your apartment!

673
00:25:55,448 --> 00:25:57,615
Fine! I will!

674
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,727
Hey, move it, kid!

675
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,778
- (knocking)
- Who is it?

676
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,737
It's Blaine.

677
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:28,272
Hey, I...

678
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:31,909
Are you okay?

679
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:32,943
Oh... (chuckles)

680
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:34,445
Oh, God, you're not trying

681
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,846
to move in here, are you?

682
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,282
No, I'm not. We need to talk.
I don't have

683
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:39,917
your number and
I don't have your e-mail

684
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,019
and we're not friend on Facebook
because I made it a point

685
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:44,722
of waiting for you to friend me,
which you never did, by the way.

686
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:47,057
So here I am
face-to-face.

687
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,093
I just want to hear you
admit it.

688
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:50,828
Admit what?

689
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:54,565
That you're trying to steal Kurt
away from me, Starchild Gilbert!

690
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,166
What?!
What are you talking about?

691
00:26:56,201 --> 00:27:00,437
Please, I was on to you
the second I saw

692
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,512
that weird cinnamon roll selfie
you took months ago.

693
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,941
You guys posted that.
Remember that?

694
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:05,976
I get to New York
and all of a sudden

695
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,079
it's "Elliott thinks this"
and "Elliott thinks that"

696
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,115
and "Elliott's hair
is so full and thick

697
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,250
that he doesn't have
to rely on hair gel."

698
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:17,921
Well, I may not be a cool
steampunk, glitter-rock vampire

699
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,457
with, like, tats and guyliner,

700
00:27:20,492 --> 00:27:23,427
but you know what?
I love Kurt. I love him!

701
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:27,531
He's my fiancé, not
yours, so back off!

702
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:30,467
Okay, are... are you done?

703
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:33,971
Take this.

704
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:36,407
- What?
- Yeah, it's, uh, it's like a body pillow.

705
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:37,808
It think it's
gonna calm you down.

706
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:39,176
Take a seat.

707
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,082
Look, Blaine,
I'm not after Kurt.

708
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:47,851
We're just friends. Don't get
me wrong, I mean, he's a,

709
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:50,654
he's a cute guy, but I don't
think of him that way.

710
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:54,425
And even if I did,
Kurt loves you.

711
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:57,928
I mean, he-he doesn't
shut up about you, actually.

712
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,196
Like, ever.

713
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,367
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's going on with me.

714
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:08,205
It's just, we've been apart
for so long,

715
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:13,210
and now that I'm finally here,
I just want to catch up to him,

716
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:14,945
I just want to make it real.

717
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:16,280
And the more I try...

718
00:28:16,314 --> 00:28:17,481
The more it pushes him away?

719
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:21,685
Well, maybe you should
stop trying.

720
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:27,057
I mean, look, New York
is a really crowded place,

721
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,572
and people need a little more
room to breathe here than usual.

722
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,695
You're right.

723
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:38,402
I guess I always think
of boundaries as walls

724
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:42,106
instead of places to grow in.

725
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,375
I'm so sorry. I-I should go.

726
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,777
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

727
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,212
You just got here.

728
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:50,147
You want to just hang out
for a minute?

729
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:51,315
Um...

730
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,584
I mean, you've obviously
come to jam.

731
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,052
Um... you gave me this.

732
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,320
"Glitter-rock vampire," huh?

733
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:57,514
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.

734
00:28:57,522 --> 00:29:00,357
I like that.
I-I... I can work with that.

735
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:01,558
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Come on. Give me some blues.

736
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:03,227
Give me some Southern... 

737
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,762
Come on.

738
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,463

Hey.

744
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,082
I got your text.

745
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:28,519
Why did her Royal Highness
summon a commoner like me?

746
00:29:28,553 --> 00:29:31,121
Okay, that was a little rude,
but I know I had it coming.

747
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,724
Look, I had an epiphany, and you
were right, okay? About everything.

748
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,692
I don't want to be
sheltered from the world,

749
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:37,661
I want to live in it.
So let's go.

750
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:40,064
I have rehearsal and you have class.
Let's take the subway.

751
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:41,632
- No, I can't.
- No, together.

752
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,167
Look, I know that you're
a little shaken up

753
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,369
about what happened, but trust
me, but I took Krav Maga

754
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,483
as a child at the JCC,
and I can protect you.

755
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:53,110
(sighs)

756
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:55,112
So what about the limo?

757
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,513
Town car. And
I gave it up.

758
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:58,649
I told my producers I'd
be in a much better place

759
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:00,617
if I rode the subway
with my friend every day.

760
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:02,319
- Every day?
- Well, if you'll have me.

761
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:03,587
Look, I will make you a deal.

762
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:05,322
I'll ride the subway
with you and make sure

763
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:06,824
that you don't get mugged again

764
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:09,526
if you give me a tongue-
lashing if I lose my way.

765
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:11,061
I can do that.

766
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,063
I'm really happy that
you're in New York.

767
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:15,599
The city is a much less
scarier place with a friend.

768
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,235
And I'm really happy you dragged
me back down here, because...

769
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:19,737
I really do love it.

797
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,335
I think there's like a dozen models
living in here,

798
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:00,836
but people take off for weeks
at a time on photo shoots,

799
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:02,061
so it never gets too crowded.

800
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:03,229
The rooms are kind of small.

801
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:04,497
Oh, that's okay;
I've been homeless.

802
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,598
That's cool, man.

803
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,899
I envy your realness.

804
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,567
Listen, I got to do this
paid webcam thing in my room,

805
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:09,902
but if you have any
other questions,

806
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:11,070
just ask your roommate Sam.

807
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:13,305
Wait, my roommate's name is Sam?

808
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,907
Okay, this couldn't get
any cooler.

809
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:16,442
- I'm sorry.
- Hi.

810
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,877
I'm Sam.

811
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:21,080
What?

812
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:26,986
- Hey.
- Hi.

813
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,954
So you went to see Elliot.

814
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,125
I did.

815
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,493
He's a good guy.

816
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:36,295
He's a good friend to you.

817
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,530
He's one of
the only real friends

818
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:38,724
I've made since I came here.

819
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,102
He texted me as soon
as you left his apartment.

820
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,470
Six hours ago.

821
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:47,382
So I guess
I've just been wondering

822
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:48,507
where you've been.

823
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,677
Well, I, um...

824
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:54,380
I actually took a water taxi

825
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:56,749
to the Statue of Liberty.

826
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:58,784
Just needed some space
so I could think.

827
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:01,787
I went to the High Line
to do the same.

828
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:05,024
Well, then can I go first?

829
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,874
I think I should move out.

830
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,176
I'm not sure that's what I want.

831
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,512
Me neither, but I think...

832
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,547
we need to take a step back

833
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:32,017
for a second together and...

834
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,888
just look at the situation

835
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:39,491
honestly.

836
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,527
It's not working out.

837
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:46,065
After graduation, I just...

838
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,267
moved in and we didn't have
a conversation about it.

839
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,336
We never weighed
the pros and cons.

840
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,705
We never really discussed

841
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,075
if this was
the absolute best thing

842
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,943
for our relationship.

843
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,079
We just wanted to be us.
Together.

844
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:01,914
And-and we are together.

845
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:03,082
We are so together,

846
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:06,385
but I just think that maybe...

847
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,020
living together

848
00:34:08,054 --> 00:34:11,490
in less
than ideal circumstances...

849
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,359
Maybe we don't need
that pressure right now.

850
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:16,095
I mean, it's such
a scary decision to make.

851
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:17,863
I-I just, I feel like I-I...

852
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:19,031
I know, I know.

853
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,332
It is scary,

854
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:23,068
but I think it's
a little less scary if...

855
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,004
we make the decision together.

856
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:26,405
We can't go backwards.

857
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,440
We're not going backwards.

858
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,776
I think we're...

859
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,378
being smart.

860
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:37,049
By protecting something
that is very precious to me.

861
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:40,019
You know that, right?

862
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:42,354
Of course I know that.
Of course.

863
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,390
Always. I know.

864
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:51,163
And no matter who we become,

865
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:53,098
even if we do need alone time...

866
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,800
which is completely valid...

867
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,715
we'll always belong
to each other.

868
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,741
(sighs)

869
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,190
And even though
this-this wasn't a fight,

870
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:11,183
this was just, you know,
a grown-up, adult conversation...

871
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:14,453
you know, we are now

872
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,555
going to have
the hottest makeup sex ever.

873
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,424
Okay.

874
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:21,527
(in high-pitched voice): It never hurts
to sing when you're going on a casting.

875
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,762
You do the best impressions!

876
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,297
That's so Kathy Ireland.

877
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,632
Huh.

878
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,167
Okay, now do Gisele.

879
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:30,336
No, I should probably, uh... I
should probably get some sleep.

880
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,505
I-I got a big follow-up photo
shoot with, uh, Bubble tomorrow.

881
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,440
The wonderbutt undies?

882
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:35,741
Oh, my God, Sam!

883
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,443
Congratulations. That's great.

884
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:39,078
- Thanks.
- Okay, well, look,

885
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:40,346
use these.

886
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,747
I swear by it.

887
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:43,682
It keeps your body
from retaining<i> any</i> water.

888
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:45,985
I have Adderall if you want.

889
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,454
Oh, if you have trouble
sleeping, Marla has Ambien.

890
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,322
I prefer Lunesta.

891
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,091
My schedule's been
so cray lately.

892
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,260
But don't take
whatever Gavin has.

893
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:56,262
He says it's clenbuterol,

894
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:58,430
but I swear
it's like pig tranquilizers.

895
00:35:58,465 --> 00:36:00,199
Sorry. I got to go.

896
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:01,600
(clears his throat)

897
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:03,369
You don't have anything
for anxiety, do you?

898
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:06,372
I don't, uh... don't think
I can stay here.

899
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,140
I hate everything.

900
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:09,775
(door opens) Sam?

901
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:11,043
(door closes)

902
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,611
(laughter) RACHEL:
Oh, my God, you guys

903
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,947
are not gonna believe what
happened to me and Artie today.

904
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:16,515
- Sam? - ARTIE: Sam, come here.
Listen to this.

905
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,710
I know this is going to sound

906
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,951
like one of those crazy
New York stories,

907
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,219
and I wouldn't believe it myself

908
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:21,820
if it hadn't just happened,
but I swear...

909
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,489
- Just tell us.
- Okay, right.

910
00:36:23,523 --> 00:36:24,690
So, Rachel and I
were riding the L-Train.

911
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,992
Take a little nap right now.

912
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:28,928
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Who?

913
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,162
The guy who mugged me.

914
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:31,463
Oh, no.

915
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:32,898
Yeah.

916
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:33,866
Shut up.

917
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,234
Okay, so then, we see this guy,

918
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:36,569
and he's, like, inching
towards this super sweet,

919
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:37,903
elegant, elderly-looking
lady, who'd obviously,

920
00:36:37,938 --> 00:36:39,238
like, had a little
bit of work done,

921
00:36:39,272 --> 00:36:41,240
but it was very tasteful. Just,
like, right around her eyes.

922
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,242
And this guy was eyeing
her gorgeous Hermès Birkin bag.

923
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:44,310
And then...

924
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:46,011
- It's pepper spray.
- Let me do it.

925
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:48,047
Go! Be careful.

926
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:53,562
I cut him off and sprayed him
right in the eye.

927
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,421
God, I felt so vindicated.

928
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:56,422
RACHEL:
It was amazing.

929
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:57,723
And when we got off the subway,

930
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,358
we found out that this
guy got arrested, and

931
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:00,912
it turns out that
he's, like, a mugger,

932
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,195
slash, hoarder, so all this
stuff was just at his apartment.

933
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,763
Yeah, and the cops
found my laptop!

934
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:05,998
- It's amazing.
- Great.

935
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,199
You're like a real
life Professor X.

936
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:08,767
Yeah.
It's so great.

937
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:09,501
That was pretty amazing.

938
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:10,769
BLAINE:
Well, Kurt and I

939
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:12,371
have had a bit of a big day
ourselves, actually.

940
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,973
Well, it wasn't
as dramatic as that.

941
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,108
Well, it-it was...
it was pretty dramatic.

942
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:18,777
Um, we decided
that I'm going to move out.

943
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:20,045
- Shut up!
- Really?

944
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,213
Don't worry.
We're not breaking up.

945
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:22,548
Oh, no, no, no, far from it.

946
00:37:22,582 --> 00:37:23,883
We actually think this is gonna
strengthen our relationship.

947
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,217
Yeah, I said
he needs to discover the city

948
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:26,385
the same way I got to.

949
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:27,553
You know,
find his favorite neighborhood,

950
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:28,721
find his favorite pizza place.

951
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,556
You know, have
some time and space

952
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,758
to explore and grow
and find out who he is here.

953
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,193
BLAINE: And to that
end, my first thought

954
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:36,495
is that I'm a guy
that wouldn't mind crashing

955
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,397
on Sam's couch
in his new apartment.

956
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:41,667
I actually... I actually don't
have a new apartment anymore.

957
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,135
Um, I moved out.

958
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:45,738
That place... it
wasn't it for me.

959
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:48,252
I'm not saying I'm giving up
my dream of being a model.

960
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,074
I still want that

961
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:50,242
more than ever.

962
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:51,644
I just... I want to
do it the right way

963
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:53,879
with, you know, no puking,
pills and eating cotton balls.

964
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:54,947
BLAINE:
Well, that's good.

965
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,582
Maybe we can find
a place together.

966
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:57,449
- Yes.
- Yeah.

967
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,051
- Up top?
- Yeah.

968
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,387
- Guess who's taking over New York?
- (Kurt gasps)

969
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:03,889
- What?! - I mean, this day
couldn't get any better.

970
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:05,090
It could not get any better.

971
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,892
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I missed you guys.

972
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:09,407
Okay, that's it.
You're never leaving now.

973
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:14,433
Just ring it a little bit
to the right. Oh, my gosh, this

974
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,948
apartment is so cute. I'm so
happy that Mercedes is here.

975
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,104
Well, technically,
she's not here,

976
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,472
which is why
we're doing all the work.

977
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,773
And where is she?

978
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:21,807
BLAINE:
She's inside

979
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,843
with Sam... alone.

980
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:24,777
Oh, dear God.

981
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:26,712
I mean, you know, L.A.'s okay

982
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:29,148
if you like sunshine
all the time, which I don't.

983
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,850
- Yeah.
- It makes me squint.

984
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,985
Then I got to thinking
about all of you guys

985
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,987
and all the fun that
you must be having.

986
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,189
And I ain't ashamed to say it.

987
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:38,891
Got a little lonely out there.

988
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,327
I missed you.
Well, I miss everyone.

989
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,196
- Even Rachel? - (laughing):
Yes, even Rachel.

990
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,599
That girl...
she keeps my head in the game.

991
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,467
So I told the producers
that my album

992
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:51,470
needed an East Coast, Harlem,
bebop, uptown kind of vibe.

993
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:52,772
(laughs)

994
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:55,307
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means, but

995
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:56,408
the suckers bought it.

996
00:38:56,443 --> 00:38:57,510
I love the Harlem bebop.
(laughs)

997
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,011
So here I am.

998
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,647
Two bedrooms and a refrigerator.

999
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,749
That's so cool.
It's crazy.

1000
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:04,944
So, uh, what are you gonna...

1001
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,218
what are you gonna do
with the other room?

1002
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:08,254
Oh, well, you know,
I was thinking

1003
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,822
of storing my hair
for my weaves in there.

1004
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,657
But then I got to thinking,

1005
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:12,931
maybe I should rent it out

1006
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,226
to a couple of nerds I
knew back in high school.

1007
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,295
You know, but Blaine
and I need a place,

1008
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:19,365
so, you could just,
you know, rent to us.

1009
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,535
- Oh, you were talking about us.
- Yes, I was.

1010
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,703
Well, listen, that's great. That's amazing.
I heard that. Yeah.

1011
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,005
Yeah. Ah.

1012
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,406
(clears throat)
Uh, what are we, uh...?

1013
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:29,475
But what are we gonna do about
the... our sexual chemistry?

1014
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,043
'Cause it's...

1015
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,946
Uh-uh. No. Been there,
done that. No, Sam.

1016
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,347
Okay, yeah, just friends,
just friends.

1017
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,782
Yeah. This looks
good, though.

1018
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:38,217
All right, fine.
Yeah, just friends.

1019
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,419
- That's a good call. That's
a good call. - Mm-hmm.

1020
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:42,455
Just, uh...

1021
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,256
I will bite your wax lips off.

1022
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,094
Listen, we play by my
rules, or not at all.

1023
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:49,295
Okay?

1024
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,463
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:52,364
Can you tighten that up?

1026
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,033
It's a little loose.

1027
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:59,238
Some people just don't
know how to screw things.

1028
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,606
Come on.

1029
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,280
I really wish
I could be helping you guys.

1030
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,076
Oh, don't worry about it,
Artie. We know you would help.

1031
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,811
Rachel, on the other
hand... I don't know.

1032
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:07,880
What? I'm texting
my publicist.

1033
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:11,083
(singsongy): That was a
joke, but I do have to go!

1034
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,419
We're doing sound and mic
checks now at the theatre.

1035
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,054
Are we still on
for dinner tonight

1036
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:16,248
for our annual Monday night

1037
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,490
because-it's-my-only-night-off
dinner?

1038
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:19,164
Let's do a potluck,
'cause I'm not cooking

1039
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,592
- for everybody.
- Okay. I'm so excited.

1040
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,234
This is going to be
a great new tradition!

1041
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:23,896
I'm gonna go and get pies
now for everyone.

1042
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,897
Taxi!

1043
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:28,167
Taxi! Hey!

1044
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,168
God, I love her style.

1045
00:40:29,202 --> 00:40:31,137
God, I need a break.

1046
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:32,905
