1
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,245
We're on our way to Nashville,

2
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,181
Been traveling quite a spell.

3
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,316
The road's been mighty bumpy!

4
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,618
Yeah, and I don't
feel too well!

5
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,820
We've got to get to Nashville!

6
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,955
Yes, it's really quite a spot!

7
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,158
You're going to
like old Nashville.

8
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,160
I still don't feel so hot!

9
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,961
It's Jamboree time!

10
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,863
Jamboree time!

11
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,867
I can hardly wait to
meet up with the crowd!

12
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,770
It's Jamboree time!

13
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,806
Jamboree time!

14
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:23,711
Come on, let me hear
it, clear and loud!

15
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,648
We're on our way!
We're on our way!

16
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,885
We're on our way to a
swinging Jamboree!

17
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,087
Yeah! We're on our way.

18
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,557
We're on our way!

19
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,931
We're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee, 000eeee!

20
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,930
Drop it!

21
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,638
It's okay. Sorry you got
caught in the middle!

22
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,106
What's goin' on?

23
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,708
- Spies!
- Spies!

24
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,311
That's right! Over in
Acme City, and these hills.

25
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,247
- They're all over the place!
- Let's get out of here!

26
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,783
Jeepers, you have to relax!

27
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,551
You're headed for a
nervous breakdown

28
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,353
If you don't
unwind a little bit!

29
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,355
Well, don't worry ma'am,
they won't bother you,

30
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,657
Uh, unless you're carrying
some secrets in this guitar!

31
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,894
- You entertainers?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,563
We're on our way to Nashville.
We're doin' a Jamboree there!

33
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,098
- Well, good luck!
- Thank you.

34
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,566
The road's clear.
You can pass on.

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,801
Thank you.

36
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,512
Woody, we have to do
something about Jeepers!

37
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,713
Yeah, I know!

38
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,847
He's been working
night and day,

39
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,349
And I think his
nerves are on edge!

40
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,485
- Jeeps.
- What?

41
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,686
Now Jeepers,

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,622
You know we appreciate
what you've done for us.

43
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,089
We sure do, Jeep!

44
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,825
And, I realize you've
worked awfully hard

45
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,126
To try to get
the show lined up

46
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,828
So we could appear
back in Nashville.

47
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,095
That's right!
And, the show isn't

48
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,631
- until tomorrow night.
- That's right.

49
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,098
And, Woody and I are
going to find a nice,

50
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,900
Quiet, restful place for you.

51
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,402
We'll see that you relax.

52
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,473
Yeah, relax. That's what
Jeepers needs, relax.

53
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,782
Howdy!

54
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,850
Hi! Thought this
place was closed!

55
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,285
Well, it should be!

56
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,621
- Nobody ever comes this way!
- Where are we?

57
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,823
- Sleepy Junction.
- Sleepy Junction.

58
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,558
- Where are we?
- Sleepy Junction.

59
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:25,693
Oh!

60
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,327
Hey Woody! We're in
Sleepy Junction!

61
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,564
Sir, we're looking for a nice,
quiet place to spend the night.

62
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,566
- Uh, a motel.
- No.

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,468
- A hotel.
- No.

64
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,437
A boarding house?

65
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,639
Ma'am, there just ain't
nothin' around here!

66
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,907
What happened to this place?

67
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,843
Everybody moved out!
Moved over to Acme City!

68
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,778
They got a big
missile plant there,

69
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,279
And the people go
where the work is.

70
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,383
Jeeps, I'm sorry buddy.

71
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,952
But, we'll find a place for
you, so you can rest and relax.

72
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,154
Aw, that's okay.
I feel good now.

73
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,456
I'm not nervous or anything.

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,660
- Thunder?
- Thunder!

75
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,164
Yeah, it looks like a
storm's coming up!

76
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,033
It don't look too
good, does it?

77
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,968
Hey! I just
thought of something!

78
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,970
There's the old
Beauregard mansion!

79
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,439
Oh, it's quiet alright!

80
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,974
At least you'd get in out of the
rain, and have a place to stay!

81
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,410
- Well, where is it?
- Just follow this road.

82
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,612
Thank you.

83
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,365
Hey! Wait!

84
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,934
I forgot to tell
'em it's haunted!

85
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,126
Hurry up! That rain's going
to be coming down any minute!

86
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,065
Wait! Listen! Listen!

87
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,369
Jeepers! Come on!

88
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,371
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Oh no!

89
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,873
Well, come on!

90
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,113
What are you two waiting for?

91
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,115
I'm waiting for my
courage to come back!

92
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,550
Come on, let's go!

93
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,493
I think my courage
just left again!

94
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,662
Oh Jeepers! It's just
a shutter that fell!

95
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,456
Listen, I don't like
this place one little bit!

96
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,032
Heehaha! Heeha!

97
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,969
I said, put that
monkey back in the cage!

98
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,372
- Alright, alright!
- I want him to stay
in the cage!

99
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,909
If he comes out once more,
once more, I'll kill him!

100
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,712
Oh Anatole, you get in
there, be a good boy.

101
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,915
Be a good boy. Ahnananana!

102
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,917
- Be quiet!
- (GORILLA) Ohohoh! Ohohoh!

103
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,420
You shouldn't talk to Anatole
like that! He's sensitive!

104
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,755
(GORILLA) Euch!
Euch! Euch! Euch!

105
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,123
Stay away from that monkey!

106
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,800
Well, it's not
exactly a Hilton hotel!

107
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:05,879
Oh!

108
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,150
Jeeps, go get the
television set!

109
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,855
- Let's start a fire!
- Okay!

110
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,259
Hey, I'd put the top up on the
car, but I know it don't work!

111
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,065
Hey! This is kind of fun, you
know? Sorta like camping out!

112
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,936
I'd like to explore this
place once we get settled down!

113
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,422
Woody?
There's something out there!

114
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,425
- What?
- Calm down, boy.

115
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,963
Listen, I saw uh, uh,
a thing out there!

116
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:59,099
Jeepers, you're a nervous wreck!
Now you're seeing things!

117
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,601
- I am?
- Boy, you in bad shape!

118
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,705
What you need is to relax!

119
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,374
Now, I want you to know
Jeeps, no matter what happens,

120
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,309
That you've been
one of the best

121
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,511
Little business
managers anybody could have.

122
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,846
But, you need to unwind!

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,581
Come over here and sit down
in this comfortable chair,

124
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,083
And just relax man!

125
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,419
That's what I'll
do. I gotta relax!

126
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,055
Sing him a song Woody,
that always relaxes him!

127
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,257
Alright!

128
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,927
Jeeps, this is one I was telling
you about I wrote the other day.

129
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,929
Called uh,

130
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,164
What was the name of that?
Oh, uh, 'Livin' in a Trance'.

131
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,299
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah!

132
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,267
Yeah, let me begin here.

133
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:41,709
You cast a spell on me,

134
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:45,578
The first time we met.

135
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:51,084
Bewitched and enchanted
at first glance.

136
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,023
I didn't know then,

137
00:10:56,056 --> 00:11:00,060
The spell that I was in.

138
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,999
Now I'm living in a trance.

139
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,006
Living in a trance.

140
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:20,013
In a world of lost romance,

141
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:27,220
I never had a chance.

142
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:34,795
Living in a trance.

143
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:41,401
Living in a trance.

144
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,975
Duhhh, duh-deh-duh...

145
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,878
Shhh! He's sleeping
like a baby!

146
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,914
Is he asleep, or
is he hypnotized?

147
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,415
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

148
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,593
Who's there? Wait a
minute, I'll see who it is!

149
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,301
Who's there? Come on,
speak up, who is it?

150
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,337
- Nobody!
- Well, come on in then!

151
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,977
You a ghost?

152
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,847
Not yet, but, you durn near
scared the life out of us!

153
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,315
Me too!

154
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,716
What are you doin' here?

155
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,051
We were just passing by,

156
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,486
And we thought we heard guitar
music coming from this place!

157
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,688
Oh! That was me!
You live around here?

158
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,224
Just over the hill.

159
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,625
We figured, if it was a ghost,

160
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,894
It must be friendly if
it plays the guitar!

161
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,495
What makes you
think it was a ghost?

162
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,097
'Cause, this place is haunted!

166
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,904
Huh! You're one of
the lucky ones.

167
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,973
Oh, I don't think
nothin' will happen!

168
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,575
Come on in and warm
yourselves by the fire.

169
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,077
Okay?

170
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,380
Yup. There's all
kinds of strange lights

171
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,916
And strange sounds always
comin' on around this place.

183
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,309
We play and sing a little.

184
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,178
How about singin' one for us?

185
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,512
We'd like to!

186
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,381
I feel like we're
auditioning an act!

187
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,183
Well, you never know where
you'll find good singers!

188
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,953
There is one song that we
sing about this mansion,

189
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,189
And 'Old Tom Cat',
one of the ghosts here.

190
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,059
Years ago, this song was
made famous in these parts.

191
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,572
Now, old Uncle John had
troubles of his own,

192
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,443
He had an old yellow cat
that wouldn't leave home.

193
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,780
He tried everything he
knew to keep the cat away.

194
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:11,584
He even gave it to a preacher
and told him to stay,

195
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,888
But the cat came back...
The cat came back.

196
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,757
I thought he was a goner,
but the cat came back.

197
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,260
'Cause he wouldn't stay away!

198
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,100
Now, he gave the old cat
to a man in a balloon.

199
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,670
He told the man to leave him
with the man in the moon.

200
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,308
The balloon, it busted,
and everybody said,

201
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:39,112
Ten miles away they
picked a man up dead,

202
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,315
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.

203
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,052
I thought he was a goner,
but the cat came back,

204
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,620
'Cause he wouldn't stay away.

205
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:51,458
Bum-de-dum, bum-bum-bum-de-doo

206
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,627
Now the cat was a terror,
and they thought it was best,

207
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,998
To give him to a feller
that was headed out West.

208
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,702
The train went around a corner,
and it hit a broken rail,

209
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,839
Not a soul aboard the
train lived to tell the tale,

210
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,043
But the cat came back.
The cat came back.

211
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,779
I thought it was a goner,
but the cat came back.

212
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,315
'Cause it wouldn't stay away.

213
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:19,286
Bum, bum, bum-by-um, bum.

214
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,422
Now the farmer on the corner's
gonna kill the cat at sight,

215
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,792
He loaded up his gun
with nails and dynamite.

216
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,363
Well, he waited in the garden
'till the cat came around,

217
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:34,434
And seven little pieces of
the man was all they found!

218
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,637
But, the cat came back!
The cat came back!

219
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,373

but the cat came back.

315
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,632
Yet tonight, you walked
right into the house

316
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,301
As if you were some
neighbor on a social jaunt!

317
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,836
I saw a strange car,

318
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,572
And I decided to
make an investigation.

319
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,775
Such foolish investigation
endangers the whole project!

320
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,110
No matter what your authority,

321
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,178
You've no right to
take such risks,

322
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,248
Especially since we're so
close to achieving our goal!

323
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,851
You know perfectly well
that we often have visitors

324
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,954
Who are curious to discover if
this is really a haunted house.

325
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,090
The simple fact is, that if
you had contacted us by radio,

326
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,026
We could have notified
you of our visitors.

327
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,228
What is done, is done!

328
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,263
So, we are no longer safe.

329
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:49,035
You have always known this was
not a safe business to be in.

330
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,703
But, tonight is
our last night!

331
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,205
It's foolish to endanger
the entire project!

332
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:02,081
Don't worry! Everything
is going to be alright!

333
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,985
Bad news.

334
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,621
- Why? What happened?
- The car won't start!

335
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,558
- Oh no!
- Yippee!

336
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:14,894
Well, I guess we'll just
spend the night here.

337
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,664
Jeeps, you can help me
build the fire up some.

338
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,900
We'll bake it so it
will last until morning.

339
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,571
And, I think we ought to
stick real close together.

340
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,607
- Good thinking!
- Boots, I want you to...

341
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,010
Boots?

342
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,314
- Boots? Boots?
- Oh boys!

343
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,016
Here I am.

344
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,519
Come and see what I've found!

345
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,220
Where are you?

346
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,424
What do you mean runnin' off?

347
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,159
Well, I was just
down this hall!

348
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,828
Well, we've got to
stick together!

349
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,297
- Yeah! We got to tick together!
- I'm sorry!

350
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,899
We don't know what's
goin' on in this house!

351
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,701
- Anything could happen!
- Okay!

352
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,402
Come on and see what I found!

353
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:02,709
When I open this door, you
won't believe what's inside!

354
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,811
By now, I'd believe anything!

355
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,888
You're right! I
don't believe it!

356
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,690
Isn't it beautiful?

357
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:21,761
Oh, I could spend forever
right in this one little room!

358
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,196
It's so elegant!

359
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,906
Maybe this is the room of
the great lady of the house,

360
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,843
That's been kept
exactly as she left it!

361
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:41,881
Way back in the Civil War days,
when she was a southern belle!

362
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:55,695
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,

363
00:24:55,728 --> 00:25:02,602
Satin, and lace
from across the sea.

364
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:10,509
Gowns! Gowns! Beautiful gowns,

365
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:17,584
Bring back a precious memory.

For people in love.

As we dance, dance,

The gown I was wearing,

373
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,182
Hypnotized.

374
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,120
So I gaily

375
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,624
Danced through the night

376
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:03,529
In my lovely gown of white.

Loo-loo-loo.

Loo-loo-loo-loo,

Loo-loo, loo-loo.

385
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:38,430
A summer night

386
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,034
Twinkling stars above,

387
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:45,972
A night so right,

For people in love.

389

As we dance, dance,

390
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:00,252
I realize,

391
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,290
The gown I was wearing

392
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,626
Hypnotized.

393
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,297
So, I gaily

394
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,234
Danced through the night,

395
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:21,273
In my lovely gown of white.

to get out of here!

Oh, but it's so beautiful!
I could stay here forever!

00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,137
Well, let's go.

Let me in! Is someone there?

00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:18,064
Yes Madam Wong!
There are three of them.

404
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:24,503
What beautiful trespassers!
Ah, who are you?

405
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,574
I'm Woody Weatherby,
Boots Malone, and Jeepers.

406
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:33,179
Delighted! Now, tell me what
are you doing in my house?

407
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,646
Oh! We didn't know
it was your house!

408
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,582
I bought the
Beauregard Mansion,

409
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:40,319
So that I could restore it
to its original beauty.

410
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,822
We didn't mean to trespass!

411
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:46,358
Well, never mind. Just tell me,
what are you doing here!

412
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,660
Well, it looked like a
storm was comin' up,

413
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,363
And we needed a place to stay.

414
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,000
Come! Let us leave this room.

415
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,007
Of course, you
cannot stay here!

416
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,977
Haven't my ghosts
bothered you?

417
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,245
Well...

418
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,280
- Are they real ghosts?
- Of course they are!

419
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,217
I told you we should
have gotten out of here!

420
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,053
Ma'am, if you'll just
let us spend the night.

421
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,888
You see, we're entertainers,

422
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,623
And we're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee,

423
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,958
To do a Jamboree there.

424
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,793
And, I'm afraid our
car won't start.

425
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,563
And uh, well, we're gonna
have to wait until morning.

426
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,634
Tell me, what kind of
entertaining do you do?

427
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,370
I'm a singer.
And, I pick a guitar.

428
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,139
How charming.

429
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,642
And, what do you do my dear?

430
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,577
I sing, and dance.

431
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,614
Ah, that's nice, nice.
Are you an entertainer?

432
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,917
Uh, no. Not exactly.

433
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,919
What are you exactly?

I are exactly his

What's goin' on?

436
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,831
I don't know, but,
it looks phony.

437
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,532
They seem real nice to me!

438
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:16,048
I have decided that, uh, you
may stay, at least for tonight.

439
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,317
- Well, fine!
- Let me warn you.

440
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,687
Stay in that room.
You'll be much safer.

441
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,355
We'll stay right
by the fireplace.

442
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,590
Good!

443
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,134
We sure do, hey, they've gone!

444
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,405
- Where'd they go?
- They didn't go out that door!

445
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,773
You think, maybe
she was a ghost too?

446
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,842
Sure seemed real to me!

447
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,711
Well anyway, she was nice

448
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,579
Letting us stay
here and all tonight.

449
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,648
Well, let's settle down
and try to get some rest.

And, I scarcely could
believe the song I heard.

It told of how you
left me for another.

written every word.

you done me wrong.

Someone told my
story in a song.

seen the way you left me,

00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:41,953
For he told it all and
never missed a line.

475
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:49,261
He told of swinging
doors and a juke box.

476
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:57,136
He even knew I
almost lost my mind.

477
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:04,410
Someone told my
story in a song.

478
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:12,618
The lyrics told of
happiness that's gone.

479
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,159
Then it told of how
you'd done me wrong.

480
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:27,599
Someone told my
story in a song.

481
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,805
Now, we give you Jim Kent.

482
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,284
Hi there shoes,

483
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:50,021
Are you the ones
she wore last night?

484
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,060
Was she with him?

485
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,665
Did he hug and hold her tight?

486
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:07,206
Or, was she just out walking

487
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,142
Like she said,

488
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,911
Down by the sea.

489
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,481
Tell me shoes,

490
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:20,619
Was she stepping out on me?

491
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,957
Oh say there telephone,

492
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:31,330
Did he call here
and talk to her?

493
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,236
Did he say, he'd meet her

494
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:41,307
- at their rendezvous.
- Woody?

495
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,141
Woody! Boots?

496
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,978
Did you hear her say,

497
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,981
She couldn't wait

498
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,150
To be with him.

499
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:58,557
Is that why she wasn't here

500
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,060
To answer you?

501
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,465
Hi there pretty dress.

502
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:11,870
Are you the one that
she would choose?

503
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,808
While I called here,

504
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:21,547
Were you out with
one or with two?

505
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:28,754
Did he put his
arms around you,

506
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:33,325
As he held her tenderly.

507
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:40,532
Tell me dress, was she
stepping out on me?

508
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,809
Woody?
Woody wake up!
Boots!

509
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,045
- Boots!
- What's going on?

510
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,147
For crying out loud, Jeeps!

511
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:59,318
Look at the T.V.!
Look at the television!

512
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,453
That's very nice, Jeepers.

513
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:05,090
Yeah, he picks a mean guitar.
Now, let's go back to sleep!

514
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,093
No! I saw these two weird
faces on the television.

515
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,228
Ah hell, you're watchin'
the late, late, show!

516
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,963
What late, late show?

517
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,966
Listen, I saw that
Chinese lady and her friend!

518
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,103
- Well, so did I!
- I mean on the television!

519
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,441
Jeepers, you're in bad shape!
You need a long, long, rest!

520
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,242
If you don't stop
seeing things,

521
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,144
You're going to end up
in the 'funny farm'!

522
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,617
Well, I saw something!
And, it looked like 'em!

523
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,085
(RATTLING AND WIND)

524
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,458
Now, I'm hearing things!

525
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,829
They are entertainers.

526
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,498
- Oh really!
- Of course they are!

527
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:49,100
You take their word
unconditionally?

528
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,371
They were carrying guitars,
weren't they Matt?

529
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,239
Yeah! Two or three of them!

530
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,908
Anyone can play a guitar!
That doesn't make entertainers!

531
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,411
In fact, it could well
be a cover disguise!

532
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,648
I believe, they're from
the master organization

533
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,350
To halt enemy resistance!

534
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,820
M.

535
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,689
O.

536
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,524
T.

537
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,593
H.

538
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,328
E.

539
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,129
R.

540
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,699
Oh!

541
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,034
- He's right!
- Oh come now!

542
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,771
They are not 'Mother' agents.

543
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,539
I'll take care of them!

544
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,475
The torture wheel!

545
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,544
The rack! Hehehehe!

546
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:36,314
And, the iron maiden!

547
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,384
Effective, but primitive!

548
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,587
We have other methods.
Quicker and surer!

549
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,156
No! We must not waste
time eliminating three,

550
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,827
Who are obviously nothing
more than what they appear!

551
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,962
Then you still think
that they're entertainers?

552
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,231
You don't want us
even to question them?

553
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,734
I thought we had
resolved that problem!

554
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,371
Well, I suppose we must bow to
her judgment in this matter.

555
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:03,475
As long as I am in
charge, you must!

556
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,130
I wish I could be as
sure of them as you are.

557
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,567
Dr. Himmel will
continue to observe them,

558
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,603
While I attempt to
contact headquarters.

559
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,652
- Yes?
- Who are you?

560
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,587
Agent Ming Toy.

561
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,490
Thirty-eight,
twenty-four,
thirty-six.

562
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,359
Oh!
Let me speak to the Chief.

563
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,194
One moment, please.

564
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,834
Good evening, Dr. Fu.

565
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:06,404
Kreagar, have you the
rest of the formula?

566
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,106
No, but Maximillian is leaving

567
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,908
Almost immediately
with Madame Wong.

568
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,309
Let him make contact tonight

569
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,645
With the agent at the
Acme City Missile Plant,

570
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,147
At which time they'll receive
the balance of the formula.

571
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,716
Excellent.

572
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,384
When we receive the
balance of the formula,

573
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,119
We'll report back
to you at once.

574
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,221
I will be expecting your call.

575
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,223
Meantime, may I suggest

576
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,493
That you have everything
in readiness for the test.

577
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,060
Of course.

578
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,130
Well, now it's up to you.

579
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:35,767
I suggest that you keep in
close radio contact with us.

580
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,969
We will. Come Max.

581
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,338
Anatole, I've got it!

582
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,009
He, he, he.

583
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,712
- Max!
- Huh?

584
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,848
Don't you realize we
have important business?

585
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,116
- Yeah.
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

586
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,051
Gentlemen! This is no
time for disagreement.

587
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,154
Max, here's your laboratory
smock, your identification card,

588
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,089
- and your badge.
Good luck.
- Yeah.

589
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:10,001
Woo! Woo!

590
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:17,035
Hi there! Working kind
of late, aren't you?

591
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,169
Yeah.

592
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,772
You scientists
really work hard.

593
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:21,973
Yeah, that's right.

594
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,275
Hey, you're new
here, aren't you?

595
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,844
Yeah, sure.

596
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,514
I thought so. I didn't recognize
your face. What project you on?

597
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,983
It's top secret. No comment.

598
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:35,386
Ooooh, that's alright,
I know all about them.

599
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,355
I been workin'
here for five years.

600
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,557
The things I know, and
the things I've heard,

601
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,892
You wouldn't believe!

602
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,629
I tell you one thing, if
anybody wanted to be a spy,

603
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:46,364
The thing to do is
become a janitor.

604
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,499
Janitor knows
everything that goes on.

605
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,168
I ain't got time
for conversation,

606
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,537
- now, let me by will ya?
- Sure. Sure.

607
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,607
I see you're
cleared for top secret.

608
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,177
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hey, that's pretty good.

609
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,179
Of course, I'm cleared
for top secret too.

610
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,848
Janitors have to be.

611
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,450
Well, I told you I ain't
got time for conversation!

612
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,952
Now, let me by, will ya?

613
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,289
Locked out, huh?

614
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,059
It looks like it.

615
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,996
That's okay. Don't
worry, I've got the key.

616
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,933
As long as you're
cleared with security.

617
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,405
- Huh, huh, thanks a lot.
- Glad to help.

618
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:31,342
Hey, uh, ain't you
forgettin' something?

619
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,879
Oh, that. Thank ya.

620
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,527
- Are you George?
- Yes.

621
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,331
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.

622
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,466
Give it to me!

623
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:13,484
If you'd betray your
country, you'd betray us.

624
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,154
Augh!

625
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:51,757
Oooooh! Owuoh!

626
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,659
Oooh!

627
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,898
No, no, don't try
to say anything.

628
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:01,466
I'll, I'll get help for you.

629
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:15,881
Yeah, Chief? This is Jim.
My partner's just been shot.

630
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,350
Yeah. You'd better get an
ambulance over here right away.

631
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,887
No, he hasn't
said anything yet.

632
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,892
I'll follow through. You'd
better hurry! Okay, will do.

633
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,660
- Now don't try to say anything.
- Ooh!

634
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,297
- Ooh!
- Take it easy.

635
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:37,002
The old Beauregard mansion.
Ooh!

636
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:53,351
The mission is completed.

637
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,821
- Do you have the formula?
- Yes.

638
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,695
That's what we've
been waiting for.

639
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,098
I'll be glad to get out of
this cold, damp cellar!

640
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,100
We both need a
vacation, Kreagar.

641
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,569
- Um-hum, Florida.
- The Caribbean.

642
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,906
- Wait a minute.
Um, Mexico.
- Puerto Vallarta.

643
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,908
Ah, marvelous! Come on.
Let's call the Chief!

644
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,210
Just to let him know our
mission was successful,

645
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,946
And we'll be calling
with the formula soon.

646
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:33,224
I don't believe in ghosts.

647
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:37,528
I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.

I don't believe in ghosts.

649
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,138
I forgot about that door.

650
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,078
It looks as though he's
waiting for someone.

651
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,115
Or, he may be initiating
an investigation,

652
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,084
Whatever Madame may think.

653
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,853
Madame is not always right.

654
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,155
We may be making
a grave mistake.

655
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,624
I don't think
they're entertainers.

656
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,793
- They're not in costume.
- True. Quite true.

657
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,765
Yes?

658
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,035
It looks like we
are being followed.

659
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:20,271
- Can you lose them?
- Of course we can.

660
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,679
- Are you alright?
- We lost them.

661
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,462
Imagination, that's
probably what it was.

662
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,201
I wonder, perhaps we should
question one of our visitors.

663
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,938
Hmmm?

(ANATOLE MAKES NOISES)

665
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,412
What'd you say?

666
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,950
- You awake?
- Awake!

667
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,653
How do expect me to sleep,

668
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,555
With you rollin'
around half the night?

669
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,158
Sorry about that chief.

670
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,561
It's a bad sign, Jeeps.
What were you talkin' about?

671
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,696
I don't know. That's the
first time I heard it.

672
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,032
Well, when you figure it
out, tell me all about it,

673
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,600
When I'm wide awake.

674
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,713
I'm telling you,

675
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,448
There's something
goin' on in this house.

676
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,317
Sure, it's your uh...

677
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,586
Well, I can't be
imaginating all of this!

678
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,854
I don't know. You've been
doin' pretty good at it.

679
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:47,225
- Now, go back to sleep.
- I can't go to sleep!

(MUFFLED CRIES FROM BOOTS)

681
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,261
You hear that?

682
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,530
That all depends on
what it sounds like.

683
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:55,500
It sounds like somebody's
moaning or somethin'.

684
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,069
- Yeah, the wind.
- Oh.

685
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,872
- What's that?
- I don't know. Let me see.

686
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,609
- Shutters?
- I don't think so.

687
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,677
Maybe nothin', huh.

the side of the house.

690
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,417
Yeah.

691
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,886
Help! Help me!

692
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,823
Naw, that sounds
like somethin'.

693
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,792
- Imagination.
- No, that sounded like...

694
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,928
Boots?

695
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,367
- She's gone!
Well, don't panic!
- I'm not! I'm not!

696
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,303
Don't panic! We would have heard
the door by the way it squeaks.

697
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:33,871
Let's try the hall!

698
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,551
Boots?

699
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,020
Boots?

700
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,423
Where are you, Boots?
Check the closet.

701
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,430
Anything in there?

702
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:02,533
Just a wierdwolf. A wierdwolf!

703
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:12,577
- Wait a minute.
- Well, what?

704
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,513
- We can't forget Boots.
- Oh, yeah.

705
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,949
What am I running for?
I didn't see anything!
Come on.

Don't pick on poor old
Anatole all the time!

709
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,567
He's not so bad.

710
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,035
Don't you remember,
I said just now that

711
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,637
We ought to question
one of our visitors?

712
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,871
Yes.

713
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:43,974
Well, he must have heard us
talking and he wants to help us.

714
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:46,644
The only smart
thing he's ever done.

Huh, ha, ha, ha.

716
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,483
Jeeps, we've got to separate.

717
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:56,154
I'll go upstairs. You go
outside and look around.

718
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,223
Okay.

719
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,993
- Say, Woody?
- Yeah.

720

really thinking about it

721
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:07,698
For three or four seconds,

722
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,700
Don't you think we
ought to stick together?

723
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,336
You're not afraid, are you?

724
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,672
Well, I never won
any bravery contest.

725

Why don't you take that hat
off. It might be bad luck.

726
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,213
Oh, okay.

727
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,929
And, I thought
the front was bad!

728
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,632
Man, it's spooky out here!

729
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,270

730
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,474
Hey, honey.
Boots, where are you?

731
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,576
Well, she's not out here.

732
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,077
- Let's go back in.
- Hold it.

- Must be wind.
- Yeah, I guess so.

little closer.

something's behind us.

- You sure?
- I think so.

742
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:09,019
- You think we ought to look?
- I'm almost afraid to.

743
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:13,691
I'll count to three, then
we'll both turn and look.

Well, I ain't lookin'
for new talent!

752
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,759
They seem
thoroughly frightened.

753
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:51,095
You should get rid of
them once and for all.

754
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:53,498
If it doesn't work, we'll
have to take drastic measures.

755
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,400
Should we question
the girl now?

756
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:59,270
Let's wait, at least
until Madame returns.

757
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,272
Are you afraid of her?

758
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,543
We're all dependent on each
other in this operation.

759
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,245
Hmmm, we could
still question her.

without Madame Wong,

We get no payment
for our services.

762
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,920
I think it's imperative that
we wait until she returns.

763
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:17,722
We could start questioning.

764
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,089
I have no intention

765
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:21,426
Of jeopardizing our
position with Madame.

766
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:24,562
I suspect she'll be angry enough
when she sees the young lady.

- It's not our fault!
- Yeah, I know, the gorilla.

Hey Woody. Man, I'm
putting this hat back on!

769
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,273
I wonder where she went to.

770
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,743
Stand right where you are.

771
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,312
I suggest you
raise your hands.

772
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,548

- The gorilla did it!

I told you to
leave them alone.

777
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,640
Never-the-less, I decided that
we should question one of them.

Perhaps you are right. Hmmm.

to answer questions.

find my girl singer.

00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,276
My guitar?

791
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,349
Play!

792
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,119
Look, that girl
may be in trouble!

793
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,622
If you're an entertainer, you
can play any time, now go on!

794
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:12,703
Well, perhaps you
are entertainers.

795
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,905
Now, would you mind
telling' me what's happening?

796
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:19,076
Have you ever heard
of M.O.T.H.E.R.?

797
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,815
M.O.T.H.E.R.,
that spells mother!

798
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:29,319
I know 'Mother McCree', and
some other songs about mother.

799
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:30,455
M.O.T.H.E.R. is,

800
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,958
Master Organization To
Halt Enemy Resistance.

801
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,260
'Mother', hey
that's clever, huh?

802
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,364
My name's Jim Meadows.

803
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,032
'Mother' agent number thirty.

804
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,802
We're after an organization
whose sole purpose

805
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,237
Is espionage and
counter-espionage.

806
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,907
They will contact
and sell to anyone.

807
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,042
I thought that you
were contact agents.

808
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,645
We wouldn't know a
contact agent if we saw one!

809
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:57,682
Tell me one thing.
How did you get here?

810
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,350
Well, it's a long story.

811
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,521
Yesterday, we were
driving down the highway

812
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,289
On our way to Nashville.

813
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,424
Alright, let's begin.
What's your name?

814
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:10,728
- Boots Malone.
- Boots Malone.

815
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:17,635
Her name is Boots Malone.

816
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,104
Is that all the information
you got from her?

817
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:22,306
- That's all we asked.
- I'll kill her.

818
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,041
Oh Max, shut up!

819
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:26,977
It's my opinion that
Boots Malone is a code name.

820
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,412
Quite possible.

821
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:32,917
- Boots. Boots.
- What could that mean?

822
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,954
I don't know. Ahhh, Malone!

823
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:41,626
- Ma-lone.
- Ma, ma, that's it!

824
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,961
Ma is a colloquialism
for 'Mother'!

825
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,430
She's a 'Mother' agent,
just as we thought!

826
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,198
Now, lone,

827
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:51,902
Lone, I, o, n, e.

828
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:54,839
Got it! L-1.

829
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:58,142
She is 'Mother' agent L-1!

830
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:02,947
What are you talking about?
My mother's in Las Vegas!

831
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,983
You leave the
interrogation to us.

832
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:08,318
You go make contact
with headquarters.

833
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:10,487
And, Max give
them the formula.

834
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,171
We have been waiting.

835
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,173
We have the
balance of the formula.

836
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,008
Dr. Himmel will
read it to you.

837
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:38,649
C-three, H-five,
radical, 0-number-three.

838
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:41,451
- Is that all?
- No. There's more.

839
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:44,154
It would be much
simpler if you'd talk.

840
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,291
Talk! Talk about what?

841
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:51,228
Four,
immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.

842
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,798
Beta-ameno-thexalaine.

843
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,668
Could you repeat that please?

844
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:01,572
We have ways of
making people talk.

845
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:03,841
H-five-radical,
0-number-three.

846
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,576
- Four...
- Come on.

847
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,511
Immedasoli-bi-tholomaine.

848
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,113
Beta-amenothexalaine.

849
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,850
Heh, heh, he, huh-huh. We have
waited so long for someone.

850
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,785
- Heh, heh, hee.
- Help me! Somebody!

851
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:18,155
I don't know any
of this. Aaaaahh!

852
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,157
Aaaaahhhhh!

853
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,995
Aaaahhhh!

854
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,936
Aaaaahhhh!

855
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:34,271
Aaahhh!

856
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,445
Now, I think perhaps you had
better answer a few questions!

857
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:44,414
- Alright!
- Did 'Mother' send you?

858
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:47,818
I told you, my
mother's in Las Vegas!

859
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,857
This is the bedroom of
the lady that lives here.

860
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,693
Nobody lives here! This place
has been for sale for years!

861
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,933
Well, there is
somebody living here.

862
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,102
Maybe it's a ghost.

863
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:07,204
I'll have to see that
before I believe it.

864
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,573
That's where we saw that
wierdwolf, over there.

865
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,877
- In that closet there.
- I want to take a look.

866
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:29,727
Here's your werewolf.
Come take a look.

867
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:35,465
Here he is!

868
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,903
Well, that's sure going to a lot
of trouble just to scare a guy.

869
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,838
This whole house is rigged!

870
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,673
We've got to get out of here.
Let's go find that girl.

871
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:03,160
Put her in there.
That'll make her talk!

872
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:07,331
Oh! Oh! No! Oh! Ahgh!

873
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:13,938
Help! Help! Help!

874
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,473
Help!

875
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:18,142
Help!

876
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,110
Help! Help!

877
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,846
We may have some
trouble relocating all this

878
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,714
Equipment on our
new assignment.

879
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:25,582
Well, let's start
dismantling it.

880
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,185
No, we'd better wait until
we get a report from Dr. Fu.

881
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:30,320
We should have
heard from him by now.

882
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,922
There's no need to be anxious.

883
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:33,891
It'll take some time to
put the formula through.

884
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,492
There are some
elaborate tests to be made.

885
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,027
And, there are two
parts to the formula.

886
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:39,629
Could you determine what
the ingredients were?

887
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:43,200
No. Of course, I didn't have
time to examine, it carefully.

888
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:46,971
There's some strange
and unusual components.

889
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,606
Maybe something entirely
new in atomic research.

890
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,876
Hmmm, let's see.

891
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:58,148
No. There's nothing
here I recognize.

892
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:07,157
Do you think that
maybe we should split up?

893
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,759
Well, alright.

894
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,895
Why don't you take upstairs.
I'll take the outside.

895
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,230
- What about me?
- Why don't you go with him?

896
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,066
Oh by the way, what
does she look like?

897
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,204
Blonde, blue eyes,
very beautiful.

898
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,749
You have been tricked!

899
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,652
This formula is a fake!

900
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,054
You gave me the formula for

901
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,490
Nitroglycerin and
an antihistamine!

902
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,893
- How can that be?
- Are you certain?

903
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,361
We are certain!

904
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,563
Our contact must have
been a 'Mother' agent!

905
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,565
It is too dangerous
to stay there.

906
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,801
Move quickly to
your next assignment!

907
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,270
Well, what about the girl?

908
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:58,008
Poor Max! How you would
love to dispose of the girl!

909
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:01,812
- The girl can identify us.
- We can leave her here.

910
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,449
No one will ever find her.
No one will even hear her!

911
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:08,018
Help! Help!

912
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,109
Our next assignment
is in Allamagoridore.

913
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,911
Oh! I'm looking
forward to that!

914
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,713
The dry climate will be
wonderful for my sinuses!

915
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:40,017
- But, I'll miss this house.
- It has been fun, hasn't it?

916
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:42,519
Perhaps, we could create
another haunted house.

917
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,921
No!

918
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,455
Could we try the
ghost just once more?

919
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,491
- No!
- Oh! Just once more!

920
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:51,628
We'll find something else that
will be just as fulfilling.

921
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,497
Max, go check the car.

922
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,833
Kreagar and Dr. Himmel will take
care of the others upstairs.

923
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,003
Come, we'll take
the passageway.

924
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:33,530
Now, wouldn't you say
that was some trick?

925
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:36,300
Boy, I'd say that
was some trick.

926
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,168
Boy, isn't it! You
sure it's a trick?

927
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:40,104
Why sure it's a trick!
What else could it be?

928
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,506
- Well, it could be a ghost!
- Naw.

929
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,308
It sure does look
real! Don't it?

930
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,443
Yeah. Go away!
You don't scare us!

931
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,812
Leave my house!

932
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,215
You are intruders!

933
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:53,483
Leave my house!

934
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,621
Leave my house!

935
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,291
Don't move!

936
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:06,530
- Now, they look real, enough.
- So do the guns!

937
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,598
After them!

938
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,282
Help! Let me out!

939
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,818
Help! Let me out!

940
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,722
- Are you alright?
- I think so.

941
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:35,159
Boy, am I glad to
see a friendly face!

942
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:37,127
- Who are you?
- I'll explain later.

943
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,344
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

944
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,648
That gorilla must be
playing games again!

945
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,085
- We'll stop him.
- This time I'll kill him!

946
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:09,426
Give yourself up!
Give yourself up!

947
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:16,300
Leave my house! You are
intruders in my house!

948
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,867
But, you're not one of ours!

949
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,449
A ghost! A ghost, a real one!

950
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,119
You fool! There are no ghosts!

951
01:07:35,152 --> 01:07:37,354
- But, I saw him!
- Oh!

952
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,765
Get the gun, Woody!

953
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,734
Quit playin' around
and get the gun!

954
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,137
Come on! Woody!

955
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,005
Come on! Woody!

956
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,747
Get over there! Face
the wall! Both of you!

957
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,116
Yes Ma'am.

958
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,718
It's that nice,
friendly, Chinese lady.

959
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:12,156
Not very friendly
right now! Go on.

960
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,073
(ANATOLE GROWLS AND
SOUNDS OF SCUFFLE)

961
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:58,402
You! Augh! Augh!

962
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,550
Augh!

963
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,922
Oh, you know,
I really enjoyed that!

964
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,824
I didn't like him at all!

965
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:23,860
You have intruded.

966
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,202
You have taken my
name and my house.

967
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:36,873
You have disturbed the dead!

968
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:05,101
Is that a promise? You will
look me up in Nashville.

969
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,436
When I make a promise,

970
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,171
Especially to a
beautiful girl like you,

971
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,540
- I don't break it.
- Thank you.

972
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,180
'Mother' is very grateful.

973
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,683
- Thank you. Glad we could help.
- You'll get a medal for this.

974
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:23,353
Glad to help. Just mail
the medal to Nashville!

975
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:33,363
We're on our way.
We're on our way.

976
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:37,501
We're on our way to a
swinging Jamboree.

977
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,803
Yeah! We're on our way.

978
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,372
We're on our way.

979
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:46,710
We're on our way to
Nashville, Tennessee.

980
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,613
Oueee. Oueee. Oueee.

981
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:57,421
We're livin' it up tonight!

982
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,789
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we travel,

983
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:02,692
That is most of the entertainers
in the Country Music field,

984
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:05,629
I'd say, better than a hundred
thousand miles a year.

985
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,364
A lot of shows we work,

986
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:10,199
We're not lucky enough
to have women on them.

987
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,636
Tonight, we're real fortunate.

988
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:16,506
Here's another beautiful blonde,
dressed in a beautiful blue.

989
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,074
Marcella Wright!

990
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:28,852
Now we're strangers,

991
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,855
Completely strangers.

992
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:36,760
When we meet, you turn
and look the other way.

993
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:42,532
How can we be strangers,
completely strangers,

994
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,737
When we were so in
love just yesterday.

995
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:51,575
On the night that we met,

996
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:54,243
It was true love
at first sight.

997
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:57,514
You held me in your arms,

998
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,517
And your arms
felt oh so right.

999
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,986
Our love seemed to blossom,

1000
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:05,789
As the days grew windy, dear.

1001
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:10,560
And, you went away and
filled my heart with fear.

1002
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:13,630
And now, we're strangers,

1003
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,500
Completely strangers.

1004
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:21,805
I just can't believe you'd
take your love from me.

1005
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:25,108
Now, we're strangers,

1006
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:28,177
Completely strangers,

1007
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:33,650
And, I'm alone
with just a memory.

1008
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,453
Now we're strangers,

1009
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:39,456
Completely strangers.

1010
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:44,561
When we meet, you turn
and look the other way.

1011
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:47,631
How can we be strangers,

1012
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:50,634
Completely strangers,

1013
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:56,005
When we were so in
love just yesterday.

1014
01:12:56,272 --> 01:13:01,745
When we were so in
love just yesterday.

1015
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:11,621
Ladies and Gentlemen, one
of my favorite singers,

1016
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,893
One of my favorite people,
Mr. Merle Haggard! Merle

1017
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:32,408
This old smoke-filled bar is
something I'm not used to.

1018
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:40,884
But, I gave up my home
to keep you satisfied.

1019
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:48,291
I just called to let you
know where I'll be living.

1020
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:56,399
It's not much, but, I
feel welcome here inside.

1021
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:00,970
I've got swinging doors,

1022
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:05,008
And a juke box,
and a barstool.

1023
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:12,482
My new home has a
flashing neon sign.

1024
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:20,223
Stop by and see me
anytime you want to.

1025
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:28,431
'Cause I'm always here at
home 'till closing time.

1026
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:41,511
I've got everything I need,

1027
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:43,947
To drive me crazy.

1028
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:52,155
I've got everything it
takes to lose my mind.

1029
01:14:53,422 --> 01:15:00,096
And in here, the atmosphere's
just right for heartaches.

1030
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:07,537
Thanks to you I'm always
here 'till closing time.

1031
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:12,576
Now I've got swinging doors,

1032
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:16,212
A jukebox, and a barstool.

1033
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:23,553
My new home has a
flashing neon sign.

1034
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:31,695
Stop by and see me
anytime you want to.

1035
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:39,468
'Cause I'm always here at
home 'till closing time.

1036
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:47,076
I'm always here at
home 'till closing time.

1037
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,853
Thank you, very much.

1038
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,988
Now, I'd like to
introduce somebody to ya,

1039
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:02,558
That I've known for a few
years. As a matter of fact,

1040
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:04,828
We worked together when she
was about eleven years old,

1041
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,529
Out in California.

1042
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,834
She was real cute then, now,
she's even more beautiful.

1043
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,803
Let's make her welcome,
Miss Molly Bee.

1044
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:31,888
Heartbreak U.S.A.

1045
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,693
The harbor's empty.

1046
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:41,464
My love has gone.

1047
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:47,270
With aching heart I face

1048
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:51,007
The cold and lonely dawn.

1049
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:55,411
Until the trade winds

1050
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:59,949
Bring him home to stay,

1051
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:07,623
I'll live in heartbreak U.S.A.

1052
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:13,629
Don't let those geisha girls

1053
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,400
Get your heart in a whirl.

1054
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:23,039
And, if you meet
some sweet frauline,

1055
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:26,743
Remember, you're mine.

1056
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,480
Don't forget your sweetheart

1057
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:35,551
While you're away.

1058
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:43,492
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.

1059
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,729
U.S.A.

1060
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:49,265
Sometimes I'm lonely,

1061
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:53,536
And time stands still.

1062
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:58,607
And, I wonder if you feel,

1063
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:02,746
The way I always will.

1064
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:06,816
So darling write me,

1065
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:11,487
Letters every day.

1066
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:19,763
In care of, heartbreak U.S.A.

1067
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:25,268
Don't forget your sweetheart

1068
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:29,806
While you're away,

1069
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:37,613
Back home in heartbreak U.S.A.

1070
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:52,095
In heartbreak U.S.A.

1071
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,569
Back stage while ago,

1072
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,939
Cricket Stone and
myself were talkin' about

1073
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,574
Singers and all that,
and we tried our best

1074
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,243
To get this next
fellow to sing a song.

1075
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:08,778
We finally talked him into it.

1076
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,947
Make him welcome,
the good Jeepers!

1077
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,961
And they got into the
wrong house again last night.

1078
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:30,867
I bought myself a
house a few months back.

1079
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:36,072
And, it's a darlin'
little house, that's a fact.

1080
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:42,745
How-some-ever, there's a certain
seven others there that's exact.

1081
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:48,551
And, would you believe, I got in
the wrong one again, last night!

1082
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:54,623
My neighbor's got a dog
about two feet high.

1083
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:59,628
Cutest little dog,
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1084
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:04,233
One day, I stumbled in
their house by mistake,

1085
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:06,202
This mornin' about five.

1086
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:11,140
And, that cute little,
stupid dog nearly ate me alive!

1087
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:17,613
I came in last night, and
felt like I had two heads.

1088
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,649
And, I was
sneakin' in the house,

1089
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:23,619
When this sweet voice
yelled out and said,

1090
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:26,522
Oooh Bill darlin',

1091
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,925
Put out the kitty
cat, and come to bed.

1092
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:33,829
And I said, Oooh,
surprise, my name's Fred.

1093
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:38,601
I went to the next house,
and knocked on the bell.

1094
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:44,573
And, this guy about eleven feet
tall answered the door and said,

1095
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:50,046
What the... And, I said, well
I was just sorta in the area,

1096
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:54,683
And I thought maybe you'd
like to chit-chat for a spell.

1097
01:20:55,885 --> 01:21:01,157
But, he threw me out the back
door, and called me some names.

1098
01:21:01,824 --> 01:21:05,361
So I went to sleep
in the next house,

1099
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:08,131
And I saw it
looked about the same.

1100
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:13,069
I woke up this morning with
my arms around a great dane.

1101
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:18,474
Some silly kid lookin' in the
door, yellin' Gravy Train.

1102
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:24,213
And, I got into to the
wrong house again, last night.

1103
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:36,259
Sure am glad I'm me!

1104
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,760
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1105
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,396
Here's somebody that
needs no introduction,

1106
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:42,865
But, I'm going to
introduce her anyhow.

1107
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:47,003
My part time lover,
Boots Malone!

1108
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:48,938
- Kill them baby.
- Thank you.

1109
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:58,314
Well now, on Monday
I'm your darlin',

1110
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:00,383
On Tuesday I'm your baby,

1111
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,352
But on Wednesday you
don't get around to me.

1112
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:06,722
I don't want a
part time lover.

1113
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,857
Can't take a part time lover.

1114
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:12,161
Won't have a part
time lover, no siree!

1115
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:16,465
I need your huggin',
I need your kissin'.

1116
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:20,836
It's your huggin' and your
kissin' I've been missin'.

1117
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,572
Now, if I'm not
your one and only,

1118
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,309
I'd rather go on
feelin' lonely,

1119
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:29,445
'Till the day the
right one comes my way.

1120
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:32,248
I must refuse a
part time lover.

1121
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,383
Can't use a part time lover.

1122
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:37,987
Got to have a full
time lover every day.

1123
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:40,589
- I need your huggin'.
- Need your huggin'.

1124
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,791
- I need your kissin'.
- Need your kissin'.

1125
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:46,162
It's your huggin' and your
kissin' I've been missin'.

1126
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,298
Now, if I'm not
your one and only,

1127
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:51,900
I'd rather go on
feelin' lonely,

1128
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:55,038
'Till the day the
right comes my way.

1129
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,906
I must refuse a
part time lover.

1130
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,975
Can't use a part time lover.

1131
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:02,078
Got to have a full time lover

1132
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,180
- everyday.
- Everyday.

1133
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,449
Got to have a full time lover

1134
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,717
- everyday.
- Everyday.

1135
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:10,719
Got to have a full time lover

1136
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:14,357
Everyday!

1137
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,435
Well, huh, huh,

1138
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:29,472
Fellows, are you ready to cross
one of these bridges with me?

1139
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,674
Okay Red, take it off.

1140
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,517
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1141
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,921
Everyone I ever
loved, I always lost.

1142
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:50,059
For a true love, I'd
gladly pay the cost.

1143
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:54,497
But, that's the one
bridge I have never crossed.

1144
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,867
All my life I have
traveled over the country.

1145
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:03,172
I've even flown and
sailed across the sea.

1146
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:07,576
Name a famous bridge, I'll
bet you that I've crossed it.

1147
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:11,647
And, all the women that I've
loved have all crossed me.

1148
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,884
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1149
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:20,656
Everyone I ever
loved I always lost.

1150
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:24,760
For a true love, I'd
gladly pay the cost.

1151
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:29,432
But, that's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1152
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:33,569
I've made a lot of
money in my lifetime.

1153
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:37,840
I've got a million friends,
and I know some enemies.

1154
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:42,178
But, nobody knows how
bad I need affection.

1155
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:46,449
And, how I long to find a
love that won't cross me.

1156
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:50,919
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1157
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:55,258
Everyone I ever
loved, I always lost.

1158
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:59,362
For a true love, I'd
gladly pay the cost.

1159
01:24:59,395 --> 01:25:03,966
But, that's the one
bridge I have never crossed.

1160
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:08,171
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1161
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:12,308
Everyone I ever
loved, I always lost.

1162
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:16,379
For a true love, I'd
gladly pay the cost.

1163
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:20,849
But, that's the one
bridge I have never crossed.

1164
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:25,254
Yes, that's the one
bridge I have never crossed.

1165
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:29,192
Everyone I ever loved,
I always lost.

1166
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:33,229
For a true love, I'd
gladly pay the cost.

1167
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:37,766
But, that's the one
bridge I have never crossed.

1168
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,538
That's the one bridge
I have never crossed.

1169
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:53,216
It's Jamboree time in
Nashville, Tennessee.
