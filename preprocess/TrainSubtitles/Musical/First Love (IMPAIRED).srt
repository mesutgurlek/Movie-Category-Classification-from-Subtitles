a small, and we hope,
happy lifetime.

But to us, they've been more
like the miracle of a minute.

The mischievous, loving children
who came to us four years ago...

now leave us
as charming young ladies,

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,872
to face the challenge of life,

with all the happiness
and victories...

it has in store for you.

when you go home
to friends and family,

13
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,861
you will carry with you
all the courage and idealism...

00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,203
and the sportsmanship
that have made us all...

so proud to be associated
with this graduating class.

There they are!

this is Connie.

We're so glad
to meet you, after all
Marcia has written.

00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,107
She gave you
quite a buildup.
Oh.

Well, look at her.
She's tops. And you
ought to hear her sing.

a high note, it sends chills
up and down your back.

Where are your father
and mother, Connie?
We'd like to meet them.

My parents are dead,

Oh. I'm sorry.

Why can't Connie come with us
and spend the summer?

32
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,391
Could you, Connie?
We'd be so pleased.

33
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,363
It's very kind of you,
but I have an aunt
and uncle in New York.

34
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm going to live with them.
It's all been arranged that way.

Well, you're a lucky girl.
He's a fine man.

we read so much about?

No, miss, they
were very busy.

You go on up there

and make those people love you
as much as we do.

you'll meet a prince,

Get my comb.
Yes, miss.

131

Send that editor a telegram
telling him he's a darling
for putting me on the cover.

132
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,004
May I fix that spangle?
You should have done it
before I put the dress on.

133
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,508
It wasn't loose then.
Well, hurry up.
Comb these curls out. OIlie!

134
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,272
Just one more!
Can you hold just
a little still, please?

135
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,440
Give me that comb.
You can pull on it.
It won't come off.

136
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,917
I didn't want to hurt you.
Get my perfume,
the Clair de Lune Bleu.

137
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,920
Yes, miss.
Is Mother ready?

138
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,922
I got her done
an hour ago.
What's she wearing?

139
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,924
A new one
from Hendricks.
What's it like?

140
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,291
You don't have to worry.
It's nothing like yours.
Which one did you say?

00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,523
Clair de Lune Bleu.
[Mispronounces]
Clair de Lune Blee.

142
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,657
Bleu. Bleu!
Blue. Blur!

143
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,897
That isn't right,
but you're getting warm.
Oh, thank you, miss.

144
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,268
Here's your coat,
Miss Barbara.
Bring it along.

145
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,570
Which flowers would you like?
I don't care.
Any of them.

146
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,611
These would look nice on you.

147
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,203
They're terrible.
Give me the gardenias.
Yes, Miss Barbara.

148
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,114
Call me at noon tomorrow
and be sure that I get up.
Yes, Miss Barbara.

149
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,314
And call that Swedish girl...
foot massage in the morning.
You shouldn't dance so much.

150
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,322
If Mr. Warrington calls,
tell him to call back.

151
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,881
If Mr. Patton calls,
tell him I have smallpox.

152
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,553
Yes, miss.
A headache
for Mr. Patton.

153
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,892
Where's my bag?
Oh, I forgot it.

154
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,432
Well, get it.

155
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,867
Mother! I'm ready!
Where's Mother, Walter?

156
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,303
Are you ready?
All but one cuff link.

157
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,604
Mother, please!
Oh, my darling child.

158
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:29,171
You look so sweet!
And that color's
so good for you too.

159
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,048
Or maybe you're good
for the color. I always say
the woman makes the clothes...

160
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,713
Let's get started, hmm?
Even Walter's ready.

161
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,916
Ready and rarin' to go.
We can't go
for quite a while yet.

162
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,925
Oh, good.
What's
the matter now?

163
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,019
George and Terry aren't back
with your cousin yet.
They have the car.

164
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,189
Let's take one of
the other cars.
Which one?

165
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,725
The sedan is waiting for
your father at his office;
my town car's in the garage;

166
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,671
and the big town car
we can't use because the
second chauffeur's off today.

167
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,699
You know, the one who was born
in February. What's his name?
Nick, for Nicholas.

168
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,545
I can't be more than an hour
and a half late for Wilma's party!
She's one of my personal friends.

169
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,210
Why did that child
have to graduate today?

170
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,743
- Graduations are important.
- What's more important to me...

171
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,347
is that Wilma
will think I'm deliberately
sabotaging her party.

172
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,450
Oh, if that's
the case, perhaps we'd
better take a taxi.

173
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,463
That's idiotic.
No one can get
comfortable in a taxi.

174
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,558
- If you'd learn to drive, we
wouldn't have to ride in them.
- Driving is work.

175
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,968
Not as much work
as walking, perhaps,
but still work.

176
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,838
Walter! You came that close
to making an epigram!

177
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,036
You know...
Here they are,
Miss Barbara.

178
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,341
This one matches everything.
Doesn't match
anything.

179
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,405
Throw it out.
Now run outside and see
if you can find a taxi.

180
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,318
- Can you whistle, Agnes?
- You mean like this?
[Whistling]

181
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,652
Don't ever
do that, Agnes.
Well, I'm sorry...

182
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,021
Will you please
get that cab!
Get my coat, please.

183
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:51,358
In the future, I hope someone
will have enough sense to keep
at least one chauffeur around.

184
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,093
- [Walter] Ditto.
- [Mother] It's all
Mother's fault, I know...

185
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,829
Here they are!

186
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,837
Hello...
Where have you been?

187
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,465
I'm sorry
we're so late.
We had a flat tire.

188
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,738
On an $8,000 automobile?
Impossible!

189
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,440
- [Walter]
We almost had to take a taxi.
- I'm very sorry, Mr. Walter.

190
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,951
- Tell me about the flat
in the morning, Terry.
- But I thought...

191
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,852
When you're going touring again,
be sure there's somebody here
to drive for us.

192
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,584
Mrs. Clinton,
your flowers!
What's the matter with my...

193
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,592
Connie!

194
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,685
Hello.

195
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,789
Oh, my baby!
I'm so glad to see you!

196
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,804
Barbara, you haven't
said a word to Connie.
Happy you managed to get here.

197
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,433
- Walter, what have you
to say to your cousin?
- Hi.

198
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,533
- [Connie] Hello.
- [Barbara] We have to run.

199
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,012
I'll start your horoscope
first thing in the morning.

200
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,743
Do you
still sing?
Yes, I do.

201
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,275
[Muttering]
George, the minute
Mr. Clinton comes in...

202
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,551
By the time we get
there, there won't be
a photographer left!

203
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,559
Good-bye, Connie.
Good-bye, good-bye,
good-bye!

204
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,598
I'll show you
to your room, miss.

205
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,202
Please come this way.

206
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,973
What time do you think
UncleJim will be home?
You mean Mr. Clinton, miss?

207
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,445
Yes.
The goings
and comings of this family
are none of my affair.

208
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,972
Though I might say
if they're out,
Mr. Clinton usually is here.

209
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,282
If they're here,
Mr. Clinton usually is out.

210
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,280
This way, miss.

211
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,155
Here's your room, miss.

212
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,075
Shall I put
the window down, miss?

213
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,272
Hmm?
I said shall I
put the window down?

214
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,908
No, thank you.
It's all right.
May I help you unpack, miss?

215
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,112
I think I can do it
myself, thank you.
Will there be anything else?

216
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,121
No, thank you.
Very well, miss.

217
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,420
There'll be a light supper
served in the dining room
as soon as you are ready.

218
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,723
- No, thank you.
- But surely you'll
want something.

219
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,696
I don't feel like eating.

220
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,324
Very well, miss.

221
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,184
Pardon me, miss.
Is supper all ready?

222
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,845
You certainly do things
quickly around here.

223
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,582
I thought you said...
I'll be down
as soon as I've changed.

224
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,523
Certainly.
And don't make that supper
too light. I'm famished!

225
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,696
Some more
chicken, miss?
Oh, I couldn't, really.

226
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,698
Are you sure, miss?
Oh, yes.

227
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:18,260
Very good, miss.
There is another
little piece of white meat.

228
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,771
Yes, there is
another little piece
of white meat, miss.

229
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,864
I know what
you're thinking.
I hope not, miss.

230
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,468
You're wondering if
I always change my mind.
I'll get your hot chocolate.

231
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,537
I don't want any,
thank you.
Will that be all then?

232
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,583
Mm-hmm.
Very good, miss.

233
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,779
Do you think if one makes up
one's mind about doing something
that really helps one to do it?

234
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,554
Indubitably, miss.
I made up my mind that I like
this house and everybody in it.

235
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,756
- And everybody in it's
going to like me.
- Cheerful thought, miss.

236
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,699
They didn't have to have me
come live with them if they
didn't want me.
No, miss.

237
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,067
UncleJim asked me to come.
So Mrs. Clinton
told me.

238
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,006
Don't you ever smile?
I'm sorry, miss,
but if I may say so,

239
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,510
gay butlers
are a trifle rare.

240
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,109
Do you like singing?

241
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,413
Yes, I do, miss,
and no, I don't,
if you know what I mean.

242
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,181
I'm sorry.
Either you do
or you don't.

243
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,518
It's this way, miss.
Some people consider...

244
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,118
Boop-boop dittem
dattem wattem chu
...an inspiring cantata.

245
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,790
My preference is for
something above that.
Oh.

246
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,924
I'm sorry, miss.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,763
I'm sorry too.

so much for me and...

00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,422
Oh, yes.
Hmph.

294
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,433
[Muttering]
She likes bein' here.

295
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,703
Is there anything
you want before you
go to bed, child?

296
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,238
We've got a big watermelon
in the icebox.

297
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,117
No, thank you.
Don't start taking them
too seriously, miss.

298
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,883
You'll get used to them.
Sure. We did.

299
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,088
Good night.
Good night, miss.
Pleasant dreams.

300
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,939
Good afternoon,
Miss Barbara. I've been
waiting for you to wake up.

301
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,240
Your pictures are in
all the morning papers.

302
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,338
What time is it?
It's a little after 2:00.

303
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,681
Which kind? I brought
orange juice, tomato,
grapefruit and grape.

304
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,519
Sauerkraut.
Oh, I never seem
to be able to guess.

305
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,718
I might have known
you'd be in the mood
for sauerkraut today.

306
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,091
When Mr. Drake called,
I told him...

307
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,562
Who called?
Mr. Drake.
He called twice.

308
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,862
Why didn't you wake me up?
I tried to,
both times.

309
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,268
- You did not.
- Oh, yes, I did.
The pillow the first time.

310
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,465
You threw the alarm clock
the second time.

311
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,134
Where'd he call from?
Right here. Just
got back in town.

312
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,940
- What'd he say?
- He wanted you to go riding...

313
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,277
with he and Miss Flourney
and Miss Van Everett
and a lot of people.

314
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,944
They were leaving
at 2:30 sharp.
I'll never get there by 2:30.

315
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,953
Couldn't you telephone him
and ask him to wait?

316
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,955
And make him think
I'm running after him?

317
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,992
I'd run after him.
Papers say he's the catch
of the season.

318
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,154
If I could only stop him
from leaving 'til I get there.
I have an idea.

319
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,529
If you'd called me
when he phoned, you
wouldn't need any ideas.

320
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,797
It's a good idea,
really it is.
I'm sure it is.

321
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,273
I could hurry out to the club,
see Mr. Drake and faint.
Have these shined.

322
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,105
I could throw myself
under his horse's hooves.

323
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,237
I wouldn't mind
doing it for you...
Get that cousin of mine.

324
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,908
If she isn't here by the time
I count ten, you're fired.
Yes, miss!

325
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,085
Miss Connie!
What is it?

326
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,648
Miss Barbara wants you
this minute. Please hurry.
Yes, all right, Agnes.

327
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,192
Miss Connie'll be
right in.
Oh, I am in.

328
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,232
Oh, you are.
Never mind.

329
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:05,676
Yes, Barbara?
Some friends
of mine are going riding at
the country club in a half hour.

330
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,975
I want you to delay their start
'til I get there, understand?
You mean stop them?

331
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,538
- At least stop Ted Drake.
- I don't even know him.

332
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,584
You know what
he looks like.
No.

333
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,712
The most notable
young man in New York.
You must have seen his picture.

334
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,315
I don't think so.
Well, you'll find one
in that drawer.

335
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,486
Which one?
The top drawer.

336
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,293
In the dresser?
Yes. Just open it.
You'll find it.

337
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,697
I don't see
any picture here.

338
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,864
Oh, you don't see any picture.
I told you it was there.
Why don't you look for it?

339
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,670
- What do you think this is?
And please hurry!
- Oh, I think...

340
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:42,111
What'll I say to him?
I don't care what you say
as long as you keep him there.

341
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,410
And be sure
he doesn't know
I sent you.

342
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,510
- I don't think
I can do it, Barbara.
- All right, don't then.

343
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,681
- Oh, I mean...
- After all this family's
done for you,

344
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,691
the first time we ask you
to do something for us,
you refuse.

345
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,592
Oh, I'll do it then.
I don't know what to do.

346
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,597
Faint. Make him revive you.
Fall in front ofhim.
Steal his horse.

347
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,395
I don't care, as long as
he's there when I get there.
And hurry!

348
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,236
Off for a little stroll,
Miss Connie?
Yes. I mean no.

349
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,608
I'll need the car. Oh,
my hat. I left it in there.
I'll get the car.

350
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,738
- Thank you.
I'm in an awful hurry.
- [Walter] Why?

351
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,548
I have to stop Ted Drake's horse
at the country club for Barbara.
Oh, not his horse. Him.

352
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,214
But he'll be on it.
You know what I mean.
Perfectly.

353
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,089
I have to run now.
Good-bye.
Connie,
give me a cigarette, please.

354
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,753
Oh, yes.
When were you born,
Connie?

355
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,595
- December 4th.
- Sagittarius.
Oh, how interesting.

356
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,794
What time
of day?
I don't remember.

357
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,999
I'm going to do your horoscope.
Hurry back, and I'll tell you
all about yourself.

358
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,007
Yes, Aunt Grace.

359
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,774
You'd better wait here.
They might recognize the car.

360
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,578
I'll keep the motor running
in case we have to make
a quick getaway.

361
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,585
I'm awfully nervous.
Don't worry.

362
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,587
Mr. Drake?
The horses ready, Dan?

363
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,283
Yes, sir,
all 13 of them.
Thirteen's bad luck.

364
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,087
We're not
superstitious, are we?
Let's wait for Barbara.

365
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,859
It's only a little after 2:30.
If we wait for her, we'll have
to make this a moonlight ride.

366
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,299
She'll probably just arrive
by the time we get back.
Let's go.

367
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:14,862
I think if we go off without
her, it'll be good for her.
I think we should wait.

368
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,573
Uh... Uh.

369
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,217
Hey!

370
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,421
Barbara know about
this trip you're taking?

371
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,515
I didn't even tell the family
'til this morning.
When do you leave?

372
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,689
A month. We don't start up
the Amazon 'til late September.
The Amazon's a river, isn't it?

373
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,561
Named after
a tribe of women.
So that's
what's behind this expedition.

374
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,567
Barbara'll
be thrilled.
Are you with us?

375
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,933
No, I'm alone.
How cozy.

376
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,403
Mr. Kirkpatrick.!
Wanted on the telephone.!

377
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,078
All right, Willie.
I'll take it.
Yes, sir.

378
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,117
Won't be a minute.

379
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,211
[Chattering]

380
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:11,059
Mr. Drake!
Wanted on the telephone!

381
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,326
- That must be Barbara.
- Maybe it's Dad.
You go on along.

382
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,664
- Oh, we'll wait.
- No, go ahead. I'll
meet you at the willows.

383
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,670
Don't be long.
I won't.

384
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,854
Nice horsey.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

385
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,657
I just want
to undo this.

386
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,824
I'm not gonna hurt you.
See? Sugar. Sugar.

387
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,834
Just wanna undo this, see?

388
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,564
That's it.
Come on.
Get the sugar.

389
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,166
Got some more in here.
You can have that when
you get to the barn.

390
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,768
Come on.
Get the sugar.

391
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,872
You can have it all
if you'll just come
to the barn. Come on.

392
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,878
Come on.
I got some more for you.
You like sugar, don't you?

393
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,626
So do I. Come on.
Get the sugar.

394
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,095
That's a good horsey.
Come on. Come on.

395
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,758
Did you call me
to the phone?
No, Mr. Drake.

396
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,563
There's nobody on it.
Somebody called.
I'm sorry, sir.

397
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:29,369
- What's going on
with that horse?
- Come on.

398
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,842
There's lots more
where this came from.
Come on. That's a boy.

399
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,971
I don't like my horse
to have sugar.
Oh, he likes it.

400
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,242
Hey, Shamrock!
Come here, boy. Hey!

401
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:47,216
Hey! Hey, Shamrock. Here!
Come back here!

402
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,556
Here, fella, take it easy.

403
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,695
Hey!

404
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,464
The horses have
enough trouble with this jump
without looking out for you.

405
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,271
I fell when you chased me.
I wasn't chasing you.
I was chasing the horse.

406
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,438
Not that way.
Look out!

407
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,573
Let's get out of here
before another horse
takes after you.

408
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,844
What are you tryin' to do,
kill yourself?

409
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,944
Between stuffing my horse
with sugar and making yourself
a steeplechase hazard,

410
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,012
you've had
a pretty busy day.

411
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,856
If one of those jumpers
had been short, you'd really
have something to worry about.

412
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,886
Now run along and try
and keep out of mischief.
[Muttering]

413
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,965
[Crying]

414
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,540
Oh, come on.
You're all right now.

415
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,134
Is there a handkerchief
in there? Let me
get it for you.

416
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,406
It's nothing.
It's just a natural react...

417
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,812
You must like horses
an awful lot.
No, I don't. I just...

418
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,652
You carry a lot
of sugar around.
Oh, that's...

419
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,851
Could you show me the way
out of here, please?

420
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,326
The same way you got in.
I've got friends waiting.

421
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,023
It'd only take
a few minutes.
I'm a little dizzy.

422
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:05,229
Well, that, young lady, is
a masterpiece of understatement.
You're the dizz...

423
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,233
Now I wonder
what's happened to her.

424
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,042
That's fine. You ought to have
a keeper or a nurse.

425
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,106
Ted!

426
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,216
What are you doing?
The kid's fainted.
She had a bad scare.

427
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,723
Get some water.
I'll take care of her.
Who is she?

428
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,783
I don't know. You
better get some water.
I'll be right back.

429
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,832
All right, thanks.

430
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,063
You're welcome.
You didn't have to
kill yourself.

431
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,901
You told me to keep him here.
I didn't tell you
to hang on his neck.

432
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,807
I didn't. He held me up...
Go on home.
Don't let anybody see you.

433
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,539
I just wanted to thank him.
He was awfully nice.

434
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,979
Do you want to spoil
everything now?
Oh, no.

435
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,348
Then get out of here
before he gets back.
Hurry up!
Barbara!

436
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,786
If you'd only...
Will you do what
you're told for a change?

437
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,584
I only want
to thank him...
I'll thank him.

438
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,093
Go home before
he sees you again.
But...

439
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,827
Will you get
my horse out, Frankie?
Yes, Miss Clinton. Right away.

440
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,268
What's happened
to our patient?
Oh, that little brat.

441
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:17,536
- She ran off like a rabbit.
- She's a funny kid.
Who do you think she is?

442
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,373
You don't know?
The first time
I ever saw her...

443
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,538
was when I caught her
feeding sugar to my horse.

444
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,048
A likely story. Girls
just chase you around.

445
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,880
- Hello, Wilma.
- I'm so glad you
finally got here.

446
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,046
- The gang went on, Ted.
- I'll get my horse
and be right back.

447
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,114
You look lovely.
If I slept this late,
I'd be a sight.

448
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,093
You're priceless.
You always look the same
no matter what you do.

449
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,686
Mademoiselle Bristo says that
whenever she gives me a facial.

450
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,699
You ought to try her.
She's marvelous at
taking bad lines out.

451
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,998
- She must be miraculous.
- You'd be surprised what
she can do for your nerves.

452
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,039
That's where you
plump people are lucky.
You have no nerves.

453
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,066
Here you are, Miss Clinton.
Be careful. That hat might
make him a little skittish.

454
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,443
Don't worry about the General.
He has better taste
than most people.

455
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,847
- Horses always know
more than their riders.
- Which path do we take?

456
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,354
The upper one is shorter,
but there are too many
jumps for Barbara.

457
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,390
Don't worry about me.
The upper road is
ten minutes faster.

458
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,620
Ted and I will
take the lower one
and race you there.

459
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,458
All right, let's go.
Careful with
those jumps, dear.

460
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,501
Barbara!
How nice of you
to hurry home for tea.

461
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,978
Who wants tea?
Why, dear pet,
what happened to you?

462
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,040
Wilma Van Everett.
What did
little Wilma do?

463
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,051
I'd like to kill
"little" Wilma.

464
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,555
What did she do, dear?
Something horrible,
I trust?

465
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:43,424
She succeeded in making herself
ridiculous in front of everybody
at the club this afternoon.

466
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,792
She acted like a fool
over Ted Drake.

467
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,195
That's terrible!
Put them there, Connie.
All right.

468
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,463
You certainly covered
yourself with glory today.
I only tried to...

469
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,630
You tried brilliantly.
Never mind. Tell
your story, Barbara.

470
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,004
You wouldn't believe it
unless you were there.
I would.

471
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,009
She only advertised
to everybody present...

472
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,602
that she was
head-over-heels
in love with Ted.

473
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,909
That's silly!
It was revolting.
Why?

474
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,009
- Girls fall in love
with Ted all the time.
- She only just met him!

475
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,647
Love at first sight.
I've read about it.
It's very rare.

476
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:16,092
A Leo and Sagittarius might
do it if Saturn were in accord.
Her birthday is...

477
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,095
- December 4th.
- How do you know?

478
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,961
I certainly
should know.
You know her, do you?

479
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,558
What are you...
Everybody knows
Wilma Van Everett.

480
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,036
She gets twice as much
publicity as you do.
She does not.!

481
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,040
Does.
Doesn't.
Mother!

482
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,909
Walter! Isn't that strange?
That's the same birthday as you,
isn't it, Connie?

483
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:38,312
Yes, that's right.
December 4th.

484
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,910
[Barbara] I'm going to fix
Miss Van Everett. I'll see her
at the Drakes'party.

485
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,580
[Grace] Are the Drakes
going to have a party?
[Barbara] On the 29th.

486
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,751
I'll have something figured out.
Everybody will know about it
because everybody will be there.

487
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,887
Everybody?
Connie, what are
you going to wear?

488
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,990
To the party you mean?
Oh, I haven't been in...

489
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,264
I'm not going, am I?

490
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:04,400
- Of course you are. Sister
just said everybody's going.
- I haven't... I'd have to wear...

491
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,569
- It's formal, isn't it?
- Barbara's probably got
something upstairs...

492
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,875
that would suit you
perfect.

493
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,507
How about it?
And have people say
she's wearing my castoffs?

494
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,178
- We wouldn't want
that, would we?
- No. Of course not.

495
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,882
But I could wear...
Mother...
Wait. You're interrupting.

496
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,824
You could what?
I could wear my
graduation dress.

497
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,795
It's very pretty,
and it's long and white.
All white.

498
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,094
White's a pretty color.
It isn't
a garden party.

499
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,830
I could make it into
an evening dress. I'd just
have to fix the sleeves...

500
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,362
See how simple it is?
I'll start figuring out
what to do with it.

501
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,875
And thank you.
Thank you very much.

502
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,877
I took sewing
in school, you know.

503
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,346
I'll have to fix the skirt
a little, and maybe I can
fix the neck.

504
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,576
We're not going
to drag her to the ball.

505
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,883
If she fixes her dress, I'm
afraid we'll have to take her.
You can't get out of it.

506
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,890
Don't think I'm going to be
bothered with her
once she gets there.

507
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,791
Be nice to her at the ball,
sister, or people will have
an excuse...

508
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,355
to say some of the things
they've been thinking
about you for years.

509
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,761
I'm going to
the Drakes' ball.
What are you gonna do?

510
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,137
I'm going to
the Drakes' ball.
No foolin'!

511
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,440
Absolutely. I have to cut
the sleeves out. I have to
make this into an evening dress.

512
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,242
- Does the duchess
know you're going?
- Barbara? Certainly.

513
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,615
They only just told me
about it. I didn't
dream I was going.

514
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,349
That's wonderful, Miss Connie.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you, Agnes.

515
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,985
I do want to look pretty
when he sees me this time...
when people see me.

516
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,996
I mean...
You know.
When who sees you
this time?

517
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,694
Everybody. Everybody in
New York's going to be there.
What slippers shall I wear?

518
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,702
Who's the "he" you were
just talkin' about?

519
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,070
I didn't mean any particular
person. Do you think these
slippers'll be all right?

520
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,101
Maybe if I cut the neckline
lower and sort of
flare out the skirt.

521
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,740
Miss OIlie could tell you.
She makes all her clothes.
Do you think she'd mind?

522
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,684
Oh, no, OIlie loves to...
I didn't know you knew
any "he" in New York.

523
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,052
I don't know any "he"...
I mean anybody.

524
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,354
Just because you see a person
doesn't mean you know a person.

525
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,327
Let's go ask OIlie
about the dress.
She's in the kitchen.

526
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,227
Miss Connie's going to the...
George told us.

527
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,531
Did they tell you about it?
I couldn't help
overhearing.

528
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,128
I'm almost as happy
as if I were going myself.

529
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,505
I've never been to
a big party like this before.
It'll be a great night.

530
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,874
It certainly will.
Is that the dress
you want to make over?

531
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:25,609
Yes, Agnes said you might
help me. May I put it here?
Put it anywhere.

532
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,517
It still has sleeves.
I thought if we'd only use
the skirt and make a bodice...

533
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,452
and then flare the skirt...

534
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,548
Don't mind me.
I only eat here.

535
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,153
That's my brother Mike.
This is Miss Connie. You know,
I told you about her singing.

536
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,097
- How do you do?
- Don't let me stop
the operation.

537
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,397
I'm used to blood.
Have you any more
of this material?

538
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,233
No, but I have
a yard of silver lace.
Maybe you can use that.

539
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,070
Only a yard?
Yes, but it's very pretty.
I'll run get it.

540
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,667
The design's lovely.
You'll see.

541
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,679
It's a good thing
it wasn't one of the others
that found you here.

542
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,942
They would have
called the police.
Fine crack.

543
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,951
Think you can fix it up?
I can try. I wish
the waist was higher.

544
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,422
Hold this.
Gotta look beautiful at that
ball for a very special reason.

545
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,288
What's his name?
What do you think I am,
a tattletale?

546
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,987
How about hoops?
Never mind hoops.

547
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,259
You better watch that roast or
we'll have a terrible dinner.
Oh, my gracious!

548
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,733
Well done might be all right
for the family, but I like
my beef rare.

549
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,669
What can I do?
Why don't you put
some feathers on it?

550
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:24,139
How about those things
on the shoulders like
football players wear?

551
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,143
I just don't know
what to do.
I can tell you.

552
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,442
- This oughta be good.
- You take this dress...

553
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,778
and first,
you hide it away,

554
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,410
and then you go out
and buy her a whole
new outfit.

555
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,386
With what?
With money.

556
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,650
Whose money?
My money and your money.

557
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,124
And mine too.
Count me in.
And me.

558
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,060
Only goes to show
you don't get nothin'
for nothin' in this world,

559
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,063
not even from
your own sister.

560
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,065
How much?

561
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,908
It wasn't hard to do at all,
miss. I just bought another
yard or two of that lace.

562
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,076
Every bit of it
seems different.

563
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,053
When I remodel a dress,
I really remodel it.

564
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,421
The slippers just arrived.
I had to bring them up and
see how she looked.

565
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,960
It's a perfect fit.
It's really magnificent.

566
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,020
I still can't believe
it's the same dress.
OIlie did a lot of work on it.

567
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,997
May I put these on,
please?

568
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,763
These aren't my slippers.
Well, you see,
we took them out to a man...

569
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,701
to have some silver
put on them.

570
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,569
You know, like...
Like dyeing.

571
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,872
While he was doing it,
he spilled it all inside,
and you couldn't have worn them.

572
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,573
- So he only did what was right.
- He got you a new pair.

573
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,616
He shouldn't have
done that.
He's insured.

574
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,743
Do they feel
all right?
Why, yes.

575
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:46,483
They're just a little bit new,
but they fit perfectly.
[Knocking]

576
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,253
Come in.
I just wanted to see
how you looked.

577
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,524
You couldn't even tell
it was the same dress.
You look like a picture!

578
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,531
I don't see how...
OIlie must have worked
day and night...

579
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,829
Oh, turn around
a minute.
How does the skirt hang?

580
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,200
Perfect!
Why don't you go
in Miss Barbara's room?

581
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,398
You can see how
you really look.
That's a good idea.

582
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,704
I'll be back
in a minute.
Oh, just a second.

583
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,340
Thank you.
These just came
for you, miss.

584
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,177
How lovely!
Who sent it?

585
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:16,413
There wasn't any card.
Probably some admirer who knew
you were going to the ball.

586
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,012
Oh, you mean...
No.

587
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,388
How could he...
Oh, I don't think so.

588
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,428
They match your dress.
Isn't that nice?
[Barbara] Ollie.!

589
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,487
- Oh, I've been expecting that.
- OIlie, where have you been?

590
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,056
I want a large chiffon
handkerchief, black.
The bracelet.

591
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,501
Yes, miss.

592
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,769
Pardon me a minute.
I want to see how the skirt
hangs in the back.

593
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,810
I think it's
all right, don't you?

594
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,870
- What school did you
graduate from in that dress?
- We fixed it up. You like it?

595
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,384
The skirt hangs perfectly.
Oh, I forgot my locket.
I better go get it.

596
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,385
You look
very nice too.
Thanks.

597
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,581
I don't think
I'd look so good
in black.

598
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,114
You'd better hurry.
We don't want to be too late.

599
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,890
Did you see that?
Yes, miss. I think
she looks very nice.

600
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,297
Has she gone crazy,
storming in here,
patronizing me?

601
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,564
Oh, no, she's
just so thrilled about
going to the Drakes'.

602
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,333
She's taking
a lot for granted.
She isn't there yet.

603
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,568
Bring my wrap.
Yes, miss.

604
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,439
Did you hear that?
Yes!
What'd she say?

605
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,211
Mother, are you ready?
Yes, dear. I was looking
up the stars for tonight.

606
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,218
We're going to have
a marvelous evening.
I doubt that.

607
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:26,347
You mustn't doubt the stars.
They control your destiny,
whether you like it or not.

608
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,689
Ready? That's a very
smart gown, Aunt Grace.
Thank you.

609
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,558
Have you seen
my new dress?
Connie, it's amazing!

610
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,689
My wrap, please.
Mother, can we go?

611
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,427
Certainly. George,
is the car waiting?
Yes, Miss Connie.

612
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,435
Your cigarette case.
Where did
you find it?

613
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,199
In Mr. Clinton's study.
Oh, dear, where will I
leave it next?

614
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,176
[Connie] Have you seen the
newspaper? The society page is
full of details about the ball.

615
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,475
It mentioned all
the famous people who
are going to be there.

616
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,482
It's sure to be
a brilliant affair.

617
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,417
I hope they don't
just play rumbas.
You'd prefer waltzes.

618
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,388
I like waltzes.
I do too.
So do I. Dreamy ones.

619
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,322
My wrap.
This one?

620
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,623
No, the other one.
Mother, I think I'll
wear your pearl bracelet.

621
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,687
It goes better
with a black dress.
This isn't mine!

622
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,030
It is tonight.
Tomorrow it goes back
in Cousin Egbert's show window.

623
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,001
Oh, but really...
Shh!

624
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,039
- Shh.
- If Mr. Clinton comes,
tell him we'll be late.

625
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,542
Yes, ma'am.
Suppose UncleJason comes in
from Washington tonight?

626
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,544
What makes you think
he's coming tonight?

627
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,638
Aunt Louise
said yesterday
that he might.
She did?

628
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,843
I forgot to tell you.
Let's hope he doesn't arrive
until tomorrow.

629
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,979
If he does come and there isn't
one member of the family home,
we'll never hear the end of it.

630
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,025
I'll be glad to stay
and welcome him.
He hates the sight of you.

631
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,992
Can't say that
I blame him.
How about Father?

632
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,155
Your father won't be home
until all hours.
It's no great problem.

633
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,190
Connie can stay and sing
to him or something. You
don't mind, do you, Connie?

634
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,203
- Tonight? Now?
- You're dear to do it.

635
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,104
- Y-You mean I'm to wait here?
- Just make our excuses.

636
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,668
And fuss over him
when he arrives.
No.

637
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:59,204
No. You're not really going
to make me miss the party.

638
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,843
You can't.
That isn't fair.

639
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:06,686
You could have told me sooner
so I wouldn't plan and...
and wait and...

640
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,022
If you're going to argue
about everything we ask
you to do, I'll stay.

641
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,824
You can't do that.
The Drakes would be offended.

642
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,058
We'll make it up to you, Connie.

643
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,293
Barbara, you're only...

644
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,496
[Barbara]
I should think you'd be happy
to do something for us.

645
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:25,167
I could have told you a week ago
this would happen. Wanted to
see if I guessed right. I did.

646
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,176
Night.

647
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,804
[Door Slams]

Sorry, ma'am.

[Mumbles]

649
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,746
[Engine Starting, Revving]

650
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,721
All right.
I'll stay home.

651
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,715
I'll say you will.

652
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,653
Going to the ball
wasn't my idea.
You were pretty anxious.

653
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,326
I like to dance. Is there
anything wrong with that?

654
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,835
Who would you dance with?
Ted Drake?

655
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,964
That's silly.
Of course it's silly.
But that's who you mean.

656
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,306
And it's twice as silly
to be getting any
foolish ideas about him.

657
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:12,782
I'm not!
Oh, no?
What about that picture you
cut out of the newspaper?

658
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,944
Who was that?
Ted Drake, that's who.

659
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,252
I just cut it out.
There wasn't any reason
for cutting it out.

660
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,657
I suppose there isn't any reason
for keeping it hidden
in that book, either.

661
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,629
In what book?
In what book!
In that book!

662
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,360
That?
Stop being a silly girl.

663
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,097
Get that picture, tear it up
and throw it away this minute.

664
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,231
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

665
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,502
See?
I'm tearing it up.

666
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,840
[Knock At Door]
I don't want to hear
or think about him,

667
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,608
or have any more silly ideas
about myself or anybody else.

668
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,743
George, l-I
didn't know you...
I knocked twice, miss,

669
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,655
and when I heard you
talking to someone I
thought I'd better step in.

670
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,387
There's no one in here.
Talking?

671
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,522
Oh! I must have been
talking to myself.

672
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,932
I'm sorry to interrupt, miss,
but everything's been arranged
and you're going to the ball.

673
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,097
I am?
Indeed you are. UncleJason
is still in Washington.

674
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,107
But Aunt Grace said...
They'll be there.

675
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,234
They won't arrive
until midnight.

676
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,676
They'll be there
long before that.

677
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,907
No, they won't, miss.
Everything's been changed.

678
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,575
You'll be there and back
before they even arrive.
How will I go?

679
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,482
In your car.
And it's a pippin.

680
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,044
Who'll take me?
You'll have an escort
of six white bikes.

681
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,317
Six white what?
Bikes, miss.
Motor police.

682
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,053
And there they are.

683
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,791
You mean l...
I'm to go with them?

684
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,925
They'll get you there
before you can say
"Jack Robinson."

685
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,901
Mike told them
you were in a hurry.
Mike?

686
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,565
My brother, miss. These lads
work with him. They borrowed
the commissioner's car.

687
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,837
Now remember, miss.
You're not to stay
a minute later than 12:00.

688
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,573
I won't.
And the boys will be waiting
for you to bring you back.

689
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,581
All right.

how much I appreciate...

Have you got it
or ain't you?
I know I had it yesterday.

708
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,629
I usually keep it
in the pocket in this door.

709

I don't wanna know
about your personal habits.

All I want is to see
the owner's license.

Terry, tell the young man
we have to go now.

Yes, ma'am, just as soon...
I think the whole thing
is ridiculous.

Maybe it is and
maybe it ain't, sister.
But I gotta stop...

and see the owner's license,
or else take 'em in.

a big mistake, officer.

the kind of people who
would steal an automobile?

we'll go some place else.

I could have told you this would
happen. I saw it in the stars.

You told me this was
gonna be a perfect evening.

I'm going to make you
pay a forfeit.

of Mr. Drake, our host,

by chance, that the orchestra
has here a Strauss waltz...

00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,817
Where is that boy?
Ted!
Right over there.

850
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,014
Wasn't that great?
Glad you liked it.

851
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,547
I was telling this young lady
I was disappointed in you
keeping her hidden this long.

852
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:13,187
This long?
I didn't even know that...
Now, now, son.

853
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,255
I know I'm old, but there's
nothing wrong with my eyes.

854
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,301
And I can tell
by looking at you two
that you're real old friends.

855
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,530
Mr. Drake...
Would you like to dance?

856
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,095
You hear that, Bevans?
Would she like to? What's the
matter with you young fellas?

857
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,938
She'd love to dance.
Yes, I would.

858
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,851
Lovely young lady,
Gerald.
Yes, indeed, Mr. Drake.

859
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,018
I wish that boy of mine
would get interested in a girl
like that and stay home...

860
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,254
instead of hopping off
on that South American thing.

861
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,524
Maybe he will.
Yes, maybe.

862
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:52,534
What'd you say her name was?
Don't start that!
I don't know!

863
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,403
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I'm used to leading.

864
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,144
At school when just we
girls danced, one led and...
And the other followed.

865
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,745
That's right.
How's your horse?
Shamrock?

866
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,722
Yes. I hope the sugar
didn't make him sick.

867
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:20,756
What's the matter?
I'm sorry. I was thinking
how different you look.

868
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,958
I'm glad of that.
I didn't see my face
until I got in the car.

869
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,593
You were in a bad way there
for a few minutes.

870
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,230
I didn't thank you for being
so nice about everything and
tell you I was all right.

871
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:34,402
I figured you were all right
when I heard you'd run away.
I couldn't help that.

872
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:38,436
Don't, don't ever
run away again
without saying good-bye.

873
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,449
I mean it.

874
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,683
[Orchestra Stops]
[Applause]

875
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,026
[Orchestra]

876
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,748
Too many people here.
Yes.

877
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:54,790
Let's go outside.
All right.

878
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,869
It isn't too cool for you,
is it?
No, not at all.

879
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,371
If you'd rather go inside...
No.

880
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,034
Maybe you would, though.
I could get your wrap.

881
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,043
Oh, no, really.
I'm all right.

882
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,045
I was...
Do you...

883
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,377
Go ahead.
It was nothing.
What were you going to say?

884
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,408
I was just thinking
I'm leaving here next week.

885
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,944
Are you?
I'm going to South America
with Dr. McKenzie.

886
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,515
You've heard of him,
haven't you?
McKenzie? I think I have.

887
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,720
He's the world's greatest
authority on rubber trees.

888
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,423
He's been to the Amazon
30 times. He always says,

889
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,489
[Scottish Accent]
"I'm verra, verra fond
of the wee river."

890
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,195
He talks like that
and calls me laddie.
[Chuckles]

891
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:44,603
Laddie?

892
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:49,134
Do you have to go?
It's sort of a declaration
of independence to Dad.

893
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:53,080
He's got a lot of ideas about
handing me a ready-made future.

894
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,209
Oh, I see.

895
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,152
Look at that traffic.
And it's after 12:00.

896
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:04,922
Yes, it certainly is.
Will you be away long?
About six months.

897
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,554
Where will you stay?
On our boat.

898
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,999
It's a big sailboat
with an auxiliary,
a diesel engine.

899
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,332
Sailboats are beautiful.

900
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,531
Yes, they are beautiful.

901
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,913
What's a diesel engine?

902
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,250
Well, it's on the same principal
as a regular gasoline engine...

903
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,552
only instead
of using crude oil...

904
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:38,253
Did you say it was 12:00?

905
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,454
It's after 12:00.
See the clock down there?

906
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,862
Oh, l...
Well, good-bye.

910

[Ted]
You're not gonna run away,
are you?

911
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,093
[Barbara]
Hello, Ted.

912
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,103
Hello, Mrs. Clinton.
Walter.

913
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,139
We've had
an appalling experience.
We're jailbirds.

914
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,869
What are you doing
with that slipper?
Looking for it's owner.

915
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,104
I'll be right back.
Who'd he say
he was looking for?

916
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,669
- I don't know.
- [Grace] He's probably playing some game.

917
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,012
[Walter]
He seemed delighted we were
here.
[Man] Hello, Grace.

918
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,449
[Woman]
We thought you'd never get here.
We were delayed.

919
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,453
By the law.
Wasn't it horrible, dear?

920
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,546
It wasn't fun.
I rather enjoyed it.

921
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,423
What happened?
Oh, Ted. Your father
knows the mayor, doesn't he?

922
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,621
Yes...
Mother wants to reform
the whole city government.

923
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,630
Good.
Excuse me a minute.

924
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,963
You didn't see a girl
go any place without a slipper,
did you?
No.

925
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,867
Well...
Be back in a minute.

926
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,531
I never heard of such
inefficiency.
Does anybody know who...

927
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,973
Ted's looking for?
[Woman] Probably
the girl who was singing.

928
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,340
[Barbara]
He's certainly
in a dither about her.

929
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,845
[Walter]
Let's all go up
and help him find her.

930
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,298
Did you see that girl
with the white wrap?
She looked just like Connie.

931
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,338
It can't be.
Connie isn't here.

932
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,566
Did that wrap she
was wearing have a hood?
I don't know.

933
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,575
Have you seen
Ted running around
with that slipper?

934
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,543
I thought it was yours
'til I saw how small it was.

935
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,444
It belonged to some new girl,
somebody no one ever saw before.

936
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,948
Shejust ran away
with the party. Nobody's
seen Ted since she sang.

937
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:45,351
And when she danced,
shejust closed her eyes
and lost herself in a dream.

938
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,515
Did that girl wear
a silver-lace dress?
Uh-huh. Very sweet.

939
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,685
Not severe like your black.
Just girlish. Do you know her?

940
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,355
Tell you later.
Get my wrap, please.
Yes, miss.

941
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,660
We've been waiting for you,
miss.
Oh, George!

942
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,668
Tell us all about it.
I don't know where
to begin.

943
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,670
Any trouble getting in?
No.

944
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,639
- You didn't run into
Mrs. Clinton and the brats?
- No, but I saw them.

945
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,642
[Martha]
Did they see you?
[Agnes] What time?

946
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,701
No, I hid behind a post.
They got in about midnight.
How did you know...

947
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,543
A little bird told us.
[Agnes]
A little bird named Mike.

948
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,310
Did you dance?
Yes, and I sang.

949
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,410
I'll bet they cheered.
And Mr. Drake...

950
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:21,650
Oh, so that's the "he."
[Whistles]

951
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,521
[Connie] Agnes, it was...
What I wouldn't have given
to see you.

952
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,323
He was so nice, Agnes.
Oh, don't ask me.
[George] What did you sing?

953
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,354
A Strauss waltz. You know.
[Humming]

954
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,799
We'd best go in the kitchen,
miss.
I've got some hot chocolate...

955
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,929
and a piece of cake for you.
And you can start
at the very beginning.

956
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,939
You're lame!
I lost a slipper.

957
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,271
How'd you do that?
It was awful.
I had to start running...

958
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:44,575
No more here. The old man's
working in his study
and we'll get into a...

959
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,117
I'm working;
you're making noise.

960
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,585
So we'll have to stop the work
or stop the noise.

961
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,590
I'm very sorry.
It's my fault, UncleJim.

962
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,821
Maybe it is.
We won't have any more of it.

963
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,732
UncleJim. George told me
to be quiet or go to another
room so I wouldn't disturb you...

964
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,602
Have a nice time
at the party?

965
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:16,373
What? Oh, yes, wonderful.
Uh-huh.
Danced, huh?

966
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,414
Met some nice people?
Oh, yes, UncleJim.
Very nice.

967
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,007
What'd your cousin say
when she saw you?

968
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,815
Oh, I didn't speak to Barbara,
Aunt Grace or Walter, either.

969
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:30,086
Smart girl. Run up
to bed now. Good night.

970
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,024
Good night.

971
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:36,394
The family must have stopped
someplace on the way...
Yeah, stopped in jail.

972
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,662
Kept 'em there
'til midnight. Should have
kept 'em there longer.

973
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,466
Jail? What happened?
Don't know.

974
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,440
They called me to get
my lawyer. Couldn't get him.

975
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,943
Couldn't remember
his telephone number.

976
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:53,948
Couldn't even remember his name.
Couldn't remember anything.

977
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:59,382
I don't understand.
Had a good time,
you said.

978
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:03,824
You knew about
UncleJason?

979
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:08,227
I know a lot of things.
I know every cloud
has a silver lining.

980
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,891
They went to jail;
you went to the ball.

UncleJim, you...
Oh!

Car coming up the driveway.
This is all a secret.

983
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,339
I'll never tell a soul.
Make my life miserable
if you do. Yours too.

01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,640
It's Barbara.
You'd better scat.

Are you asleep?
Uh-huh. Ooh, that light
hurts my eyes.

990
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:04,476
- I just wanted to see
that you were in.
- I'm in. Good night.

01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,283
Have you been in all night?
What time is it?

992
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,223
- You were home all night?
- UncleJason didn't arrive.

993
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:14,285
Sorry if I interrupted
your beauty sleep.
That's all right.

994
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,351
So you were at the party.
Yes.

995
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,217
And you sang.
Um-hmm.
I sang.

996
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:43,486
Didn't I tell you
to stay here?
I didn't want to.

997
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,119
Oh, you didn't want to.

998
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,164
Nope. I knew UncleJason
wasn't coming and I had
a chance to go, so I went.

999
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,725
- You mean you sneaked in.
- There's nothing you can do that
could spoil this night for me.

1000
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,933
Would it spoil things if I asked
how you turned your graduation
dress into a Paris creation?

1001
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:02,501
OIlie made it out of some
silver lace I had. Not that
it's any of your business.

1002
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,105
And that wrap. She made that
out of a pair of pet ermine
she's been keeping?

1003
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,845
A friend of mine said I could...
I'm not going to quarrel
with you, Barbara.

1004
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,353
I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
You must have been wonderful.

1005
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,787
Thank you. Now, if you're
through being sarcastic...

1006
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,325
Even Ted said he never
had so much fun.

1007
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,521
He thought you were
a night club singer pretending
to be somebody important,

1008
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,359
so he decided
to play up to it.

1009
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,561
It's so funny. And his
imitation of you dancing with
your eyes shut is wonderful.

1010
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,594
People just roll on the floor
when he does it. He does it
over and over again.

1011
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,402
And leaving your slipper.
That was so touching.

1012
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,170
Ted's going to use it
to try and find you.

1013
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,336
He wants to hire you
to play the same joke
on a friend of his in Boston.

1014
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,848
You get out of here.
This is my room and l...

1015
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,817
Oh, you want to be alone.
You have so much to think about,
so much to dream over.

1016
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,820
Get out!
All right.

1017
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,346
I'll go down to the kitchen
and tell your chums
what a success you were.

1018
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,418
[Sobbing]

1019
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,531
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

1020
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,538
Your orange juice, sir.
Um-hmm.

1021
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,904
Your coffee black
as usual?
Um-hmm.

1022
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,705
Anything else, sir?
Not a thing.

1023
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,207
Then this is good-bye,
sir.

1024
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,884
Going someplace?

1025
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,480
I'm leaving, sir.
Miss Barbara sacked
the whole staff last night...

1026
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,684
when she found out we'd helped
Miss Connie get to the party.

1027
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,693
What?
Oh, that's all right, sir.

1028
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,992
Not one of us would have stayed
after Miss Connie left.

1029
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,067
Connie left?

1030
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:37,902
Bag and baggage, sir.
We wanted her to stay
and have a talk with you, sir,

1031
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,964
but she said she had
made enough trouble.

1032
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,875
And didn't leave a note?
She said she'd
write to you, sir,

1033
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,675
when she was settled
and making her own way.

1034
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:50,481
I do think she was trying
to make it easier...
for us all.

1035
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,113
I'd like to talk
to the other servants, George.

1036
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,922
They've been
gone hours, sir.
[Mrs. Clinton]Jimmie.!

1037
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,360
Jimmie, you have to
drive me into town.
We have no chauffeur.

1038
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:06,299
Did you know that Connie had left?
Yes, so has everyone else.
No cook, no butler, no maids.

1039
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,393
And you're not with us
anymore, are you, George?

1040
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,496
- No, madam, I'm not.
- Such a pity.
You're such a good butler too.

1041
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:17,103
It was nothing personal. Just a bad
constellation for everybody.
It won't happen again.

1042
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,808
Connie's a very young girl
to be out on her own.
It's not right.

1043
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,250
I'm going to look up her
horoscope and find out what evil
influence brought this about.

1044
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,084
I'm also going to see
if it's a good time
to employ new people.

1045
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,124
We have to wait
until the stars are right.

1046
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,093
I'm hungry.
The cook has left,
Mr. Walter.

1047
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,097
Father, can you make coffee?

1048
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:42,228
Do you know that your cousin
has left this house?

1049
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,795
I only know
I'm hungry.

1050
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,315
Don't you think we better
do something practical
about Connie?

1051
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,944
I'm doing the most
practical thing in the world:

1052
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,989
Checking her
complementary influence
againstJupiter's emphasis.

1053
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,991
Then there's a trend
of depression that's been...

01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,915
Jim, it's taken me years
to work that all out!

this thing, either!

1057

Are you losing your mind?

1058

Now, you listen to me,
Gracie Schultz!

1059
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,392
I've had all the twaddle
I'm gonna have about
the eight and ninth house...

1060
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:46,764
and the influence of this and
that, and Leo being in Libra
that I'm gonna have!

another peep outta you
about the sun, moon or stars,

Don't "Father" me! I know
what you did and for once...

There's one more thing
I want you to...

1082
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,661
Don't you ever do anything
but sit sprawled out
in that chair?

1083
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,060
But, Father, I have
a theory, you know.
Really?

1084
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:26,534
A theory of relaxation.
I worked it all out myself.
In that chair?

1085
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,570
Um-hmm.
It's taken years.

1086
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,073
I believe that one
through relaxation,
prolonged and constant,

1087
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,770
can store up sufficient energy
to surmount any emergency
that arises...

where vitality is called for
and force is needed.

Simple, isn't it?
Almost too simple.

1090
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,148
You see, I don't spend energy,
I hoard it.

1091
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,154
Sort of sit on it?
Exactly.

1092

I've already proved all forms
of exercise are wrong.

Say a man gets up
and does his daily dozen.

The first time
he stretches,

1095
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,864
bends over,
touches the floor,

1096
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,731
he's spent 14 pounds
of energy.

1097
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,795
To get back to
his normal position, how much
do you think he spends?

1098
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:08,502
Uh, from the position
you were in just now?

1099

Um-hmm. Identical with it.
Just about...

Practically none, because
I'd help him like that!

we gotta do! Find Connie

Nope.

I'm surprised. Feel better?

and it won't make me
feel any worse.

1130
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,004
First, you'll be
a junior instructor.

1131
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:25,376
You'll get paid half as much
as you need to live on,
if you call it living.

1132
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:29,383
You'll wear last year's hats,
two-year-old dresses
and patched up shoes.

1133
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,919
But it won't make much
difference how you look
'cause there won't be...

1134
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,478
anybody lookin' at you,
except a lot
of so-called students.

1135
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:37,855
I'll have my work.
You'll have that.

1136
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,690
Later on by scrimping
you'll have money to travel on...

1137
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,595
third class and alone,
or with another teacher.

1138
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:48,500
I like to be alone.
You don't even know
what the word means, child!

1139
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,028
My pupils will love me, I hope,
as much as they love you.

1140
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,076
I'm a character, a crotchety,
loveable old character.

1141
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:59,011
I hate being a character.
Do you like cats?

1142
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:03,245
- No, not much.
- Huh. You'll get
to love them.

1143
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,912
They've got sense.
They're like men:

1144
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:09,651
Feed them, pet them and
admire them and they'll purr.

1145
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:12,250
Every woman
wants to make somebody purr.

1146
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:16,320
You want to lock yourself up
in a world of women, a little
world, a sheltered world.

1147
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,559
A useless, polite
frightened world.

1148
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,865
Miss Wiggins, I'm not a child.
I know what I want to do.

1149
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:26,431
Work and support myself
and not depend on other people
for happiness or anything else.

1150
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:34,146
All right.
Where's your diploma?

1151
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:38,414
I'll have to sent it along
with the application
for the scholarship.

1152
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,614
It's right here.

1153
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:46,085
There's a teacher's powwow
here on the sixth.

1154
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,789
They'll be here
from all over the state.

1155
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,061
We'll have to line up
some votes for you
while they're on the ground.

1156
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:56,195
Here's a list of credits.
Hmm, pretty slipper.

1157
01:17:56,271 --> 01:18:00,071
The other one, I suppose,
is the one Mr. Blake had.
Mr. Drake.

1158
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,940
What you keeping it for?
I just happened to pack it.

1159
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:08,039
To have something to cry into
30 years from now?
Get rid of it.

1160
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,314
You'll sing at that meeting,

1161
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,948
show them a sample
of what you know
about music,

1162
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,356
have them make up
their minds right away.

1163
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:21,055
Thank you.
That'll be marvelous.

1164
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:24,257
It'll be terrible, but I'll do it.
You'll get a new dress for it.

1165
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,665
I'll have the girls go to
the auditorium so you'll
have an audience...

1166
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,727
and you'll sing something
that will be effective.

1167
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,137
The Spring Song.
No, not the Spring Song.

1168
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,971
One fine day.
"Butterfly" by Puccini.

1169
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:37,807
Know it?
Yes.

1170
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,576
We have to work on it.
That'll make 'em all cry.

1171
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,914
All the old maids
will sniffle.

1172
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,886
You know, "One fine day
he'll come back to me."

1173
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,890
Oh, but l...
I'd rather... l...

1174
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,325
Rather what?
Couldn't I sing
something else?

1175
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:57,354
Why?
I don't think it's a good idea
to make them sad.

1176
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,525
Make you sad
to sing it?

1177
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:03,537
No, no, not me.
You just said it'd
make them cry.

1178
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:07,097
Old maids are
only happy when they cry.
You'll find that out.

[Knock At Door]

1180
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,008
Miss Wiggins, we just heard
that Connie was... Oh!

1181
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,049
Hello, Connie!
When did you get back?

1182
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,881
[Chattering]
Go along, all of you,
and stop chattering.

[Chattering Continues]

1184
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,926
Why didn't you go
with Connie?
I don't know her.

1185
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:32,228
I came in to see
if you would mark the cuts
in this orchestration for me.

1186
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,359
Irene told me to do it...
I'll fix it.

1187
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,462
You will?
Thanks a lot, Miss Wiggins!
Good-bye!

1188
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,138
I said I'll fix it,
didn't I?

On his face
you are looking

1193
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:07,290
Hear me

1194
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:15,532
One fine day
we'll notice

1195
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:22,015
A thread of smoke arising

1196
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,075
On the sea

1197
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:30,147
In the far horizon

1198
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:32,693
And then

1199
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:38,461
The ship appearing

1200
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:44,199
Then the trim white vessel

1201
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:47,639
Glides

1202
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:52,544
Into the harbor

1203
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:59,110
Thunders forth her cannon

See you

1205

Now he is coming

1206
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:15,429
I do not go to meet him

Not I

01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:24,073
I stay upon the brow
of the hillock

for a long time

[Whispers]
Miss Wiggins.
There is coming

01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:58,136
A little, little speck
in the distance

1216

Climbing the hillock

1217
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:09,880
Can you guess
who it is

1218
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,620
And when he's reached
the summit

1219
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,960
Can you guess
what he'll say

Butterfly from the distance

I, without answering, hold
myself quietly concealed

1223
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:34,076
A bit to tease him
