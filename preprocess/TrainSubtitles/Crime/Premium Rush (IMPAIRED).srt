Yeah, and that brake's
gonna get you killed.
You should get rid of that.

The worst shit that

happened when I had a brake.

Brakes are death.

Hi.
Hey.

633
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:20,294
I'm almost done.
My friend borrowed
a truck to help me move,

634
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,631
so I'll be outta here
by 6:00.

Thank you.

636
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:27,267
I'm sorry it is so sudden.
You will be all right?

637
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:30,341
Yeah. I'm staying
with my aunt
until I find a place.

638
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,638
Okay, good.

I still don't get
what happened.

640
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,307
Did I do something
to piss you off or something?

641
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,350
No, I told you,
it's a private matter.

642
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,510
Okay.

643
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:43,120
Excuse me,
I have some things
to take care of.

Whoa.

645

Where'd you get all that?

646
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:57,826
This is my business.

647
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:58,927
Better for you
to stay out of it.
