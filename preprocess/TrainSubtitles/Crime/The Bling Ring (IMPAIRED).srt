is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.

1072
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,446
And our moms became, like, best friends.

1073
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,286
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!

1074
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,170
- So, basically you took her in.
NICKI: Yes.

1075
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,891
We took her in about six years ago.

1076
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,203
But let's, uh...
Let's... Let's get back to Nicki, okay?

1077
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,090
(ALL CHUCKLE)

1078
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,130
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.

1079
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,010
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.

1080
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,845
- Mm-hmm.
- It's called the Agape Church.

1081
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,129
- Right.
- It's the religious science philosophy...

1082
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,202
beneath <i>The Secret.</i>

1083
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,410
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.

1084
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,643
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...

1085
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,883
where they build wells
and schools for kids.

1086
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,088
Which country?

1087
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,561
Um, I can't remember
exactly which country...

1088
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:06,807
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.

1089
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,201
Okay. So there's a little bit
of a disconnect...

1090
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,931
between your positive pursuits
and what's happening now.

1091
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,002
Nicki, I don't want you
to answer that comment.

1092
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,561
Well, I think that I am.

1093
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,563
Don't.

1094
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,166
I have, like,
a good statement to say about this.

1095
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,004
She could speak generally.

1096
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,846
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...

1097
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,208
as a huge learning lesson for me...

1098
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,127
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

1099
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,409
I believe that I am an old soul.

1100
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,209
You are, honey. She is.

1101
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,203
We've gotten to know
Nicki and her family...

1102
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,921
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...

1103
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,128
who has a lot to offer the community.

1104
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,204
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect.

1105
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,248
That there were circumstances
that happened...

1106
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,642
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...

1107
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,770
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.

1108
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,400
What's your goal, or life plan,
if you have one?

1109
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,484
I do. I think it's my journey...

1110
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,042
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.

1111
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,801
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.

1112
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,281
It's my main goal.

1113
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,561
I... want to be a leader...

1114
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,850
and do things that people really notice.

1115
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,081
That's why I'm taking business-

1116
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,403
so that I can be a leader...

1117
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,280
and-and take a stand for people.

1118
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,765
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...

1119
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,402
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

1120
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,164
And now you're a star.

1121
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,284
Yeah... On my Facebook page recently...

1122
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,011
I had over 800 friend requests.

1123
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,441
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn't even look at them.

1124
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,533
- And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.

1125
01:14:03,559 --> 01:14:04,311
- Hmm.

1126
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,649
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...

1127
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,840
for... for something
that's so looked down on in society.

1128
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,362
If it had been, you know, something
that were to benefit the community...

1129
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,125
or something like that, I'd love it.

1130
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,806
But it's kind of showing America has this.

1131
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,805
This sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.

01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,081

1140

in any of those houses, okay?

days for her involvement in the Bling Ring...

1201
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,926
and shared a cellblock
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.

1202

There were reports
that Lindsay was crying.

With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?

1204
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,203
Yeah. I could hear her crying
the first day...

1205
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,205
which is really hard
when you're just trying to be strong.

I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.

Now, were you nervous being next to her?

Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...

that allegedly robbed her house.

on TVs inside...

and, you know, little do people know...

1220
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,768
that when that first video came out...

1221
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,242
I was actually in contact
with her manager...

1222
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,291
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.

1223
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,967
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...

1224
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,929
people are gonna know the truth.

So, that's nerve-racking.

1226
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,646
She could think you robbed her house.

1227
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,122
Yeah. She could have.

1228
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,682
But, you know, anyway...

1229
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,526
you can follow everything about me
and my journey...
