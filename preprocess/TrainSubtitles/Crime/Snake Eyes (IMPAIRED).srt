Enough.

00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,279
The people that set this up
said if l dropped this one,

595
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,516
they'd square
everything l owed.

596
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,553
Plus, if l lose to an underdog,
it would set me up for a rematch,

597
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,910
and the rematch
is where the real money is.

598
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,634
They didn't say what round
they wanted it in.

599
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,355
They were gonna let me know during the
fight. There was a guy in the front row.

600
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,268
They told me what he was gonna say, and
he was gonna be the signal to go down.

l ain't never
gonna forget those words:

''Here comes the pain.''

lt was all l could do to keep from
taking him out. Just one punch.

- Yeah.

in his ear.

to take a decent swing at me.

was gonna bullshit me to death.

to shut him up.

They were very clear about that.

back into the corner,
let him charge in and knock me out...

of Allah,'' shit like that.

He was all worked up
about our missile sales to lsrael,

A hole ripped open in the bulkhead,
and the sea flooded in.

said, ''Cut defence spending,''

he started playing political games
with real soldiers' lives.

He forced Powell
into an early test.

He positioned the system to fail,
because he didn't want to pay for it.
