1
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,270
An article, which I believe
appeared in a newspaper,

2
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,272
asked why, since you are,

3
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,776
or it would seem that you are in effect,

4
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:30,277
the mayor of Chicago,

5
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:33,280
you've not simply been
appointed to that position.

6
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,483
Well, I'll tell you, you know, it's touching.

7
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:41,489
Like a lot of things in life,

8
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,491
we laugh because it's funny,

9
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,993
and we laugh because it's true.

10
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,996
Some people say, "Put that man in jail.

11
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,999
What does he think he is doing?"

12
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,001
What I hope I'm doing...

13
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,833
here's where your English paper's got a point...

14
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:00,363
is I'm responding to the will of the people.

15
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,568
People will drink.

16
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:02,974
We all know that.

17
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,878
And all I do is act on that.

18
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,779
All this talk of bootlegging...

19
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,283
What is bootlegging?

20
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,285
On the boat, it's bootlegging.

21
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,287
On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality.

22
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,788
I'm a businessman.

23
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,791
And what of your reputation

24
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,657
that you control your business through violence,

25
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,492
that those that don't purchase your products

26
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,532
are dealt with violently?

27
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,229
It's all right.

28
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,843
I grew up in a tough neighborhood.

29
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,675
We used to say, you can get further

30
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:41,511
with a kind word and a gun

31
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,847
than with just a kind word.

32
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,854
In that neighborhood, it might have been true.

33
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,856
Sometimes a reputation follows you.

34
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,859
There is violence in Chicago, of course,

35
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:55,863
but not by me and not by anybody I employ

36
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,899
because it's not good business.

37
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:32,233
Leave us alone down here.
We're getting along fine.

38
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,235
We have everything we need.

39
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:37,238
The green beer you're peddling ain't any good.

40
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:39,740
It ain't supposed to be good.

41
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,742
It's supposed to be bought.

42
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,437
I'm not buying any.

43
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,182
Don't worry about it, Pops.

44
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,878
We won't come back.

45
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:56,018
And how's everyone
at your house today?

46
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,183
They're fine.

47
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,988
Your mama well?

48
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,995
She has a little cold.

49
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:03,088
Oh, she does, huh?

50
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,096
But she'll be all right.

52
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,372
Here you go.

53
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,375
Thank you.

54
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,413
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
You be careful crossing the street.

56
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,348
Mister!

57
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,441
Mister!

58
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,713
Hey, mister!

59
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:26,719
Wait!

60
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:28,881
Mister, wait!

61
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,219
You forgot your brief...

62
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,455
Yes. I heard it on the radio.

63
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:41,123
I know.

64
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:45,633
Now it's time to go to work.

65
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,141
Go make a good first impression.

66
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,915
I love you, Eliot.

67
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,290
Now, shoo.

68
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,758
Eliot Ness...

69
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,860
special agent of the Treasury Department.

70
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,131
Mr. Ness.

71
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,638
Thank you, Chief.

72
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:27,641
At the request of the city of Chicago,

73
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,142
the federal government,

74
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,645
specifically the Department of the Treasury,

75
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,146
has inaugurated a program

76
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,150
to deal with the flow of illegal liquor

77
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:38,152
and the violence it creates.

78
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,654
Of what does this program consist?

79
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,656
I and other Treasury agents

80
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:45,659
will work with the Chicago police and other...

81
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,161
Isn't this just another showpiece program?

82
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,165
What do you think about prohibition, Mr. Ness?

83
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,167
Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

84
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:54,668
Answer the questions.

85
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,101
It's not a showpiece.

86
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:57,604
And I'll tell you

87
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,106
exactly how I feel about prohibition.

88
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,609
It's the law of the land.

89
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:05,111
Do you consider yourself a crusader?

90
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,114
What qualifications do you have?

91
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,616
Do you have any political ambitions?

92
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,845
All right, boys.
That's enough.

93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,080
Excuse me.

94
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:16,090
Mr. Ness. What are your real plans?

95
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,093
You'll have to read about it in the paper.

96
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:22,096
Listen, let me ride along with you.

97
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,995
No. Can't help you.

98
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,000
Mr. Ness. Lieutenant Olveson, the flying squad.

99
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,003
Are you ready to meet the men?

100
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,766
Well...

101
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,569
Yes, I am.

102
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:46,109
I have one more thing to say.

103
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:53,917
I know that many of you take a drink.

104
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:57,421
What you've done before today is not my concern.

105
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,922
But now we must be pure,

106
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,425
and I want you to stop.

107
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:03,926
It's not a question

108
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,930
of whether or not it's a harmless drink.

109
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,932
It's against the law, gentlemen.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,798
As we are going to enforce the law,

111
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,133
we must do first by example.

112
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,209
Are there any questions?

113
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,638
Good.

114
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,444
The Department of the Treasury

115
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:28,713
has had a man undercover here for some time.

116
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,118
We've received word from this informant

117
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,454
of a large shipment of
Canadian whiskey to Chicago.

118
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:37,289
I hope you've signed on for some action.

119
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,954
You're going to get it.

120
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:47,270
Remember, the liquor cases are marked

121
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,272
with a red maple leaf.

122
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,329
Yes, sir.

123
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:53,343
The Treasury agent is in a gray suit.

124
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,936
He is not to be arrested.

125
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,446
A gray suit.

126
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,449
I think that's about it.

127
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,950
Are your men ready?

128
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,451
Yes, sir. They are.

129
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,782
Good.

130
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,626
At ease.

131
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,129
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

132
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,037
How are we doing?

133
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,037
O.K.

134
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,546
Want part of a sandwich?

135
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,047
No, thank you, sir.

136
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:38,821
You nervous?

137
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,879
No, sir.

138
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:44,327
Been with the unit long?

139
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:45,828
A short while.

140
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,400
I suppose we all want to do well.

141
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,799
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:56,771
[Chuckles]

143
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,639
A message from my wife.

144
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,411
You married?

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,778
Yes, sir, I am.

146
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,783
Nice to be married, huh?

147
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,666
What is it?

148
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:27,002
Just follow me.

149
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:41,176
[Dog Barks]

150
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,410
Federal officer.
Hands in the air.

151
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,949
Get them up.

152
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:14,484
Drop it.

153
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,520
I can't...

154
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,054
Mr. Ness.

155
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:22,456
Look, I was just...
Jeez, I'm sorry.

156
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:28,098
Listen, listen.
I can do a lot for you.

157
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:31,293
I get the big scoop.
You make a big splash.

158
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,859
Get yourself some support.

159
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,370
What do you say?

160
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,030
Let me help you.

161
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,597
O.K. Just shut up.

162
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,632
All right, now!

163
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,694
Let's do some good!

164
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,142
Let's get 'em.
Come on, guys.

165
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,515
Hold it right there!

Federal officer.

167
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,857
You're under arrest

00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:48,537
Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,309
No one's allowed in here.

172

Mr. Ness!

173
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,714
It's all right.

174
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:56,252
Let... Let him through here.

175
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,217
You want to take your picture?
Take it now.

00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:03,559
You ready?

177
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:04,560
Ready.

178

Liquor, huh?

179
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,916
Get him out of here.

180
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:39,019
Tear the place apart.

181
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,530
I mean now!
Get him out!

182
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,588
Yes, sir.

183

That means you, too.

184
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:16,898
Now, what do you think you're doing? Hmm?

185
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,400
You want to throw your garbage?

186
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,403
Throw it in the damn trash basket.

187
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:26,339
Don't you have more important things to do?

188
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,535
Yeah.

189

But I'm not doing them right now.

190
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:33,814
We understand each other?

191

O.K., pal, why the mahoska?

192
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,222
Why are you packing the gun?

193
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:45,726
I'm a Treasury officer.

194
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:50,794
All right.

195
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:55,303
Just remember what we talked about, now.

196
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:01,100
Hey. Wait a minute.

197
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:06,513
What kind of police you have in this damn city?

198
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:08,914
You turned your back on an armed man.

199
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,452
You're a Treasury officer.

200
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,784
How do you know?
I just told you that.

201
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:16,791
Who would claim to be that who was not?

202
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,798
What's your name and unit?

203
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,571
It's right here.

204

You got a beef?

205
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:36,410
What is it?

206
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,678
How did you know I had a gun?

207
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,311
What, you want a free lesson in police work?

208
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:49,382
No.

209
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,396
Are you O.K., pal?

210
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:59,467
I had a rough day on the job.

211
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:00,729
Ah.

212
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,896
Are you going home now?

213
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,564
I was about to.

214
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,177
Well, then you just fulfilled

215
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:11,611
the first rule of law enforcement.

216
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,342
Make sure when your shift is over,

217
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,854
you go home alive.

218

Here endeth the lesson.

219
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,751
We got $100,000 there for 40 barrels.

220
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,253
Make sure there are no empties.

221
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:28,256
I'll give you the ledger.

222

"Let's do some good."

229

I came here to thank you.

00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,327
It was...

00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:22,096
my little girl that got killed with that bomb.

I'm... I'm so sorry.

You see, it's...

238
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:36,049
because I know that you have children, too...

239
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:39,383
and that this is real for you

240
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:43,151
that these men caused this tragedy.

241
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:47,161
And I know you will put a stop to them.

242

Ness, I am just a poor beat cop.

Now, how can *I* help *you*?

250
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:10,588
Just work with me.

251
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:13,090
But why should I, though?

252
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,354
Because you're a good cop.

253
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:18,056
How do you know that?

254

You told me.

Oh. I'm such a good cop.

How come I'm walking
the beat then, at my age?

You want to tell me?

258
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,244
Maybe I'm that whore with a heart of gold

259

or the one good cop in the bad town.

Is that what you want to hear?

You want to stay on the beat, you do that.

He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:24,164
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

341
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:34,405
Do you know what a blood oath is, Mr. Ness?

342
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,412
Yes.

343
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,972
Good. Because you just took one.

344
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:42,721
How did Capone know about
your raid the other night?

345
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:44,221
Some cop told him.

346
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,723
Right.
Welcome to Chicago.

347
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,227
This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide.

348
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,731
Now, the first thing is, who can you trust?

349
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,730
Nobody.

350
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,731
The cops -- nobody.

351
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,734
Because nobody wants you here.

352
00:29:56,802 --> 00:29:59,737
Then why are you helping me?

353
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:02,740
Because I swore to uphold the law.

354
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:06,244
And if you believe that, I'll tell you another.

355
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:08,746
Now, who can you trust?

356
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:10,247
You trust nobody.

357
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:11,749
That's the solid truth.

358
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,752
Then where are we going to get help?

359
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,755
If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple,

360
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,757
don't go to the barrel.

361
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,952
Get it off the tree.

362
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,378
Get it off the tree.

363
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:27,537
[Gunshots]

364
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,548
Finger on the trigger guard!

365
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:31,049
Eject those cartridges!

366
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:32,550
Clear it all around!

367
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:34,052
Stand back!

368
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,644
About face!

369
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:39,158
Barry, I want you to meet Mr. Eliot Ness.

370
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:41,159
Treasury Department.
How are you?

371
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:44,162
We need a recruit for extended duty.

372
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,165
He's to be seconded to the Treasury Department.

373
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,167
We have the cooperation of...

374
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:52,170
Who is consistently this class' best shot?

375
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,172
Williamson and Stone.

376
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,036
Please call them out...

377
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,042
But one at a time.

378
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,873
Is either man married?

379
00:30:58,945 --> 00:30:59,934
No.

380
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,674
Good.

381
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:02,680
Williamson!

382
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:03,681
You're married.

383
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,344
I don't want any married men.

384
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,411
All right.
Stand easy, son.

385
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,117
I want to ask you something.

386
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:14,592
Why do you want to join the force?

387
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:16,151
To protect and s-s...

388
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,493
and s... To protect and serve.

389
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,623
To protect...

390
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,634
Please don't search for the yearbook answer.

391
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,067
Say what you think.

392
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,661
Well, what I think?

393
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:26,671
Yeah.

394
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,173
I could help...

395
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,539
with the force.

396
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,134
You can help?

397
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:33,144
The force.

398
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,612
With crime.

399
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,308
Thank you.

400
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,250
There goes the next chief of police.

00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,857

403
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:50,520
Out here.

404
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:53,698
This kid's a prodigy.

405
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:58,537
Why do you want to join the force?

406
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:01,540
To protect the property and the citizenry...

407
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:04,668
Don't waste my time with that bullshit.

408
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:07,577
Where are you from, Stone?

409
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:11,416
From the South Side.

410

Stone.

411
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:18,521
George Stone.
That's your name?

412
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,253
What's your real name?

413
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:22,658
That is my real name.

414
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:26,130
Nah. What was it before you changed it?

415
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,068
Giuseppe Petri.

416
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,603
Jeez, I knew it.

417
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,970
All you need is one thieving wop on the team.

418
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,271
What's that you say?

419
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,278
I said that you're a lying member

420
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,371
of a no-good race.

421
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:47,751
It's much better than you,
you stinking Irish pig.

422
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:50,719
Oh, I like him.

423
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,061
Yeah, I like him, too.

424
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,588
You just joined the Treasury Department, son.

425
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,692
Yeah, O.K.

Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

429
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:23,621
What do you think?

430
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,558
I think there's nothing like vaudeville.

431
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,060
That's what I think.

432
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:32,121
Now, are you ready to go to work?

433
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:33,631
Where are we going?

434
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,635
On a liquor raid.

435
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:38,136
We need another man.

436
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,138
Hey, Ness, it's very interesting.

437
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:43,141
I've found a financial disbursement pattern here

438
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,540
which shows some irregu...

439
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,771
You carry a badge?

440
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,210
Yes.

441
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,542

What?

00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:13,062
What the hell are you dressed for, Halloween?

445
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,004
Shut up.
I'm working.

446
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:15,938
Where?

447
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:16,976
The circus.

448
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:36,694
Look.
They've got guns.

449
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:39,865
Well, here we are.

450
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,366
What are we doing here?

451
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,526

The problem isn't finding it.

It's who wants to cross Capone.

Let's go.

You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

458
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,297
If you walk through this door,

459
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:16,233
you're walking into a world of trouble.

460
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:18,236
No turning back, you understand?

461
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,828
Yes, I do.

Give me that ax.

This is a raid!

What are you doing here?

469
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,095
All this stuff is impounded.

470

You're all under arrest.

Hey, this isn't right.

Hey, this is no good.

473
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:51,069
You got a warrant?

474
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,934
Sure. Here's my warrant.

476
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,775
better or worse?

477
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,952
What is that?

00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,454
What is that?

479
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:11,319
Yes. What is it?

00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:13,325
God, I'm with the heathen.

He's the patron saint of lost causes.

485
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:23,927
And policemen.

486
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,229
Patron saint of policemen.

487
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:29,775
Mmm. Everybody needs a friend.

488

Lost causes, policemen.

489
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,314
Which do you want to be?

490
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:38,680
I want to be a cop.

You do?

492
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:40,751
Yeah.

493
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,912
Why?

494
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,922
To protect the property and citizenry...

Who... It's all... It's all right.

496

What?

497
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,591
Congratulations.

498
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:59,104
O.K. If I get a picture of you and your men?

499
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,198
Yeah. But not for publication, just for us.

500
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:04,209
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

501
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,723
Closer in.
Arms straight.

502
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:08,755
O.K., ready? Hold it.

he's expected to have enthusiasms.

Enthusiasms.

508
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,847

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,353
What draws my admiration?

00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:42,357
What is that which gives me joy?

512
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,086
- Dames.
- Music.

513
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:49,859
Baseball.

514
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,229
A man...

515
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,242
A man stands alone at a plate.

516
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:07,579
This is the time for what?

517
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,244
For individual achievement.

518
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:14,451
There he stands alone.

519
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:19,124
But in the field, what?

520
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:21,789
Part of a team.

521
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,525
Teamwork.

522
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,157
Teamwork.

523
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,333
Looks, throws, catches, hustles...

524
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,602
Part of one big team.

525
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,668
Bats himself the livelong day.

526
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:39,681
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

527
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,519
If his team don't field, what is he?

528
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:49,290
You follow me?

529
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:50,916
No one.

530
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:55,597
Sunny day, the stands are full of fans.

531
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:58,098
What does he have to say?

532
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:02,093
I'm going out there for myself.

533
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,473
But...

534
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:10,035
I get nowhere unless the team wins.

535
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:11,204
Team.

536
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,975
- Yeah, team.
- Team.

537
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:20,988
Jesus Christ!

538
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:48,315
Now I lay me down to sleep.

539
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:51,547
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

540
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,021
If I should die before I wake,

541
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,355
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

542
00:39:58,427 --> 00:39:59,416
Amen.

543
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,826
God bless.

544
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:04,354
God bless Mommy. God bless Daddy.
God bless Dolly.

545
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:05,365
Amen.

546
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:06,366
Amen.

547
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,578
Good night.

548
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,079
Good night, Daddy.

549
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:20,581
Good night, little girl.

550
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,412
Can I have an Eskimo?

551
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:23,417
And butterfly.

552
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:35,029
Where are you going?

553
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,029
What?

554
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,034
Where are you going?

555
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:42,036
I thought I'd go downstairs.

556
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:44,038
Do some work for tomorrow.

557
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:47,041
You had a full day today, didn't you?

558
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,542
Yes, I certainly did.

559
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,045
You still got some energy left?

560
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:52,546
Oh, lot of work.

561
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:56,551
Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair,

562
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,211
you detective?

563
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,067
How are we doing?

564
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,501
Capone's organization is incredibly diverse.

565
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,004
Look at this.

566
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:19,506
It owns Canadian Holding Company Associations,

567
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:22,510
which owns in turn Green Light Laundry,

568
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:24,068
Midwest Cab, Jollytime Playthings...

569
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:25,113
Jollytime Playthings?

570
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,579
Yes, Jollytime Playthings.

571
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:30,176
Remind me to get a present for my daughter.

572
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:31,617
Bahamas Ship-to-Shore...

573
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,120
The list is endless.

574
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,053
All the business is legitimate.

575
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:37,058
Capone owns none of it.

576
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:40,061
We can get him on income tax evasion

577
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:43,064
if we can show that he's getting money

578
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,429
from the organization's business.

579
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,628
See, legally he receives no income.

580
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,136
He doesn't receive anything?

581
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,136
[Knock Knock]

582
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,639
Mr. Ness, you have a visitor.

583
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,142
Mr. Ness, could we talk?

584
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,905
John O'Shea, alderman.

585
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,913
I know who you are.

586
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,783
Would you excuse us?

587
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:08,589
We have several large operations in the works.

588
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:10,591
What can I do for you?

589
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:13,093
I came up to congratulate you

590
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:15,460
on a job well done,

591
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:19,797
share your good fortune on such a lovely day.

592
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,236
What's that?

593
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,136
What is that?

594
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,477
Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

595
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:36,541
Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt.

596
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,109
There is a large,

597
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:40,587
a large and popular business

598
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:42,886
which you are causing dismay.

599
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,893
Why don't you just cross the street

600
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,395
and let things take their course?

601
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:50,898
Would you come in here please?

602
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:57,237
In Roman times,

603
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:58,739
when a fella was convicted

604
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,241
of trying to bribe a public official,

605
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,246
they'd sew him in a bag with a wild animal

606
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,748
and throw that bag in the river.

607
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:09,147
You tell your master

608
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:11,948
that we must agree to disagree.

609
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,022
You're making a mistake.

610
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,820
I've made them before.
I'm beginning to enjoy them.

611
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,588
You're untouchable, is that it?

612
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,220
No one can get to you?

613
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:22,729
And you tell Capone...

614
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,527
Everyone can be gotten to.

615
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,329
I'll see him in hell.

616
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:29,937
Hey, nice house.

617
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:31,836
I said nice house.

618
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:33,340
You live there?

619
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,235
Little girl's having a birthday, huh?

620
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,732
Yes.

621
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:43,073
Nice to have a family.

622
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:47,104
Yes, it is.

623
00:43:48,483 --> 00:43:50,917
A man should take care,

624
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:53,420
see that nothing happens to them.

625
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:09,298
Katherine!

626
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:13,037
Katherine!

627
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,541
Where's the baby?

628
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,236
She's upstairs. Eliot...

629
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,312
Ohh...

630
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:20,313
Daddy.

631
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,310
Ohh, yes.

632
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,724
What were you doing up?

633
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:32,726
I had to finish my ironing.

634
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:33,818
You did?

635
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,065
You're going to come with Daddy now, O.K.?

636
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:50,870
Eliot.

637
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:52,379
O.K., it's all right.

638
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:54,312
O.K., let's go.

639
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:55,610
Stay there!

640
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:58,744
Keep your eye on the street.

641
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:01,379
Where's Malone?

642
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:04,391
He's on the stakeout.
He'll be right here.

643
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:05,391
Who's he?

644
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,588
One of the men on his list. He's O.K.

645
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:11,598
All right, then.
Drive them to the station.

646
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,601
She'll tell you where to go when you're there.

647
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,102
Take off your hat.

648
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,106
Anything happens, you shoot first,
you understand me?

649
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,607
Yes, Mr. Ness.

650
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:26,914
Kiss.

651
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:28,711
Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.

652
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:29,715
O.K.

653
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,917
Now, go.

654
00:45:57,912 --> 00:45:59,812
Malone.

655
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,314
Are you O.K.?

656
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,318
They're fine.
Are you sure the cop's O.K.?

657
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,820
He better be.
He's my cousin.

658
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,822
I want to hurt the man.

659
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,825
I want to start taking the battle to him.

660
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:14,828
Then merry Christmas because
we've got great news.

661
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:15,828
Tell him.

662
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:17,831
There's a huge international shipment

663
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:18,957
coming through.

664
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:22,492
We got the time, the place, the whole shebang.

665
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,505
Well, what are we doing standing here then?

666
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:28,942
How do you get this information?

667
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,444
That's the second rule of police work.

668
00:46:31,513 --> 00:46:35,279
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

669
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:42,923
You know he's making over $3 million a year?

670
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:44,925
But he's paid no taxes.

671
00:46:44,993 --> 00:46:46,426
Nothing's in his name.

672
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:49,429
If we can establish any payments to him,

673
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:52,432
we can prosecute him for income tax evasion.

674
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,432
What?

675
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,935
I said we can prosecute him

676
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:58,165
for income tax evasion.

677
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,436
Try a murderer for not paying his taxes?

678
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:03,500
Well, it's better than nothing.

679
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:09,977
All right. How do we link him to the money?

680
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:11,518

01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,955
We'll get that information one way or another.

853
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,456
Not that way.

854
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:11,961
You'll beg to talk 'cause
somebody's going to talk.

855
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:13,655
That dirty son of a bitch!

856
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,163
Enough out of you.

857
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:20,536
Hey, come on, you, on your feet.

858
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:23,664
I need you to help translate this book.

859
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,005
I'm not going to ask you a second time.

860
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:29,807
I'm going to count to 3.

861
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,312
Oh, what's the matter?

862
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:34,817
Can't you talk with a gun in your mouth?

863
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:38,081
1 ...

864
01:00:41,591 --> 01:00:42,956
2 ...

3! [Gunshot]

01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,463
Aah!

867
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:50,055
I'm going to talk.

868
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,499
No! I'll tell you whatever you want.

869
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:54,696
What do you want to know?

870
01:00:57,841 --> 01:01:01,777
And don't let him clean himself
till after he talks.

871
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:04,780
Now, ask him what you want to know.

872
01:01:04,848 --> 01:01:06,281
All right, uh...

873
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:09,716
O.K. I want to know the name of the bookkeeper.

874
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:13,017
I want a complete translation of the code.

875
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,580
Mr. Ness!

876
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:24,957
I do not approve of your methods.

877
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:27,601
Yeah?

878
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:30,037
Well, you're not from Chicago.

879
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:36,006
What?

880
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,444
They got the shipment.

881
01:01:37,514 --> 01:01:38,446
What?

882
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:40,574
They got the whole shipment.

883
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,880
I want him dead.
I don't care how.

884
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:44,010
We're trying...

885
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:45,520
Am I alone here?

886
01:01:45,588 --> 01:01:48,421
Did I ask what you're trying to do?

887
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:51,927
I want you to get this fuck where he breathes.

888
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:54,429
I want find him.
I want him dead.

889
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:55,930
I want his family dead!

890
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:58,763
I want his house burnt to the ground!

891
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:01,303
I want to piss on his ashes!

892
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:03,271
Look at this guy.

893
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:06,604
This guy... he's so serious.

894
01:02:06,676 --> 01:02:09,440
Well, he's got a lot on his mind.

895
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:10,376
He does?

896
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:11,379
Yes.

897
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:13,211
Like what?

898
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:15,547
Like what his name is.

899
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:16,550
Well... John.

900
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,553
I thought that was all settled.

901
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:19,610
It's John.

902
01:02:19,689 --> 01:02:22,487
I suppose his middle name will be Law.

903
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,049
No.

904
01:02:24,127 --> 01:02:25,958
It'll be Edgar.

905
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,564
It'll be J. Edgar.

906
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:31,463
I don't think so.

907
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:36,502
God, you're beautiful.

908
01:02:38,808 --> 01:02:41,641
You should have seen us last night.

909
01:02:43,813 --> 01:02:44,837
I know.

910
01:02:44,914 --> 01:02:47,883
I should have been here.
I wanted to be.

911
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:50,249
I understand. I do.

912
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,017
Just tell me, are you being careful?

913
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,251
Careful as mice.

914
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:58,590
Are you making progress?

915
01:02:58,661 --> 01:02:59,593
Progress?

916
01:02:59,662 --> 01:03:00,594
Yes.

917
01:03:00,663 --> 01:03:02,927
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband

918
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:06,435
just became the man who got Al Capone.

919
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:16,683
Gentlemen, a subpoena was issued

920
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:21,698
for Alphonse Capone by my office this morning

921
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:23,700
for the crime of evading

922
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:27,534
and conspiring to evade federal income tax.

923
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:29,539
What's the maximum Capone could get?

924
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:31,302
If convicted on all counts,

925
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:35,039
Mr. Capone could have up to 28 years.

926
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:36,546
Excuse me.
That's all.

927
01:03:36,614 --> 01:03:37,945
Thank you.

928

[Indistinct Questioning]

929
01:03:44,622 --> 01:03:46,055
O.K., here we go.

930
01:03:46,124 --> 01:03:47,887
The car's in the alley.

931
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:49,722
You don't answer the phone.

932
01:03:49,794 --> 01:03:51,227
We'll let it ring...

933
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:52,228
Twice.

934
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:53,229
From...

935
01:03:53,298 --> 01:03:54,230
The corner.

936
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:55,231
Anybody knocks...

937
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,564
Come out shooting.
I got it.

938
01:03:57,635 --> 01:04:00,399
You enjoy the tactical
aspects of law enforcement?

939
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:03,565
Yeah. It's much more diverting than accounting.

940
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:06,235
I been good to you.
You got to be good to me.

941
01:04:06,311 --> 01:04:09,576
We made a deal.
We'll stick to it, O.K.?

942
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,854
Oh, yes. Much more diverting than accounting.

943
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,685
O.K. We see youse tonight.

944
01:04:19,757 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah. O.K.

945
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:23,693
All right.
All the way down. No stops.

When he sees error...

when he sees crime...

948
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,705
he can say I will speak up.

949
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:38,708
Before you go, I got one more question.

950
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:42,542
I must commend the excellent work

951
01:04:42,614 --> 01:04:45,879
of Eliot Ness and his squad of untouchables.

952
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,815
What was it, boy or girl?

953
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:51,820
Boy.

Yeah, she's O.K.

961
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:04,898
She said she wants to repaint the whole house.

962
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:08,063
Then it will be too small.
You'll have to move.

Exactly.

If you can stand the pain.

Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

968
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:21,844
Didn't you see them?
They just went down the service elevator.

969
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,409
Very good.

970
01:05:23,488 --> 01:05:25,854
Keep an eye out, you hear?

971
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,892
I'm telling you they're going to send someone.

972
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,695
Did he say the service elevator?

973
01:05:39,771 --> 01:05:40,703
Yes.

974
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,043

01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,044
Wallace!

Let's take the stairs.

Oh.

978
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:32,421
No.

979
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,583
No.

980
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:35,751

01:07:46,764 --> 01:07:47,992
Ah.

987
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,700
It's always a crime

988
01:07:50,768 --> 01:07:54,033
when a young guy goes down on the lines.

989
01:07:55,273 --> 01:07:58,936
I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know.

990
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:02,207
Sometimes it's better not to get involved.

Leave the city for a while.

994
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:10,887
You know what I mean?

995
01:08:27,805 --> 01:08:28,999
Al Capone.

997
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:31,340
Get him.

998
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,341
We have no...

999
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:33,877
I said, goddamn it,

1000
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:35,913
I said...

1001
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,015
Something you want here?

1002
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:46,079
My friend was killed today.

1003
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:47,317
I don't care.

1004
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,949
You don't care.

1005
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:53,020
Now he does.

1006
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:54,530
Come on, Capone.

1007
01:08:54,599 --> 01:08:56,362
You want to fight?

1008
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:58,368
You and me, right here.

1009
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:00,233
That's it. Come on!

1010
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,967
What's the matter, you afraid
to stand up for yourself?

1011
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,508
You want it now?

1012
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:06,508
Let's go.

1013
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:08,169
You son of a bitch.

1014
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:10,305
What?

1015
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:13,612
You talk to me like that
in front of my son? Fuck you!

1016
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,619
Eliot! It's me.

1017
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:17,619
It's me.

1018
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:19,246
Not this way.

1019
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:20,620
Not this way.

1020
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:24,821
You fuck. You got nothing.

are we done?

01:36:19,985 --> 01:36:24,479
And you will decipher these coded entries for us.

1356
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:29,317
I will.

1357
01:36:29,394 --> 01:36:32,329
Sorry, Mr. Payne.
I can't hear you.

1358
01:36:32,397 --> 01:36:33,830
I said I will.

1359
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:38,933
You were in charge of disbursements
for Mr. Capone?

1360
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,536
Yes, I was.

1361
01:36:41,607 --> 01:36:44,940
And you personally distributed monies...

1362
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:49,140
vast, undeclared monies...

1363
01:36:49,214 --> 01:36:51,011
to Mr. Capone?

1364
01:36:52,217 --> 01:36:53,809
Yes, I did.

1365
01:36:55,254 --> 01:36:57,085
Would you tell us the amounts?

1366
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:01,616
In a three-year period,

1367
01:37:01,693 --> 01:37:05,823
I personally disbursed monies to Mr. Capone

1368
01:37:05,898 --> 01:37:10,562
in excess of $1.3 million.

1369
01:37:13,372 --> 01:37:16,341
Would you repeat that amount, please?

1370
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:20,739
$1.3 million.

1371
01:37:20,812 --> 01:37:23,372
Thank you very much.

1372
01:37:38,597 --> 01:37:40,428
I don't understand it.

1373
01:37:40,499 --> 01:37:41,932
What does Capone have?

1374
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,936
We're nailing the lid
on his coffin, and he's smiling.

1375
01:38:08,293 --> 01:38:11,626
He's wearing a gun in court.

1376
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,659
Get me the bailiff.

1377
01:38:19,404 --> 01:38:21,372
It'll be a fast trial.

1378
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:27,875
The man in the front row wearing the white suit

1379
01:38:27,946 --> 01:38:29,413
is carrying a gun.

1380
01:38:29,481 --> 01:38:32,245
I don't want this to turn into something.

1381
01:38:32,317 --> 01:38:35,582
When you get him up, I'll lead you out.

1382
01:38:40,892 --> 01:38:43,827
Could we speak to you a minute, please?

1383
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:14,343
Get up against it.

1384
01:39:14,412 --> 01:39:15,845
Who the hell are you?

1385
01:39:15,913 --> 01:39:17,847
You heard him.
Up against it.

1386
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,440
What's this?

1387
01:39:20,518 --> 01:39:24,284
Empty all your pockets.
On the table. All of it.

1388
01:39:24,355 --> 01:39:26,619
I got a permit for that.

1389
01:39:26,691 --> 01:39:28,124
Fine. Let's see it.

1390
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:32,696
You know, I'm not the one under indictment.

1391
01:39:32,764 --> 01:39:34,197
Everything on the table.

1392
01:39:37,568 --> 01:39:39,331
Give him his gun back.

1393
01:39:39,404 --> 01:39:40,666
"To whom it may concern...

1394
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:43,730
"Please extend to the bearer, Mr. Frank Nitti,

1395
01:39:43,808 --> 01:39:45,742
"all possible courtesy and consideration.

1396
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:48,745
William Thompson, mayor of the city of Chicago."

1397
01:39:48,813 --> 01:39:50,110
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness.

1398
01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:52,115
You'll have to give it back.

1399
01:39:52,183 --> 01:39:53,275
Fine.

1400
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:57,117
But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

1401
01:39:57,188 --> 01:39:58,621
Do you understand me?

1402
01:39:58,690 --> 01:39:59,622
Yes, sir.

1403
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,582
1634 Racine.

1404
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:35,092
You know, I used to have
a friend who lived there.

1405
01:40:48,406 --> 01:40:50,340
Don't.

1406
01:40:50,408 --> 01:40:51,841
Let him go.

1407
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:56,740
No!

1408
01:40:56,814 --> 01:40:58,247
Here. Take it.

1409
01:41:20,505 --> 01:41:22,439
[Gunshots]

1410
01:41:55,773 --> 01:41:56,899
Aah!

1411
01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:11,495
Here I am, Treasury man.

1412
01:45:11,569 --> 01:45:13,002
Come on.

1413
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:15,004
Arrest me.

1414
01:45:15,072 --> 01:45:17,540
What are you waiting for?

1415
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:21,736
Don't just stand there.
Arrest me.

1416
01:45:25,816 --> 01:45:27,681
Don't push me.

1417
01:45:30,287 --> 01:45:32,050
They're going to burn you.

1418
01:45:32,123 --> 01:45:33,090
Yeah?

1419
01:45:33,157 --> 01:45:37,059
I'll come see you burn, you son of a bitch,

1420
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:39,688
'cause you killed my friend.

1421
01:45:39,764 --> 01:45:41,664
He died like a pig.

1422
01:45:41,732 --> 01:45:43,097
What did you say?

1423
01:45:43,167 --> 01:45:45,601
I said your friend died screaming

1424
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:47,570
like a stuck Irish pig.

1425
01:45:47,638 --> 01:45:51,074
You think about that when I beat the rap.

1426
01:45:58,015 --> 01:45:59,812
Hey.

1427
01:45:59,884 --> 01:46:01,078
Aah!

1428
01:46:01,152 --> 01:46:04,349
Aah!

1429
01:46:04,422 --> 01:46:06,617
Did he sound anything like that?

1430
01:46:37,811 --> 01:46:40,245
One picture.
Come on. One picture.

1431
01:46:43,117 --> 01:46:46,052
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

1432
01:46:47,588 --> 01:46:48,577
Mr. Ness.

1433
01:46:50,758 --> 01:46:52,692
Mr. Ness, you doing O.K.?

1434
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,058
I think you better see this.

1435
01:46:55,129 --> 01:46:56,562
What is it?

1436
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:59,929
What is it? That's a jury list, Mr. Ness.

1437
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,433
They've been bribed.

1438
01:47:01,502 --> 01:47:03,868
Got it out of Nitti's coat.

1439
01:47:03,938 --> 01:47:05,371
Where is Nitti?

1440
01:47:07,374 --> 01:47:08,807
He's in the car.

1441
01:47:28,262 --> 01:47:30,355
This constitutes no evidence.

1442
01:47:30,431 --> 01:47:31,420
It has no providence.

1443
01:47:31,498 --> 01:47:34,433
Your Honor, the truth of the case

1444
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:38,437
is that Capone is a killer and will go free.

1445
01:47:38,505 --> 01:47:41,440
The only way to deal with such men

1446
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:42,941
is hunt them down.

1447
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,443
I have forsworn myself.

1448
01:47:44,511 --> 01:47:47,947
I have broken every law I swore to defend.

1449
01:47:48,015 --> 01:47:49,812
I'm content I've done right.

1450
01:47:49,883 --> 01:47:52,716
That man must be stopped, and you must...

1451
01:47:52,786 --> 01:47:54,151
I'll be the judge

1452
01:47:54,221 --> 01:47:57,156
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

1453
01:48:05,799 --> 01:48:07,699
Would you excuse us?

1454
01:49:10,297 --> 01:49:11,321
Bailiff.

1455
01:49:11,398 --> 01:49:12,365
Yes, sir?

1456
01:49:17,204 --> 01:49:20,037
Bailiff, go next door to Judge Hoffman's court.

1457
01:49:20,107 --> 01:49:22,871
They've just begun hearing a divorce action.

1458
01:49:22,943 --> 01:49:25,571
I want you to bring that jury in here

1459
01:49:25,646 --> 01:49:28,706
and take this jury to his court.

1460
01:49:30,484 --> 01:49:32,645
Bailiff, are those instructions clear?

1461
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,153
Yes, sir.
They're clear.

1462
01:49:38,425 --> 01:49:42,088
Bailiff, I want you to switch the juries.

1463
01:49:42,162 --> 01:49:44,426
Your Honor, I object.

1464
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:46,723
Overruled.

1465
01:49:51,572 --> 01:49:53,540
What did you tell him?

1466
01:49:54,775 --> 01:49:58,802
I told him his name was in the ledger, too.

1467
01:49:58,879 --> 01:50:01,677
His name wasn't in the ledger.

1468
01:50:03,117 --> 01:50:06,280
Wait. What is this?
Is this the law?

1469
01:50:06,353 --> 01:50:07,547
You're out of order.

1470
01:50:07,621 --> 01:50:08,883
I think that we...

1471
01:50:08,956 --> 01:50:11,550
I don't care what you think.

1472
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,355
What do I look like?
Do something.

1473
01:50:14,428 --> 01:50:15,395
Order!

1474
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:18,086
Your Honor,

1475
01:50:18,165 --> 01:50:21,259
we'd like to withdraw our plea of not guilty

1476
01:50:21,335 --> 01:50:24,133
and enter a plea of guilty.

1477
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:29,002
Guilty?

1478
01:50:29,076 --> 01:50:30,805
Order in the court!

1479
01:50:30,878 --> 01:50:31,845
Order!

1480
01:50:33,547 --> 01:50:36,141
Guilty?

1481
01:50:36,216 --> 01:50:37,683
I'll give you guilty.

1482
01:50:41,221 --> 01:50:42,381
Bailiff!

1483
01:50:44,258 --> 01:50:46,351
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

1484
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:53,661
Your Honor. Your Honor, is that justice?

1485
01:50:53,734 --> 01:50:56,726
Why did he switch the jury?

1486
01:50:56,804 --> 01:50:59,364
Are you going to continue
going after the organization?

1487
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:00,929
Excuse me.

1488
01:51:01,008 --> 01:51:05,502
I'm asking Your Honor, is this justice?

1489
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:07,638
What about justice?

1490
01:51:09,516 --> 01:51:11,507
Is this justice?

1491
01:51:11,585 --> 01:51:13,485
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1492
01:51:15,022 --> 01:51:18,856
Never stop. Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

1493
01:51:18,926 --> 01:51:20,484
What did you say?

1494
01:51:20,561 --> 01:51:23,826
Never stop fighting till the fight is done.

1495
01:51:23,897 --> 01:51:24,829
What?

1496
01:51:24,898 --> 01:51:26,263
You heard me, Capone.

1497
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,858
You're nothing but talk and a badge.

1498
01:51:28,936 --> 01:51:30,460
Here endeth the lesson.

1499
01:51:30,537 --> 01:51:34,633
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!

1500
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:37,905
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!

1501
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:59,786
So much violence.

1502
01:54:05,392 --> 01:54:07,053
Cleaning up a little.

1503
01:54:17,371 --> 01:54:19,339
I guess it's goodbye.

1504
01:54:21,175 --> 01:54:22,938
Goodbye, George.

1505
01:54:25,512 --> 01:54:29,141
I want to, uh, thank you for this.

1506
01:54:29,216 --> 01:54:31,582
No. Thank you.

1507
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:48,900
Mr. Ness...

1508
01:54:48,969 --> 01:54:51,369
I think he wanted you to have that.

1509
01:54:51,438 --> 01:54:53,906
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

1510
01:54:58,712 --> 01:55:00,145
I'm going home.

1511
01:55:12,092 --> 01:55:14,390
Mr. Ness, any comment for the record?

1512
01:55:14,461 --> 01:55:17,396
The man who put Al Capone on the spot.

1513
01:55:17,464 --> 01:55:21,127
I happened to be there when the wheel went round.

1514
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:23,465
They say they're going to repeal prohibition.

1515
01:55:23,537 --> 01:55:25,971
What will you do then?

1516
01:55:27,307 --> 01:55:28,706
I think I'll have a drink.
