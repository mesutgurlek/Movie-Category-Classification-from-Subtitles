Yes, darling ?

167
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:44,081
Miss Bianca,
would you--

168
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,981
Would you--

169
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,349
Would you excuse me
for a minute ?

170
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,366
<Mademoiselle Bianca,>
<I have important news.>

171
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,807
Yes, Francois,
what is it ?

172
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:15,675
You and Bernard have
been asked to accept...

173
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,238
a dangerous mission
to Australia.

174
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:22,582
The poor boy.
This is dreadful.

175
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:25,418
Where is Bernard ?
I must tell him.

176
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,926
Allow me, madam.
I will tell him immediately.

177
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:48,979
Miss Bianca,
will you marry me ?

178
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,981
Monsieur Bernard--

179
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,574
Please marry me.
Not now, Francois !

180
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,744
No, no, no,
you don't under--

181
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,182
O, sacre bleu !

182
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:02,249
- Did you talk to Francois ?
- Yes, but--

183
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,887
I know exactly what
you're going to say.

184
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,159
- Francois told me.
- How did he know ?

185
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:11,668
It doesn't matter.
I think it's a marvelous idea.

186
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:15,672
You do ? I mean,
you really want to ?

187
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,506
It's not a matter of wanting,
it's a matter of duty.

188
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:23,069
Duty ? I never
thought of it--

189
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:26,708
Well, all right.
How does next April sound ?

190
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:30,515
Heavens no !
We must act tonight !

191
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,489
Tonight ? B-But, wait !

192
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:35,958
Bianca, this is so sudden.

193
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,463
Don't you at least need
a gown or something ?

194
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,522
Just a pair of khaki shorts
and some hiking boots.

195
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,124
Hiking boots ?

196
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,727
Ah, there you are !

197
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:49,466
Come along,
come along.

198
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,146
Delegates, we have an
important announcement.

199
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,648
Bernard and I
have decided...

200
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,276
to accept the mission
to Australia.

201
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,650
- Australia ?
- Good show !

202
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,121
You must fly out
immediately.

203
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,250
<It's a bit nippy outside,>
<but that won't stop us, will it ?>

204
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,705
<Miss Bianca,>
<I'm not sure...>

205
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,768
it's a good idea to fly
this soon after eating !

206
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,439
<Darling,you'll be>
<just fiine.>

207
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,541
But aren't you supposed
to wait 45 minutes ?

208
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:36,587
Oh,just knock
on the door...

209
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:39,452
<and see if>
<Orville is there.>

210
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,927
Nobody's home.
Let's go.

211
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,429
Bernard,

212
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:49,830
this is no time
to play in the snow.

213
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,836
<I wasn't playing.>
<It was an avalanche.>

214
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:54,428

Pick it, boy,
pick it !

226
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,376
Yeah !

Whoo, here we go !
Let's walk !

He can't hear us.

That's better.

00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:00,297
Excuse us for interrupting.

We're from

I am Miss Bianca.

<The> Miss Bianca ?
I don't believe it.

239
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:10,005
My brother Orville
told me all about you.

240

Oh, boy,
this is an honor !

241
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:16,446
May I just say
"enchanté senorita" to you ?

242
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,113
Ahem !

243
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:22,387
- We need a flight.
- You've come to the right place.

It's a play on--
Never mind.

247
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,900
I've got tons of exotic
destinations, faraway places...

248

Speaking of which,
what can I get you ?

251
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,519
How about a nice
mango Maui cooler ?

252
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:50,486
No, thank you.

253
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:54,082
A coconut guava nectar ?
It's carbonated, very nice.

254
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:57,286
I've got little umbrellas
for each one of them.

255

We must leave
immediately !

We need a flight
to Australia !

00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:08,543
The land down under ?
That's a fabulous idea !

259
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:11,146
So when can I
pencil you in ?

260
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:15,217
After spring thaw ?
Mid-June would be very nice.

261
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,319
<We must leave tonight!>

262
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:19,330
Tonight ?

263
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,889
<You're kidding me, right ?>

264
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:25,301
Have you looked outside ?
It's suicide out there !

265
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:29,865
Oh, no, your jolly little
holiday will have to wait.

266
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:32,001
What a bunch
of jokers !

267
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:35,980
But you don't understand. A boy
needs our help. He's in trouble !

268
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:39,779
Boy ? You mean,
little kid kind of boy ?

269
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:44,152
- He was kidnapped !
- Oh, that's awful.

270
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:47,351
Locking up a little kid.
Kids should be free,

271
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:50,486
free to run wild through
the house on Saturday mornings,

272
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:53,532
<free to have>
<cookies and milk...>

273
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,999
and get those little
white moustaches.

274
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:59,595
Nobody's gonna take a kid's
freedom away while I'm around !

275
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:02,004
Does that mean
you'll take us ?

276
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:04,201
Storm or no storm,

277
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:07,212

280
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:16,921
Thank you.

281
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:20,720
Loosen up, get the blood
flowing up to the head.

282
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:22,954
And a couple of these.

283
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:24,621
Ow !

00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:27,461
Okay, one's enough.
There we go.

285
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:31,060
That feels better !
Oh, baby !

286
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,537
Tie your kangaroos down,

Let's go for it !
Whoa, hey !

289
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:41,537
I didn't adjust
for the wind.

290
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,242
I just had to duck
down a little lower,

291
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:46,649
go under the wind.
Here we go !

292
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,744
Whoa, hoo-hoo !

293

Oh, this is cold !

Hey. Slippery. Ice !

295
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,585
We got ice !
We got ice !

296
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,959
<Whoa, hang on now!>

297
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,021
Ow, hoo-hoo !

Captain, is this a nonstop
flight to Australia ?

303
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:21,211
Not exactly, no.
I could definitely say no.

304
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,415
We're gonna make connections
with a bigger bird.

305
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,151
Nonstop ?

306
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:28,659
What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh ?

307
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,533
Let me out of here !
You can't do this !

308
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:45,804
<Help, help, help!>

309
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:48,108
Breaker, breaker,

We're not married.

We're here on a

That's right !
How did you know ?

452
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:20,120
You'll find it's tough to
keep secrets in the outback.

453
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,958
So, which way
you taking ?

454
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:25,556
Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon
or Satan's Ridge ?

455

Suicide trail ?

456
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:30,869
Good choice. More snakes
but less quicksand.

Once you cross Bloodworm Creek,
you're scot-free.

That is, until
Dead Dingo Pass.

in the outback.

What you need is...

463
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,818
someone who knows
the territory.

464
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,324
Oh, Mr.Jake,
will you guide us ?

Yeah, it's just a little
b-b-bumpy back here.

00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:30,320
Cinch up your seat belts, mate.
We're coming in for a landing.

let's see if we can refresh
that rusty old memory of yours.

Don't you realize a bird
that size is worth a fortune ?

You can't get a better offer than that.
