Look, let's just get
something straight here-

499
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,652
The reason he got locked in
the slam in the first place

500
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,731
was for sticking up a gas
station to cover you guys.

in Coal City.

That's right.

So I don't want to hear anymore
of this small-change shit.

any finer

than they did

511
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,972

Minnie the Moocher

She was a low-down

She was the roughest
toughest frail

with a bloke named Smokey

She loved him
though he was cokey

1479
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,840
He took her down
to Chinatown

He gave her things
that she was needin'

1488
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:54,987
He gave her a home
built of gold and steel
