Hello?

318
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,543
Yeah.

319
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,344
Well, can't be.

320
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,813
I know for a fact that card expires 2015.

321
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,483
JACK: Well, it's not my fault
it didn't clear.

322
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,651
Wait. Ho...

323
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,588
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What did you just say?

324
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,291
Well, what did he look like?

325
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,929
Is that Wendy?
No.

326
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,297
I was at a motel last couple nights.

327
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,334
Manager just called and says
I charged a bunch of stuff,

328
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,103
but I didn't charge...
That stuff.

329
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,605
So I didn't pay for it.

330
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,607
But... I was in there.
I was thinking...

331
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,375
I've rode all that shit at cedar point.

332
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,045
What we should do
is go hit six flags Texas.

333
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:45,682
You know, I'm not a kid anymore, okay?

334
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,352
Tell me the truth.
Are you in trouble?

335
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,221
All right.

336
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,024
I was at a bar back in Williston

337
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,627
with a buddy of mine and his sister.

338
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,527
She heads into the can.

339
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,764
And a few minutes later, we
start hearing this screaming.

340
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,999
So I charge in there.

341
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,634
And I see her about to get raped.

342
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,502
I had this pool cue in my hand,

343
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,070
and I... I just went off.

344
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,339
I put the dude in the hospital.

345
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,975
And I just got out of dodge.

346
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,610
That was my buddy calling,

347
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:18,181
saying the dude's out of his coma.
He's gunning for me.

348
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,951
That's the truth.

349
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,756
Think maybe you should go home.

350
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,191
I bet you can handle him.

351
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,128
Either way, I think you should go.

352
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,101
Where?

353
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,279
Hold on tight.

355
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,522
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

356
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,791

Help! Guard!

360
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,434
PENNY: We need medical help!

361
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,935
She's hurt.

362
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,837
AVA: Oh!

363
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:30,587
Any news?

364
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,888
They were here.
Now they're gone.

365
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,459
Got a general heading based on
Kendal's cell pinging the towers,

366
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,361
but not much more since we spoke.

367
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,829
What about this Michael person?

368
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,630
I can't pin him down based on your story.

369
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,900
Could be an old friend, could
be Jack's banging his wife.

370
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,802
I don't know.
He seemed to mean business.

371
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,637
You shot his car full of buckshot.

372
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,139
You think I provoked him?

373
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,874
Well, I don't know, do I?

374
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,776
Oh, see, this is that attitude
you have had

375
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,045
right from the very beginning,
this antagonism.

376
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,381
I approached you, attempted to bargain.

377
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,916
After considerable unpleasantness.

378
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,985
Anyway, I'm here now...

379
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,254
- To help.
- You've got your reasons.

380
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,024
You are obsessed
with my family, after all.

381
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,058
Oh, no.

382
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,426
I think of them like cancer,

383
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,762
and I'm just a doctor working on a cure.

384
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,097
I am deeply offended by that.

385
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,499
You ain't offended.

386
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,534
You're conflicted about helping me.

387
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,936
All I want is to
get Kendal back home safely.

388
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,973
And yet, you were the one who took him

389
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,208
out of a good, Christian foster home,

390
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,777
threw him back to those wolves.

391
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,979
Time is wasting.
Can we go?

392
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,315
All right, come here.

393
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,651
Can you squeeze
your fingers down in there?

394
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,154
These things are a jiff to get started.

395
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,789
We're stealing a car now?

396
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,924
That wasn't clear?

397
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,192
How much trouble are you in?

398
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,861
Well, he's a very angry man,
and he knows my car.

399
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,029
You're lying.
No. I'm not.

400
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,833
Yes, you are. You lie about
everything, and you always have.

401
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,601
Name one lie.

402

You're my dad and Wendy's my mom.

A long time.

405
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,944
- Wendy told you.
- No, I figured it out, okay?

406
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,446
Now cut the shit.
What did you really do?

407
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,049
'Cause I don't think you're
some hero that stopped a rape.

409
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,120
I followed the workers, the money...

410
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,322

I was running poker games.

411
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,860
And I had an idea that I was gonna
buy in to this fracking operation.

Come on.

415
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,902
I was gonna buy into this
fracking operation in Mexico.

416
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,904
So I started skimming
from my regular game...

417
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,140
Heavy-duty
player in particular.

418
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,309
It was a good hustle...
Till the guy found out.

419
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,277
It's mostly his money in the bag.

420
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,847
How much?
About $35,000.

421
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,280
Whoa.

422
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,449
Trouble is,
he wants it back... Bad.

423
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,818

tell me that from the start?
