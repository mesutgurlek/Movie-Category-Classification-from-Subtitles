I'm on my computer all day.

668
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,442
I haven't had what
you'd call much
of a formal education,

669
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,744
but you can find
most anything if you
look hard enough.

670
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:52,689
Last year, I took
an online business course,
for example.

671
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,559
And I learned that
you have to have
a business plan

672
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,627
before starting a business.

673
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,963
And that why you
pursue something

674
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,865
is equally as important
as what you pursue.

675
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,436
The site advised you

676
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,904
to answer the following question

677
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,140
before you decide
where to focus
your abilities.

678
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,741
The question was

679
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,443
"What do I love to do?"

680
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,580
The site suggested making a list

681
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,981
of your strengths
and weaknesses.

682

683
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,585
What am I not good at?

684
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,487
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

685
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,788
about the things
I'm already good at.

00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,081
Cabanita has been called

782
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,203
"an authentic
taste of Mexico City."

783
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,786
Do you wanna go with me?

784
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,148
I think we could
have fun together.

785
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,091
Thanks, but I'm busy.

786
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,092
Saturday is your
night off, isn't it?

787
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,060
I have a rule, Lou.

788
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,262
I don't date people I work with.

789
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,064
And I'm twice your age.

790
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,306
I like older women.

791
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,568
Besides,
I don't work with you.

792
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,669
You're someone I sell to.

793
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:02,271
And I don't wanna fuck that up.

794
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,308
What if by saying no,
you fuck it up?

795
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,809
MAN: All right, 10 seconds
to go and back on.

796
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,177
Is that what you're saying?

797
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,614
I didn't say that.
(LAUGHING)

798
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:15,184
MAN: Eight, seven,
six, five...

799
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,919
Well, I don't know what to say.

800
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,955
MAN: ...three, two, one.

801
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,990
LISA: Good morning.
Thank you for joining us.
I'm Lisa Mays.

802
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,358
BEN: And I'm Ben Waterman.

803
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,494
First up on <i> This Morning</i>
on KWLA News,

804
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,963
a horrible car crash
over in Benedict Canyon.

805
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,132
It's claimed the life
now of one man.

806
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,600
Severely injured a young woman.

807
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,771
JOE: Hey, Lou!

808
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,675
Hey, man.
Joe Loder, Mayhem.

809
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,643
Great get tonight.

810
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:43,146
They were closing it down
by the time we showed up.

811
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,314
Were you waiting
for me out here?

812
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,650
No, I was driving by
and I saw your car.

813
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,553
You're not dropping
your shit off, are you?
Nobody does that.

814
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,989
You need an air card
if you want to be
in the game.

815
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,824
Import the video to your laptop.

816
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,958
Cut the video.

817
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,627
Upload to your FTP site

818
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,962
and notify stations
you got something for sale.

819
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,531
Boom, boom, boom!

820
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,653
Otherwise,
it's a nice ride.

821
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,569
Listen, man,
you got a good run going

822
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,304
but there's valleys out there.

823
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,973
Take it from me.
I've been nightcrawling
for 14 years.

824
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,542
You heard I'm
adding a second van?

825
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,876
No. I didn't hear that.

826
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,312
Gonna be a game changer.

827
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,347
Cut my on-scene time
in half.

828
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,916
I'm setting up
a dedicated dispatch, too.

829
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,719
No more listening
and driving.
That's for suckers.

830
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,520
You like the Canon 305s?

831
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,888
Never used one.

832
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,323
Six thou a piece.

833
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:32,095
2.4 megapixels.
Night vision.
18:1 zoom.

834
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,497
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

835
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:35,998
I have a camera.

836
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,767
I want you
running my second van.

837
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,203
Two crews.
Half the area to cover.

838
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,571
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

839
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,039
Half the money, right?

840
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,108
You should be thinking,
twice the sales.

841
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,442
Because we're
going to be the first

842
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,744
at every scene.

843
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,012
Why compete when we
can work together?

844
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,581
You can share my press cards.

845
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,016
Puppy dog off my
police connections.

846
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,586
This is the big move,
the next level.

847
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,221
We can corner this whole thing.

848
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,389
I'm talking about
putting some heavy digits
in our pocket, brah.

849
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,024
Thank you for
offering me the position

850
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,293
but working for
myself is more in line

851
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:05,695
with my skills and career goals.

852
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,699
Take a few days
to think about it.

853
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,933
No.

854
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,268
You'll need to
hire someone else,

855
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,436
and I don't want to
hold up the process.

856
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,471
You want to be on
the inside of this, man

857
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,307
because I'm going
to be tag-teaming
every call.

858
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,477
You keep talking
like it's something

859
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,746
that I may be
interested in,
but I'm not.

860
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,948
You don't even
understand the offer.

861
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,317
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

862
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,786
You'd be asking me questions.

863
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,888
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

864
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,391
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

865
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,794
and screaming in your face,

866
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,716
"I'm not
fucking interested."

867
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,920
Instead,
I'm going to drive home
and do some accounting.

868
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,206
Fuck you!

869
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:52,041
Twerp.

870
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,043

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

872
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,024
(SIGHS) I didn't
wake up until 5:00.

873
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,927
My body is so off,
I feel like it's
time for breakfast.

874
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,262
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

875
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,034
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

876
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,970
In fact, I'd say

877
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,772
you're much prettier
than Lisa Mays.

878
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:23,873
(LAUGHS)

879
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,210
I like the dark
makeup on your eyes.

880
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,332
I also like the way you smell.

881
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,683
So, where you from, Lou?

882
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,074
The north end of the Valley.

883
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,990
Some of the calls sometimes
take me over there,

884
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,726
but nobody I know
still lives out there.

885
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,795
You're from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

886
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,997
How did you know that?

887
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:49,199
It's online.

888
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,868
Everything about you is online.

889
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,303
Not everything,
but definitely a lot.

890
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,239
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

891
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,473
I'm sure you look
at those, of course.

892
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,175
No. God, no.

893
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,457
Not without a drink in my hand.

894
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,213
I watch my work all the time.

895
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,848
Yeah? Do you want
to become a reporter?

896
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,970
No.

897
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,819
Most of you guys want air time.

898
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,587
Not me.

899
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,024
I want to be the guy
that owns the station
that owns the camera.

900
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,593
The business is going well,

901
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,495
but in order to
grow to the next level,

902
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:20,863
I need to stay
one step ahead
of my competition

903
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,265
and take risks.

904
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,427
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

905
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,617
Would you like
another margarita?

906
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,473
One is enough.

907
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,529
Thanks for coming out to talk.

908
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,778
The place I'm in now

909
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,214
is that I want a relationship

910
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,549
with someone I can team up with

911
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,519
and share, like we share,
the same job
and hours and whatnot.

912
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,254
I could go down
a laundry list,
but you get the idea.

913
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,889
Yes.

914
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,691
Well, I hope you find someone.

915
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,296
Here's the thing
about that, Nina.

916
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,378
I'm quite certain
I already have.

917
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,035
Okay.

918
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:02,371
Let me put this politely.

919
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,540
I only came out to
dinner with you, Lou,

920
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,809
purely as
a professional courtesy.

921
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,513
Thank you.

922
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,150
I don't think it's any secret

923
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,618
that I've
single-handedly raised

924
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,820
the unit price of
your ratings book.

925
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:22,792
Our ratings book price?
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

926
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,162
I'm a very fast learner.

927
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,164
We had a conversation
where I specifically
mentioned that.

928
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,366
Do you remember that?

929
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:31,734
Well, do you?

930
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,336
Yes.

931
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,504
I recently learned,
for instance,

932
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,666
that most Americans
watch local news
to stay informed.

933
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,144
I also learned that

934
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,679
the average half-hour
of Los Angeles
television news

935
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,082
packs all of its
local government coverage

936
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,284
including law enforcement,
budget, transportation,

937
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,986
education and immigration

938
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,954
into 22 seconds.

however, not only
usually led the news

940
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,425
but filled 14
times the broadcast,

941
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,994
averaging five minutes
and seven seconds.

942
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:01,263
KWLA relies heavily
on such stories.

943
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:02,999
With Los Angeles
crime rates going down,

944
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,135
I think that
makes items like mine
particularly valuable.

945
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,770
Like rare animals. (LAUGHS)

946
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,873
I can only imagine that
your needs will increase

947
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,195
during next month's
rating sweeps period.

948
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:16,045
Ooh!

949
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,713
(BOTH LAUGH)

950
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,282
Yeah.

951
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,718
Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

952
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,761
There's certain good things
about being alone.

953
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,866
You have time to do
the things you wanna do,

954
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,501
like study and plan,

955
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:39,535
but you can't have
dinners like this

956
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,970
or be physical with a person.

957
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:43,132
I mean, outside
of flirtation-ship.

958
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,376
Where are you going with this?

959
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,880
I want that.

960
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,717
With you.

961
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,768
Like you want to
keep your job and
your health insurance.

962
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,227
Look, just for starters,

963
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,931
I don't need you to
keep my fucking job.

964
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,767
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

965
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,137
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

966
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:22,745
We have what could be
considered an
almost-exclusive relationship.

967
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,848
There are many
other places I could go.

968
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,684
I have to think
that you're invested
in this transaction.

969
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:29,752
WAITER: Here you are.

970
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,853
Wow.

971

WAITER: Enjoy.
Thank you.

972
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:40,396
Where did you get

something like this?

973
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,864
We're still talking.

974
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,100
No. There's nothing
more to say.

975
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,434
You can leave.

976
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,909
Okay, look.

977
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,812
You've done well. Okay?

978
00:51:56,814 --> 00:52:00,316
And we pay you well,
very well.
We always have.

979
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,920
If you like,
I could get you
an exclusive retainer.

980
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,156
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

981
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,592
I could maybe even get
you a job at the station

982
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,227
starting as
a production assistant.

983
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,095
So that you could
learn the business
from the inside.

984
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,777
That's where you
said your interests lie.

985
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,232
Mmm-hmm.

986
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,928
You're not listening,
Nina.

987
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,004
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

988
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,939
for longer than
two years at a time,

989
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,181
and you're coming
up on two years soon.

990
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,179
I can imagine

991
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,514
that your contract is
for that length of time.

992
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:32,815
And that next month's ratings

993
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,350
directly affect that.

994
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,286
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

995
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,654
I'm negotiating.

996
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,322
You're threatening
to stop selling to me.

997
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,525
That's your choice.

998
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,093
The true price of any item

999
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:45,695
is what somebody's
willing to pay for it.

1000
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,630
You want something.

1001
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,331
And I want you.

1002
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,699
To fuck you.

1003
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,369
And as a friend.

1004
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,105
Jesus Christ, friends
don't pressure friends

1005
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:57,227
to fucking sleep with them.

1006
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,736
Actually,
that's not true, Nina.

1007
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,282
Because as I'm sure you know,

1008
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:10,019
a friend is a gift
you give yourself.

1011
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,823
You're putting me on the 5?

1012
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:50,259
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

1013
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,895
Did you read my
traffic memo yesterday?

1014
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,897
Did I read it?

1015
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,398
Yeah, I read it.

1016
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,434
What did it say?

1017
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,236
About the 5?

1018
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,037
Okay. I looked at it.
What?

1019
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,405
Well, for one thing,
it included that

1020
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,740
the 5 has floating construction

1021
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,941
in the fast lane for
the next three weeks.

1022
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,876
So, given that,
I expect you to put me

1023
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,945
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

1024
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:12,081
That's half of one,
six of the other.

1025
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,616
It's half dozen of one,
six of the other.

1026
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,783
What I'd like you
to do is admit that

1027
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,418
you didn't read
what you said you did.

1028

but nobody likes to be lied to!

Okay! When am I
going to get my raise?

1031

Rick, trying to
leverage your salary

1039
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,405
in this economic environment
is near impossible.

1040
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,240
Most firms have
set starting wages.

1041
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,409
Ideally, you could
leverage with other offers,

1042
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,610
but that's just not the case

01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,181
How much of this can we show?

1249
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,010
You mean, legally?

1250
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,346
No, morally.
Of course, legally.

1251
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,580
Have they been identified?

1252
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,282
It just happened,
so you have to assume no,

1253
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:15,917
and that's just
one of the issues.

1254
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,418
We can't broadcast
their identities

1255
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,853
without notifying
the next of kin.

1256
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,255
We're not identifying them.

1257
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,157
You are by proxy,
by showing their faces.

1258
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,025
We pixelate the faces.

1259
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,093
Where did you get this?

1260
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:26,427
Stringer.

1261
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:27,996
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

1262
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,465
Um, Jesus. Is there
a dead baby
inside of there?

1263
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:32,000
No. The crib was empty.

1264
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,101
NINA: Oh,
for Christ's sake.

1265
01:09:33,103 --> 01:09:35,303
Are we breaking the law
by showing this?

1266
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,041
Block the faces,
don't give out
the exact address.

1267
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:43,511
Do that, I guess.
(STAMMERS) I don't know.

1268
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,313
I wouldn't think so, no.

1269
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:46,447
Journalistically and ethically?

1270
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:47,515
This isn't Hartford.

1271
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,617
We are beyond
all broadcast standards.

1272
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,619
Have you seen the overnights?

1273
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,454
I'll risk the fine.

1274
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:54,822
What did you pay for this?

1275
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:56,858
The price hasn't been
negotiated yet.

1276
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,993
(SIGHS)
Give us a minute.

1277
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,094
Thanks.

1278
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:07,535
How much?
$100,000.

1279
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,238
(CHUCKLES) How much?
$50,000.

1280
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,307
I need a number.
Nine minutes.
I need a number.

1281
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,675
I just gave you two.

1282
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,076
$3,000.

1283
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:16,711
I got $3,000
for the food truck
stabbings.

1284
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,346
There were more dead.

1285
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,215
Those were poor
Mexican people
in a roach coach.

1286
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,549
Two of them were illegals.

1287
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,917
These are three
wealthy white people,

1288
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,519
shot and killed
in their mansion.

1289
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:27,222
Including
a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed.

1290
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,856
I know you, Nina.

1291
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,258
I know your interest
and excitement
in this product

1292
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,500
is greater
than the amount
you're offering.

$15,000.

1299
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:48,843
Give me a serious number.

1300
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,411
$15,000.

1301
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,913
Can't do it. Never happen.
There's a matter
of precedent.

1302
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:53,548
Ten is my last best offer.

1303
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,649
Okay.

1304
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,118
Really?

1305
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,287
Where are you going?

1306
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:01,856
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

1307
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,524
The ND there gave me his number.

1308
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,426
They'll make me
a better offer.
It's a five-minute drive.

1309
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,961
Hold on!

1310
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,100
(SIGHS)

1311
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,436
Twelve.

1312
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,871
Fifteen.

1313
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,707
I can't spend
a month's budget
on a single story.

1314
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,789
What if the story's not over?

1315
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,878
The people who did this escaped.

1316
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,448
They're still out there,
walking around
with the rest of us.

1317
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,385
If I had a family
and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

1318
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,587
I'd want updates
on what was going on.

1319
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:35,669
With this footage,
people would turn to
your channel for the story.

1320
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:37,959
I like you, Nina.

1321
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,727
And I look forward
to our time together.

1322
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,329
But you have to understand.

1323
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:44,265
$15,000 isn't all that I want.

1324
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,301
From here on,
starting now,

1325
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,903
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

1326
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,405
The name of my company is

1327
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:53,508
Video Production News,
a professional
news-gathering service.

1328
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,609
That's how it should be read

1329
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:56,511
and that's how
it should be said.

1330
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,681
I also want to go
to the next rung,
and meet your team.

1331
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:01,816
And the station manager
and the director
and the anchors.

1332
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,951
And start developing
my own
personal relationships.

1333
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,653
I'd like to start
meeting them
this morning.

1334
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,655
You'll take me around,
you'll introduce me
as the owner and President

1335
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,190
of Video Production News

1336
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:12,160
and remind them
of some of my many
other stories.

1337
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,428
I'm not done.

1338
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,863
I also want to
stop our discussion
over prices.

1339
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:16,998
This will save time.

1340
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,299
When I say that
a particular number

1341
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:20,001
is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

1342
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,202
And you can be
assured that I arrived

1343
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:23,371
at whatever
that number is
very carefully.

1344
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:27,942
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

1345
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,044
I mean that I want them.

1346
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,946
And I don't want to
have to ask again.

1347
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,614
And the last thing
that I want, Nina,

1348
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:35,350
is for you to do the things
that I ask you to do

1349
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,718
when we're alone together
in your apartment.

1350
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,086
Not like the last time!

1351
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,358
So...

1352
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,626
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1353
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,295
I'll tell you what.
(SNIFFLES)

1354
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,365
I have the van crash
on Moorpark tonight.

1355
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,200
It was a couple of
stringers, actually.

1356
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:54,162
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

1357
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,058
I'd be willing to
throw that in for free.

1358
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,856
So what do you say,
do we have a deal?

1359

Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

1360
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:10,084
Hi.
Hello. How are you, Lisa?

1361
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:12,687
You remember Lou from
the Benedict Canyon crash.

1362
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,088
BEN: Oh, yeah.
Amazing stuff.

1363
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,357
That was my company,
Video Production News.

1364
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:17,859
I would just like to say

1365
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:21,362
that I think that
what the two of you do
is incredibly valuable.

1366
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:22,897
Thank you.
That's nice of you
to say.

1367
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,665
We appreciate it.

01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes, I'm Lou.

1540
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,236
You live here?
Yes, that's right.

1541
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,704
May we come inside?

1542
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:37,972
Why?
FRONTIERI: Why not?

1543
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,207
You want to?
Yes.

1544
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,375
I don't care.
(CHUCKLES)

1545
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,543
Wonderful.

1546
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,650
You were in
Granada Hills last night.

1547
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:51,218
LOU: Yes, that's right.

1548
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,820
You shot the video in the house?

1549
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:55,122
Yes, ma'am, I did.
That's right.

1550
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,526
You went inside the house?
You filmed
all through the house?

1551
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:00,635
You even filmed the bodies.

1552
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,730
All before the police came.

1553
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:03,731
That door was open, ma'am.

1554
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,132
Detective.

1555
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,068
The door was open
and what I did was

1556
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,470
I went in to see
if I could help,

1557
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,938
because the alarm was ringing.

1558
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,473
An active crime scene.

1559
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,915
I didn't know
it was a crime scene.

1560
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,911
LIEBERMAN:
You knew what it was.

1561
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:19,013
LOU: I know that
an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

1562
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,816
And you sold it
to be shown on TV.

1563
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,851
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

1564
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:26,020
LIEBERMAN:
What did you see
when you arrived?

1565
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,355
Uh, two men
leaving in a vehicle.

1566
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,124
You saw two men?

1567
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,827
(STUTTERS) They were
just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

1568
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,428
And then I saw
the shapes of two men

1569
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,630
moving inside the vehicle,
if that helps.

1570
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,932
Describe the men.

1571
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,200
LOU: It was dark.

1572
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,001
And then they drove away.

1573
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,870
Black? White? Tall?
LOU: I couldn't see.

1574
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,004
LIEBERMAN:
What were they driving?

1575
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,272
An SUV.

1576
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,441
Dark-colored.

1577
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,276
Rims? Tinted windows?

1578
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,846
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1579
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:54,448
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

1580
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,617
No, I don't. I only
started filming
when I was inside.

1581
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,485
FRONTIERI: Mmm-hmm.

1582
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,654
I'd like a copy of that footage.

1583
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,823
Do I have to
give it to you?
(CHUCKLES)

1584
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,159
Is there any reason
why you wouldn't?

1585
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,995
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

1595
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,870
I'm tired.
Aren't you tired?

Why are we
starting so early?
(SEAT BELT CLICKS)

1597
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,609
One of the people
in the house
last night was alive.

1598
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:32,646
I cut that part out.

1599
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,415
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

1600
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,650
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

1601
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:41,522
We're gonna find the person
that drove that car.

1602
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,056
So you know
who killed those people?

1603
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,625
One of them,
quite possibly, yes.

1604
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:47,962
You gotta call the cops.

1605
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,396
And we will,
at the right time.

1606
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,642
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

1607
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:03,711
To do what?

1608
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,249
I don't usually share
my business plan with you.

1609

(CHUCKLES)

1610
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,655
But a moment has arrived
that could allow the company

1611
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,424
to make enough money
to expand to the next level.

1612
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:20,661
We could call this

1613
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,934
the critical moment.

1614
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:28,869
I'm inviting you, Rick,
to be a part of the team

that pounces
on this opportunity.

1616

You've been asking
a lot about
your performance review.

Yeah.

Well.

1619

For starters,

1620
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:40,714
I've been seeing
a great improvement

1621
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:43,076
in your overall focus
and order-following.

1622
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,487
Given complex problems,
you're developing
a real ability

01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:48,722
to find clear
and simple solutions.

1624

I'm also aware of
your increased enthusiasm.

your eyes light up

on a new idea.

I'm trying. You know?

1630
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:06,306

We're gonna wait.
For what?

1663

First, we want to see
if he's actually inside.

And then, we want to find
a more interesting place

to start some shit
so you can film it?

at the Granada Hills house.

2012

Cocaine in wrapped packages

Over 50 pounds.

with an investigator
at the scene.

I was watering my plant.

01:49:20,187 --> 01:49:22,755
I looked out my window
at my apartment.

01:49:22,757 --> 01:49:26,025
The one you visited.

2043
01:49:26,027 --> 01:49:29,228
I saw a dark-colored vehicle
with two men inside
parked across the street.

2044
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,329
I didn't think anything of it,

2045
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:31,971
otherwise I would have
reported it then.

2046

We began our night,

2047
01:49:38,172 --> 01:49:41,006
my employee and myself.

2048
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:44,009
And around
approximately 12:38,

2049
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:45,945
I looked in my rearview mirror

2050
01:49:45,947 --> 01:49:48,013
and I saw what looked
like the same men

2051
01:49:48,015 --> 01:49:50,182
in the same vehicle
following us.

2052
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:51,684
I made an evasive maneuver.

2053
01:49:51,686 --> 01:49:54,687
I circled back
and tailed them
to the restaurant.

2054
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:56,355
At which point,
I saw them go inside

2055
01:49:56,357 --> 01:49:59,124
and recognized them
as the same men
from the home invasion.

2056
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:02,227
You told me
you didn't see the men.

2057
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:04,096
That you didn't get
a good look at them.

2058
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:07,066
Well, it all came back to me
when I saw them going in.

2059
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:10,536
Their shapes
and their movements.

2060
01:50:10,538 --> 01:50:13,072
And then I saw
that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt,

2061
01:50:13,074 --> 01:50:16,241
so I immediately
got my phone
and dialed 911.

2062
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:17,876
That's your story?

2063
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,045
That's what happened.
That's why
I'm sitting here with you.

2064
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,481
I think that
the men saw my footage

2065
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:25,985
and they tracked me down.

2066
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:28,268
You want to know
what I think?

2067
01:50:28,823 --> 01:50:31,323
Yes, please.

2068
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:34,560
I think you withheld
information.

2069
01:50:34,562 --> 01:50:37,496
I think you saw the two men
in the murder house
in Granada Hills

2070
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:41,734
and you saw the car
and you sat on it

2071
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:44,103
to get something you could film.

2072
01:50:44,105 --> 01:50:46,265
What do you think about that?

2073
01:50:47,908 --> 01:50:50,109
I think that would be

2074
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:52,911
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

2075
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:55,180
It would be murder.

2076

I can understand why
you're looking into it,

2077
01:50:56,584 --> 01:50:58,117
but I didn't do
anything like that.

2078
01:50:58,119 --> 01:50:59,585
Nothing that could
be considered wrong.

you said is a lie.

to back up what happened.
