152
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,523
All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

153
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,451
who barely had
enough gas money...

154
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,610
to come and pick up
his own fuckin` check.

155
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,571
And of course it was
the bosses` man...

156
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,491
Andy Stone,
who gave all the orders.

157
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,889
Not the chairman
of the fuckin` board, Philip Green.

158
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,004
I understand.
I understand.

159
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,131
Now all they needed was...

160
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,130
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

161
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:28,411
And who better than Ace? I mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

162
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,405
and he had
the fuckin` place clocked.

163
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,962
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin` a casino...

164
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:35,369
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

165
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,644
I don`t know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

166
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:39,366
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

167
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:41,809
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

168
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:45,369
You don`t have to have a license
to work in a casino.

169
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,450
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

170
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,729
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

171
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,770
while they`re processing
your application.

172
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,685
They got a ten-year backlog.

173
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,605
What happens when
they do find out?

174
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,571
Why would they
want to find out?

175
00:10:57,654 --> 00:11:00,452
We`re puttin` a hundred million
into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?

176
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,243
They`ll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

177
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:08,651
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

178
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,806
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

179
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:14,931
I know guys been workin` there
for 30 years, don`t have a license.

180
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,209
It`s a tough proposition, Andy.

181
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:21,125
You know if I did it,
I`d have to run it my way.

182
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,886
You got it.

183
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:25,368
I`m serious, no interference.

184
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,644
Nobody`s gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

185
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,929
I guarantee it.

186
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,324
[ Nicky ] And that`s how
they got Ace to take over.

187
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:39,010
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

188
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,923
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

189
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,807
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

190
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:50,164
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

191
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:53,445
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

192
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,923
But he didn`t bet
like you or me.

193
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:58,608
You know, havin` some fun
with it, shit like that.

194
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,645
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

195
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,373
He bet like a fuckin`
brain surgeon.

196
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:05,524
Place the checks properly.

197
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,405
- That`s the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,166
He had to know everything,
this guy.

199
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,284
He`d find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

200
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,973
and that`s what he`d put
his money on.

201
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,812
Even back home, years ago...

202
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,725
when we were first hangin` out...

203
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:21,282
he`d know if the quarterback
was on coke...

204
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,046
I`ll take Columbia for 20.

205
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:25,130
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

206
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:28,411
He`d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

207
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,251
He even figured out
the different bounce...

208
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,165
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

209
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:34,085
on college basketball courts,
you know?

210
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,005
He`d be workin`
on this shit day and night.

211
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,244
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn`t know.

212
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,643
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

213
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:43,294
Season after season...

214
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,888
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

215
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,805
But he was so serious
about it all...

216
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:50,124
that I don`t think
he ever enjoyed himself.

217
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,210
But that`s just the way he was.

218
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,893
But back then, the bosses
didn`t give a fuck...

219
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,930
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

220
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:59,812
To them, he was
a cash register.

221
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:02,454
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

222
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,166
Especially Remo...

223
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:06,523
who was a fuckin` degenerate
gambler who always lost...

224
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:08,445
Cazzo!
[ Mumbles in Italian ]

225
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,002
All those fuckin` sweeps.

226
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,892
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

227
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,885
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

228
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,926
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

229
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,329
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

230
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:25,009
I mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

231
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,205
crooked fuckin` zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

232
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,131
He told fuckin` Remo everything.

233
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:33,246
And to tell you the truth,
I don`t blame him.

234
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,325
- Hey!
- Keepin` Remo happy with money...

235
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,530
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

236
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,451
Son of a bitch!

237

How the hell did you get
Oklahoma-Michigan?

238
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,723
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi--
How the hell`d you do it?

239
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,651
Well, that`s why
they paid so well.

240
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:48,650
You see?
Never tells me nothin`.

241
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:50,804
What do we got on
for next week?

242
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:54,688
Well, it`s a little too early.
I`d say Thursday would be good.
ls that all right?

243
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:57,493
- Okay, you`ll come by the house?
- I`ll come by.

244
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:01,413
7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up? Okay, Ace?

245
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,645
Hey, Nick. Vien acca.

246
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,884
- I`ll be right out.
- T`aggia parla.

247
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:09,852
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

248
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,771
He`s makin`
a lot of money for us.

249
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,931
And he`s gonna continue makin` a lot of
money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

250
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,608
Not like your fuckin` friends
out there that-- without brains.

251
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,844
- Okay?
- All right.

252
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,765
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah. Want me to take this for you?

253
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:23,970
[ Nicky ] So now,
on top of everything else...

254
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:26,369
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around
with the golden Jew.

255
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,888
Chase, couple of shooters
for the ladies.

Yeah, we made a great pair.

257
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:35,684
I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

258
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,890
The old men loved us,
and why not?

259
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,890
- They all made money with us.
- They payin`?

260
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,169
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week,
like they`re supposed to.

261
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,569
- Don`t ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don`t see any money.

Who`s this guy?

264
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:53,452
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine. I laid nine.
- It was eight.

265
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,490
Ace, tell him the line
on the Bear game.

266
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,532
- Eight.
- lf he don`t know, nobody knows.

267
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,445
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?

268
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,445
`Cause you`re a jag-off.

- ls this yours? Your pen?
- Yeah, that`s my pen. Why?

271
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,725
No, it`s a nice pen.
I just didn`t know whose it was.

272
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,645
I thought it was yours.
I didn`t want it to get lost.

273
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,043
Well, thank you.
Why don`t you take that fuckin` pen...

274
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:16,602
and shove it up your ass,

You hear a little girl, Frankie?

00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:47,168
Hear a little girl, Ace?
ls that a little fuckin` girl?

281
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,085
What happened
to the fuckin` tough guy...

284
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,612
[ Ace ] While I was trying
to figure out why the guy was saying...

285
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:06,327
what he was saying,
Nicky just hit him.

286
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:09,684
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

287
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,009
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

288
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:15,404
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

289
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:17,883
And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

290
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,607
because he`ll keep coming
back and back...

291
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,009
until one of you is dead.

292

[ Nicky ] Listen,
with me protectin` Ace...

293
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:36,887
he made a fortune
for the bosses.

294
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:40,131
I mean, that`s
what got him to Vegas.

295
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:42,927
He was a money machine.

296
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:45,608
A tremendous earner
for these guys.

297
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:48,492
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin` drop.

298
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,242
With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:55,127
And the bosses,
they couldn`t be happier.

00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,085
÷ I got $700 ÷

301
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:59,011
÷ Don`t you mess with me ÷

302
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:01,932
÷ But you know I`m down ÷

303
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,611
÷ Everybody knows I`m down ÷÷

304
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:15,132
[ Ace ] In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

305
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,085
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

306
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:21,292
I mean, without us, these guys,
they`d still be shoveling mule shit.

307
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,205
Ward, you`ve got to keep
a cleaner space.

308
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:25,330
lf you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

309
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,245
Won`t happen again, Sam.

310
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:30,724
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won`t
happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

311
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,726
ls this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What`s the story?

312
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:36,129
- You need this guy.
- Can`t get rid of him?

313
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:38,608
He`s juiced in.
He`s the County Commissioner`s cousin.

314
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:40,571
I wouldn`t give the bum
a mop job.

315
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:43,128
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

316
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,085
These yokels ran the state.

317
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:46,613
Thank you very much,
Senator.

318
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:49,726
- They passed the laws,
they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.

319
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:52,288
- I had dozens of politicians
and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

320
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,211
coming through that place
every week.

321
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,131
- Help the Senator,
get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

322
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,483
Why not make him happy?

323
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,048
...the Presidential Suite.

324
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:13,084
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

325
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,813
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

326
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,091
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

327
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:22,484
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

328
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,889
It`s a whale
like K.K. Ichikawa...

329
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,687
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

330
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,730
that`s the one
you really gotta watch.

331
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:33,011
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

332
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,925
to turn out your lights.

333
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,768
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman lslands.

334
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:40,810
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

335
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:44,933
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

336
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:47,488
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

337
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:51,493
free private jets and
two million of our money.

338
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,889
But we got him back.

339
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,323
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

340
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:58,484
I don`t know what the hell went wrong.
I`m awfully sorry.

341
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,571
I can`t understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

342
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:04,082
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

343
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,642
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

344
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,770
I can`t believe that there`s
a convention; there`s no room.

345
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,803
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

346
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,727
- I`m sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

347
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:21,964
Oh, no. No gambling.

348
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,367
And once he was back,
he played small.

349
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:33,250
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

350
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:36,127
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

351
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,211
But I knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa...

352
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,132
was that they can`t bet
small for long.

353
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,045
He didn`t think of it
as winning 10,000...

354
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:47,251
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

355
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:50,132
So, he upped his bets.

356
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:57,008
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

357
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:02,124
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

358
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,205
and keep them coming back.

359
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,569
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

360
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,844
In the end, we get it all.

361
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,687
÷ Goddamn it
Trying to make it real ÷

362
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,611
÷ Compared to what ÷

363
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,650
÷ Sock it to me ÷

364
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:21,443
In Vegas, everybody`s
gotta watch everybody else.

365
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:23,684
Six. All right,
who`s gonna give me that?

366
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:25,605
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

367
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:28,162
Each and every roll,
all right.

368
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:31,047
- the dealers are watching
the players...
- Six.

369
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:34,723
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.

370
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,527
the floormen are watching
the boxmen...

371
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:40,208
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

372
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:43,047
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

373
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,887
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

374
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:48,050
I`m watching the casino manager...

375
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:51,171
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

376
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,285
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

377
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:00,650
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

378
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,643
÷ Tryin` to make it real
compared to what ÷

379
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:21,925
Yes!

380
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,653
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

381
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:38,085
Lookin` good.
Lookin` good.

382
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:40,011
Let`s go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

383
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:41,931
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

384
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,851
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

385
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:47,330
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

386
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,486
- Oh, I`m sorry.
- The dice--

387
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:03,327
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

388
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:05,763
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

389
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,652
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

390
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,891
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

391
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,525
- Come on.
- What`s the matter?

392
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:19,050
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

393
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,130
What money? I`ve seen
you stealing from me.

394
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,045
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

395
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,284
- I want my half.
- I`ve been watching you all night.

396
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:27,689
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

397
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,407
- I didn`t steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

398
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,962
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

399
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:36,524
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

400
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,688
÷ Slippin` and a-slidin` ÷

00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,049

÷ You`re the one ÷

407
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:26,085
[ Ace ] What a move.

408
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:28,005
I fell in love right there.

409
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:31,006
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

410
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:34,763
÷ What`s different about him ÷

411
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:36,446
÷ I don`t really know ÷

÷ I just can`t make him cry ÷

415
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:52,762
- [ Ace ] Ginger`s mission
in life was money.
- I`ll be right back.

416
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:54,691
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

417
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,406
She was a queen
around the casino.

418
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,126
She brought in high rollers...

419
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,210
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

420
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:02,290
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

421
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,683
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

422
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:07,527
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

423
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:10,088
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:12,483
Who didn`t want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

425
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,651
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

426
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:21,844
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

427
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,004
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

428
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:26,085
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

429
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,768
÷ You only make me glad ÷

430
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:33,768
÷ Better listen, little girl ÷

431
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:37,369
÷ You`re goin` walkin`
down the street ÷

432
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:41,003
÷ I ain`t got no love ÷

433
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:43,528
Any change?

434
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:48,284
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

435
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:50,973
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

436
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:52,373
÷ This heart of stone ÷

437
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,811
- How you doin` tonight?
- Good.

438
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:57,810
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

439
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:00,328
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

440
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:03,326
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

441
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,763
And that`s what Vegas
is all about.

442
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,612
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

443
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,963
- It`s kickback city.
- Have a good night.

444
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:12,811
Thank you. You too.

445
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,525
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

446
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:21,566
pit bosses, floor managers...

447
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,491
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

448
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,890
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

449
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,606
Ginger took care of the parkers...

450
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,724
because they took care
of the security guards...

451
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:34,244
- who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

452
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:37,491
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

453
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,405
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

454
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:43,009
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

455
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:45,614
But one thing
I just could never understand...

456
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,003
was that she could have
everything under control...

457
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:51,052
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

458
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,047
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

459
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:57,090
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

460
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,011
in this thing, okay?

461
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:02,285
You`re gonna get yours back,
and you`re gonna get back first, okay?

462
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:05,525
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

463
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,809
Where are you? You`re
in that place. Where are you?

464
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:09,765
- I`m here.
- No, you`re not.

465
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:13,170
Where are you?
Where are you?

466
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,848
I`m always here for you.

467
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:18,647
- You`re my woman.
- I know.

468
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:22,488
[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn`t
even look at this creep.

469
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:24,565
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

470
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:26,485
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

471
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,134
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

472
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,728
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

473
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:34,089
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

474
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,563
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

475
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:39,373
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

476
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,450
Somebody had
to take care of him.

477
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:45,443
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

478
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:48,253
lf you find any cash in there,
we`ll whack it up with you.

479
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:50,165
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

480
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:53,769
- That`s why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

481
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,725
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

482
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,612
- Look at me, pal,
I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

483
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:00,525
÷ Volare ÷

484
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:02,445
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

485
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,968
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

486
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:07,170
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

487
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:09,284
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

488
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,404
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

489
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:13,610
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

490
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:17,130
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster.

491
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,324
- And he didn`t give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

492
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:22,844
Look at this. Beautiful!

493
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:27,092
I mean, that`s what worried me.
`Cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

494
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:30,849
- All right, we`re clear.
- There`s more.

495
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,964
There`s a couple stuck in there.
I know there`s more.

496
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:36,046
- I`m telling you, they`re out!
- Come on.

497
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:39,484
Don`t get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

498
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,650
What`s that?
Huh, what`s that?

499
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:44,248
There`s no more.
Thanks, hon.

500
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,087
[ Nicky ] I couldn`t wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

501
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:49,290
But the bosses didn`t send me
out there to have a good time.

502
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,644
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

503
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:55,532
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin` skim.

504
00:27:56,934 --> 00:27:59,448
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin`?

505
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,365
Hey, Sammy.

506
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:04,491
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.

507
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,724
Welcome to Vegas.

508
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:08,770
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

509
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:10,884
Ginger.

510
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:18,133
Holy shit. What`ve you
been doing out here?

511
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:20,853
Honey, come here.

512
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,846
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they`re dear friends of mine.

513
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:27,210
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

514
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:29,165
Okay, Sammy.

515
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:32,007
[ Ace ] After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

516
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,210
and we took a ride to talk.

517
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,165
And then, he hit me with it.

518
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:38,848
What do you think about me
moving out here?

519
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:42,211
What`s the matter?
You got a problem with that?

520
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:46,213
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

521
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:48,973
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

522
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,891
it`s no joke out here,
it`s no joke.

523
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:52,965
You gotta keep a low profile.

524
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,727
It`s not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don`t like guys like us.

525
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:58,089
And this sheriff`s
a real cowboy.

526
00:28:58,174 --> 00:29:00,972
Even the coppers aren`t afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

527
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:03,522
I don`t care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

528
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,445
I`m tired of that shit
back there.

529
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,365
Look at this place.
It`s made of money.

530
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,730
You know what the best part is?
Nobody`s gonna know what we`re doing.

531
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:13,572
There`s nobody here to see us.
Everybody`s back home.

532
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,684
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

533
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,611
I really gotta be careful.

534
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:19,724
I`m running a licensed place,
everything`s legit.

535
00:29:19,814 --> 00:29:22,408
Don`t worry about it.
I`m not gonna do anything.

536
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,452
I`m especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

537
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,054
[ Nicky ]
Ace saw Vegas one way...

538
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:33,166
- You call this guy
and tell him I`m comin`?
- Of course.

539
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,893
but I saw it another.

540
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:38,243
I saw it as untouched.

541
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:40,171
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

542
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,205
and drug dealers
I could shake down.

543
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:44,131
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

544
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,971
So I started gettin`
everybody in line.

545
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:48,648
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

546
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,123
I figured out a way
not to lose.

547
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:53,330
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

548
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:55,291
It wasn`t very scientific,
but it worked.

549
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,211
When he won, he collected;

550
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,814
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

551
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:03,130
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

552
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:05,648
- Hey, how you doin`?
- How you doin`?

553
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,804
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

554
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:09,924
Oh, Nicky. I thought
you was layin`.

555
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,647
No, no, I`m takin`.
I was takin`.

556
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,606
- You sure?
- I`m positive.

557
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:18,447
- I`m a little confused.
- You`re a little confused?

558
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,923
Maybe if I stick your fuckin`
face through this window...

559
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:22,885
you`ll get unconfused.

560
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:24,805
- Gimme the fuckin` money.
- I`m sorry, Nick.

561
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,725
I didn`t mean anything by it.

562
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,282
That`s why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin` layin` it?

563
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:32,810
- My fuckin` head.
- Smarten up.

564
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:35,533
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

565
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:42,164
George Washington was born--

566
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,973
[ Ace ] But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

567
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:47,488
Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

568
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:50,731
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

569
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,651
Beautiful, you got
a beautiful swing.

570
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:55,208
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

571
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,888
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

572
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,004
was a fuckin`
metro intelligence cop.

573
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:03,012
But it didn`t matter.
It was all about the kids.

574
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:04,328
He`s gotta realize that everything
can`t be a home run that he does.

575
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:07,286
That`s exactly what
I keep tellin` him...

576
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,764
but that`s the kind of kid he is.

577
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:12,804
[ Ace ] And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

578
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:16,210
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

579
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:18,524
people got the message.

580
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:20,451
[ Nicky ] Me, that`s why
the bosses sent me out here.

581
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,962
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

582
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,488
Like these two fuckin`
balloon heads over here.

583
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:28,213
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin` grand...

584
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:30,125
- yeah, right, I`m sure.
- Hey! How are you?

585
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:32,045
How are you?
What are you doing here?

586
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:34,090
I`m over here now.

587
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,483
- You`re over here?
- Yeah, I`m over here with them.

588
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,684
We`re waiting on Carmine.

589
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,605
Yeah, we`re looking
for Carmine.

590
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:47,130
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

591
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:51,287
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

592
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:53,205
He`s gone?

593
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,125
He`s not here?

594
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,491
Carmine`s out?

595
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,650
I think maybe he went
across the street...

596
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,850
or somewhere else
or somethin`.

597
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:09,371

Can you feel my eyes on you?

- No, Lester.

I`ve been with Lester

No, I didn`t know that.
But you know what he did?

I walked over to him politely,

He doesn`t know that

I mean, he`s already
very sorry.

But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

I swear he`ll never
get out of line again.

Ace could be a very touchy guy.

945
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,850
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

946
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:58,926
Like when he hired
that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,529
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

But I`ll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:07,325
He knew all
the fuckin` angles.

950
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:10,212
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

951
00:51:10,294 --> 00:51:13,172
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

952
00:51:13,254 --> 00:51:17,406
He had to weigh `em in
once a week to make sure
they didn`t blow up like balloons.

- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

I guess she`s frightened. lf she doesn`t
lose weight she may get fired.

961
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:42,532
That`s right, she will get fired.

I mean, he does
the most obvious thing.

This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

So why not take advantage, right?

968
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,974
So, he took bookie joints
off the street...

969
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:02,648
and then opened them up
inside the casino.

970
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:04,764
Within a few years
by doing all of this...

1050
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,650
[ Ace ]
Well, it wasn`t long...

1051
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:05,162
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1052
00:56:05,254 --> 00:56:09,008
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1053
00:56:09,094 --> 00:56:12,848
And from then on,
I couldn`t be seen talking
to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1054
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:15,732
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1055
00:56:15,814 --> 00:56:19,568
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1056
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:23,647
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1057
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:26,049
every time he shows up."

1058
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,245
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1059
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:32,644
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation--"

1060
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:35,294
Motherfucker!

1061
00:56:35,334 --> 00:56:37,894
ls there any way
around this?

1062
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,613
No, there`s no way.

1063
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:43,646
Let`s say, for instance...

1064
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:47,090
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1065
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:49,005
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1066
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:52,609
Forget it. You can`t even
set foot in the parking lot.

1067
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:55,003
That`s how serious it is.

1068
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:58,251
In other words,
I`m fucked?

1069
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:00,609
In so many words, yes.

1070
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:04,653
It just didn`t sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1071
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:07,532
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1072
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:11,971
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and FBl agent.

1073
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,649
I mean, you`re listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn`t care.

1074
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:19,164
I gotta do something.
They ain`t gettin` rid of me.

1075
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:21,853
They`re not gettin` rid of me.
I`m stayin` here.

1076
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:24,249
Fuck `em. Fuck `em.

1077
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:30,762
[ Nicky ]
So, once they pulled that shit...

1078
00:57:30,854 --> 00:57:33,891
I started doin` my own things
nobody ever thought of doin`.

1079
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:38,689
To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my kid brother,
Dominick, and some desperados...

1080
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:41,567
and started knockin` over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1081
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:44,287
bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

1082
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:46,894
I had a good fuckin` crew goin`
for me, I`ll tell you that.

1083
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:50,489
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1084
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:55,289
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1085
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:59,930
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1086
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,488
It was like old times.

1087
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:06,971
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1088
00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:10,324
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1089
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:13,207
But I didn`t like the people
I was rippin` off looking at me...

1090
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:15,927
so I used to turn
their fuckin` pictures around.

1091
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:18,807
- What`s takin` so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1092
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:22,893
- It`s working.
- Learn how to open these things
so you don`t have to take `em.

1093
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:25,693
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1094
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:29,090
Tell Pepe if he`s
switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1095
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:31,369
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?

1096
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:33,604
- They`re in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1097
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:35,685
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1098
00:58:35,774 --> 00:58:38,527
- Yes. Don`t worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1099
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:41,213
[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1100
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:43,814
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1101
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:45,930
- Valet parkers.
- They`re just checking in now.

1102
00:58:46,014 --> 00:58:47,845
Okay, I`ll tell him.

1103
00:58:47,934 --> 00:58:49,765
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1104
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:51,685
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1105
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:54,846
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1106
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,208
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1107
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,973
Car`s coming.

1108
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:02,014
÷÷ [ Hard Rock ]

1109
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:04,090
They were very careful.

1110
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:06,602
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1111
00:59:06,694 --> 00:59:10,926
if not, they`d drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1112
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:14,170
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1113
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:17,809
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1114
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:21,768
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1115
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:24,163
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael.

1116
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:27,963
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn`t I?

1117
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:30,329
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1118
00:59:30,374 --> 00:59:33,730
- There`s no flaws.
- I`m doing this for 25 years.

1119
00:59:33,814 --> 00:59:36,965
You better clean your loupe,
because there`s no flaws.

1120
00:59:37,054 --> 00:59:39,443
[ Nicky ]
Whenever we got local merch...

1121
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,486
we`d usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1122
00:59:42,534 --> 00:59:45,048
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1123
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:47,528
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1124
00:59:47,614 --> 00:59:49,684
I know his language.

1125
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:51,645
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1126
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:54,373
Twenty thousand.
That`s my final offer.

1127
00:59:54,414 --> 00:59:57,850
He suddenly talks English. Let`s talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1128
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,727
[ Nicky ] I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vauIt...

1129
01:00:00,774 --> 01:00:03,208
where I kept
the choice stuff.

1130
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:06,570
I couldn`t leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1131
01:00:06,654 --> 01:00:08,770
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1132
01:00:08,854 --> 01:00:10,685
or if my crew got cute.

1133
01:00:10,734 --> 01:00:13,567
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn`t give a fuck.

1134
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,447
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1135
01:00:16,494 --> 01:00:20,009
This stuff was all mine.
I didn`t send any of this back home.

1136
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:23,166
Actually, I couldn`t, because I wasn`t
even supposed to be doin` it.

1137
01:00:23,214 --> 01:00:26,047
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1138
01:00:26,094 --> 01:00:29,245
that they didn`t want anybody
makin` any waves for them.

1139
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:31,808
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1140
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:33,731
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1141
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:38,052
That`s why there was
no real organized street stuff
in Vegas before I came here.

1142
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,932
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1143
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,329
You have to understand,
and I`m sure you do...

1144
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:45,410
that in a venture
of this kind...

1145
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,809
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1146
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:51,813
So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark, Ace`s banker.

1147
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:55,443
You will try to push it through,
won`t you, Mr. Clark?

1148
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:58,054
- Yes.
- I`m giving you 50,000 cash.

1149
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,410
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1150
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:03,325
- ls that the last one?
- Yeah.

1151
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:06,690
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1152
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,611
Fuckers.

1153
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,205
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1154
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:16,524
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1155
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:18,525
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1156
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,530
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin`?

1157
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:24,050
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1158
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:26,932
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1159
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:30,245
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1160
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:34,293
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1161
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:36,604
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1162
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:39,970
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1163
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:43,012
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1164
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:45,813
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1165
01:01:45,894 --> 01:01:49,364
[ Ace ]
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1166
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,053
I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1167
01:01:52,134 --> 01:01:54,329
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1168
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:56,251
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1169
01:01:56,294 --> 01:01:58,364
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1170
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,848
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1171
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:04,290
Let`s check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1172
01:02:04,374 --> 01:02:07,093
Come on. I`ll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1173
01:02:07,174 --> 01:02:09,972
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1174
01:02:10,054 --> 01:02:14,047
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1175
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:17,046
That`s the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1176
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:20,450
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1177
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:24,123
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1178
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:27,564
It`ll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1179
01:02:27,654 --> 01:02:30,532
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1180
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:33,572
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1181
01:02:33,654 --> 01:02:35,645
- That`s what I did.
- Yeah?

1182
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,884
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1183
01:02:37,974 --> 01:02:42,490
You know you`re a lyin` lowlife,
motherfuckin` gamblin` degenerate prick?

1184
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:44,809
You know that`s what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1185
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,010
I gave you money to pay
the fuckin` rent...

1186
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:49,244
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1187
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:52,485
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin` heat`s off.

1188
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,690
And you didn`t gamble
that fuckin` money?

1189
01:02:54,734 --> 01:02:56,611
- No? You didn`t?
- I didn`t--

1190
01:02:56,694 --> 01:02:59,811
Don`t fuck with me, Al!
Don`t make a fuck outta me.

1191
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:03,250
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn`t gamble?

1192
01:03:03,334 --> 01:03:05,529
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin` money...

1193
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,327
I`ll give you the fuckin` money
to put the fuckin` heat on!

1194
01:03:08,414 --> 01:03:10,644
Did you gamble? Huh?

1195
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:15,843
Fuckin` degenerate.

1196
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:18,607
Fuckin` kids at home.

1197
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:23,892
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:25,885
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1199
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:28,613
Let me find out you fucked up.
I`ll leave you where I find you.

1200
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:30,805
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1201
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,731
- Two.
- Two?

1202
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:35,607
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1203
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:38,009
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1204
01:03:38,054 --> 01:03:41,012
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1205
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:43,813
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1206
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,493
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:49,367
- Why?
- `Cause it clogs up your heart.

1208
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:53,407
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1209
01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:56,133
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1210
01:03:56,214 --> 01:03:58,853
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1211
01:03:58,894 --> 01:04:01,124
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1212
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:04,286
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don`t
know anybody who can see that far.

1213
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:06,325
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1214
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:09,252
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1215
01:04:09,294 --> 01:04:11,171
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1216
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,774
The cops knew,
but they didn`t give a fuck.

1217
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:15,845
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1218
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,447
I knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1219
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:20,645
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1220
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:23,931
I would carry things out
to a "T."

1221
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:28,013
Like the time Tony Dogs,
who`s supposed to be
the new maniac tough guy in town...

1222
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:30,403
shot up one of Remo`s bars.

1223
01:04:34,494 --> 01:04:37,566
Here`s a fuckin` guy
kills two of Remo`s guys...

1224
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:41,886
and a poor fuckin` waitress who was just
workin` on her night off, of all things.

1225
01:04:43,574 --> 01:04:47,169
I mean, this guy`s just beggin`
to be made an example of.

1226
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:50,769
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1227
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,130
And I don`t care what you have
to do to `em to get `em, understand?

1228
01:04:54,214 --> 01:04:56,205
- I`ll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow `em down.

1229
01:04:56,294 --> 01:04:59,411
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1230
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:02,213
He was one of the toughest
lrishmen I ever met.

1231
01:05:02,254 --> 01:05:04,643
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.

1232
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,044
For two days and two fuckin` nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1233
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:10,364
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1234
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:14,043
- Better give me a name soon,
or I`m gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1235
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:17,086
- But he never talked.
- I know you would`ve ratted by now.

1236
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,688
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin` head in a vise.

1237
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:22,413
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1238
01:05:22,494 --> 01:05:25,292
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1239
01:05:25,374 --> 01:05:29,333
I`ll squash your fuckin` head like a
grapefruit if you don`t give me a name.

1240
01:05:29,414 --> 01:05:31,609
Don`t make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1241
01:05:31,654 --> 01:05:34,646
Don`t make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1242
01:05:34,694 --> 01:05:37,083
[ Straining ]
Fuck you!

1243
01:05:37,174 --> 01:05:40,211
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin` days and nights.

1244
01:05:40,294 --> 01:05:42,728
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1245
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,533
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you`re tellin` me?

1246
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,372
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1247
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:51,651
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin` name!

1248
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:53,565
[ Straining ]
Charlie M.

1249
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:55,485
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1250
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:58,367
You make me pop your
fuckin` eye outta your head...

1251
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,247
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1252
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,205
You dumb motherfucker!

1253
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:05,330
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1254
01:06:05,414 --> 01:06:07,644
You motherfucker, you!

1255
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:09,964
Frankie, do him
a fuckin` favor.

1256
01:06:10,054 --> 01:06:12,409
[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally...

1257
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:15,287
there was a real
gangster in town.

1258
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,370
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1259
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:19,291
Charlie M.

1260
01:06:21,254 --> 01:06:23,165
[ Bells Ringing ]

1261
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:26,371
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1262
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:28,763
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1263
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:31,163
It`s gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1264
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:34,405
Three fuckin` jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn`t you call me?

1265
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:37,850
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn`t have a chance.

1266
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:41,489
- You didn`t see the scam?
- There`s no way to determine that.

1267
01:06:41,574 --> 01:06:43,690
Yes, there is.
They won!

1268
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:46,732
It`s a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1269
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:50,090
Ward, you`re pissing me off.
Now you`re insuIting my intelligence.

1270
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:54,372
You know goddamn well somebody had
to get into those machines
and set those fuckin` reels.

1271
01:06:54,454 --> 01:06:57,252
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1272
01:06:57,334 --> 01:06:59,802
On three machines in a row,
it`s in the billions.

1273
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:01,885
What`s the matter with you?

1274
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:06,650
Didn`t you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1275
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,924
I think you`re overreacting.

1276
01:07:08,974 --> 01:07:12,125
Listen, you fuckin` yokel. I`ve been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1277
01:07:12,214 --> 01:07:15,490
- Get your ass outta here.
- You`re firing me?

1278
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,929
I`m firing you.
No, I`m not firing--

1279
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:21,211
- You might regret this.
- I`ll regret it if I keep you.

1280
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:23,529
This is not the way
to treat people.

1281
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:25,570
lf you didn`t know,
you`re too fuckin` dumb.

1282
01:07:25,654 --> 01:07:26,973
lf you did know,
you were in on it.

1283
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:30,290
Either way, you`re out.
Get out. Come on. Let`s go.

1284
01:07:30,374 --> 01:07:33,286
The guy`s history
as far as I`m concerned.

1285
01:07:33,374 --> 01:07:36,730
But you can`t fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1286
01:07:36,774 --> 01:07:41,768
Everybody with cowboy boots is
a fuckin` county commissioner
or related to a commissioner.

1287
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:44,004
This is his state.
His uncle`s chief judge.

1288
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,403
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1289
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:49,292
You`re in the finances,
you`re upstairs.

1290
01:07:49,374 --> 01:07:52,093
But you are not on the floor.
You don`t see what`s going on.

1291
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,887
I`ve got thousands of players.
I`ve got 500 dealers.

1292
01:07:54,974 --> 01:07:57,534
They`re all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1293
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,044
I have to let them know I`m watching
all the details all the time.

1294
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:04,609
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1295
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:07,413
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1296
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:10,088
Look at this.
There`s nothing.

1297
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:12,483
Look how many blueberries
your muffin has.

1298
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:14,883
What are you talking about?

1299
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:17,283
lf you don`t do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1300
01:08:17,374 --> 01:08:20,764
- Where are you going?
- ÷ How long can this go on ÷

1301
01:08:20,814 --> 01:08:24,853
From now on, I want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1302
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,653
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1303
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:30,248
Do you know how long
that`s going to take?

1304
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:34,009
I don`t care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1305
01:08:37,854 --> 01:08:41,483
Just a little.
That a girl.

1306
01:08:41,574 --> 01:08:43,883
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1307
01:08:43,974 --> 01:08:46,807
Wanna come to Mommy?
It`s all right, sweetheart.

1308
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:50,642
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1309
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:54,004
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1310
01:08:54,054 --> 01:08:57,729
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

1311
01:08:57,774 --> 01:08:59,969
Why don`t you take it
out of your account?

1312
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:03,126
I would, you know, Sam,
it`s just that--

1313
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:06,007
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1314
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:10,093
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?

1315
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:13,211
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1316
01:09:13,254 --> 01:09:16,087
What`s the difference?
I just need it.

1317
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:18,090
Well, I gotta ask you.
That`s a lot of money.

1318
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:20,130
You`re not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1319
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:22,648
We don`t have to turn this
into a big deal.

1320
01:09:22,694 --> 01:09:25,288
Okay? We don`t have
to have a fight.

1321
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:28,013
It`s important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.

1322
01:09:28,094 --> 01:09:31,928
Who`s fighting?
I mean, tell me what it`s for.

1323
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:38,607
Why can`t you tell me
what it`s for? Huh?

1324
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:43,286
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1325
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:46,849
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1326
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:49,402
- No.
- lf you want a coat, you got it.

1327
01:09:49,494 --> 01:09:53,646
It`s not the money.
It`s just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1328
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:57,727
Sam, I`ve been independent
my whole life. I never had
to ask anybody for anything.

1329
01:09:57,814 --> 01:10:00,726
- Now you`re making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1330
01:10:00,774 --> 01:10:04,164
And you`re embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1331
01:10:04,254 --> 01:10:07,166
You`re asking me for 25,000.
I`m not out to make you feel bad.

1332
01:10:07,214 --> 01:10:09,205
I want to just
be able to trust you.

1333
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:11,131
You know,

[ Nicky ] She was doin` pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1627
01:26:01,534 --> 01:26:03,809
But before she could start
countin` her money...

1628
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:06,493
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1629
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:08,604
So they sent me.

1630
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:25,887
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1631
01:26:25,934 --> 01:26:29,404
- What are you talking about?
- She was found
last night shot in the head.

1632
01:26:29,454 --> 01:26:31,490
Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1633
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:33,570
Her lawyer said
you were partners.

1634
01:26:33,614 --> 01:26:37,243
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1635
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:39,802
It was never a partnership.

1636
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,692
Did you ever hear
of the .22 Caliber Killer?

1637
01:26:42,734 --> 01:26:45,567
[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1638
01:26:45,614 --> 01:26:47,809
they started looking
at Green too.

1639
01:26:47,854 --> 01:26:50,527
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1640
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:53,372
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1641
01:26:53,414 --> 01:26:55,644
the casino
was on the up-and-up.

1642
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:58,162
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1643
01:27:00,134 --> 01:27:02,853
Green`s here about
two or three times a month...

1644
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:05,328
and he`s busy
with real estate deals.

1645
01:27:05,414 --> 01:27:08,292
So in Green`s absence,
then, you`re the boss?

1646
01:27:08,374 --> 01:27:11,332
I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

1647
01:27:11,414 --> 01:27:16,613
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1648
01:27:16,654 --> 01:27:18,770
So day-to-day, then,
you`re the boss?

1649
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:22,369
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1650
01:27:22,414 --> 01:27:25,087
when Mr. Green is away.

1651
01:27:26,734 --> 01:27:28,690
You could say that.

1652
01:27:29,254 --> 01:27:30,687
Hmm, have you read this?

1653
01:27:32,574 --> 01:27:34,530
About Mr. Rothstein.

1654
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:37,293
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1655
01:27:37,374 --> 01:27:39,729
says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million...

1656
01:27:39,814 --> 01:27:42,374
Tangiers casino empire."

1657
01:27:42,414 --> 01:27:44,484
Did he really say that?

1658
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:47,646
Why, of course he said that.
It`s right here.

1659
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:51,528
Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1660
01:27:51,614 --> 01:27:54,174
I don`t know.
We have to check the files.

1661
01:27:54,214 --> 01:27:56,603
Without gettin` your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?

1662
01:27:56,654 --> 01:28:00,567
And kinda check closely, `cause we may
have to kick a kike`s ass outta town.

1663
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:02,491
Thank you.
