This is my story and that of the only
three friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,216
Two of them were killers
who never made it past the age of 30.

4
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,303
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past,

5
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,015
too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror

happy and content to live
in the closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

10

The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground,

a cement kingdom where we felt ourselves
to be nothing less than absolute rulers.

(KIDS CHATTERING)

13

Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend

14
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,143
of Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,
and Eastern European laborers.

We lived in railroad apartments

SHAKES: Domestic violence was
a cottage industry in Hell's Kitchen,

22
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,433
yet there was no divorce
and few separations.

23
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,769
The will of the Church was forceful.

24
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,189
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

25

Yet, despite the harshness of life,

26
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,863
Hell's Kitchen offered
the kids on its streets a safety net

27

enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

28
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,245
Crimes against people
of the neighborhood were not permitted.

29
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,164
When they did occur;
the punishment doled out was severe,

30
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,250
And in some cases, final.

31

moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

A packet killed the 12-year-old son
of a Puerto Rican numbers runner

34

It was the last packet the dealer ever sold.

Hell's Kitchen was a place of innocence
ruled by corruption.

We each served as altar boys.

Everyone wanted to work funeral masses
since the funeral included a $3 fee.

And more if you looked sufficiently somber

We were intrigued
by the powers a priest was given.

where people openly admitted
dark misdeeds and vile indiscretions.

Confession was better
than any book we could get

SHAKES' FATHER: When he was young,
King Benny was a hitman for Lucky Luciano.

146

Lucky Luciano did a lot of good
for this country during World War II.

But you ain't gonna read about it
in any fucking history book.

There was talk King Benny
was the shooter of Mad Dog Coll,

149

that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with Dutch Schultz

and he opened up a couple of clubs
with Tough Tony Anastasia.

I was 14 when I first heard about him.

152

The story goes, as a kid,
he wasn't much of anything.

153
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,568
He always got the shit kicked out of him
in street fights.

154
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,238
And then, one day, who the fuck knows why,

Michelangelo needed the job because it paid
more money than he ever had in his life.

SHAKES: The scam was simple.

00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,738
I was to walk up to the hot dog vendor
and order what I wanted.

382
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,742
The vendor would then hand me my hot dog
and watch as I ran off without paying.

383
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,953
This left the vendor with two choices,
neither very appealing.

He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

was as simple and as dumb

00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,698
I can't, Father.

460
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,161
I don't want to face it.

461
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,998
I'm too scared to face it.

462
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,001
I'm scared, too.

463
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,380
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

464
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,596
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna make it through there.

465
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,557
You understand?

466
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,689
Come on, we got an audience.

467
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,450
I counted three rummies
and four widows on my way in.

468
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,747
Plus Fat Ralphie's
sleeping one off in the last row.

469
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:54,543
It's the rain.
Bad weather always brings in the crowds.

470
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,884
This is one of my favorites.

471
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,552
What is?

472
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:09,058
"Whatever you do to the least
of my brethren, you do to me."

473
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,231
Come on.

474
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,948
SHAKES: We never saw the vendor as a man,

475
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,575
not the way we saw other men
of the neighborhood.

476
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,371
And we didn't care enough about him
to grant him any respect.

477
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:34,208
We gave little notice to
how hard he worked, or that he had a wife

478
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,419
and two kids in Greece,
and hoped to bring them to this country.

479
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,964
We didn't pay attention
to the long hours he worked.

480
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,467
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,057
JUDGE: Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded

John Reilly, the court hereby sentences you
to be remanded

for a period of no more than 18 months,
no less than one year

00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,613
to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

487
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,448
Lorenzo Carcaterra,

488
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,286
taking into consideration
that you arrived on the scene

489
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,705
after the theft of the cart
had already occurred...

490
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,083
In consideration of that,
the court hereby sentences you to serve

491
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,129
no more than one year; no less than
six months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

492
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,840
Michael Sullivan.

493
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,175
The court hereby sentences you
to be remanded

494
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,304
for a period of no more than 18 months,
no less than one year

495
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,889
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,641
And I might add,
had it not been for the intervention

497
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:36,228
of Father Robert Carillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf,

498
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,231
I would've sentenced you
to a much stiffer punishment.

499
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,109
I still have my doubts
as to your inherent goodness.

500
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,987
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

501

-Could you do me a favor?
-What do you want? Name it.

502
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,203
The past couple of weeks,

503
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,582
my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

504
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,668
-Could you watch over them for me?
-BOBBY: I will.

505
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,672
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

506
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,675
You mean you want me to lie?

507
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,346
It's a good lie, Father. You can do it.

508
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,017
Come on, let's go.

509
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,520
-Be strong.
-I will.

510
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,853
SHAKES: The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders

511
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,064
housed in five separate units.7

512
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,400
From the outside, the facility resembled

513
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,236
what those who ran it wanted it to resemble,

514
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,197
some kind of nice school or university.

515
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:15,577
Michael, Tommy John, and I were assigned
to the second floor of Group C.

516
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,163
We each had a private 12-foot room.

517
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:22,251
I'd been in my room less than an hour
when the panic set in.

518
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,796
It doesn't take very long
to know how tough a person you are

519
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,589
or how strong you can be.

520
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:32,261
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

Here?

You expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

526
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,658
Now lose the clothes.

It's Mary, you know, the Mother of God.

Get dressed.

538
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,021
SHAKES: There were four guards
assigned to each floor

Addison was a graduate

who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

It was not a group of innocent young boys
at Wilkinson.

Most, if not all,
of the inmates belonged there.

Many were riding out
their second and third convictions.

550
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,054
All were violent offenders.

551
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,473
Few seemed sorry
about what they had done.

It's a little harder for us to forget.
You gave us so much more to remember.

919
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:53,784
You can't quite place us, can you, chief?
Let me help you out.

920
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,245
You're looking at John Reilly
and Tommy Marcano.

921
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,378
Yeah.

922
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:08,924
That's right.

923
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,516
That was a long time ago.

924
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,728
So, how you been?

925
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,897
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

926
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,066
So what do you want?

927
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,070
What I've always wanted is to watch you die.

928
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,120
TOMMY: You ordered the meatloaf.

929
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:42,749
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

930
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,584
You fucked up.

931
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:02,102
You were scared little pricks, both of you.

932
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:07,816
All of you, scared shitless.

933
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:13,739
I tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

934
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:15,490
TOMMY: I had you all wrong then, Nokes.

935
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,202
All this time I thought you just liked
fucking and beating up little boys.

936
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:22,080
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell.

937
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:25,292
-You're gonna burn in hell.
-Yeah, after you.

938
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:28,211

(GROAN ING)I

940
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,299
Did that hurt, Nokes?

941
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,326
(CRYING)

942
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,170
Jerry.

943
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,382
Sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

944

(PATRONS SCREAMING)

945
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:29,439
JUDGE: John Reilly how do you plead?
JOHN: Not guilty Your Honor

946
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,191
JUDGE: Thomas Marcano?

947
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,610
TOMMY: Not guilty Your Honor

948
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:37,864
JUDGE: John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

949
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:42,244
SHAKES: In all the years since Wilkinson's,
we had never once spoken to each other

950
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,995
about what had happened there.

951
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,833
We remained caring friends,
but the relationship had been altered.

952
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:53,213
We drifted together always wondering
if that moment would arrive

953
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,383
that would force us to deal with the past.

954
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,274
One down, Shakes.

955
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,527
One what?

956
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:20,448
One Sean Nokes.

957
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:22,659
Nokes?

958
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,335
SHAKES: At the time of Nokes' shooting,

959
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:35,797
Michael was working
as an Assistant New York District Attorney.

960
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:40,927
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens, then he hung up.

961
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,683
-MICHAEL: So what did they say?
-What?

962
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:50,478
-John and Tommy, what'd they say?
-It's a little cloak and dagger, isn't it?

963
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:53,398
Come on. Nokes. Did they talk about him?

964
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,777
-John did.
-Yeah? What did he say?

965
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:01,156
He said, "One down, Shakes."

966
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,828
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer.

967
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,915
It's temporary. King Benny's gonna move in
one of his lawyers.

968
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:14,127
-Don't let him do that. Snyder's perfect.
-Perfect? The guy's a fall-down drunk.

969
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,630
-He's perfect.
-Perfect for what?

970
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,636
Are you covering this story
for your newspaper?

971
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,887
-Me?
-Yeah.

972
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,557
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey.
Ask me what movie's playing at what time.

973
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,976
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

974
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,482
Get some coffee?

975
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,317
Let's take a walk.

976
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,664
I'm gonna prosecute John and Tommy
in an open court.

977
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:54,417
-What are you, fucking nuts?
-Just hear me out.

978
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:57,420
Stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, Counsel.

979
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,923
I'm not taking this case to win.

980
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,009
I'm taking this case to lose.

981
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,345
What does that mean?

982
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,182
It means it's payback time.

983
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:13,937
Look, John and Tommy started this.
it's begun.

984
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,358
It's messy, it's not how I had it planned,
but here it is.

985
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:24,155
-And you and I, we can finish it.
-Finish what, Mikey?

986
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,953
You read The Count of Monte Cristo lately?

987
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,622
I don't know, 10 years ago.

988
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,002
You see, I read a little bit of it every night.

989
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:41,464
I reed words like "revenge"
"Sweet, lasting revenge."

990
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,637
Payback time. It's our time.

991
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,890
What are you saying?

992
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,811
I'm saying it's time for all of us
to get a taste.

993
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:58,857
I'm saying it's time to put an end to this.

994
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,735
Let's walk.

995
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,156
So I asked for the case.

996
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,159
Told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused,

997
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,910
knew the mentality of the area.

998
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,412
They bought it.

999
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,914
And the connection between
John, Tommy, and Nokes?

1000
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:18,918
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

1001
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:21,338
We were never at Wilkinson's.

1002
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,594
I gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

1003
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,679
Bring it all down.

1004
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:33,099
MICHAEL: Adam Styler, plainclothes cop.
Works narcotics in Queens.

1005
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:36,936
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

1006
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,688
Other personal information there.

1007
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:42,609
Henry Addison. Now works for the mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

1008
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,778
He's a Community Outreach Director
in Brooklyn.

1009
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:48,865
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

1010
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,285
Ralph Ferguson. Works in a social service
agency in Long Island.

1011
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,204
How long you been working on this?

1012
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,122
He's recently divorced, got one child,

1013
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,541
and on weekends,
teaches Catholic Sunday school.

1014
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:02,545
-He seems clean then, right?
-That's exactly why I want the piece of shit.

1015
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,215
The plan is to call Ferguson
in as a character witness.

1016
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,051
Get him talking about his best friend,
Sean Nokes.

1017
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:12,472
Once I got him on the stand,
I'm gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

1018
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:16,768
Mike, are you sure you want to go this way?

1019
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,274
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

1020
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:27,654
Do you still sleep with the light on?

1021
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,328
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

1022
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:38,832
No, it'll play better in court
if they don't know.

1023
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,930
SHAKES: The ”not guilty” verdict had to be
a verdict that no one would dare question.

1024
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,684
Danny Snyder was to remain
as Tommy and John 's attorney.

1025
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,353
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen

1026
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,439
to deliver information and keep quiet.

1027
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,275
Both were skills
the neighborhood had in abundance.

1028
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,777
We 'd set up a simple method
of communication.

1029
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,447
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work

1030
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,116
for me to call
my non-existent girlfriend, Gloria.

1031
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,619
If I needed to get word to Michael,
someone from the neighborhood

1032
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,289
would pick up an early edition
of The New York Times,

1033
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,792
write ”Edmund” in the upper
right hand corner of the Metro section,

1034
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,211
and drop it in front of Michael's apartment.

1035
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,467
For this plan to succeed

1036
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:33,720
we needed total secrecy
of the only people we completely trusted.

1037
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,889
The plan depended on keeping Michael alive,

1038
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,975
which meant word had to get
to John and Tommy's killing crew

1039
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,393
that he's not an open target.

1040
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,730
After this night,
Michael would not be available to any of us.

1041
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,816
The only time we would see him
would be in court.

1042
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,818
-That's it?
-Not quite.

1043
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:52,071
Four witnesses saw the shooting
and are willing to testify.

1044
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,656
We gotta get that number down.

1045
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,326
-I'll talk to King Benny.
-Good.

1046
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:00,747
I can handle two,
but you gotta get us one for our side.

1047
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,249
-One of what?
-One witness.

1048
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:07,587
A witness who'll put John and Tommy
somewhere else on the night of the murder.

1049
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,839
A witness they can't touch.

1050
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,260
-Don't they have a name for that?
-A judge would call it perjury.

1051
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:15,762
(LAUGHS)

1052
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,598
-And what are we calling it?
-A favor.

1053
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,436
Get up.

1054
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:28,399
-Tony?
-Yeah, King?

1055
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:32,612
-Bring Danny Snyder to see me.
-Who, Danny Snyder the lawyer?

1056
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,365
-You know more than one Danny Snyder?
-No, King.

1057
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,617
Bring me the one you know.

1058
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:00,640
I can't do this now, you gotta know that.
It's been a long time for me.

1059
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:06,312
You need somebody younger.
Somebody like I used to be.

1060
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,314
KING BENNY: Younger is not better.

1061
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,985
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

1062
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,445
I'm lucky I can find the courthouse.

1063
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:19,409
I had only four cases last year.
You Know how many I won?

1064
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,829
None. That's how many.

1065
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,002
In two of them,
I think the jury blamed me personally.

1066
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,504
They must've been innocent.

1067
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,966
It's tough to get innocent men off a rap.

1068
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,969
I wasn't even planning on
going to court with this one.

1069
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,847
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could, and walk away.

1070
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,100
I wasn't planning on taking this to trial, sir.

1071
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,436
Your plans have been changed.

1072
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:50,648
I am afraid that I'll make a mistake
and say the wrong thing,

1073
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:56,112
make a wrong turn somewhere.
You don't want to take that risk.

1074
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,615
-Life is risk.
-I'm sorry?

1075
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,826
-Life is risk.
-Life is a risk?

1076
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,916
I haven't been in here before.

1077
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,670
-What do you need me to do?
-Listen.

1078
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:16,299
You're gonna be given the answers
and the questions.

1079
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,762
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1080
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,556
Is it in English?

1081
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,434
Just don't drift. Don't drink, and don't lose.

1082
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:31,773
-What if I do lose?
-Then you go down for the dirt nap.

1083
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,568
Never heard that expression before.

1084
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,279
Dirt nap.

1085
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:43,910
I'm not really out out for this anymore.
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus

1086
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,163
and sues, I like that.

1087
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:51,459
Some lady slips in a supermarket,
I'm with her.

1088
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,086
The discussion is over.

1089
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,048
I'm an alcoholic.
This is a murder case. This isn't for me.

1090
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,384
-It was, once.
-Yes, but...

1091
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,803
Before you let the drink lead.

1092
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:06,474
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1093
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:09,936
You've got nothing to lose,
just like the rest of us.

1094
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,481
I don't want to be a burden to you,
but aside...

1095
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:18,486
Or along with my alcohol problem,
I have a slight drug problem.

1096
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,239
-Nothing big, just...
-Go away.

1097
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,335
SHAKES: Within days
of Michael taking the case,

1098
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,838
the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.

1099
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,633
The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

1100
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:44,137
Cries of ”traitor” and ”gutter rat”
were heard up and down the avenue.

1101
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,764
But there was never to be
a death move against him.

1102
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,350
The hit on Michael Sullivan,
if there was to be one,

1103
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:51,018
could only come from King Benny.

1104
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:53,563
The underground word,
the only one that mattered,

1105
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:57,316
had spread through the streets
at the speed of a late-night bullet.

1106
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:04,073
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

1107
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:08,077
”Sleepers” was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.

1108
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,882
You gonna pay for that, you little prick?

1109
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:23,342
SHAKES: Need your help, Fat Man.
Need a big favor.

1110
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:24,594
See you outside.

1111
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:28,306
-King Benny been to see you?
-My goodness.

1112
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,683
What a fucking team we put together, huh?

1113
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:35,021
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1114
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:38,399
Fucking paper boy, making like Dick Tracy.

1115
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,695
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing.

1116
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:46,199
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1117
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,659
Fucking General Custer
has a better shot at a walk.

1118
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,787
SHAKES: There's no connection
with the guard and us.

1119
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,705
Cops think it's a drug-related homicide.

1120
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,791
It's just we need you to pull a few strings.

1121
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:58,252
If you get caught on this,
you're looking straight-ass serious.

1122
01:19:58,336 --> 01:20:01,088
I'm talking real jail. The big house.

1123
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:05,134
(LAUGHING)

1124
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:09,972
They are not good boys anymore.

1125
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,225
They're killers now.

1126
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,851
Cold as stone.

1127
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:16,479
I know.

1128
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:19,982
I know what they were and what they are,
and it's not about that.

1129
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:23,778
It's not worth it,
throwing away life just to get even.

1130
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:27,281
You and the lawyer
have a chance to get out.

1131
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:28,741
To get out the right way.

1132
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:31,160
There's no choice. Not for us.

1133
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,708
SHAKES: On occasion,
I 'd have dinner with Carol.

1134
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:41,754
She still lived in the neighborhood,
and was e social worker in the South Bronx.

1135
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:45,216
Her concern for us
was undiminished by the passing years.

1136
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,845
Whenever we went out as a group,
she'd walk between Michael and John,

1137
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:50,847
grasping their arms,

1138
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:53,474
in step between the lawyer and the killer.

1139
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:57,478
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1140
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:01,065
Won't you settle for a couple of beers?

1141
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,527
If that's your best offer.

1142
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,989
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1143
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,490
Deal.

1144
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,745
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

1145
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:17,331
-You look tired.
-Thank you.

1146
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:22,420
They don't give you time to sleep
in this new job of yours?

1147
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,675
So, how much do you know?

1148
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:30,386
Just what the neighborhood says.

1149
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,180
And what I read in papers like yours.

1150
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:34,849
What does the neighborhood say?

1151
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,101
That they're gonna put
Johnny and Tommy away.

1152
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,562
That their best friend's gonna be
the one to do it.

1153
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,356
-You believe that?
-it's hard not to.

1154
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,277
Unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1155
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:50,698
-He did take the case.
-Then what else is there to say?

1156
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:55,786
You know Michael very well,
maybe even better than I do.

1157
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,123
Yeah, I thought I did. Now, I don't know.

1158
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,500
-You do know.
-I don't know!

1159
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,586
He went in there and he asked for the case!

1160
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,297
Now, you tell me,
what the hell kind of friend is that?

1161
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,007
The best kind.

1162
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:12,386
The kind who'll throw away everything
to help his friends.

1163
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,266
What are you telling me?

1164
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:22,229
You know this neighborhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1165
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:24,857
Why should this be any different?

1166
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,489
I'm hungry.

1167
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,951
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1168
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:39,205
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1169
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:42,041
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1170
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,836
And he just shut down.

1171
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,840
Couldn't touch him,
couldn't even breathe on him.

1172
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,012
I thought it was me.

1173
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:59,600
After a while, it just gets easier to let it go.

1174
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:02,895
-Do you still love him?
-I don't think about it.

1175
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,190
If I did, I'd say yes.

1176
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:09,568
-But you're with John now.
-Yeah.

1177
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:13,155
As much as anybody can be with John.

1178
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,451
The man I know
is not the boy you remember.

1179
01:23:17,535 --> 01:23:19,161
None of us are.

1180
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,415
But there's something special about John.

1181
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,669
You just have to look a little harder to see it.

1182
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:33,009
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1183
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:34,844
-Me?
-Yeah.

1184
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,556
Because you were Mikey's girl.

1185
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,517
He got to you first.

1186
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,812
-And after Mikey?
-I think it was Tommy's turn.

1187
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,647
Fuck you.

1188
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:54,572
Because I didn't think you'd say yes, and...

1189

(STUTTERING)

1190
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,706
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1191
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:15,009
What? Go ahead and say it.

1192
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:20,347
You work at Social Services.
You got access to files.

1193
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,934
And from time to time,
we're gonna need some information.

1194
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:27,063
-Whatever.
-Wait. What?

1195
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,565
What do you want? You want information?

1196
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:33,944
You want me to get the files?
I'll get the files. What do you want?

1197
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:43,412
-You still visit John?
-Yeah, once a week, for about an hour.

1198
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,581
-Good.
-Good?

1199
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:49,126
Yeah, good. Just don't tell him
that you've seen me.

1200
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,628
Don't tell him anything.

1201
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:54,840
The more he thinks this thing's hopeless,
the better it might work.

1202
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,134
Shakes, what is this about?

1203
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:02,181
FAT MANCHO: You want a Rolls-Royce?
You don't come here.

1204
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,934
You go to England,
or wherever the fuck they make it.

1205
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,561
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1206
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:09,522
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1207
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,818
But if you want dirt or scum
buried under a rock somewhere,

1208
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:17,988
or some secret nobody wants anybody
to know about, there's only one place to go.

1209
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:22,118
Right here, Hell's Kitchen.
It is the lost-and-found of shit.

1210
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:25,871
They lose it, and we find it.
Forget about it, man.

1211
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:31,210
Now, you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1212
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:34,505
Two others changed their minds.

1213
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,299
-Which two?
-The suits at the bar.

1214
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:42,513
-That still leaves the couple in the booth.
-For now.

1215
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:46,684
Everything else falling into place?

1216
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:51,063
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1217
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:53,732
I know.

1218
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,447

Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1372
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:30,720
-MICHAEL: Are you positive?
-Yes, very positive.

1373
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:33,974
Are the two men you saw at McHale's
in this room today?

1374
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,475
Yes, they are.

1375
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:38,270
Could you point them out
for the jury, please?

1376
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,856
They're sitting right over there.

1377
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:42,732
Your Honor, will the record reflect

1378
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:46,695
that Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano

1379
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:49,364
-as the two men in question.
-WEISMAN: Noted.

1380
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,783
Thank you. No further questions.

1381
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:54,578
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1382
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:57,247
Yes, Your Honor, we are. Good morning.

1383
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,832
I just have a few questions.

1384
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,668
I won't take
too much of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

1385
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:06,298
You stated that you only had wine to drink
with dinner. Is that correct?

1386
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:07,465
Yes.

1387
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:11,636
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1388
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,723
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1389
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:17,851
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1390
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,185
What do you mean, "prior"?

1391
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:23,565
At lunch, maybe.
Did you have anything to drink at lunch?

1392
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,985
-MRS. SALINAS: Yes, I did.
-What did you have to drink?

1393
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:31,239
I went shopping and I stopped
at a place on Madison Avenue...

1394
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:35,452
See, I didn't ask you where you went.
I asked you what you had to drink at lunch.

1395
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,371
-A martini.
-And what else?

1396
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:43,168
Probably some wine.

1397
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:48,340
Yes, and how many glasses of wine
did you have to drink?

1398
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,135
One glass, maybe two.

1399
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,722
-Closer to two?
-Yes, probably two glasses.

1400
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:58,433
Did you...

1401
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,647
It's like pulling teeth.

1402
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:08,401
I should've pinned the questions to his shirt.

1403
01:39:08,485 --> 01:39:10,236
SNYDER: And tell me...

1404
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,197
Then at dinner, you...

1405
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:14,741
Strike that.

1406
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,704
(MOUTH ING)I

1407
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,335
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1408
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:27,504
Objection, Your Honor.

1409
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,965
What she did on the day of the murder

1410
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:32,258
has nothing to do with
what she saw that night.

1411
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:34,469
How much she had to drink does,
Your Honor.

1412
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:35,929
Overruled.

1413
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:37,347
(SNYDER CLEARING THROAT)

1414
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,725
Mrs. Salinas, what time did you have lunch?

1415
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:44,437
-About 1:30.
-And what did you have for lunch?

1416
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:47,357
MRS. SALINAS: It was a while ago.
Probably a salad.

1417
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,651
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1418
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:52,946
A martini, two glasses of wine,
and a salad. Is that correct?

1419
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:54,781
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:59,619
And then you had wine at dinner,
about six hours later. Is that right?

1421
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,037
MRS. SALINAS: Yes, that's right.

1422
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:02,872
How much wine did you have to drink

1423
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:05,458
by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHale's?

1424
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:09,379
-Two glasses.
-Would you say that four glasses of wine

1425
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:14,092
and a martini within a six-hour period
is a lot for you to drink?

1426
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,677
Yes, it is.

1427
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,854
Have you ever heard a gun fired,
prior to the night in question?

1428
01:40:26,396 --> 01:40:27,564
No.

1429
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:33,570
-How would you describe the sound?
-It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1430
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:39,159
-Did the sound frighten you?
-MRS. SALINAS: Very much.

1431
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:42,037
Did you close your eyes?

1432
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:46,708
At first, until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1433
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:51,337
Did you think the men who did the shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHale's?

1434
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:55,550
I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been snot.

1435
01:40:55,633 --> 01:41:00,138
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1436
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:02,390
Yes, I did.

1437
01:41:02,474 --> 01:41:06,770
Yet despite that fear,
despite that risk to your life,

1438
01:41:06,895 --> 01:41:10,857
you looked at their faces as they left?

1439
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:14,402
-Yes, I did.
-Is that correct?

1440
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,863
Yes, I did.

1441
01:41:17,072 --> 01:41:19,949
Did you look at their faces? Did you

1442
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:23,161
really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1443
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:27,415
I glanced at them when they walked by,
but I did see them.

1444
01:41:27,499 --> 01:41:29,626
You glanced?

1445
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:31,836
You didn't look?

1446
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,005
I saw them.

1447
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:37,258
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.

1448
01:41:37,342 --> 01:41:41,304
You glanced at them through the eyes
of a very frightened woman

1449
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:44,182
who maybe had too much to drink.

1450
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:47,602
-Objection, Your Honor.
-SNYDER: There is no need, Your Honor.

1451
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:49,270
I have no further questions.

1452
01:41:49,354 --> 01:41:52,315
WEISMAN: Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1453
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,779
SHAKES: It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

1454
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:01,032
Frank Magcicco worked
out of a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

1455
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:05,120
He was a first-grade detective
with an honest name and a solid reputation.

1456
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,497
He was also King Benny's nephew.

1457
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:10,500
Nick Davenport was with Internal Affairs.

1458
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:13,503
He was ambitious and wanted
to make captain before he hit 40.

1459
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,463
He knew the fastest way up the track

1460
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:19,551
was to reel in a maximum amount
of dirty cops in a minimum amount of time.

1461
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:21,344
Frank, what is this shit?

1462
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:23,346
If I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1463
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:27,267
You make this, you'll be having breakfast
once a month with the Commissioner.

1464
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:30,895
You got a real hard-on for this Styler guy.
What's your beef with him?

1465
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,772
-One more thing.
-I can't wait.

1466
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:37,652
It's simple. No one knows who fed you
this information. And I mean nobody.

1467
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:39,279
How did you get it?

1468
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:42,907
It fell into my lap.
Just like it's gonna fall into yours.

1469
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:50,915
NICK: Christ Almighty.

1470
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:02,093
-You got everything here but a confession.
-SHAKES: I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1471
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:04,304
My preference is that you beat it out of him.

1472
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:05,930
There's even surveillance photos.

1473
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:09,767
This piece of shit's pulling in about
$5,000 a month, ripping off pushers.

1474
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:12,103
-Has been for about three years.
-More like four.

1475
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:14,814
-He ain't gonna see five.
-Got enough for a conviction?

1476
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:17,817
That ain't up to me. That's up to a jury.

1477
01:43:20,612 --> 01:43:22,447
SHAKES: Show the jury this.

1478
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,409
What do you got there, Ness?

1479
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:28,912
About three weeks ago,
the body of a drug dealer

1480
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:32,373
named Indian Red Lopez was found
in an alley in Jackson Heights.

1481
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:34,834
Three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

1482
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:36,127
I'm with you so far.

1483
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:39,130
This is the gun that killed him,
and these are the shells.

1484
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:42,675
What's behind door number three?

1485
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,720
The prints on the gun belong to Adam Styler.

1486
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,392
-(LAUGHS) Do me a favor, will you?
-What's that?

1487
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:54,437
If I ever make it onto your shit list,
give me a call.

1488
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,856
Give me a chance to apologize.

1489
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,484
SHAKES: So you need anything else,
you talk to Frank.

1490
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,946
-He knows how to get a hold of me.
-Take care of yourself, kid.

1491
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:06,658
-Water gets choppy out your way.
-I'll do what I can.

1492
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:13,665
-Did you ever think of becoming a cop?
-And leave the good guys?

1493
01:44:31,099 --> 01:44:33,268
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

1494
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,362
The body of Christ.

1495
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:53,955
Amen.

1496
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:58,418
The body of Christ.

1497
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:04,132
SHAKES: Michael had done
all that could be expected

1498
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:07,635
of an Assistant District Attorney
seeking a conviction.

1499
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:12,265
He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.

1500
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:15,226
He just never had the murder weapon
to present as evidence.

1501
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:18,730
And he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder

1502
01:45:19,147 --> 01:45:21,774
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working,

1503
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,902
and the uncertainty about the outcome
weighed heavily on him.

1504
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:26,321
Did you see their faces?

1505
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:29,157
Yes, I looked at them,
and they looked at me.

1506
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,616
Did they say anything to you?

1507
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:33,328
No, they just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

1508
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,830
Are you sure the two defendants
killed Sean Nokes?

1509
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,332
I know they killed him.

1510
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:40,335
SHAKES: If the plan worked,
it would be everyone's success.

1511
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:42,628
If it failed, the fault would fall to Michael.

1512
01:45:46,132 --> 01:45:50,053
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the West Side,

1513
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:54,098
remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder

1514
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:58,019
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1515
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,146
Why didn't you turn around, Mr. Carson?

1516
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,815
I was concerned for my companion's safety.

1517
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,109
Did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?

1518
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:06,277
No.

1519
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:10,573
Did they threaten anyone
in McHale's Restaurant, as far as you know?

1520
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:12,325
MR. CARSON: I didn't See it, but I know it.

1521
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:15,286
SNYDER: If you didn't see the defendants
shoot the guy

1522
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,623
then how do you know
it was the defendants that shot him?

1523
01:46:41,354 --> 01:46:43,314
What's the emergency?

1524
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:49,404
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
It's too risky.

1525
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:52,490
Nobody sent me. I wanted to see you.

1526
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:55,827
Why?

1527
01:46:57,036 --> 01:47:00,081
Shakes met with Father Bobby
two weeks ago.

1528
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:04,836
-He hasn't heard from him since.
-It's not an overnight decision for him.

1529
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:11,384
-What if he doesn't testify?
-Then we got a very serious problem.

1530
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:28,860
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1531
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:34,115
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1532
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,867
He already has.

1533
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:38,077
What?

1534
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,749
I was with him
when he talked to Father Bobby.

1535
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,212
I heard everything, Michael.

1536
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,557
So you know.

1537
01:48:01,893 --> 01:48:03,227
Yeah.

1538
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:09,108
If only you'd told me...

1539
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:16,574
I think things could've been different.

1540
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:20,077
If you could've talked.

1541
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:26,626
(CRYING) Maybe...

1542
01:48:53,778 --> 01:48:55,279
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

1543
01:48:55,363 --> 01:48:56,864
Hey, how you doing?

1544
01:48:56,948 --> 01:49:00,952
Carmine, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1545
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:06,374
-You still have a thing for Doris Day.
-She was a good woman.

1546
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,627
You know the strega?

1547
01:49:10,086 --> 01:49:13,381
It's hard to miss a lady
with four warts and only one eye.

1548
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:15,800
She needs the heads.

1549
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,432
Take this to the witch.

1550
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:26,227
Now, why does she need the heads?

1551
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:29,146
-She takes the eyes.
-Wonderful.

1552
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:32,984
Puts them in a bowl and mixes them
with water and oil.

1553
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:34,819
And then?

1554
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:38,948
People get headaches, they go to her.

1555
01:49:39,115 --> 01:49:42,076
She looks into their eyes and tells them

1556
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,245
who is wishing the headaches.

1557
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:48,165
She says a few words
and the headaches go away.

1558
01:49:48,624 --> 01:49:52,962
Once in a while the person who wishes
the headaches goes away, too.

1559
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:57,508
This guy, Addison,
the one who works for the Mayor,

1560
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,177
he quits his job in two weeks.

1561
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:04,348
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1562
01:50:04,432 --> 01:50:08,519
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1563
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:11,147
-He knows this?
-He will.

1564
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,775
The boys he buys for parties are expensive.

1565
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:18,821
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1566
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,198
How much does he owe?

1567
01:50:21,282 --> 01:50:24,785
$8,000 with a heavy vig. I paid that off.

1568
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:26,871
You paid?

1569
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:30,041
Addison's debts belong to me now.

1570
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,794
-You hate debts.
-I hate Addison.

1571
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:40,134
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1572
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:42,303
And I like to play alone.

1573
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:46,682
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1574
01:51:00,363 --> 01:51:03,157
SHAKES: His mother named him
Edward Goldenberg Robinson

1575
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,409
after her favorite actor

1576
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:07,328
To continue the Hollywood connection

1577
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:10,164
Eddie Robinson took the street name
Little Caesar

1578
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:13,751
as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.

1579
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:17,505
He had a 12-year-old son
in a private school in upstate New York.

1580
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:20,174
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother;

1581
01:51:20,257 --> 01:51:24,011
who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

1582
01:51:24,095 --> 01:51:27,264
-I want you to give me some money.
-All right.

1583
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:29,517
I'll play along.

1584
01:51:29,809 --> 01:51:33,646
-How long before you pay it back?
-I ain't paying it back.

1585
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:35,523
Somebody else is.

1586
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,193
This somebody I know?

1587
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:42,613
-Your little brother knew him.
-Rizzo?

1588
01:51:45,366 --> 01:51:47,034
How did he know Rizzo?

1589
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:51,414
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

1590
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:56,127
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1591
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:04,927
Count out $8,000, put it in an envelope.

1592
01:52:10,725 --> 01:52:13,102
You go back a long time, old man.

1593
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:15,980
Old men always do.

1594
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:19,024
Ran with the guineas
back when the guineas were tough.

1595
01:52:19,108 --> 01:52:20,943
I ran when I could.

1596
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:23,779
Looked good doing it, too.

1597
01:52:23,863 --> 01:52:25,990
(CHUCKLING)

1598
01:52:26,073 --> 01:52:29,869
Gave the business some style, some class.

1599
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:35,541
Made it a call for respect
the way you wore it, the way you talked it.

1600
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:38,711
I always liked that about you.

1601
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:42,047
I'm no help to you. My tailor is dead.

1602
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:53,309
I'll look up our friend
and collect the money he owes me.

1603
01:52:53,726 --> 01:52:58,606
-He owes you something more than money.
-Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1604
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:01,484
-This is.
-What, old man?

1605
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:05,279
What's this guy owe
that means more than dollars?

1606
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:09,325
He owes you Rizzo.
He's the man that killed your brother.

1607
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:21,962
-They said he died of pneumonia.
-They said.

1608
01:53:29,553 --> 01:53:31,555
WEISMAN: What is the relevance of this?

1609
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:34,433
So Ralph Ferguson
is a Sunday school teacher

1610
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:38,103
I don't know, Counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1611
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:42,942
I understand that, Your Honor.
Again, I need to put a face to the victim.

1612
01:53:43,609 --> 01:53:47,154
Otherwise, it's just another name
in the obituaries.

1613
01:53:47,613 --> 01:53:49,824
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1614
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:53,035
I don't have a problem with it.

1615
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:58,541
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1616
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:26,402
-Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
-Good morning.

1617
01:54:26,485 --> 01:54:30,281
I thank you for coming.
I realize, for you, this has been a long trip.

1618
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:33,617
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1619
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:36,203
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were good friends.

1620
01:54:36,287 --> 01:54:39,331
Your testimony as a character witness
will be very valuable.

1621
01:54:39,415 --> 01:54:42,835
We were great friends.
It would be hard to find a better friend.

1622
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:47,464
-Would you say you were his best friend?
-I was his closest, that's for sure.

1623
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:51,594
-How long did you know each other?
-About 17, 18 years.

1624
01:54:52,136 --> 01:54:55,514
-Did you see each other often?
-As often as we could.

1625
01:54:55,598 --> 01:54:59,393
Weekends, holidays, vacations,
things like that.

1626
01:55:00,519 --> 01:55:04,106
-What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
-He was a good man.

1627
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:07,234
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1628
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:09,695
Objection.
Statement is one of opinion, not fact.

1629
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:13,407
-He was asked his opinion.
-Overruled. Please proceed.

1630
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:19,455
Mr. Ferguson, were you aware
of any enemies he might have had?

1631
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:22,082
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1632
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:25,878
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1633
01:55:30,132 --> 01:55:31,926
SNYDER: What is that, a prison?

1634
01:55:32,009 --> 01:55:34,428
FERGUSON: No,
it's a juvenile facility for young boys.

1635
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:37,640
Your function was what
at this juvenile facility?

1636
01:55:37,723 --> 01:55:39,308
Standard stuff.

1637
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:43,646
Keep the boys in line,
make sure they got to class on time,

1638
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:47,858
keep an eye out for trouble, put them down
for the night. Nothing exciting.

1639
01:55:47,942 --> 01:55:50,736
As guards, were you and Mr. Nokes allowed

1640
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:54,657
to use force to, as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1641
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:58,577
-What do you mean, "force"?
-Were you allowed to hit them?

1642
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:00,537
No, of course not.

1643
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:02,998
Were any of the boys hit
by any of the guards

1644
01:56:03,082 --> 01:56:05,668
at any time at the Wilkinson Home?

1645
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:08,754
FERGUSON: I'm sure something like that
may have happened.

1646
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:12,591
It was a big place,
but it wasn't the common practice.

1647
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:14,760
Sure. Let's narrow the place down.

1648
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:18,681
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit
any of the boys under your care

1649
01:56:18,764 --> 01:56:21,225
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1650
01:56:28,816 --> 01:56:31,193
Would you like me to repeat the question?

1651
01:56:31,276 --> 01:56:32,444
No.

1652
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:37,408
Then answer it, please.
Remember, you're under oath.

1653
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:40,661
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems

1654
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,788
were hit on occasion.

1655
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:44,498
And how were they hit?

1656
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,875
-I don't know what you mean.
-A fist,

1657
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:50,796
open hand, Kick, baton, maybe?

1658
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:55,592
-Depended on what the situation called for.
-Who determined that situation?

1659
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:57,219
The guard on the scene.

1660
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:59,930
That's a lot of power to have
over a boy, isn't it?

1661
01:57:00,014 --> 01:57:03,892
-It came with the job, sir.
-Did torture come with the job?

1662
01:57:12,776 --> 01:57:15,279
Boys were tortured, weren't they?

1663
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:17,197
Define torture.

1664
01:57:18,574 --> 01:57:20,492
SNYDER: Let's define torture.

1665
01:57:22,494 --> 01:57:26,165
Cigarette burning, random beatings.

1666
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:31,128
Solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1667
01:57:33,047 --> 01:57:34,965
Say that took place?

1668
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,177
-On occasion.
-Who tortured them?

1669
01:57:38,886 --> 01:57:40,846
-Guards.

02:10:12,222 --> 02:10:15,975
And what time did you, Mr. Reilly,
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1820
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:21,272
It was around 10:30, a little later.

1821
02:10:21,481 --> 02:10:25,610
They dropped me off in front of the rectory,
near where they had picked me up.

1822
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:27,987
Did they tell you where they were going?

1823
02:10:28,071 --> 02:10:31,366
No, they didn't, but I imagine,
after a night spent with a priest,

1824
02:10:31,449 --> 02:10:33,660
they went looking for
the first open bar they could find.

1825
02:10:33,743 --> 02:10:34,744
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

1826
02:10:34,828 --> 02:10:38,498
So, then, Father, if the two defendants
were with you at 8:25,

1827
02:10:38,581 --> 02:10:42,126
the night of the murder, they couldn't
have shot and killed Sean Nokes,

1828
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:45,046
as the prosecution contends.
isn't that correct?

1829
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:49,551
Not unless they shot him
from the blue seats at the Garden.

1830
02:10:51,594 --> 02:10:53,429
He was not shot from there.

1831
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:58,351
Then he was not shot by those boys.

1832
02:11:00,228 --> 02:11:02,981
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Father.

1833
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:06,150
-Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

1834
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:13,867
Did you buy the tickets, Father,
or were they given to you?

1835
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:15,952
-No, I bought them.
-On the day of the game?

1836
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:18,246
I went to the box office about a week before.

1837
02:11:18,329 --> 02:11:21,708
Did anyone know you were going
to the game, other than the defendants?

1838
02:11:21,791 --> 02:11:23,126
I don't think so.

1839
02:11:23,209 --> 02:11:25,795
MICHAEL: Was anyone with you
when you purchased the tickets?

1840
02:11:25,879 --> 02:11:26,921
No.

1841
02:11:27,005 --> 02:11:29,549
MICHAEL: No one saw you buy the tickets?
BOBBY: That's right.

1842
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:31,801
MICHAEL: Did you get a receipt?
BOBBY: No, l didn't.

1843
02:11:31,885 --> 02:11:34,846
Paid by check? MasterCard? Visa?

1844
02:11:35,096 --> 02:11:38,558
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1845
02:11:40,476 --> 02:11:43,313
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you?

1846
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:44,647
Very much.

1847
02:11:45,315 --> 02:11:48,401
MICHAEL: And there isn't anything
you wouldn't do for them, am I right?

1848
02:11:48,484 --> 02:11:51,946
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1849
02:11:52,030 --> 02:11:55,575
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1850
02:11:56,242 --> 02:11:58,119
Something along those lines, yes.

1851
02:11:58,202 --> 02:12:01,497
Is it true then, as a good father,
you would want to protect them

1852
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:03,458
from something they shouldn't have done?

1853
02:12:03,541 --> 02:12:07,795
As much as I would want to protect them
from something someone else said they did.

1854
02:12:07,879 --> 02:12:10,840
-Like a murder?
-Yes, like a murder.

1855
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:15,762
Let me get this straight, then.
No one knew you were going to the game.

1856
02:12:15,845 --> 02:12:18,640
No one saw you there.
No one saw you buy tickets.

1857
02:12:18,723 --> 02:12:22,602
There's no record you even bought tickets.
You have no receipt for the tickets.

1858
02:12:22,685 --> 02:12:23,895
Am I correct?

1859
02:12:25,313 --> 02:12:26,814
Yes, that's correct.

1860
02:12:26,898 --> 02:12:28,942
Then how do we really know, Father?

1861
02:12:29,025 --> 02:12:30,443
How do we know

1862
02:12:30,693 --> 02:12:34,530
you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder?

1863
02:12:34,614 --> 02:12:38,409
I'm telling you as a witness
and as a priest. We were at the game.

1864
02:12:38,534 --> 02:12:42,205
Yes, as a priest, and a priest wouldn't lie.
Am I right?

1865
02:12:42,872 --> 02:12:46,125
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1866
02:12:48,252 --> 02:12:50,296
I always keep the stubs.

1867
02:12:54,592 --> 02:12:56,678
Do you want to see them?

1868
02:13:02,767 --> 02:13:05,812
Why is that, Father?
Why do you keep the stubs?

1869
02:13:05,895 --> 02:13:09,691
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1870
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:13,528
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

1871
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:17,448
No one ever has.
But there's a first time for everything.

1872
02:13:27,709 --> 02:13:30,753
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1873
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:35,425
WEISMAN: Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

1874
02:13:42,306 --> 02:13:46,227
SHAKES: I've never recovered from seeing
Father Bobby take the stand and lie for us,

1875
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:48,646
to even the score for John and Tommy.

1876
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,026
He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson

1877
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:55,903
and the evil that had lived there for too long.

1878
02:13:55,987 --> 02:13:58,573
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

1879
02:14:05,163 --> 02:14:08,166
With respect to the charge of murder
in the second degree,

1880
02:14:08,249 --> 02:14:12,045
do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilty or not guilty?

1881
02:14:12,128 --> 02:14:13,379
Not guilty.

1882
02:14:13,463 --> 02:14:16,340
With respect to the charge of murder
in the second degree,

1883
02:14:16,424 --> 02:14:20,720
do you find the defendant,
Thomas Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1884
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:22,221
FOREWOMAN; Not guilty.

1885
02:14:22,305 --> 02:14:25,892
WEISMAN: Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

1886
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,874
Hi, how are you? Could I get a hot dog?

1887
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:54,295
Mustard and relish. A lot of relish.

1888
02:14:57,632 --> 02:14:59,550
Give him two napkins.

1889
02:15:04,806 --> 02:15:06,974
You did good in there, Counselor.

1890
02:15:08,893 --> 02:15:12,522
-What happens to you now?
-What happens? I walk away.

1891
02:15:14,315 --> 02:15:17,110
I'll wait a few weeks, I'll hand in my notice.

1892
02:15:17,193 --> 02:15:19,779
After the way I handled this case,

1893
02:15:19,862 --> 02:15:22,740
they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1894
02:15:24,909 --> 02:15:29,455
So you switch to the other side and work
as a defense lawyer. The money's better.

1895
02:15:29,956 --> 02:15:33,459
There's always gonna be
more bad guys than good, Mikey.

1896
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:38,131
And can you imagine the work you'd get
from John and Tommy's crew?

1897
02:15:38,214 --> 02:15:40,007
That's a house and a pool.

1898
02:15:42,051 --> 02:15:43,469
Not for me.

1899
02:15:44,387 --> 02:15:46,973
I've seen all the law I want to see.

1900
02:15:47,723 --> 02:15:50,685
-It's time for something else.
-Like what?

1901
02:15:50,893 --> 02:15:53,187
I'll let you know when I know.

1902
02:15:53,271 --> 02:15:55,731
SHAKES: You're too old to play
for the Yankees

1903
02:15:55,815 --> 02:15:57,733
and you're too young to take up golf.

1904
02:15:57,817 --> 02:16:02,405
Why are you shooting holes through
all my plans? You're gonna make me panic.

1905
02:16:02,488 --> 02:16:04,699
You'll work it out. You always have.

1906
02:16:10,246 --> 02:16:12,498
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1907
02:16:14,083 --> 02:16:18,004
I just want to shut my eyes
and not have to see the places I've been.

1908
02:16:20,298 --> 02:16:21,549
I'm weary.

1909
02:16:25,428 --> 02:16:26,846
I don't know.

1910
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:32,351
Maybe I'll get lucky, forget I was even there.

1911
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:36,022
Don't disappear on me, Counselor.

1912
02:16:37,148 --> 02:16:40,359
-I may need a good lawyer one day.
-You can't afford a good lawyer.

1913
02:16:40,443 --> 02:16:41,944
(LAUGHS)

1914
02:16:43,279 --> 02:16:45,781
I may need a good friend, though.

1915
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:50,786
I'll find you when you do. Count on it.

1916
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,332
(SOFTLY) Always have.

1917
02:17:00,463 --> 02:17:04,091
SHAKES: A full month had passed since
the acquittal and no one had made contact.

1918
02:17:04,175 --> 02:17:06,552
In those few weeks,
our lives had reverted back

1919
02:17:06,636 --> 02:17:09,805
to what they had been
prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

1920
02:17:09,889 --> 02:17:12,892
Carol had returned to her stack
of social service files,

1921
02:17:12,975 --> 02:17:15,478
helping troubled teens and single mothers.

1922
02:17:15,561 --> 02:17:19,899
John and Tommy went back to the streets,
running the West Side Boys.

1923
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:24,612
I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.

1924
02:17:24,695 --> 02:17:27,156
Michael, as he promised,
resigned from his job

1925
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:30,326
after working the losing end
of a can't-miss case.

1926
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:32,411
Excuse me.

1927
02:17:34,747 --> 02:17:37,333
I don't know now to fucking thank you.

1928
02:17:37,458 --> 02:17:39,585
(LAUGHING)

1929
02:17:40,670 --> 02:17:43,923
I can't believe what you did.
I can't believe we got away with it.

1930
02:17:44,006 --> 02:17:46,592
It wasn't me, that was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1931
02:17:46,676 --> 02:17:50,137
When I first heard he was taking the case,
I was gonna have him burned.

1932
02:17:50,221 --> 02:17:51,514
Then I figured, he's a friend,

1933
02:17:51,597 --> 02:17:54,225
and if you're sent away for murder,
who better to do it?

1934
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:56,811
The way he was handling the case,
I thought he sucked.

1935
02:17:56,894 --> 02:17:59,689
I started feeling sorry for the bastard.

1936
02:17:59,772 --> 02:18:02,108
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1937
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:04,277
TOMMY: Get over here, Counselor.

1938
02:18:04,694 --> 02:18:07,029
JOHN: You are the real Count!

1939
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:10,366
Alive and well, and living in New York City.

1940
02:18:11,701 --> 02:18:13,953
-You fucking maniac.
-All right.

1941
02:18:16,038 --> 02:18:18,124
What is this, a gay bar?

1942
02:18:19,292 --> 02:18:20,835
It was, until you came in.

1943
02:18:20,918 --> 02:18:23,921
Why don't you give me a kiss
to go with that hello?

1944
02:18:29,135 --> 02:18:30,928
Get out of the way.

1945
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:38,436
Let's have a drink.

The Four Gladiators.

02:18:47,611 --> 02:18:50,573
Worst quartet to ever hold
a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1949
02:18:50,656 --> 02:18:53,284
But what was that name
that Shakes wanted to call it?

1950
02:18:53,409 --> 02:18:56,245
Genius wanted to call it
"The Count and His Cristos."

1951
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:58,998
-Nice!
-TOMMY: It's so sweet, isn't it?

(ALL LAUGHING)

1953

flying out of the store.

1954
02:19:02,752 --> 02:19:05,421
We weren't that bad.
Some people wanted to hear us sing.

1955
02:19:05,504 --> 02:19:08,341
The kids at the deaf school don't count.

1956
02:19:12,094 --> 02:19:13,971
One song for Carol.

1957
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:16,640
-I retired a long time ago.
-Come on, you mutts.
