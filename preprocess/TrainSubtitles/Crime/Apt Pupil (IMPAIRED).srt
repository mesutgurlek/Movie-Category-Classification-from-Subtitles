00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:41,563
Todd, did you know you were on your
way to finishing first in your class?

480
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,602
Yes.

481
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,774
Your grandfather and I have
been talking and we both agree,

482
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,780
that what's going on,
with your father's work problems

483
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,613
and your mom with the drinking,

484
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,780
that maybe home
isn't the best place to be studying.

485
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,286
So he's offered to let you study over
at his place every day after school.

486
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,454
I think it's a good idea.

487
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,623
You do?
Yeah.

488
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,293
In fact,
I offered to go a step further.

489
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,879
But it means
we have to make a deal.

490
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,469
What kind of deal?

491
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,390
Finals for this quarter
are in three and a half weeks.

492
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,934
If you can give me all A's,
then I'll talk to your teachers,

493
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,069
and see if we can't discount
your midterms,

494
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,107
and let this quarter's grades
rest with your final exams.

495
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:37,118
If you come back with B's or C's,
I can't help you.

496
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:41,656
But all A's, that shows everybody
that you're serious.

497
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,951
You can do that?
Yeah.

498
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,505
But first you've got to start
being honest with me.

499
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,344
No more forging
your father's signature.

500

No more hiding my letters.

501
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,051
For now, we can deal
with just the three of us,

502
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,515
if it makes things easier at home.

503
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:07,273

next time I show up at your door.

There's always the story
of how I escaped from Berlin

as to go back.

of an old man who was afraid.

638
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,438
He was afraid
of a certain young boy

639
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:07,201
who was, in a queer way,
his friend.

The boy proved
to be a very good student.

[CHUCKLES]

644
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,547
At first, the old man
disliked the boy intensely.

645
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:32,389
But then he began to enjoy
the boy's company.

646
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:37,808
Of course, there is still a great deal
of distrust between them.

647
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:43,445
Each knew something
the other wanted to keep secret.

648
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:48,276
Over time, the old man felt

649
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,911
his hold on the boy slipping away.

650
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,286
He thought the day might come
when the boy no longer needed him.

651
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,877
So one sleepless night,

652
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,508
the old man got out of bed,

653
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,967
and wrote down the story
of his involvement with the boy.

He wrote how the boy forced his way
into the old man's house.

657

And blackmailed the old man
to serve his own morbid fascinations.

658

When the boy's grades
began to fall,

659
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:40,795
he blamed the old man and ordered
him to impersonate his grandfather.

660
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,794
At the end, his hands
were stinging with arthritis,

The following morning,
the old man put on his best suit.

664

And went down
to one of the local banks

would be inventoried.
