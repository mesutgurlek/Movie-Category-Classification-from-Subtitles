Both tips came from a pay phone
in the central city

195
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,400

Each new address

that's running a mirror of the site.

197

The site's Russian name server
uses a low TTL

198
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:24,700
so your computer constantly queries
the name server's record.

199
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:27,202
That's how it gives
you a new address consistently.
