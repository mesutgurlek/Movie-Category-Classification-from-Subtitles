You work for Mr. Harris?

168
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,594
I was an operative at the
agency. I branched out on my own.

May I?

170

Now, there are
certain situations

171
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,074
the agency
is not prepared to handle.

172

They come to me.

174
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,846
How's that?

175
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,914
The ones there,
that night.

And that woman.

The fiancée?

How could you trust
anything they say?

180
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,234
Did he give
any indication to you?

181
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,607
About what?

When was, if I may, the last
time you spoke with your son?

No.

He's also an investigator
here. Very professional.

level with you, all right?

they don't like to be shown up.

191
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,127
Okay, they've already
closed the door on your son.

192
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,855
It's a suicide. End of story.

193
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,925
You want that door open again?

194
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,990
You want to make the cops
and the DA pay attention?

195
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,370
You need a headline this big,
only with the truth.

196

So that everybody knows. Okay?
You got to shove it in their faces.

tell you that?

not a problem. But she's concerned.

He took charcoal fluid, poured it
all over it and put it on the couch.

00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,083
And my pop apologized.

639
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,687
To you?

640
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,360
To the studio.

641
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,092
For his son screwing up.

642
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,294
Like the chicken shit peasant
he was.

643
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,580
What's that look?

644
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,808
Just watching you.

645
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,015
Mrs. Bessolo.

646
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,221
I don't need this.

647
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,259
I do. Sit down,
please.

648
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,927
PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. Bessolo.

649
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,757
Right here.

650
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,901
Mrs. Bessolo.
Mrs. Bessolo.

651
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,301
I'm James Engelmann,
from RKO-Pathe Studios.

652
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,463
The what?

653
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,870
Superman was filmed
on our lot.

654
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,239
And I'm here to express how
saddened we are over your loss.

655
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,506
My son was not lost, Mr.
Engelmann. He was taken.

656
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,683
One more, Mrs. Bessolo.
Over here, Mrs. Bessolo.

657
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,352
What the hell did you
drag them here for?

658
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,822
Freedom of the press,
right?

659
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,664
Were these in the report?

660
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,640
They weren't
there then.

661
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,871
Hang on there, Mrs. Bessolo,
hang on, hang on. Come on.

662
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,816
Just let me sit for a minute.
Okay.

663
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,642
Come on, make yourself useful,
grab a chair.

664
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,779
Sure. Come on, let's
get her out of here.

665
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,220
There you go.

666
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,789
There you go.

667
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:37,163
Okay? There you go,
very good. Okay, good.

668
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,531
Here.

669
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,205
Okay? I'm gonna go
handle this. You just relax.

670
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,902
Is she all right?

671
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,536
That's her boy's blood.
You tell me.

672
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:56,244
The deceased woke up, joined his
guests for approximately half an hour,

673
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:00,722
returned to bed, no sign of
forced entry or physical struggle.

674
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:05,453
The Luger, found there on the
floor, heavily oiled. No prints.

675
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:10,991
He kept it in the night stand.
The slug, there.

676
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,831
And the casing, on the bed,
underneath the body.

677
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,102
You want to explain to me
how a man can shoot himself

678
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,768
and end up
on top of the shell?

679
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,438
Is this your strategy, Mr. Simo?
To impugn the laws of physics?

680
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,981
There's no prints
on the gun.

681
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,278
What, did he wipe it clean after
putting that hole in his head?

682
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,252
Prints aren't automatic. Certain
conditions have to be present.

683
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,719
Did you question
the people in the house?

684
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,222
They all signed
sworn statements.

685
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,848
Forty-five minutes
to call the cops.

686
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,587
That's plenty of time to
come up with some bogus story.

687
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,128
But you got sworn statements.
You accusing me of something?

688
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,891
Was Reeves checked
for powder burns?

689
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,263
It's a suicide shot to the
temple. Where's the burn?

690
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,529
When a gun is discharged
directly against...

691
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,934
Listen, the coroner
never checked.

692
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,699
He didn't notice the bruises
on the body, either.

693
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:54,710
Which, by the way, aren't automatic, okay?
Certain conditions have to be present.

694
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,969
Like, maybe a fight with a guy
that's about to...

695
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,645
Cause your expiration.

696
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,824
He won't be buried
in that cape.

697
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,099
Mrs. Bessolo,
RKO-Pathe would be honored

698
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,107
to help you pay for
any sort of a floral tribute

699
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,305
that you might deem
appropriate for your son.

700
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,687
Since when do suicides miss twice,
lay down a rug and start over?

701
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,487
Is that normal? Just asking.

702
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,954
That cost the studio 15 grand.

703
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,726
You think you're worth that?

704
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,156
We were just...

705
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,033
This Farmer's Daughter
picture. What is it?

706
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,797
HOWARD: The Mating Game.

707
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,569
EDDIE:
A million-dollar investment.

708
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,007
You think I'm going to let you
fuck with that?

709
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,568
You think you're
gonna be a star?

710
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,773
HOWARD: Our concern here is...
You're a face.

711
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,274
Faces change.

712
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,612
What Mr. Mannix means...

713
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,915
He knows what I mean.
Out of my sight.

714
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,293
Set something up.

715
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,029
Him and some starlet.

716
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,998
Picnic, soda pop.

717
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,506
Already arranged.

718
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,237
They treat their
contract like shit, Howard.

719
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,441
Whatever the fuck they want.

720
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,511
The business is changing.

721
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,279
Fags and television.

722
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,692
And what are we, huh?

723
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,185
The Last of the Mohicans.

724
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,622
That was a UA picture, Eddie.

725
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,837
That spic,

726
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,640
wop, prick detective.

727
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,142
I sent
Jim Engelmann over.

728
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,737
He used to work for us. I'm sure you
don't want MGM coming into it.

729
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,311
And?

730
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,508
Louis Simo.

731
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,879
Two years
with Rick Harris.

732
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,084
He shot his mouth off
about Susan Humphries

733
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,351
to Confidential for $5,000.
Harris fired him.

734
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,983
Susan Humphries?

735
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,186
Jennifer Jones type.

736
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,991
Under contract at Fox.
Heroin addict.

737
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,189
Drove off Topanga
doing 90.

738
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,529
You have a good memory,
Eddie.

739
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,330
What's the prick want?

740
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,929
Money. Press.
Whatever he can grab.

741
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,009
What's he got?

742
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,272
Some questions.

743
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,725
My wife
won't get out of bed.

744
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,397
It's been almost a week,
she won't get out.

745
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,958
I'll stop by and see her.

746
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,537
Do that. Cheer her up.

747
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,940
She always liked you.

748
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,909
Eddie.
Yeah?

749
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,311
You have anything
to tell me?

750
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,610
About what?

751
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,743
Anything I need to
have a story ready for.

752
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,896
She's not here.

753
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,057
Miss Lemmon?

754
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,660
That's interesting.

755
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,792
What is?

756
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:43,162
That you thought I wanted to talk
to her, since this is your house.

757
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,078
Is that your father?

758
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,839
My husband.

759
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,385
Oh, sorry.

760
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,688
He's a screenwriter.

761
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,825
Well, no one could blame you for wanting
to hang around people your own age.

762
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,453
What was his name again?
Robert Condon?

763
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,099
I'm sure you're just friends.

764
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,666
Around back.

765
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,947
You really ought to
prune these.

766
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:33,416
My husband does the gardening.
It takes his mind off his writing.

767
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,419
Well, what do you do,
Mrs. Van Ronkel?

768
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,893
I don't go around trying to
get my picture in the paper.

769
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,727
You saw that, huh?

770
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,096
What are you going to do when
this blows up in your face?

771
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,136
There are two holes in the bedroom
floor. What do you know about that?

772
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,102
Leonore made them.
Yeah?

773
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,201
Months ago.
Why?

774
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,244
I asked her to.

775
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,805
You asked her
to shoot a gun in the floor.

776
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,484
When you're drunk,
everything's funny.

777
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,154
He shoots himself, you all wait
45 minutes to call the police.

778
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,817
That's unusual.

779
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,390
You ever been to a party where a man
goes upstairs and blows his head off?

780
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,725
No.

781
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,265
Then how do you know
what's unusual?

782
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,760
So how do I find
Miss Lemmon?

783
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,169
She's not the way
you think she is.

784
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,834
Yeah?
What way is she?

785
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,742
She was only
looking for love.

786
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,680
I just want to remember
that one. That's good.

787
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,854
That's nice,
it's very futuristic.

788
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,196
Hey, you're a detective,
right?

789
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,356
Yeah.

790
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,868
So, men hire you to find out what their
wives are up to, that sort of thing?

791
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,334
Yeah, they do that.

792
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,830
Does the truth
make them happier?

793
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,266
Hardly ever.

794
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,240
You know, he wasn't
going to marry her.

795
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,141
Reeves?
Mmm-hmm.

796
