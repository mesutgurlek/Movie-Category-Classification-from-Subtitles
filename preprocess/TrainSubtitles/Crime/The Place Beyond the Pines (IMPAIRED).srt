yourself again, or not?

00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:57,796

is make ourselves known, right?

707

making yourself known.

as we were trained, correct.

714
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,903

make entry, and I kicked the door down.

Was then. Was the door locked?
Correct.

716

717
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:27,784
What do you mean?

718
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,507

the door was locked?

719
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,663

it was locked.

No.
Okay.

725
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,177

Right.

726
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,805

I'm sorry, why did
I come down here?

728

a hard time looking at your son

within the division

01:36:40,212 --> 01:36:41,630
You don't like them girls?

1389
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:45,509
I don't know,
maybe you're just used to it.

1390
01:36:45,593 --> 01:36:48,846
They ain't got girls like that
where I come from. You feel me?

1391
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:50,431
Where are you from?

1392
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:51,932
Troy.

Yeah, you heard of Troy?

1394
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:57,646
Yeah, I've heard of Troy.
Where's Troy at?

1395
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,356
It's fucking
right next door, dude.

around here, dude.

1402
01:37:15,122 --> 01:37:16,790
I've been here for, like,
fucking three days,

1403

my fucking mind.

No, we got some things.

1408
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:28,594
What?

1409
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:30,721
Don't say, like, a mall.

1410
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:34,141

like, I swear to God...

LAWYER: Yes, please, Your Honor.

In regards
to my client's status,

1524
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:02,571
there has been a discussion
with the District Attorney.

1525
01:44:02,654 --> 01:44:04,990
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case potentially resolved today.

1526
01:44:05,073 --> 01:44:07,242
So I'd ask that the court
put it on for second call.

01:44:07,326 --> 01:44:08,368
JUDGE: Second call.

1528
01:44:08,452 --> 01:44:09,703
LAWYER: This is a C felony,

1529
01:44:09,786 --> 01:44:12,831
so Jason could do anywhere
between five and 15 years.

But I'm getting the impression
from the prosecutor

1531
01:44:15,459 --> 01:44:18,253
that they may be willing to
reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

1532
01:44:18,337 --> 01:44:21,965
The offer on his particular
case would be time served,

which is the day
he spent in jail,

1534
01:44:23,383 --> 01:44:25,093
and a fine,
and that would be it.

1535
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:27,304
Can he come home with us today?
He can.
