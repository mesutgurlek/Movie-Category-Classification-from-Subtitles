helping us find Megan.

936
01:22:09,226 --> 01:22:11,751
You know
what I see, Mac?

937
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:15,162
Someone was onto Soneji
long before we ever heard of him.

938
01:22:15,232 --> 01:22:17,496
Look at this.
What do you see?

939
01:22:17,568 --> 01:22:20,162
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

940
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:23,866
Mac. He could have shut this
whole place down from right there.

941
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:27,308
Now. You wanna tell me
why he didn't?

942
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:34,578
[Quietly] Good God.
Devine was in on it with him.

943
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:37,381
Then. When Soneji hit the embassy.
He pulled a double cross.

944
01:22:37,454 --> 01:22:39,388
He ran his own ransom.

945
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:42,823
No. Soneji was a loner.

946
01:22:42,893 --> 01:22:44,952
An accomplice would have
been beneath him.

947
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:47,690
I'll tell you
what happened.

948
01:22:47,765 --> 01:22:50,495
Soneji was hoodwinked.

949
01:22:52,236 --> 01:22:55,015
And so were we.

950
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:58,549
Details are still emerging.
But this much is clear:

951
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:02,020
The manunt that began over a
week ago in the natiors capitol...

952
01:23:02,089 --> 01:23:04,387
- came to a violent end yesterday,
- [Clattering]

953
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:07,222
With the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji.

954
01:23:40,227 --> 01:23:42,388
[Jezzie]
Don't move.

955
01:23:42,462 --> 01:23:45,158
Turn around.
Hands on the wall. Feet apart.

956
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,166
Hi. Jez.
Where'd you come from?

957
01:23:47,234 --> 01:23:50,101
You know something. Devine.
You're pretty stupid.

958
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,104
Your car in the driveway.

959
01:23:52,172 --> 01:23:55,573
TV so loud. You wouldn't be able
to hear a SWAT team come in.

960
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:58,133
- What are you doing...
- Shut up!

961
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:06,611
[Both Laughing]

962
01:24:14,394 --> 01:24:16,658
Where's Megan?

963
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:19,597
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up.

964
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:21,861
I don't think she knew
I took her off the boat.

965
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:24,995
She's still alive? You were
supposed to dump her in the river...

966
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:29,202
- after you got the diamonds.
- Yeah. Well.

967
01:24:29,276 --> 01:24:33,269
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

968
01:24:33,346 --> 01:24:36,144
Anyway. Today. Tomorrow. It's still
gonna look like Soneji killed her.

969
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:39,151
She can't die
after Soneji. You idiot.

970
01:24:39,219 --> 01:24:42,677
It doesn't make any difference.
They're never gonna find the body.

971
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:51,454
Okay. I'll go do it now.
Will that make you happy?

972
01:24:51,531 --> 01:24:55,661
Yeah. It would. Wait!

973
01:24:59,306 --> 01:25:01,399
Can I see them?

974
01:25:16,723 --> 01:25:18,953
Hey. Do you realize
we spent an entire year...

975
01:25:19,025 --> 01:25:22,517
following Soneji's
every move?

976
01:25:22,596 --> 01:25:24,996
I think
we deserve these.

977
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:33,200
That beats the hell out of
a Secret Service pension. Huh?

978
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:37,535
Profiling the profiler.

979
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:40,011
Kidnap from the kidnapper.
That's brilliant.

980
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,379
You are a genius. Jez.

981
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,647
Genius has nothing to do with it.
I'm just good at what I do.

982
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:53,118
Didrt hurt that everyone else
involved was a complete half-wit.

983
01:25:53,193 --> 01:25:55,593
You think Alex Cross
is a half-wit?

984
01:25:55,662 --> 01:25:59,359
You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

985
01:25:59,432 --> 01:26:03,801
Cross pulled the trigger because
he knew Soneji didn't have Megan.

986
01:26:05,672 --> 01:26:07,606
What are you saying?

987
01:26:07,674 --> 01:26:11,075
I'm saying that sooner or later.
He's gonna figure it out.

988
01:26:11,144 --> 01:26:13,612
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

989
01:26:15,382 --> 01:26:17,373
He's onto us already.
Isn't he?

990
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:20,544
No. He's not onto us.

991
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:25,253
But I think
he's onto you.

992

[Computer Beeps]

994
01:28:09,429 --> 01:28:12,887
It's Turkish. My daddy won it
in a game of poker.

995
01:28:12,966 --> 01:28:15,958
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

Megan. It's me. Honey.

Jezzie. Jezzie.
I'm in here! Jezzie!

Open up. Honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

1004
01:30:12,455 --> 01:30:15,185
Yeah. Sure.
Just hold on a second.

What happened
to that other guy?

1008
01:30:30,573 --> 01:30:34,134
He's dead. Megan.
You're safe now.

1009
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:37,043
Open up.

- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,143
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

1012
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:51,554
Megan. It's me. Don't be
scared of me. Open the door.

1013
01:30:56,766 --> 01:30:59,894

one more time to open the door.

how-how did you. Um...

1032

Aces and eights. Jezzie.

1033
01:34:28,244 --> 01:34:31,805
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

1034
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:33,815
I watched the tapes.

1035
01:34:33,883 --> 01:34:38,684
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

1036
01:34:38,754 --> 01:34:41,689
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

1037
01:34:41,757 --> 01:34:44,191
But you had
a different agenda.

You know something. Alex?

1039
01:34:47,463 --> 01:34:49,556
When you said.
"You do what you are."

1040
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:52,157
You were right.

1041
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:55,362
I'm living proof.

1042
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,130
Put the gun down. Jezzie.

Would you kill
another partner?

That is nice.

1392

My daddy won it in a game
of poker. Aces and eights.

1393
02:10:16,951 --> 02:10:20,318

1394
02:10:20,388 --> 02:10:23,516
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

Do you know of any relationship
between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

1397
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:40,234
Amy? No way.
Why do you ask?

1398
02:10:40,308 --> 02:10:43,675
He strangled her.

1399
02:10:43,745 --> 02:10:46,612
It's an act of passion.

1400
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:49,616
It's a demonstration
of will.

1401
02:10:49,684 --> 02:10:52,175
A message.

1402

Take me seriously.
What do you see?

- Dr. Cross...
- Alex.

1404
02:10:59,427 --> 02:11:02,726
Alex. Womars intuition.
Third eye. Sixth sense...

I don't have it.

Sure you do. You just
don't look at it right.

1407
02:11:06,934 --> 02:11:08,925
Every face has two aspects.

1408
02:11:09,003 --> 02:11:12,632
Now try looking at it down
the middle. One side at a time.

1409
02:11:12,707 --> 02:11:15,073
Would you say this man
was confident?

1410

- Yeah.
- Narcissistic?

1411

- Ever see any flashes of hatred?

- No. No. No!
- Anger? Hostility?

1413

Look. Everything about him
was right.

1414
02:11:30,391 --> 02:11:34,555
He was always patient. He was
pleasant. He had a sense of humor.

1415
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:37,962
I mean. He was
the perfect teacher.

1422

I see that you're about
to start an argument.

1423

I need to help get her back.

1424

I want a partner?

1425
02:12:14,869 --> 02:12:17,167
- You don't. I can understand that.
- That's right.

1426
02:12:17,238 --> 02:12:20,366
- No. You can't.
- Can I tell you why I don't care?

1427
02:12:23,311 --> 02:12:25,245
Shoot.

1428
02:12:28,583 --> 02:12:33,748
Look. When I was
assigned to Cathedral.

1429
02:12:33,821 --> 02:12:35,812
It was a job
I didn't want.

1430
02:12:35,890 --> 02:12:39,519
It's a far cry from working
rope lines or flying Air Force One.

But I have been there
for three years.

I have been responsible
for Megan for three years.

And that little girl means
more to me than even a partner.

1434
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,966
Can you understand that?

1435
02:12:55,343 --> 02:12:57,743
I suppose so.

1436
02:12:59,514 --> 02:13:04,144
Even if I say no. You'll probably
follow me around wherever I go.

1437
02:13:06,487 --> 02:13:10,321
So. If it's a choice between
having you as a partner...

1438
02:13:10,391 --> 02:13:16,057
or as a stalker. I guess I'll
take my chances with a partner.

Oh. When you find Soneji.
Ask him for the password.

1468
02:15:29,764 --> 02:15:33,200
He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

2005
03:06:00,212 --> 03:06:03,613
Details are still emerging.
But this much is clear:

2006
03:06:03,682 --> 03:06:07,083
The manunt that began over a
week ago in the natiors capitol...

2007
03:06:07,152 --> 03:06:09,450
- came to a violent end yesterday,
- [Clattering]

2008
03:06:09,521 --> 03:06:12,285
With the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji.

2009
03:06:45,290 --> 03:06:47,451
[Jezzie]
Don't move.

2010
03:06:47,526 --> 03:06:50,222
Turn around.
Hands on the wall. Feet apart.

2011
03:06:50,295 --> 03:06:52,229
Hi. Jez.
Where'd you come from?

2012
03:06:52,297 --> 03:06:55,164
You know something. Devine.
You're pretty stupid.

2013
03:06:55,233 --> 03:06:57,167
Your car in the driveway.

2014
03:06:57,235 --> 03:07:00,636
TV so loud. You wouldn't be able
to hear a SWAT team come in.

2015
03:07:00,705 --> 03:07:03,196
- What are you doing...
- Shut up!

2016
03:07:09,548 --> 03:07:11,675
[Both Laughing]

2017
03:07:19,457 --> 03:07:21,721
Where's Megan?

2018
03:07:21,793 --> 03:07:24,660
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up.

2019
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:26,924
I don't think she knew
I took her off the boat.

2020
03:07:26,998 --> 03:07:30,058
She's still alive? You were
supposed to dump her in the river...

2021
03:07:30,135 --> 03:07:34,265
- after you got the diamonds.
- Yeah. Well.

2022
03:07:34,339 --> 03:07:38,332
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

2023
03:07:38,410 --> 03:07:41,208
Anyway. Today. Tomorrow. It's still
gonna look like Soneji killed her.

2024
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:44,214
She can't die
after Soneji. You idiot.

2025
03:07:44,282 --> 03:07:47,740
It doesn't make any difference.
They're never gonna find the body.

2026
03:07:52,490 --> 03:07:56,517
Okay. I'll go do it now.
Will that make you happy?

2027
03:07:56,595 --> 03:08:00,725
Yeah. It would. Wait!

2028
03:08:04,369 --> 03:08:06,462
Can I see them?

2029
03:08:21,786 --> 03:08:24,016
Hey. Do you realize
we spent an entire year...

2030
03:08:24,089 --> 03:08:27,581
following Soneji's
every move?

2031
03:08:27,659 --> 03:08:30,059
I think
we deserve these.

2032
03:08:34,566 --> 03:08:38,263
That beats the hell out of
a Secret Service pension. Huh?

2033
03:08:39,504 --> 03:08:42,598
Profiling the profiler.

2034
03:08:42,674 --> 03:08:45,074
Kidnap from the kidnapper.
That's brilliant.

2035
03:08:45,143 --> 03:08:48,442
You are a genius. Jez.

2036
03:08:48,513 --> 03:08:51,710
Genius has nothing to do with it.
I'm just good at what I do.

2037
03:08:55,053 --> 03:08:58,181
Didrt hurt that everyone else
involved was a complete half-wit.

2038
03:08:58,256 --> 03:09:00,656
You think Alex Cross
is a half-wit?

2039
03:09:00,725 --> 03:09:04,422
You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

2040
03:09:04,496 --> 03:09:08,865
Cross pulled the trigger because
he knew Soneji didn't have Megan.

2041
03:09:10,735 --> 03:09:12,669
What are you saying?

2042
03:09:12,737 --> 03:09:16,138
I'm saying that sooner or later.
He's gonna figure it out.

2043
03:09:16,207 --> 03:09:18,675
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

2044
03:09:20,445 --> 03:09:22,436
He's onto us already.
Isn't he?

2045
03:09:22,514 --> 03:09:25,608
No. He's not onto us.

2046
03:09:27,085 --> 03:09:30,316
But I think
he's onto you.

2047
03:10:03,054 --> 03:10:04,487
[Beeps]

2048
03:10:08,893 --> 03:10:11,088
[Computer Beeps]

2049
03:11:14,492 --> 03:11:17,950
It's Turkish. My daddy won it
in a game of poker.

2050
03:11:18,029 --> 03:11:21,021
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

2051
03:11:30,308 --> 03:11:32,003
[Beeps]

2052
03:12:23,294 --> 03:12:25,228
[Straining]

2053
03:13:04,002 --> 03:13:06,368
Megan?

2054
03:13:06,437 --> 03:13:08,496
Megan. It's me. Honey.

2055
03:13:08,573 --> 03:13:10,578
Jezzie?

2056
03:13:10,578 --> 03:13:11,510
Jezzie?

2057
03:13:11,579 --> 03:13:14,639
Jezzie. Jezzie.
I'm in here! Jezzie!

2058
03:13:14,715 --> 03:13:17,445
Open up. Honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

2059
03:13:17,518 --> 03:13:20,248
Yeah. Sure.
Just hold on a second.

2060
03:13:20,321 --> 03:13:22,255
[Straining]

2061
03:13:26,994 --> 03:13:30,327
- Jezzie?
- Yeah. Honey.

2062
03:13:30,398 --> 03:13:33,094
What happened
to that other guy?

2063
03:13:35,636 --> 03:13:39,197
He's dead. Megan.
You're safe now.

2064
03:13:39,273 --> 03:13:42,106
Open up.

2065
03:13:42,176 --> 03:13:45,577
- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

2066
03:13:45,646 --> 03:13:48,206
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

2067
03:13:52,453 --> 03:13:56,617
Megan. It's me. Don't be
scared of me. Open the door.

2068
03:14:01,829 --> 03:14:04,957
Megan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time to open the door.

2069
03:14:05,032 --> 03:14:07,557
- Right now. Open the door!
- [Kicks Door]

2070
03:14:07,635 --> 03:14:10,160
Megan, open the door
for me.

2071
03:14:10,237 --> 03:14:12,705
Listen to me!
Open the door!

2072
03:14:12,773 --> 03:14:15,674
- [Kicking Door]
- Megan. Open the fucking door!

2073
03:14:15,743 --> 03:14:19,008
Open it, bitch!

2074
03:14:20,481 --> 03:14:22,711
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]

2075
03:14:24,785 --> 03:14:27,913
Stop it! No!
[Screams]

2076
03:14:27,989 --> 03:14:29,923
Stop it!

2077
03:14:34,228 --> 03:14:36,162
[Breathing Heavily]

2078
03:14:45,773 --> 03:14:47,934
[Whimpering]

2079
03:15:39,794 --> 03:15:41,728
That was very clever.
Megan.

2080
03:15:49,837 --> 03:15:52,567
[Straining,
Whimpering]

2081
03:16:24,071 --> 03:16:27,131
- [Muffled Screams]
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

2082
03:17:10,584 --> 03:17:12,916
Jezzie?

2083
03:17:16,390 --> 03:17:18,858
It's over.

2084
03:17:18,926 --> 03:17:20,860
Drop the gun.

2085
03:17:24,765 --> 03:17:26,699
Alex...

2086
03:17:28,903 --> 03:17:30,837
how-how did you. Um...

2087
03:17:30,905 --> 03:17:33,237
Aces and eights. Jezzie.

2088
03:17:33,307 --> 03:17:36,868
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

2089
03:17:36,944 --> 03:17:38,878
I watched the tapes.

2090
03:17:38,946 --> 03:17:43,747
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

2091
03:17:43,817 --> 03:17:46,752
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

2092
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:49,254
But you had
a different agenda.

2093
03:17:49,323 --> 03:17:52,451
You know something. Alex?

2094
03:17:52,526 --> 03:17:54,619
When you said.
"You do what you are."

2095
03:17:54,695 --> 03:17:57,220
You were right.

2096
03:17:57,298 --> 03:18:00,426
I'm living proof.

2097
03:18:01,702 --> 03:18:04,193
Put the gun down. Jezzie.

2098
03:18:09,977 --> 03:18:13,276
Would you kill
another partner?

2099
03:18:13,347 --> 03:18:16,077
You're not my partner.

2100
03:18:23,390 --> 03:18:25,722
[Whimpering]

2101
03:19:31,191 --> 03:19:33,352
Are you all right?

2102
03:19:35,929 --> 03:19:38,124
You're a very brave girl.
Megan.

2103
03:19:38,198 --> 03:19:41,292
Who are you?

2104
03:19:41,368 --> 03:19:44,303
I'm a policeman.

2105
03:19:47,474 --> 03:19:50,409
My name is Alex Cross.

2106
03:19:50,477 --> 03:19:53,037
I'm a friend
of your parents.

2107
03:19:56,650 --> 03:19:58,880
Can you take me to them?

2108
03:20:00,353 --> 03:20:03,083
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

2109
03:20:06,793 --> 03:20:10,593
Could you...
Ah. Thanks.
