00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,040
- She's gonna kiII me. I'm dead.
- Calm down, Ernie.
Gotta do this to break it in.

733
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,440
- Your mom wiII thank you for it.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

734
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,440
- He's stepping on my mom's groceries !
- SIap him across the face. He'II stop.

735
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,960
Ugh ! Ugh !

736
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,840
- [ Scott ] AII right. What is that ?
- [ Dave ] It's a black CadiIIac.

737
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,240
What is the Iicence plate ?
I can see the car.

738
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
Uh, wait. P-K-I. P-K-I.

739
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,080
- Okay, P-K-I--
- No. "B."

740
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,440
- No. It's P-K-I.
- It's a "B."
- B-K-I.

741
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,760
- Shut up !
- Shut up, Ernie !

742
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,640
- P-K-I.
- P-K-I.

743
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,920
- R-K-I-5-4-7.
- R-K-I-5-4-7.

744
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,040
- AII right, that's right. R-K-I-5-4-7.
- Romeo, Kilo, India, 5-4-7.

745
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,440
AII right, hang on, hang on.
He saw us ! He saw us ! Come on !

746
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,560
Come on, come on, come on.

747
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,440
- Which way ? Which way ?
- I think he went right.

748
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,840
- Right, right ! I'm sure it's right.
- WeII, don't guess !

749
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,640
It's right, okay ?

750
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,440
Go right ! Right !

751
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,240
Highway Patrol hears about that,
I'm out of a job before I even start !

752
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,640
Hey, Turner, don't worry about it.
It'II be our Iittle secret.

753
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,640
What's the matter with your mom ?
She can't get a car with some muscle ?

754
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,480
WeII ! You boys really
Iivened up the reception.

755
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,840
The bride burst into tears
and swore...

756
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,240
she was gonna have nightmares the rest
of her Iife because of that dog.

757
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,920
Fortunately Boyett thought you
were trying to capture the beast.

758
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,640
The mayor did too. I, of course, did not
teII them it was your runaway pet...

759
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,640
that had now become
the station mascot.

760
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,440
Don't raise your voice
around him Iike that.

761
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,240
- You'II just set him off again.
- Aw, come on.

762
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,640
- He's chained to a radiator.
- That doesn't matter.

763
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,640
Zack Gregory is a former Marine
with three arrests on his record:

764
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,840
Assault with a deadly weapon,
transportation of unregistered
firearms, and extortion.

765
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,000
No convictions. Monterey P.D. says that
address and phone number were false.

766
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,040
- WeII, who is he ?
- The guy Hooch was just chasing--

767
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,880
- The man he saw kiII Amos Reed.
- [ Fart ]

768
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,040
- You're kidding. Think this is the guy?
- Yeah.

769
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,600
[ Sniffing ]

770
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,560
- What ?
- Gee.

771
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,920
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Sniffs ]

772
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,440
- Congratulations. You broke the case.
- WeII, we don't have him yet.

773
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,040
Yeah.
There's, uh, no motive, Howard.

774
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Amos wasn't kiIIed in a robbery
or a pattern crime, or in a fight.

775
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,840
- [ Sniffs ]
- We think maybe he was kiIIed
to cover something up.

776
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,960
- [ Coughs ]
- This, uh--

777
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,120
This Zack guy is employed
by Boyett Seafood.

778
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,840
Now, Amos was always complaining about
strange noises down there at night.

779
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,440
- Like something iIIegal was going on.
- Hmm. Katie, could you...

780
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,840
swing the door open, please ?
We're gonna need some air in here.

781
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,240
Amos complained
about everything, Turner.

782
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,600
Yeah, and now he's dead, Howard.

783
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,640
I think we need to assume
that he was right.

784
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,440
Now consider it.
It's an isolated spot down there.

785
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,840
There's fishing boats coming in
and going out aII the time.

786
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,640
Now somebody's kiIIed ?

787
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,040
Drugs, Howard.
I know we don't have the personnel,

788
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,440
and we'll never have a warrant
with the stuff that we have so far,

789
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,800
but it sure would be nice
if we could search that place.

790
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,840
Yeah, aII right.
I guess I can handle that.

791
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,840
I mean, Boyett's a friend of mine.
What's he gonna say, no ?

792
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,720
Yeah. D.E.A. agents,

793
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,120
Customs guys, the C.H.P.,

794
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,440
two shifts of our own guys,
plus aII sorts of Iocal cops.

795
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,640
This is gonna be the biggest search
in the central coast since--

796
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,240
What ? Since probably World War II,
and it's aII because of you.

797
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,240
We're gonna go through Boyett's
Iike bacon through a duck...

798
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,640
and bust us a smuggling operation.

799
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,360
This is dessert.

800
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,120
Chocolate chip cookies.
Chocolate chip.

801
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,320
Something to drink ?

802
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,760
It's not gonna hurt me at aII
if we impress some of those C.H.P. guys.

803
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,840
That's gonna Iook good on the resum.

804
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,240
Give me maybe a Iittle job security
in the future.

805
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,040
Nothin' wrong with that.

806
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,640
There you go.

807
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,840
WeII, come on.
You're not eating. Go ahead.

808
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,240
Go ahead.
This is a celebration, Hooch.

809
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,640
You I.D.'d Zack Gregory.
Amos's murder is aII but solved.

810
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,360
So go.

811
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,240
- Open your beer.
- [ Sniffing ]

812
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,240
What ?
You're thinking about Amos ?

813
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,320
Huh ?
You must miss him.

814
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,360
Yeah, weII,

815
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,240
I forget sometimes that
this must be pretty hard on you.

816
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,360
Everything's so different.

817
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,440
You and I got off
to a pretty bad start,

818
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,880
and my place isn't exactly
a rusty shack fiIIed with junk.

819
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,120
Not yet, anyway.
You can keep working on it.

820
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,840
Okay ?

821
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,800
Hmm ?

822
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,720
- You Iike that ?
- [ Grunts ]

823
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,400
You Iike that ?

824
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,600
[ Grunts ]

825
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,920
You do !
You Iike that.

826
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,640
WeII, here.
Let me do this side as weII.

827
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,440
Huh ? Huh ?

828
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,120
You're not so rough.

829
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,520
- You're not so mean.
- [ Growling ]

830
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,480
You're not any kind
of a monster dog, are ya ?

831
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,880
Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh !

832
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,920
Look at that face. Look at those
big teeth. What are you doing ?

833
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,320
Give me back my towel.
Give it to me.

834
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,080
[ Both Growling ]

835
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,320
- AII right then ! Come on !
- [ Barking ]

836
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,120
- [ Barking ]
- Come on ! Come get this thing !

837
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,040
Get it ! Ha ! Ha-ha !

838
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,000
I got it !

839
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,080
Oh, yeah ! Yeah !

840
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,600
I'm coming right now for you !

841
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,320
WeII, if any of my employees
are involved in anything iIIegal,
I'm happy to cooperate.

842
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,320
- I just don't understand it.
- When was the Iast time
you saw Zack Gregory ?

843
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Yesterday at the wedding.
He didn't show up for work Iast night.

844
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,120
WeII, the Monterey police
checked out his address.

845
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,080
It was a motel,
and they'd never heard of him.

846
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,080
He shows up for his pay cheque,
I'II caII you.

847
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,920
AII right, let's go, guys !
Come on !

848
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,520
I don't want any Sheriff's Department
guys handling this stuff alone.

849
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,920
Let's make sure one of our guys
is with them aII the way.

850
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,280
- Gee, I hate fish.
- [ Chattering ]

851
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,840
Okay.
Let's check in the back.

852
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,560
[ Chattering Continues ]

853
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,440
Move these filing cabinets out,

854
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,120
- then go through these one by one.
- [ Chattering Continues ]

855
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,640
Maybe we came on the wrong day.

856
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,680
Howard, I apologize.
I'm sorry.

857
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,520
- I really let you down.
- Come on.

858
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,160
Forget it. Can't expect things
to pan out every time, can you ?

859
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,520
Besides, you got a new job
waiting for you.

860
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,920
Why don't you go home
and pack up and get ready.

861
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,160
David, the case is now yours.

862
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,720
Foster, the guys in Monterey told me...

863
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,520
you sheriffs did
the original go-see on Zack Gregory,

864
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,920
but the D.M.V. says they sent
his vehicle registration...

865
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,880
on the black CadiIIac
to the Lazy Acres motel.

866
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,920
So I'm just trying to determine how you
discovered that it was a false address.

867
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,000
What did you do,
just caII them up on the phone ?

868
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,920
You didn't even go down
for an interview ?

869
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,200
You didn't show them a photo ?

870
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,040
WeII, aII right, Iook,
I need surveiIIance done...

871
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,520
on the Lazy Acres motel
to Iocate Zack Gregory.

872
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,200
Yes. He's the prime suspect
in the Amos Reed murder, that's why.

873
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,520
Yes, he is.
He is Iegitimate.

874
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,800
I have an eyewitness, kind of.

875
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,720
I am not teIIing you
how to do your job.

876
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,720
I am a Iaw enforcement officer,
and you are too, kind of,
