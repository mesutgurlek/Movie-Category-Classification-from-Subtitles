How was everything?

00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,304
Real good honey, thanks.

3
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,227
Let me have a pack of
Kools too, would you?

4
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,157
Real nice smile you got there.

5
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,160
Thank you.

Hi, are you going to the city?

00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,695
Sure.

Becky.

Hello Otis.

25
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,698
Well, how are you?

26
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,949
Good.

27
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:30,950
It's good to see you.

28
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,531
Good to see you, too.

29
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,708
You got all your things?

30
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,750
Yeah.

31
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,290
You look terrible.

32
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,553
Okay, come on let's go.

33
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,677
It's this way.

34
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,645
Before you got
married I told you

35
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,605
Leroy was no damn good.

36
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,484
That he was trash

37
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,656
and he'd always be trash

38
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,530
and you was going to catch
it and you did didn't you?

39
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,986
I don't really want to
talk about him right now.

40
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,242
Okay by me, we don't
have to talk about it now.

41
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,039
We don't have to
talk about it ever.

42
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,209
How long are you
going to be up here?

43
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,330
It's hard to say.

44
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,285
What about Lurleen?

45
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,541
How long can you
leave her with mama?

46
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,997
I don't know.

47
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,423
I'm going to get a job,

48
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,249
make some money.

49
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,296
Maybe bring her up here,

50
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,592
I don't know.

51
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,544
Where did you tell
Leroy you were going?

52
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,004
I don't want
to talk about him.

53
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him!

54
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,094
You hungry?

55
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,053
Yeah.

56
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,605
Good, I'm hungry too.

57
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,476
You think Leroy's hungry?

58
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,647
Do you want some more coffee?

59
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,947
Yeah, thanks.

60
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,149
Here.

61
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,125
So what kind of work do you
planning on getting up here?

62
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,296
Anything like...

63
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,999
I haven't decided yet.

64
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,176
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

65
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,594
Don't start with me Otis.

66
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
I can do lots
of things mister.

67
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,926
Oh yea, like what?

68
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,508
Like waitressing

69
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,717
or a beautician.

70
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,767
Yeah.

71
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,892
After seeing you I might
just try brain surgery.

72
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,809
You're a card.

73
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,144
Yeah, I'm the queen.

74
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,900
Yeah, the queen of clubs.

75
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,490
Don't make me
sorry I came here, Otis.

I brought you a present.

Where did you get that?

a bother, we'll change.

00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,745
I always did hate doing this.

175
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,795
I'll do it.

176
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,497
That's alright.

177
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,091
Where did you say you met him?

178
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
Who?

179
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,384
You know who, Henry.

180
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,140
What do you want to know for?

181
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
I don't know.

182
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,979
I'm just curious.

183
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,151
Van Dalia.

184
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,523
Van Dalia?

185
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,856
Sure, Van Dalia.

186
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh.

187
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,241
What was he in for?

188
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,069
You don't want to know.

189
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,120
What did he do, kill his mama?

190
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,117
Uh- huh.

191
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,198
Come on, what was he in for?

192
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,204
You don't want to know.

193
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,002
What did he do,
rob a bank or something?

194
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,455
You were right the first time.

195
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,334
Huh?

196
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,504
You were right the first time.

197
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,052
He killed his mama.

198
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,346
Don't you ever
tell him I told you.

199
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,468
You're kidding me?

200
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,343
No, I ain't.

201
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,265
Yes you are.

202
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,759
Alright, I'm kidding you.

203
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,095
Just don't ever
tell him I told you.

204
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,101
He killed his mama?

205
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,306
With a baseball bat.

206
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,108
Her and one of her boyfriends.

207
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,401
I swear if you ever
tell him I told you

208
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,150
I'll beat your ass right off.

209
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,400
How do you know all this?

210
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,107
He told me, that's how I know.

211
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,237
How else would I know?

212
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,408
Were you cellmates
or something?

213
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,328
No, we were friends.

214
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,655
When did he get out?

215
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,161
A couple of years before me.

216
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,540
<i>(Door opening)</i>

217
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,550
Hi.

218
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,422
I got some business
I got to take care of.

219
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,214
You going out?

220
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,628
Yeah, for a while,

221
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,710
I got to run an
errand for a fellow.

222
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,592
You want to come along Henry?

223
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,469
No, you go ahead.

224
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,095
Okay.

225
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,676
See you later.

226
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,111
Want to play cards?

227
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,236


228
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,047
What was your daddy like?

229
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,750
My daddy?

230
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,085
He used to drive a truck

231
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,014
before he got
his legs cut off.

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,056
I remember one time,

233
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,181
he brought me and my
little brother home bicycles.

234
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,557
He had delivered some that day

235
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,389
and he had a couple left over.

236
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,726
But, mine was
way too big for me,

237
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,855
and my brother

238
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,938
he couldn't ride his anyway.

239
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,864
Daddy, he said
I'd grow into it,

240
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,067
but, I never did.

241
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,073
Why not?

242
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,369
I never got the chance,

243
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,322
they sold it.

244
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,248
They sold them both.

245
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,917
So you have a brother?

246
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,792
My brother,

247
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,757
he had a bone disorder.

248
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,257
He was a little deformed.

249
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,135
What happened to him?

250
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,057
He died.

251
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,355
I can't ever remember

252
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,273
really liking my daddy.

253
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,225
I wanted to,

254
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,403
I really did.

255
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,230
One time he bought me,

256
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,157
when I was about five,

257
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,406
he bought me an ice cream cone

258
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,113
and I dropped it.

259
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,197
And he slapped me

260
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,705
and made me
pick it up and eat it.

261
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,381
I never liked my daddy.

262
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,082
One time,

263
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,088
when my momma was at work,

264
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,340
and I was about 13,

265
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,341
he come into my room

266
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,141
and he told me to
take my shirt off

267
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,436
'cause he wanted to see
how I was developed.

268
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,512
And when I wouldn't

269
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,565
he got real mad and he hit me.

270
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
And he told me he had a right

271
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,317
because he was my daddy

272
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,020
and I was his daughter

273
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,696
and he fed me

274
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,444
and let me live in his house

275
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,244
and he could do
whatever he wanted.

276
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,743
And he did.

277
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,699
Then he started coming
into my room a lot,

278
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,376
after that.

279
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,452
And I didn't fight him

280
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,915
because when
I did he just hit me.

281
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,002
I was afraid I was
going to have a baby

282
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,963
and that my baby
would be deformed

283
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,298
but, I never got pregnant.

284
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,432
I tried to tell mama,

285
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,391
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

286
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,975
She pretended
not to believe me

287
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,311
but I knew she did.

288
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,403
It sure is good to talk...

289
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,406
to talk to you Henry,

290
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,281
because I know

291
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,325
you're not judgmental

292
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,532
or anything like that.

293
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,537
I never would have married
Leroy in the first place

294
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,749
if I hadn't wanted to get
away from daddy so bad.

295
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,425
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?

296
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,934
Did you really kill your mama?

297
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,227
What?

298
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,691
Did you really kill your mama?

299
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,145
I guess I did.

300
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,107
How did it happen?

301
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,942
I stabbed her.

302
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,325
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

303
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,406
Otis said that?

304
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,662
Yeah.

305
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,962
Well, he's mistaken.

306
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,914
Well, don't tell
him I told you,

307
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,467
he made me promise.

308
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,592
She must have
treated you real bad.

309
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,683
She was a whore.

310
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:36,017
My mama was a whore.

311
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,569
But I don't
fault her for that.

312
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,566
It ain't what she done

313
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,818
it's how she done it.

314
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,159
As long as I can remember

315
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,785
she'd be bringing
men up to the house.

316
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,115
My daddy was there too

317
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:56,045
but it didn't
matter none to her.

318
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,499
She'd make me watch it.

319
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,504
That's creepy.

320
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,463
She beat me too, a lot.

321
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,221
She beat me when
I wouldn't watch it.

322
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,098
And sometime she'd beat me

323
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,600
make me wear a dress

324
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,684
and watch her doing it.

325
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,019
And then they'd laugh at me.

326
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,525
She made you wear a dress?

327
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,732
You think I'm lying?

328
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,205
I feel like I know you.

329
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,534
Like I've known
you for a long time.

330
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,916
I feel like I've known
you for ever and ever.

331
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,755
Yeah...

332
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,302
I killed my mama...

333
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,599
One night,

334
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,057
It was my 14th birthday

335
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,768
and she was drunk and,

336
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,730
we had an argument.

337
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,568
She hit me with
a whiskey bottle.

338
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,652
And I shot her.

339
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,660
I shot her dead.

340
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,162
I thought you said
you stabbed her?

341
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,374
Oh yeah.

342
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,588
That's right.

343
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,923
I stabbed her.

344
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,599
<i>(Door opening)</i>

345
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,275
Hey.

346
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,699
Anything good on TV?

347
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,754
I got a job today.

348
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,464
Oh yeah?

349
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,305
Doing what?

350
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,550
At a beauty parlor.

351
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,554
A beauty parlor?

352
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,135
I'm a shampoo girl.

353
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,310
What's that?

354
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,808
What's it sound
like, you dummy?

355
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,730
How the hell should I know?

356
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,599
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?

357
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,150
I give shampoos,

358
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,442
a woman gets her
hair shampooed

359
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,485
before she gets it cut

360
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,689
and I do it.

361
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,364
They pay you for that?

362
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,817
Of course they do.

363
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,322
Besides I used to
do it some back home

364
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,903
after I met Leroy.

365
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,205
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

366
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,500
Don't start with me Otis.

367
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,827
You used to dance naked?

368
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,503
Sure, all the time
around the house.

369
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,750
Otis.

370
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,251
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.

371
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,208
You never.

372
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,795
Were you really a dancer?

373
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,130
I danced some,

374
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,840
in a club,

375
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,891
and I wasn't naked.

376
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,685
I wore a costume.

377
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,763
But I guess it
wasn't very much.

378
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,893
Oh.

379
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,395
When you gonna dance for us?

380
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,025
When the pope
pees in his hat, Otis.

381
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,650
Ain't she got a mouth on her?

382
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,902
I better have something on me

383
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,858
to defend me
from a pig like you.

384
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:55,909
<i>(Making pig sounds)</i>

385
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,361
Otis.

386
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,453
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.

387
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,250
Thank you Henry.

388
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,626
At least there's one
gentleman at this table.

389
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,796
Oh, I'm sorry honey,

390
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,169
now don't get mad.

391
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,842
I was just having
a little fun with you,

392
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,840
that's all.

393
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,385
Oh, wait.

394
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,345
I got something to show you.

395
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,886
What?

396
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,801
Wait.

397
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,934


398
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,350
Nice.

399
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,851
Real nice.

400
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,853
Put it on.

401
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,728
Right now?

402
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,277
Uh-huh.

403
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,901
Okay, but turn around first.

404
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,981
Turn around.

405
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,590
Okay, you can look.

406
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,893
What does it say on there?

407
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,597
I love Chicago.

408
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,602

00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,603
don't it Otis?

410

Uh-huh.

411
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,820

Oh, now come on honey,

417
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,371
I ain't asking you

418
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,415
to wash the
windows or nothing,

419
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,412
I just want a beer.

420

Come on, bring your poor
old brother a beer, will ya?

she's your sister!

Okay, I was only
kidding around, Henry.

424
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,632
Tell her you're sorry.

425
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,763
Okay, I'm sorry.

426
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,970
Now, tell her you
won't do it again.

427

I won't.

go out and get a beer.

439

I'll do these,

I don't mind, honest.

441
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,940
Well, what do you say Otis?

442

You want to go grab a beer?

Sure, I don't mind.

nothing.

I ain't saying that.

482
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,577
Then you've killed
before, right?

483
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,531
Well, maybe I didn't
have no choice.

484
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,038
You didn't have no
choice here neither.

486
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:46,921
Huh?

I don't know,

it ain't the same.

490
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,765
It's always the same,

491
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,389

492

What do you mean?

493
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,146
It's either you or them,

494
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,145
one way or the other.

495

Ain't that right?

496
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,318
Open your eyes, Otis.

497
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,275
Look at the world.

498
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,238
It's either you or them.

499
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,039
You know what I mean.

500
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,128
Yeah.

501
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,792
Good.

Okay.

00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,660
There was only one left.

He knows nothing about this

but you can bet
a dollar to a doughnut

that when he finds out,

508
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,637
and he will find out
'cause I'll tell him

509
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,930
there'll be hell to pay.

510
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,848
Really.

511
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,716
I'll never go back there again

512
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,052
I can tell you that.

513
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,557
Not when he's
not there anyway.

514
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,686
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

515
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,108
It's gone down so badly

516
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,230
the way it's changed

517
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,107
it breaks my heart.

518
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,654
It's like that all over.

519
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,652
People spit at you.

520
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,358
I wish I was lying.

521
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,284
Yeah, you can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.

522
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,444
Ah, shit!

523
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,109
Fuck.

524
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,366
What did you do that for?

525
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,452
I guess I got carried away.

526
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,039
Well, I guess you did, Otis.

527
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:39,629
Shit, I got to have a TV.

528
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,806
Well, let's go shopping.

529
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,355
So what can I do
for you gentlemen?

530
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,523
It's hot in here, isn't it?

531
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,397
I'm kind of cold.

532
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,774
We want a TV.

533
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,072
How much you got to spend?

534
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,364
What do you got?

535
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,442
50 bucks.

536
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,620
I can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

537
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,446
Well, turn it on

538
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,538
we want to see if it works.

539
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,332
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

540
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,501
Uh-uh.

541
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,331
Here plug it in down there.

542
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,665
Here?

543
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,295
Yeah, down there, real good.

544
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,377
I see you've had some college.

545
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,755
Like you can see
it works real good.

546
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,511
Just takes a while to warm up.

547
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,807
It's black and white!

548
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,556
Of course it's
black and white.

549
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,182
What do you
expect for 50 bucks?

550
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,763
Fuckin' 3-D for Christ sake.

551
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,564
Well, how much is color?

552
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,983
We want color.

553
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,060
You can't get
color for 50 dollars.

554
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,440
That's okay,

555
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,646
let's see what you got.

556
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,447
What have I got?

557
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,490
You want cable ready?

558
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,817
You want remote control?

559
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,527
You want UHF?

560
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,452
You want 13"?

561
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,246
You want 19"?

562
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,039
I bet you'd
like to have a 19".

563
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,416
You want Sony?

564
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,209
You want Zenith?

565
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,249
You want a Gold Star?

566
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,456
What can we get for a $150?

567
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,541
I can let you have
this set for $150.

568
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,171
It's worth $300.

569
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,548
But here, take a look at this.

570
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,096
For an extra $75,

571
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,845
you can take this $600 set.

572
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,560
What's this?

573
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,852
It's a camcorder.

574
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,599
What?

575
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,847
It's a videotape recorder

576
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,648
and camera rolled into one.

577
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,101
You just pop in a cassette

578
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,059
and you're ready to go.

579
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,440
You can make your
own movies with that?

580
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,613
What else would
you do with it?

581
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,985
How much you want for it?

582
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,156
It's worth a grand,

583
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,529
I'd take half.

584
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,484
500 bucks?

585
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,162
Yeah, half of a grand is $500.

586
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,204
That's a little more

587
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,748
than we were
planning to spend.

588
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,951
I think we should
just take the TV.

589
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,503
Okay, which one do you want?

590
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,667
The $50 one.

591
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,592
You guys come in here,

592
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,631
I show this,

593
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,087
I show you that,

594
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,514
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend.

595
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

596
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,846
Take the $50 set

597
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,847
and get the hell out,

598
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,893
I'm a busy man.

599
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,143
Well, we were really
counting on a color set.

600
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:38,939
What's the matter,

601
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,604
You got shit in your ears?

602
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,060
The black and white is $50,

603
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,440
take it or leave it.

604
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,896
Sorry we wasted your time,

605
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,775
come on, Otis.

606
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,026
Don't give me
sorry, you dumb ass!

607
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,234
Did I stutter?

608
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,320
Gimme the $50 and get out!

609
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,029
I'll give you 50...

610
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,497
(Screaming)

611
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,577
(Screaming)

612
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,000
(Screaming)

613
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,842
(Screaming)

614
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,921
No!

615
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,769
Otis,

616
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,525
Plug it in.

617
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,082


618
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,214
Oh get out of here
you're so ugly.

619
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,590
Lurleen, here's
your Uncle Otis.

620
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,718
Hi Lurleen, hi honey,

621
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,515
how are you,
hi it's Uncle Otis.

622
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,309
Henry come dance with me.

623
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,432
Come on, come on, just dance.

624
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,683
Who me?

625
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,513
Yeah.

626
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,139
No, no, no.

627
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,393
Come on Henry.

628
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,567
Come on do it Henry.

629
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,270
All right lets go.

630
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,525
That's it.

631
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,775
Get down.

632
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,781
Wig it as they say here.

633
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,999
More, more,

634
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,334

635
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,634

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,427
that's it...

637
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,012
Work them hands, Henry.

638
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,966
That's it, that's it.

639
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,050
Lo and behold, what a guy.

640
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,388
Come on, come on,
see look how good it is.

641
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,814
Right there yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,891
Come on,

643
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,976
more, more!

644
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,606
More!

645
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,778
More damn it!

646
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,276
Fight your own battles.

647
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,323
Get this...

648
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,995
Turn it off!

649
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,000
Turn it off!

650
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,046
I want more,

651
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:08,839
just a little bit more.

652
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,798
All right.

653
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,798
That's it, that's it,
just a little bit,

654
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,673
all right that's it.

655
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,925
Hi baby.

656
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,802
Come on Henry, say hi.

657
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,723
No.

658
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,341
Say hi, Henry.

659
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,183
No more, Otis.

660
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,176
Say hi, Henry.

661
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,556
No more, Otis!

662
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,853
He doesn't want to.

663
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,725
Say hi baby.

664
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,181
I said hi.

665
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,318
<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

666
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,818
Yeah?

667
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,276
Uh- huh.

668
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,407
Look I'll do the best I can,

669
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,159
but I don't promise...

670
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,785
Fuck him.

671
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,662
Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

672
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,334
Crazy guy!

673
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,376
What?

674
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,251
Some jerk off hasn't
been out of jail six months,

675
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:49,796
gets drunk,

676
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,041
gets busted up in a fight.

677
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,466
So he goes home and gets a gun

678
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,669
and comes back later
and shoots the guy.

679
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,378
They find the gun on him.

680
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,971
He claims he was framed.

681
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,719
What are you going to do?

682
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,517
So, everything going okay?

683
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,388
Yeah.

684
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,139
Okay,

685
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,729
You still working at Bobs Gas?

686
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,772
Yes sir.

687
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,100
Good, you working everyday?

688
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,730
Two, three days a week.

689
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,732
It's a little slow now.

690
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,905
Well, if it's less than
two days a week let me know.

691
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,232
We'll see what
we can do for you.

692
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,237
You still living
at 1801 West North?

693
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,738
Yes sir.

694
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,410
Good.

695
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,779
I got to cut it
short today, Otis.

696
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,704
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

697
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,781
I promised to take him over.

698
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,911
Sure.

699
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,540
Good, I'll see you next month.

700
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,416
Take it easy.

701
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,872
Bye.

702
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,810
You got it?

703
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,315
Got what?

704
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,988
You know what.

705
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
Here you go.

706
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,988
You wanna try it?

707
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,172
Ooh!

708
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,210
God damn, you son of a bitch!

709
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,261
Fuckin'...!

710
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,093
Damn it!

711
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,810
Fucker.

712
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,347
Let me see that.

713
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,559
That little fuckin' bastard.

714
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,483
I ought to kill him.

715
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,898
I ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

716
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,820
That'd be a mistake.

717
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,069
Look who's talking.

718
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,652
Watch your mouth Otis.

719
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,703
I'm sorry, Henry.

720
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,826
You kill that high school boy

721
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,122
they're going to slap your ass

722
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,541
right back in jail.

723
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,368
Otis that's a promise.

724
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,920
People have seen you together.

725
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,123
I'd still like
to kill him though.

726
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,833
I bet you would.

727
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,260
I'd like to kill somebody.

728
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,838
Say that again.

729
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,889
I'd like to kill somebody.

730
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,932
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.

731
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,895
Here, I want to
show you something.

732
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,150
Where'd you get this?

733
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,276
Careful Otis,

734
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,357
it's loaded.

735
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,533
Where'd you get it?

736
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,486
Guns are easy to get.

737
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,445
I can make a phone call

738
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,825
and get a gun.

739
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,623
Anybody can get a gun Otis.

740
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,450
What do you got in mind Henry?

741
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,035
What do you think?

742
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,753
I don't know.

743
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,459
Put up the hood.

744
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,338
Why?

745
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,546
Just put up the hood, Otis.

746
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,263
You guys need any help?

747
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,561
Otis, do you need some help,

748
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,640
or can you do it yourself?

749
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,868
Feel better?

750
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,908
Yeah.

751
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,285
Alright.

752
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,136
If you shoot somebody

753
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,554
in the head with a 45

754
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,506
every time you kill somebody

755
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,309
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.

756
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,806
But if you strangle one

757
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,932
and stab another,

758
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,229
one you cut up

759
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,431
one you don't

760
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,642
then the police
don't know what to do.

761
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,148
They think you're
four different people.

762
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,104
What they really like,

763
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,235
what makes their
job so much easier,

764
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,192
a pattern.

765
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,620
What they call
a modus operandi.

766
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,117
That's Latin.

767
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,119
Bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

768
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,122
Big fuckin' deal.

769
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,168
What?

770
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,962
Nothing.

771
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,799
It's like a trail
of shit, Otis.

772
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,127
It's like a blood droppings

773
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,052
from a deer you've shot

774
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,095
and all they gotta do

775
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,343
is follow those droppings

776
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,222
and pretty soon they're
going to find that deer.

777
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:31,236
Why do we use a gun?

778
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,158
You can use a gun.

779
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,031
I'm not saying
you can't use a gun.

780
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,239
Just don't use
the same gun twice.

781
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,335
The most important
thing is to keep moving.

782
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,290
That way they might
never catch up to you.

783
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,295
I'm gonna have to pack up

784
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,172
and be on the move
too, pretty soon.

785
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,218
Where are you going?

786
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,591
Nowhere.

787
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,015
You wanna come?

788
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,685
We could be back this
way in about a month.

789
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,228
I'm not supposed
to leave the state

790
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,099
without telling them.

791
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,146
So who's gonna know?

792
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,223
As long as you show up

793
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,308
when you're supposed to?

794
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,191
What if they check
up on me at work?

795
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,899
Well, no plan is perfect.

796
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,131
Bring her in.

797
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,082
Bring her in Otis.

798
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,213
Come on.

799
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,965
That's it.

800
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:15,760
Yeah, yeah.

801
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,424
Sit down.

802
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,388
Sit her down.

803
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,511
Oh, good, good,
good, good, good.

804
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,466
Take her blouse off.

805
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,641
Take it off.

806
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,853
Oh yeah, Otis, good.

807
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,351
My oh, yeah, yeah.

808
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,058
Skirt, skirt, skirt.

809
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:29,767
Do it Otis,

810
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,984
you're a star.

811
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,320
<i>(Man gagged and screaming)</i>

812
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,196
Shut up!

I'll do what the hell
I want to do bitch!

814
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,254
Leave me alone!

815
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,251
Do it Otis.

816
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,707
Do it.

817
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,633
Henry look.

818
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,381
You got it.

819
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,677
Go for it boy.

820
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,932
Shut up!

821
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,303
Get the fuckin' kid!

Henry?

830
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,369
What?

831
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,290
Hi!

832
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,242
Looky here, where you at.

833
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,167
Bye!

834
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:11,876
Where you at?

835
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,587
Say hello, honey!

836
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,380
I have to wave to my baby.

837
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,422
Henry, bye.

838
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,296
Henry, look at this, Henry.

839
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,752
Ain't that a view.

840
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,512
Otis!

841
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,135
No, Otis!

842
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,511
Otis!

843
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,639
No!

844
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,846
Let's go!

845
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,242
What are you doing?

846
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,994
I want to see it again.

847
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:28,662
In jail?

848
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,122
Are you sure?

849
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,669
Is Lurleen there?

850
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,337
Does she know?

851
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,170
In the what,

852
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,000
in the army?

853
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,462
Go get her, will you?

854
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,228
Hi.

855
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,021
Hi, hi.

856
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,602
Do you miss me?

857
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,904
I miss you.

858
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,280
You did?

859
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,488
That's wonderful.

860
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,413
Are you being a good girl?

861
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,163
I don't think so honey.

862
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,466
I know I promised, but uh...

863
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,090
a couple of things
have happened here.

864
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,593
I know, he is a good soldier.

865
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,731
Soon, real soon, I promise.

866
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,861
I love you, too.

867
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,698
Yeah, put your
grandma back on, okay?

868
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,578
Hi.

869
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,287
I know.

870
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,913
I'll think about it.

871
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,166
I can't right now.

872
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,626
I will, soon.

873
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,380
I can't talk now okay,

874
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,807
I gotta go.

875
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,475
Okay.

876
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,802
Bye.

877
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,521
Great, great.

878
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,775
Oh!

879
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,107
I got one,
I got one, here, look.

880
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,033
Oh, look, look,
look, look, look.

881
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:30,950
Look at this,
look at this.

882
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,494
Tight on there huh.

883
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,741
Yeah, no, no, no,

884
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,912
oh, no, I like
this one better.

885
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,036
Look Henry, Henry look.

886
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,241
Oh, yeah, I love it,

887
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,121
I love her.

888
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,084
Oh god, how she looks,

889
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,582
isn't she pretty.

890
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,038
Ah god, look at that dress,

891
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,589
look at the way it moves.

892
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,257
Oh yeah!

893
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,381
Pull up next to
her, real slow.

894
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,928
<i>(Hits camera)</i>

895
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,677
Look what you did!

896
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,928
Oh God!

897
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,009
Oh Jesus!

898
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,721
Look at it, it's ruined.

899
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,308
Damn Henry you ought to
look where you're driving.

900
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,061
Who the hell told you

901
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,981
to stick your head
out the window anyway?

902
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,061
You could have killed me!

903
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,270
Oh, that's right.

904
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,073
Blame it on me!

905
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,527
Oh, this fucking camera!

906
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,079
What did you do that for?

907
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,997
It wasn't any good anymore.

908
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,416
Could have fixed it.

909
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,744
Shit, the lens was
busted right off!

910
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,703
Could have fixed it!

911
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,628
How do you know,

912
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,673
you a camera repair man.

913
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,749
You should have
said something.

914
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,255
You didn't give
me a chance, Otis.

915
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,177
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

916
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,675
It ain't my fault it broke.

917
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,472
Oh right.

918
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,226
Go back and get
it if you want.

919
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,518
Yeah.

920
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,694
Want to get a beer?

921
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,693
Not particularly.

922
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,524
I want a beer.

923
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,745
If you want a
beer so bad, Otis,

924
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,790
go ahead and get one.

925
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,788
All right, I will.

926
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,541
See you later.

927
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,998
Yeah.

928
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,674
I talked to Lurleen.

929
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,804
Yeah?

930
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,387
You'd like her.

931
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,313
God, I miss her.

932
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,891
I'm thinking,

933
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,695
I might be
heading on back home.

934
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,316
I quit.

935
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,148
You quit what?

936
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,618
My job.

937
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,740
What happened?

938
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,786
Nothing.

939
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,706
I just figured it
was time to go home.

940
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,046
You want to come with me?

941
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,419
I thought you wanted
to make some money?

942
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,377
Yeah, but,

943
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,757
I'm thinking,

944
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,134
I don't want to bring
Lurleen up here after all.

945
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,057
You know,
that was my intention.

946
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,479
There's just too
much going on up here.

947
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,227
She'd get lost.

948
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:13,697
We're better off
living with mama.

949
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,774
I can work back home,

950
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,736
I won't make as much
money I'm sure, but,

951
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,820
I won't need <i>as</i> much either.

952
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,410
And I can live with mama.

953
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,838
You can stay there, too.

954
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,961
You figure it's
safe to go back?

955
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,759
I hope so.

956
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,177
Leroy's in jail for murder

957
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,052
and his bond's
a million dollars.

958
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,553
So, unless he wins the lottery

959
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,104
Leroy won't be going
anywhere for quite a while.

960
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,853
Where's Otis?

961
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,311
He had a dinner
date I think he said.

962
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,941
Really?

963
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,237
Well.

964
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,693
Come with me?

965
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,653
When are you leaving?

966
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,865
Tomorrow.

967
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,949


968
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,165
Better think fast Henry.

969
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,966
You got your ticket?

970
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,918
Not yet.

971
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,721
But my mind's made up.

972
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,798
Might as well just do it.

973
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,721
Might as well.

974
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,182
I'd rather ride with you.

975
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,361
Let me think about it.

976
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,741
I'll tell you what,

977
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,863
let's me and you

978
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,239
go get us a steak dinner,

979
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,946
I'm buying, huh.

980
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,873
I got a new Visa card
I want to try out.

981
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,245
You've got a Visa card?

982
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,955
Yeah, who you think you're
associating with anyway?

983
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,540
Great, let's go.

984
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,464
Alright.

985
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,834
Where are we going?

986
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,589
We'll find a place.

987
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,180
Grab your jacket and let's go.

988
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,986
I gotta go to the bathroom.

989
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,237
Okay.

990
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,965
He's passed out.

991
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,031
I ain't
interrupting nothing, am I?

992
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,997
You guys want a beer?

993
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,039
You got any cigarettes?

994
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,086
Not since Superman died.

995
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,589
I gotta, go out and
get some cigarettes,

996
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,339
get some air.

997
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,177
Henry?

998
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,046
I'll be right back I promise,

999
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,551
I just need some air.

1000
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,973
Henry.

1001
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,470
You want anything?

1002
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,938
Otis?

1003
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,857
Uh- uh.

1004
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,826
How about getting your
poor ol' brother a beer?

1005
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,167
Hi.

1006
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,213
Two packs of Kools.

1007
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,039
What kind?

1008
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,040
What?

1009
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:24,794
What kind?

1010
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,964
Milds, Regulars, 100's...

1011
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,260
Regulars.

1012
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,014
Two, sixty.

1013
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,099
Hey, how about those Bears?

1014
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,025
Fuck the Bears.

1015
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,483
Okay.

1016
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,129
Hi.

1017
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,172
That's a nice looking
dog you got there.

1018
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,295
Thank you.

1019
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,217
What kind is it?

1020
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,419
Heinz.

1021
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,549
What?

1022
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,881
57 varieties.

1023
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,181
What?

1024
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,554
It's a mutt,

1025
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,260
half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

1026
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,472
Oh, Shitzu, huh.

1027

What's his name?

Delores.

What?

1030
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,112
Her name is Delores.

That's a nice name.

Say thank you.

No, no, no, easy.

No, no, no.

What about Otis?

It's not a good idea.

No.

Henry.

1064
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,261
That was so awful.

1065
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,724
I'm scared.

What do we do now?

We just got to keep moving,

that's for sure.

outside San Bernardino.

She raises horses there.

01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,079
She's got about
1/2 dozen of them.

We'll send for her,

soon as we get there.

I guess, I love you too.

Where are we going to go now?

1084

We'll find a place.

But, I'm out of practice.

We better go to bed now.
