1
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,920
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,374
Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,619
You look kind of all
in, at that. I'm fine.

4
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:57,148
How is the insurance
business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

5
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,822
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

6
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,622
They said I have something
loose in my heart.

7
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,194
I say it's rheumatism.
Yeah?

8
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,327
Twelve.

9
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,744
Office memorandum.

10
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,753
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

11
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:12,252
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

12
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,694
Dear Keyes...

13
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,289
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

14
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,733
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

15
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,930
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

16
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,700
because it was smack up
against your nose.

17
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,967
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

18
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,238
such a wolf on a phony claim.

19
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:37,249
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

20
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,648
Accident and double indemnity.

21
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,684
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,586
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

23
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,428
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

24
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:54,427
You said it was murder. Check.

25
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,095
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

26
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,369
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

27
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:03,966
It was perfect.

28
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:07,570
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

29
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,547
just one little mistake.

30
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:14,584
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

31
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,252
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

32
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:21,952
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

33
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,955
I killed Dietrichson.

34
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,898
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

35
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,103
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

36
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,366
until a while ago, that is.

37
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,504
Yes, I killed him.

38
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,238
I killed him for money...

39
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,907
and for a woman.

40
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,883
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

41
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,719
Pretty, isn't it?

42
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,439
It all began last May.

43
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,904
Around the end of May, it was.

44
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,210
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

45
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,777
<i>On the way back I remembered this
auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

46
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,788
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

47
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,820
<i>It was one of those
California Spanish houses...</i>

48
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:28,793
<i>everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.</i>

49
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:32,297
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

50
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,830
<i>That is, if he ever
finished paying for it.</i>

51
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,204
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

52
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:41,797
Who wants to see him? My
name is Neff. Walter Neff.

53
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,106
If you're selling something... Look,
it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

54
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,338
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,813
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not
in. How soon do you expect him?

56
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,077
He'll be home when he gets
here, if that's any help to you.

57
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,880
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

58
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:54,750
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,914
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

60
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,058
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

61
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,059
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

62
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,290
Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

63
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:06,355
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

64
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,993
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

65
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:12,232
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

66
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:13,795
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

67
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:16,001
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

68
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,703
or something
while you're not...

69
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,039
fully covered.

70
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,511
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

71
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:26,416
I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.

72
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,548
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

73
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,955
Oh, that's all right.

74
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,516
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

75
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,495
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

76
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,497
Where would
the living room be?

77
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,002
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

78
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,062
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

79
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,108
<i>The living
room was still stuffy...</i>

80
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,843
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

81
00:08:58,718 --> 00:08:59,878
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

82
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,978
<i>and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...</i>

83
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,285
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

84
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,254
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy
frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

85
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,559
<i>his daughter
by his first wife.</i>

86
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,062
<i>They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...</i>

87
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,535
<i>on the table behind
the big davenport.</i>

88
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,965
<i>But to tell you
the truth, Keyes...</i>

89
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,065
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

90
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:26,101
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

91
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,081
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

92
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,846
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

93
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,649
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

94
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,362
I wasn't long, was I?
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

95
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,922
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,433
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.

97
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,799
With two "F's," like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.

98
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,430
<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

99
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,664
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

100
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,233
My husband never
tells me anything.

101
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,678
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

102
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,141
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

103
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,744
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

104
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,955
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

105
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,684
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

106
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,560
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

107
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,123
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

108
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:23,396
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

109
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,404
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

110
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:26,803
That's fine with me.

111
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,898
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

112
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,375
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

113
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:34,413
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

114
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:37,314
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

115
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,442
No, he isn't.

116
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,681
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

117
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,451
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:48,483
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

119
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,756
I have a very attractive
policy here.

120
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,492
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

121
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,126
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

122
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,227
in the collision coverage.

123
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,206
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

124
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,834
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

125
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,275
It's a living.

126
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,573
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

127
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,085
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

128
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,587
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

129
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:16,984
Accident insurance?

130
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:19,287
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:24,424
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

132
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:27,389
Just my name.
As, for instance?

133
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,697
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?

134
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:34,169
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

135
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,403
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

136
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:40,207
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

137
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,145
He'll be in then.
Who?

138
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,446
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

139
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:48,419
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

140
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,853
if you know what I mean.

141
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:53,359
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

142
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:56,691
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

143
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,396
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

144
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,696
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

145
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,497
Suppose it doesn't take.

146
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,936
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

147
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:08,906
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

148
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,103
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

149
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:13,668
That tears it.

150
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,351
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

151
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,083
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

152
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,488
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

153
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,584
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

154
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,496
I wonder if you wonder.

155
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,568
<i>It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

156
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,572
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

157
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,872
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

158
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,138
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

159
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,841
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

160
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,781
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

161
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,750
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

162
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:59,117
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

163
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,489
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

164
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,960
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

165
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,929
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

166
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,966
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

167
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,058
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

168
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,571
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.

169
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:18,803
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

170
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,743
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

171
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,873
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

172
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,179
All I want is my money. Says you.

173
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,879
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

174
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:31,115
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

175
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:34,126
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

176
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:38,460
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

177
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,700
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

178
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:44,066
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

179
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:47,129
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

180
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:51,241
What little man?
The little man in here.

181
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,537
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

182
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,047
I can't eat.

183
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:59,346
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

184
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,943
So what did I do?

185
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,614
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

186
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,555
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

187
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,149
And what did they find?

188
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:10,526
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

189
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,157
What shavings?

190
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,793
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

191
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,564
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

192
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,934
That's one way
of putting it.

193
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,240
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

194
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:28,542
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

195
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:31,482
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

196
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,084
Here?
Here.

197
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,853
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

198
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,861
But I ain't got no more truck.

199
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,329
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

200
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:47,889
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

201
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:51,266
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

202
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,106
Now pull it toward you.

203
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,867
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,509
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

205
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:07,314
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

206
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,615
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

207
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,315
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

208
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,948
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

209
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,014
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

210
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,821
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

211
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,556
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

212
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,722
The way they don't do things!

213
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,528
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

214
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,092
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

215
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,105
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

216
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,004
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

217
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,408
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

218
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,173
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

219
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,112
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

220
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,776
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

221
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,819
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

222
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,721
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

223
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,123
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

224
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,923
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

225
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,590
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

226
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,064
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

227
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,931
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

228
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,197
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

229
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:01,502
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

230
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,536
I love you, too.

231
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,511
<i>I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

232
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,887
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

233
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:22,755
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

234
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,297
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

235
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,765
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

236
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,996
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

237
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,799
<i>about the renewals.</i>

238
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,073
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

239
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,837
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

240
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:43,646
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

241
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,684
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

242
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:49,518
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

243
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,683
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

244
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:55,293
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

245
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,397
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

246
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:08,034
I'm considering it.

247
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:12,240
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

248
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,280
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

249
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,441
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

250
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,678
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

251
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,016
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

252
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,682
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

253
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,951
Nettie.

254
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:33,557
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

255
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:36,363
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

256
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,996
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

257
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:40,232
But he's not?
No.

258
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,999
That's terrible.

259
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,634
Nettie!

260
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:49,006
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

261
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,984
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

262
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,350
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.

263
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:00,617
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

264
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:03,856
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

265
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,730
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

266
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,733
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

267
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:12,498
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

268
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,270
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

269
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,537
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

270
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:20,670
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

271
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,840
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

272
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:27,442
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?

273
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,385
Walter.
That's right.

274
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,158
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

275
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,827
Twenty percent. Why?

276
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,523
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

277
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,192
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

278
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,667
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

279
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,034
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

280
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:47,504
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

281
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,871
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

282
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,170
It's got me worried sick.

283
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,576
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

284
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,114
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

285
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,174
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

286
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,050
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

287
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,612
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

288
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,920
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

289
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:08,688
It could.
Well...

290
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,361
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

291
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,732
What kind of insurance
could he have?

292
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,032
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

293
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:21,164
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

294
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,640
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

295
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,974
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

296
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,180
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

297
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,615
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

298
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,084
Well, your husband
would understand.

299
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,951
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

300
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,581
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

301
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,819
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

302
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,986
They're all tough at first.

303
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,024
He has a lot on his mind.

304
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,826
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

305
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,732
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

306
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:54,005
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

307
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,735
Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

308
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,442
Is that what you
married him for?

309
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:03,676
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

310
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,414
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

311
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,851
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

312
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,014
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

313
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:17,529
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

314
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,124
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

315
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,965
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

316
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,064
How's that, again?

317
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:32,110
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

318
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,702
I have a little
allowance of my own.

319
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,976
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

320
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:40,612
Why shouldn't he know?

321
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,086
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

322
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:47,091
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

323
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,323
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

324
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:55,359
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

325
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:58,164
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

326
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:01,263
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

327
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,138
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

328
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,541
No, I think it's lovely.

329
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,045
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

330
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,172
What crown block?

331
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:12,342
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

332
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,749
I don't know what
you're talking about.

333
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,252
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

334
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:18,415
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

335
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:20,584
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

336
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,890
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.

337
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,693
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

338
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,663
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

339
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,131
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

340
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,674
That's a horrible
thing to say.

341
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,039
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

342
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,476
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

343
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,514
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

344
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,843
"You got one that's been
around too long?

345
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,577
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

346
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,551
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

347
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,283
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

348
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,552
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

349
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:56,561
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

350
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,824
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

351
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:11,242
<i>So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

352
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,835
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

353
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,547
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

354
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,344
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

355
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:22,987
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

356
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:26,923
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

357
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,892
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

358
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:32,157
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

359
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,756
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

360
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,928
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

361
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:43,003
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

362
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,476
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

363
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,714
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

364
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,842
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

365
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,719
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

366
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,618
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

367
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:59,522
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

368
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:03,658
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

369
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:06,195
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

370
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,825
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

371
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:10,560
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

372
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:16,071
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

373
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,071
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

374
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,784
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

375
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,213
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

376
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,048
Sure.

377
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,553
Put it on the chair.

378
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,737
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

379
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:48,334
It's raining.
Yeah.

380
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:51,273
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

381
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,438
Your husband out?

382
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,505
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

383
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,744
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

384
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,115
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

385
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:04,622
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

386
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,682
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

387
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,059
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

388
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,031
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

389
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,361
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

390
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:18,267
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

391
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:20,966
I want you to be nice to me.

392
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,265
Like the first time
you came to the house.

393
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:26,573
It can't be
like the first time.

394
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:29,443
Something's happened.
I know it has.

395
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:32,012
It's happened to us.

396
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:38,546
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

397
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,860
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

398
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:45,453
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

399
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,856
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

400
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,629
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

401
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:53,001
If you want to.
Right now?

402
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:54,369
Sure, right now.

403
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,887
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

404
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,686
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

405
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,723
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

406
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,994
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

407
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:25,969
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

408
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,004
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

409
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,913
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

410
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:47,492
Club soda?
Plain water, please.

411
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:52,358
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

412
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,763
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

413
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:57,202
Only he had
accident insurance.

414
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,794
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

415
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,965
Who didn't?
His wife.

416
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,544
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

417
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,842
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

418
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:13,541
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

419
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,411
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

420
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:21,251
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

421
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,224
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

422
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,894
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

423
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,030
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

424
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:37,040
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

425
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,838
Just strangers beside you.

426
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,610
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

427
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,304
You don't have to
sit across the table...

428
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,579
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

429
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,917
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

430
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,018
Lola. She lives with us.

431
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,616
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

432
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,427
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

433
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,929
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

434
00:26:58,998 --> 00:27:01,558
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

435
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,397
But he had
when you married him?

436
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:07,998
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

437
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:12,473
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

438
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:16,139
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

439
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,676
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

440
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:22,649
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

441
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:25,684
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

442
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,487
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

443
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,254
He's always been mean to me.

444
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:33,224
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

445
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,433
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

446
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,935
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

447
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,406
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

448
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:46,477
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

449
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,873
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

450
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:55,777
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

451
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:59,585
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

452
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,186
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.

453
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:07,457
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

454
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,361
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

455
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:13,166
and the motor still running.

456
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:17,233
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

457
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:20,671
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

458
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:21,906
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

459
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,574
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

460
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,743
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

461
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:29,811
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

462
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,719
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

463
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,883
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

464
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,120
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

465
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,026
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

466
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:40,361
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

467
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,525
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

468
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,092
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

469
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,230
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

470
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:50,599
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

471
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,580
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

472
00:28:59,118 --> 00:29:00,813
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

473
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:05,247
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

474
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:08,322
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

475
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:09,618
I couldn't.

476
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:13,131
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

477
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,928
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

478
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:18,870
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

479
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:20,564
In this business
you can't sleep...

480
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,472
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

481
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,009
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

482
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:28,376
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

483
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:32,112
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

484
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:33,708
And do it smart.

485
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,879
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

486
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:38,081
You know every notch in it
by heart.

487
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:40,848
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

488
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,990
A shill to put down the bet.

489
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:45,155
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

490
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,664
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

491
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,597
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

492
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:59,032
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

493
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:04,343
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

494
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,718
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

495
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,014
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

496
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:13,785
<i>And I did.</i>

497
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:28,939
Will you phone me? Walter?

498
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:34,642
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

499
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,647
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

500
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,613
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

501
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,021
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

502
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:47,649
It's better than
going on this way.

503
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,886
They're not gonna
hang you because...

504
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:50,758
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

505
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,525
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

506
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,089
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

507
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,295
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

508
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,362
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

509
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,873
It's got to be perfect.

510
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:18,246
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

511
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,188
And watch your step
every single minute.

512
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:23,387
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

513
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:26,621
Straight down the line.

514
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,869
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

515
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:13,969
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

516
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,138
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

517
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:22,349
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

518
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:25,914
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

519
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,993
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

520
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:33,492
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

521
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,692
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

522
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:40,261
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

523
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:42,803
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

524
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:47,636
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

525
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,207
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

526
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:53,777
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

527
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:56,912
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

528
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,582
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

529
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:03,153
I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

530
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:04,525
that, not being an employee...

531
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,894
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

532
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:10,264
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

533
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:11,495
Yeah, I know
all about that.

534
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,037
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

535
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:16,632
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

536
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,437
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

537
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,307
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

538
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:24,247
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

539
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:26,011
Who needs a hat in California?

540
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,779
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

541
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:30,287
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

542
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:33,222
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

543
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,383
Just as you say.

544
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,257
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

545
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:38,556
Sure.

546
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,198
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

547
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,165
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

548
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:46,602
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

549
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:47,933
Yes, I have.

550
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,038
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

551
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,237
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.

552
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,075
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.

553
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:58,116
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

554
00:33:58,183 --> 00:33:59,582
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

555
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:00,879
If I ever catch you
with that...

556
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:02,317
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

557
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,480
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

558
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:07,650
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

559
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:10,194
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

560
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:12,822
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

561
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:15,262
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

562
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,324
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

563
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,063
Good night, Mr. Neff.

564
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:24,075
A great little fighter
for her weight.

565
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:27,570
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

566
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:30,046
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

567
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,083
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

568
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,845
When will that be?
About a week.

569
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,853
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

570
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,752
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.

571
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:39,552
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

572
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:42,058
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

573
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:45,688
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

574
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:47,425
Great football school,
Stanford.

575
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,490
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

576
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:51,195
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

577
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,600
The bottom line.

578
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:59,267
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?

579
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:00,641
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

580
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:04,671
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

581
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,889
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

582
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:14,790
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

583
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,090
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

584
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,858
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

585
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,125
Plenty.

586
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,698
Bring me some soda when you come
up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

587
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:28,796
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:31,468
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

589
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,789
Good night, Mr. Neff.

590
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:52,657
All right, Walter?
Fine.

591
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,631
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

592
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,633
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

593
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,690
End of the month.

594
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:58,758
He drives, huh?
He always drives.

595
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,464
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

596
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,097
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

597
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:04,540
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

598
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:06,474
a little thing called
double indemnity.

599
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:09,446
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

600
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:11,675
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

601
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,377
The kind that almost
never happen.

602
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,942
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

603
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,455
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

604
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,957
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

605
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:23,551
That's why
it's got to be the train.

606
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:27,696
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

607
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:29,666
Straight down the line.

608
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:50,646
Hello, Mr. Neff.

609
00:36:52,057 --> 00:36:53,285
It's me.

610
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,391
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,553
For me? Why?

612
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,928
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

613
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:09,529
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

614
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:12,600
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

615
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,008
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

616
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,418
Going roller-skating, huh?

617
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,919
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

618
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,991
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

619
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,022
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

620
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,464
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

621
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,427
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

622
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:40,903
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

623
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:42,906
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

624
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:46,102
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

625
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:49,247
You won't tell on me,
will you?

626
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:52,044
I'd have to think it over. Nino's
not what my father says at all.

627
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:55,211
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

628
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:58,256
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

629
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,985
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

630
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:05,085
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

631
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:07,595
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

632
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:10,157
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

633
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,465
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

634
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:16,303
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

635
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,904
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

636
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:24,142
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

637
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:29,348
Nino? Over here, Nino.

638
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,589
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

639
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,299
The name is Zachetti.

640
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,029
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

641
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,195
I told him all about us.

642
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,636
Why does he have to
get told about us?

643
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:49,697
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

644
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,332
I'm not doing any worrying.

645
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:52,706
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

646
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,506
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

647
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,070
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

648
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:59,412
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

649
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:01,816
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

650
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:04,047
Is that anything
to get tough about?

651
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,590
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

652
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,455
Of course I'm coming.

653
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:14,294
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

654
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,698
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

655
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,803
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

656
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:27,044
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

657
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:30,548
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...</i>

658
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:34,312
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...</i>

659
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:36,513
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

660
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,818
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

661
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:42,959
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

662
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:45,757
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

663
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:50,058
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

664
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:52,228
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

665
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,601
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

666
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:58,233
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

667
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:01,271
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

668
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:04,041
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

669
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,016
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

670
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,952
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

671
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:14,954
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

672
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:18,629
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

673
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,028
<i>Sort of accidentally
on purpose.</i>

674
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,391
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

675
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,532
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

676
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,732
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

677
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,299
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

678
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:35,312
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

679
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,507
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

680
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,449
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

681
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:43,316
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

682
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:46,448
Itll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

683
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,287
Open your bag. Quick.

684
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:54,864
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

685
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:56,924
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.

686
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,299
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

687
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,100
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

688
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:04,767
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

689
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:06,310
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

690
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,277
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

691
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:09,938
What happened?

692
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:14,518
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

693
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,247
That one up there?

694
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:22,023
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

695
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:24,988
Go ahead. I'm listening.

696
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:27,429
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

697
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:30,229
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

698
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:32,929
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?

699
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,471
Until he can
take the train.

700
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:35,767
I told you it's got
to be the train.

701
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,171
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

702
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:40,234
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

703
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:43,075
There are other ways. We're
not gonna do it other ways.

704
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:44,239
But we can't leave it
like this.

705
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:47,250
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

706
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:49,377
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

707
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:52,252
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

708
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,518
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

709
00:41:58,429 --> 00:41:59,760
Excuse me.

710
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,459
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

711
00:42:04,536 --> 00:42:06,026
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

712
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:07,571
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

713
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:10,665
But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only...

714
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:14,200
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

715
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:19,313
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

716
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:28,917
<i>After that, a full week
went by and I didn't see her once.</i>

717
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:32,485
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

718
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,464
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe
those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

719
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:39,264
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

720
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,329
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

721
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:48,075
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

722
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,043
Hello, Keyes.

723
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,342
I just came
from Norton's office.

724
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,906
The semiannual sales
records are out.

725
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:55,885
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

726
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:58,650
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

727
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:01,214
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

728
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:03,556
Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

729
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:06,927
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

730
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,329
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

731
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,424
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

732
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,401
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

733
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,869
Me? Why pick on me?

734
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:16,463
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

735
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,940
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

736
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:21,206
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

737
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,041
You're too good
to be a salesman.

738
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:25,241
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

739
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:28,808
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

740
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,047
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

741
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:32,646
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

742
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:35,693
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

743
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,660
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

744
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:38,855
It's the hottest job
in the business.

745
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,158
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

746
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:42,358
I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

747
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,025
Is that all you can see in it?

748
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:47,071
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

749
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,868
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

750
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:54,310
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

751
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,404
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

752
00:43:56,481 --> 00:44:00,577
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

753
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:03,485
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

754
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:07,354
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

755
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:10,553
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

756
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:12,957
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

757
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:16,262
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

758
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:20,863
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

759
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:24,267
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

760
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:26,037
and a father confessor,
all in one.

761
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,668
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

762
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:28,905
You don't want to work
with your brains?

763
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,039
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

764
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:34,642
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

765
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,244
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter.

766
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,686
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

767
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:43,319
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

768
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:47,225
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

769
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:50,597
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

770
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:53,262
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

771
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,496
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

772
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:59,907
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

773
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,741
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

774
00:45:02,814 --> 00:45:05,374
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

775
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,884
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

776
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:10,784
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

777
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,585
Keyes, suppose I join you in your
office? That's all right. I'll wait.

778
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:16,092
Only tell her
not to take all day.

779
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:18,988
Go ahead.

780
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,390
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

781
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:24,298
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

782
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:27,633
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

783
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:29,430
No.

784
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:30,696
Oh, uh...

785
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,867
what color did you pick?

786
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:35,845
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

787
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:37,775
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:39,840
Yeah, that suits me fine.

789
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,181
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

790
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,279
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

791
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:47,483
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

792
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,460
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?

793
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,259
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

794
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,197
If I told you
it was a customer...

795
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,426
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

796
00:45:58,503 --> 00:46:00,368
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

797
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:04,499
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

798
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:06,338
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

799
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,935
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

800
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:11,243
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

801
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:14,148
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

802
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,812
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

803
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:18,412
So you went back
and had her investigated?

804
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,923
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

805
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:24,259
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

806
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,853
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

807
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:28,558
She already had one husband.

808
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,726
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

809
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:32,861
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

810
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:36,566
She was a tramp from a long line of
tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.

811
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:39,371
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

812
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:41,001
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

813
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:43,569
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

814
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,745
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

815
00:46:46,818 --> 00:46:48,979
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

816
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:52,386
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

817
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:02,556
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

818
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,927
You're just a little taller.

819
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:17,212
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

820
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,876
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

821
00:47:20,952 --> 00:47:24,319
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

822
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:27,050
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

823
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:31,523
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

824
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:35,726
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

825
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,825
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

826
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,000
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

827
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:43,097
<i>move by move.</i>

828
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:48,036
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

829
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:51,047
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

830
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,714
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.

831
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,616
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

832
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:57,847
How soon you gonna want it?

833
00:47:57,922 --> 00:47:59,321
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

834
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,914
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

835
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:03,222
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.

836
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,295
<i>Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

837
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:07,661
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

838
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:11,133
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

839
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:13,500
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

840
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:16,506
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

841
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:20,407
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

842
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:23,572
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

843
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:26,082
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

844
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,143
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

845
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,246
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

846
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,156
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

847
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:38,718
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

848
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:42,994
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

849
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:47,130
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

850
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:51,404
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

851
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,840
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

852
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,573
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

853
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,638
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

854
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,644
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

855
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,915
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

856
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:12,524
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

857
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:15,923
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

858
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,490
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

859
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:20,628
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

860
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:23,003
<i>I got into
the back of the car.</i>

861
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:25,542
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

862
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:28,703
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

863
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,576
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

864
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:33,412
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

865
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,884
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

866
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:37,682
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:40,189
I'll have the car out
in a second.

868
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:20,293
Take it easy, honey. We've
got lots of time. Yeah.

869
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,743
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

870
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,548
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

871
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:47,421
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

872
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:50,283
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

873
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:54,058
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

874
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:13,446
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

875
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,515
What are you doing that for?

876
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,992
What are you
honking the horn for?

877
00:52:23,154 --> 00:52:25,145
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

878
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,554
Don't worry. Keep away
from me as much as you can.

879
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,093
Tell them I don't want to be
helped. I said, don't worry, Walter.

880
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,391
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

881
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:35,125
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

882
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,757
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

883
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:38,267
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

884
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,860
I remember everything.
No speeding.

885
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,902
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

886
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:47,341
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

887
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:49,675
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

888
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,873
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

889
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:54,611
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

890
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:57,745
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

891
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:03,226
San Francisco train, lady? Car
9, section 11. Just my husband.

892
00:53:03,294 --> 00:53:05,785
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

893
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,805
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

894
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:17,738
Car number 8. Up there.

895
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:26,642
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

896
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,653
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

897
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,087
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

898
00:53:33,157 --> 00:53:36,593
I'll miss you, honey.
Section 11, sir.

899
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,360
All aboard! Thank you.

900
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:42,591
Goodbye, honey.
All aboard!

901
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:50,032
Good luck, honey.

902
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,241
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

903
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:01,375
Yes, sir.

904
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:03,147
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

905
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,915
Right this way, sir.

906
00:54:36,754 --> 00:54:38,221
Like a chair?

907
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:43,359
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

908
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:48,163
You going far?
Palo Alto.

909
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:50,091
My name's Jackson.

910
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:53,364
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

911
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:55,762
I had a broken arm once.

912
00:54:56,273 --> 00:54:59,572
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

913
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:01,975
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

914
00:55:02,046 --> 00:55:06,107
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

915
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:11,115
I used to be. I'll bet
you left something behind.

916
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:13,288
I always do.

917
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:16,824
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

918
00:55:16,894 --> 00:55:20,227
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

919
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:21,286
Dietrichson.

920
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:24,290
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

921
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:28,199
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

922
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:31,639
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.

923
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:35,509
Car 9, section 11. Car 9,
section 11. With pleasure.

924
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,348
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

925
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:24,917
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

926
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,056
Okay, baby. That's it.

927
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:56,147
All right. Let's go.

928
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:07,860
<i>On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

929
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:09,364
<i>what she was to do
at the inquest...</i>

930
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:13,164
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

931
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:16,363
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.</i>

932
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,036
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

933
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:25,105
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

934
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:29,374
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

935
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,919
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

936
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:45,123
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.

937
00:58:58,282 --> 00:59:02,048
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.</i>

938
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,112
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

939
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:09,181
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

940
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:14,653
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

941
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:19,625
<i>I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

942
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,211
You gonna use your car, after
all? I'm not quite through.

943
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,144
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

944
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:33,307
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

945
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:36,352
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

946
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,012
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

947
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:41,948
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

948
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:44,687
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

949
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:47,161
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

950
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,859
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

951
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:54,370
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

952
00:59:54,438 --> 00:59:57,635
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

953
00:59:57,808 --> 01:00:00,208
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

954
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,610
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

955
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:16,083
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

956
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:20,027
and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

957
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:21,997
and they started talking
about it at the office...

958
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:25,296
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

959
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:29,305
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

960
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:31,603
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

961
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:35,634
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

962
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:38,408
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

963
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:41,741
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

964
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:47,321
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.

965
01:00:47,591 --> 01:00:49,752
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

966
01:00:49,826 --> 01:00:52,124
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.

967
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:54,263
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.

968
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:58,233
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

969
01:00:58,301 --> 01:01:00,565
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.

970
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:04,266
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

971
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,206
Died of a broken neck.

972
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:08,368
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.

973
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,504
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

974
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,378
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

975
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:14,712
to the observation car.

976
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:18,346
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

977
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:21,423
What do the police figure?

978
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:24,153
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

979
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:25,854
They're satisfied.

980
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:28,557
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

981
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,898
All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

982
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:34,196
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

983
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:36,603
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

984
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:39,540
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

985
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,178
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

986
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:49,241
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

987
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:50,684
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.

988
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:51,778
Any new developments?

989
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:54,483
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

990
01:01:54,558 --> 01:01:55,582
Who's Jackson?

991
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:57,183
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

992
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,820
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

993
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,955
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

994
01:02:02,032 --> 01:02:03,693
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

995
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:06,133
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

996
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:08,068
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

997
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:10,106
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

998
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:12,903
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

999
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,467
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1000
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,536
Anything else?
No, not much.

1001
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:20,606
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1002
01:02:20,684 --> 01:02:24,051
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1003
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,351
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1004
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:27,788
I couldn't sell him at first.

1005
01:02:27,858 --> 01:02:30,793
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1006
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:34,058
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1007
01:02:34,131 --> 01:02:36,156
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1008
01:02:36,233 --> 01:02:38,633
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1009
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:40,329
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1010
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:42,371
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1011
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:45,704
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1012
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:49,576
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1013
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:52,244
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1014
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:53,805
Then what do you
think of this case?

1015
01:02:53,884 --> 01:02:55,647
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1016
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:57,846
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1017
01:02:57,921 --> 01:02:59,684
Just what is your opinion?

1018
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:01,485
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

1019
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:03,924
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1020
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:05,325
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1021
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:09,092
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1022
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,829
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1023
01:03:12,903 --> 01:03:16,270
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1024
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:22,203
What do you say to that?
Me?

1025
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,980
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1026
01:03:26,049 --> 01:03:29,610
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1027
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:35,385
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1028
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:37,484
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1029
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:40,860
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1030
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:42,865
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1031
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:45,902
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1032
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,596
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1033
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:54,209
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1034
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:57,041
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1035
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:58,580
How do you do?
How do you do?

1036
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,673
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1037
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,310
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1038
01:04:05,956 --> 01:04:07,787
May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1039
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:10,349
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1040
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:14,090
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1041
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:15,722
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1042
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:18,393
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1043
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:20,595
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1044
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,365
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1045
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:25,169
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1046
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:28,541
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1047
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:31,103
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1048
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:32,944
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1049
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:35,007
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1050
01:04:35,085 --> 01:04:36,780
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1051
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,286
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1052
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:39,982
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1053
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,080
What sort of things?

1054
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:43,652
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1055
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:46,787
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1056
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:49,457
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1057
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,029
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1058
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:56,603
a suicide.

1059
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:03,377
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

1060
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:09,482
Thank you.

1061
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:19,019
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1062
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:21,859
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1063
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:25,265
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1064
01:05:25,335 --> 01:05:27,462
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1065
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:31,667
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1066
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:34,743
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1067
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,473
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

1068
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:41,142
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1069
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:44,880
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1070
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:48,215
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1071
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:52,022
What was his name, Keyes? His name
was Jackson. Probably still is.

1072
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:56,226
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1073
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:59,598
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

1074
01:05:59,669 --> 01:06:03,366
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1075
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,607
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1076
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:10,476
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1077
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,979
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1078
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,951
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1079
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,488
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1080
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:23,253
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1081
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:25,351
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1082
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:27,862
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1083
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:30,263
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1084
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:33,700
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1085
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:37,501
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:06:42,312 --> 01:06:45,577
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1087
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:47,013
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1088
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:50,280
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1089
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:53,288
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1090
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:56,382
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1091
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:57,949
Oh, can we?

1092
01:06:58,028 --> 01:07:01,862
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1093
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:05,662
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1094
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:09,296
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1095
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:11,840
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1096
01:07:11,908 --> 01:07:14,035
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1097
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,873
Yeah, in the front office.

1098
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:19,108
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1099
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:21,446
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1100
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:23,315
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1101
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:25,377
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1102
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,822
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1103
01:07:28,892 --> 01:07:31,554
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1104
01:07:31,628 --> 01:07:34,256
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1105
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:35,797
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1106
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:38,561
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1107
01:07:38,635 --> 01:07:40,762
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1108
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:44,102
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1109
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,867
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1110
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,309
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1111
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:51,142
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1112
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:54,183
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1113
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,411
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1114
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:59,353
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1115
01:07:59,422 --> 01:08:01,117
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1116
01:08:01,191 --> 01:08:04,285
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1117
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,952
May I have this?

1118
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:10,891
Come on, Walter.

1119
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:16,232
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1120
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:35,123
<i>I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1121
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:36,749
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1122
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,556
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1123
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,359
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1124
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:45,591
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1125
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:47,693
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1126
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:50,568
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1127
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,904
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1128
01:08:52,976 --> 01:08:55,638
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1129
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:06,454
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1130
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:08,848
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1131
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:12,156
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1132
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:14,753
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1133
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:17,425
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1134
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,760
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1135
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,599
Don't let anybody see you.

1136
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:49,364
Hello, Keyes.

1137
01:09:55,038 --> 01:09:57,666
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1138
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:01,302
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1139
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:04,904
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1140
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,240
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1141
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:09,251
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1142
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:13,085
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1143
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:18,057
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1144
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,822
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1145
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:22,228
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1146
01:10:22,298 --> 01:10:26,132
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1147
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:29,194
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1148
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:32,864
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1149
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,137
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1150
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:36,235
Yeah.
You got his check?

1151
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,472
Sure I did.

1152
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:41,216
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1153
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:45,614
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1154
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:48,783
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1155
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:51,292
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1156
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:52,953
No. Not suicide.

1157
01:10:53,563 --> 01:10:56,623
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1158
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,394
Now look, Walter.

1159
01:10:58,468 --> 01:11:01,437
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1160
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:02,562
if he's killed on a train.

1161
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:04,539
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1162
01:11:04,607 --> 01:11:08,600
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1163
01:11:08,678 --> 01:11:11,340
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1164
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:14,315
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1165
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:19,748
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1166
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:24,317
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1167
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:33,529
Murder?

1168
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:35,902
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1169
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:38,770
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

1170
01:11:40,143 --> 01:11:41,132
Who do you suspect?

1171
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,144
Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1172
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:45,237
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1173
01:11:45,315 --> 01:11:46,407
You mean the wife?
Yeah.

1174
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:49,042
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1175
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:51,143
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1176
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,482
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1177
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,785
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1178
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:57,291
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1179
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,089
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1180
01:11:59,162 --> 01:12:02,131
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1181
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:04,894
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.

1182
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:08,169
See you at the office
in the morning. Yeah.

1183
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:11,799
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1184
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:16,038
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1185
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:18,774
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1186
01:12:18,848 --> 01:12:20,406
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1187
01:12:20,483 --> 01:12:23,316
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1188
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:25,411
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1189
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:27,786
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1190
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:32,089
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1191
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:36,527
Can I have
one of those things?

1192
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:49,868
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.

1193
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:06,489
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.

1194
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,291
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1195
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:10,696
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1196
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:14,760
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1197
01:13:16,773 --> 01:13:19,333
How long a while?
Until this dies down.

1198
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:20,398
You don't know Keyes.

1199
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,535
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1200
01:13:22,612 --> 01:13:24,307
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1201
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,178
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1202
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,741
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.

1203
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:34,812
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1204
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:38,054
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1205
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:39,890
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?

1206
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:43,659
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1207
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:46,624
Shut up, baby.

1208
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:53,273
<i>Pacific All
Risk. Good afternoon.</i>

1209
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:57,170
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1210
01:13:58,181 --> 01:14:00,206
Hello.
Lola Dietrichson.

1211
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:03,518
Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.

1212
01:14:03,653 --> 01:14:05,848
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1213
01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:08,356
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1214
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:10,786
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1215
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:19,294
Is it something about
what happened?

1216
01:14:19,368 --> 01:14:22,963
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1217
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,632
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1218
01:14:29,378 --> 01:14:31,972
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1219
01:14:32,048 --> 01:14:33,948
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1220
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:42,481
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1221
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:46,016
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1222
01:14:47,096 --> 01:14:50,554
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1223
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:54,667
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1224
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:55,761
When your mother died?

1225
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:58,238
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1226
01:14:58,307 --> 01:14:59,296
We had a cabin there.

1227
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:03,709
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1228
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,742
She had a nurse with her.

1229
01:15:05,848 --> 01:15:08,840
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1230
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:11,647
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1231
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:13,586
She was delirious with fever.

1232
01:15:13,656 --> 01:15:17,353
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1233
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,620
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1234
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:20,889
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1235
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:23,693
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1236
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,198
The nurse stood there.

1237
01:15:26,736 --> 01:15:30,365
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1238
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,201
I'll never forget.

1239
01:15:34,277 --> 01:15:37,371
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1240
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:43,015
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1241
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:44,880
No. Who?
Phyllis.

1242
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,720
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1243
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,953
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1244
01:15:51,027 --> 01:15:55,430
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

1245
01:15:55,498 --> 01:15:59,958
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1246
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:03,870
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1247
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,966
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1248
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:09,534
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1249
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:10,943
pinning a black veil to it.

1250
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:14,414
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1251
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:16,542
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1252
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:18,246
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1253
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:19,787
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1254
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:22,881
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1255
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:24,449
That same look.

1256
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:26,924
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1257
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:28,827
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1258
01:16:28,898 --> 01:16:31,332
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1259
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,732
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1260
01:16:33,803 --> 01:16:36,931
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1261
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:38,496
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1262
01:16:38,574 --> 01:16:42,908
You'd better be careful, saying things
like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1263
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,551
I'm sorry.

1264
01:16:55,925 --> 01:16:58,223
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1265
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:02,555
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1266
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:03,826
No one.

1267
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:06,457
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.

1268
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:08,960
I've moved out.

1269
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:12,199
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1270
01:17:12,274 --> 01:17:14,834
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1271
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:17,811
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1272
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:21,246
Where are you living now?

1273
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:24,309
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1274
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:27,556
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1275
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:29,914
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1276
01:17:32,762 --> 01:17:34,286
<i>So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1277
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:38,026
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1278
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,091
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1279
01:17:40,503 --> 01:17:43,939
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1280
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:46,736
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1281
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:50,370
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1282
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:53,381
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1283
01:17:53,582 --> 01:17:55,413
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1284
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:57,679
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1285
01:17:57,753 --> 01:18:02,087
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1286
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:06,284
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1287
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:09,331
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1288
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:10,865
<i>It was worse.</i>

1289
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:15,393
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1290
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:26,538
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1291
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,951
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

1292
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,252
After all the years
we've known each other...

1293
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,256
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1294
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:36,916
About what?
About me.

1295
01:18:37,526 --> 01:18:40,188
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

1296
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:43,026
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1297
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:45,090
and murders don't come
any neater.

1298
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:48,034
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1299
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:50,368
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1300
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:53,741
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1301
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:57,643
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1302
01:18:57,713 --> 01:19:00,443
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

1303
01:19:00,816 --> 01:19:03,751
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1304
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,945
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.

1305
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:10,822
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1306
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:14,021
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1307
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:16,564
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1308
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:18,566
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1309
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,829
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1310
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:24,634
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1311
01:19:24,707 --> 01:19:25,901
and put him on the tracks.

1312
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:29,240
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1313
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,003
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1314
01:19:32,114 --> 01:19:33,877
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1315
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,813
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1316
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:41,488
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1317
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:43,320
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1318
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:45,952
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1319
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:48,690
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1320
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,625
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1321
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,224
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1322
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:55,770
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1323
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,999
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1324
01:19:58,073 --> 01:20:01,440
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1325
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,011
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1326
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:06,980
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1327
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,176
is sitting
right outside my office.

1328
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:12,687
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1329
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:17,256
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1330
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,020
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1331
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,823
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

1332
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:22,454
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1333
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:24,556
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1334
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,464
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

1335
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:28,526
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1336
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:30,765
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1337
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,866
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1338
01:20:33,943 --> 01:20:36,173
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1339
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:37,234
Yes.

1340
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,975
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

1341
01:20:40,049 --> 01:20:42,244
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1342
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:43,512
Will you swear to that?

1343
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:45,577
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1344
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:48,020
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1345
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,717
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1346
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,453
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1347
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:53,518
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1348
01:20:53,596 --> 01:20:54,961
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

1349
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,396
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1350
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:00,833
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1351
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,633
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1352
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:06,708
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1353
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:08,800
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1354
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:11,278
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1355
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:14,214
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1356
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,941
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1357
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:19,283
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1358
01:21:19,355 --> 01:21:21,983
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

1359
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:24,491
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1360
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,654
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1361
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:30,494
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1362
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:33,865
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1363
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:38,065
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1364
01:21:38,741 --> 01:21:40,800
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1365
01:21:40,876 --> 01:21:44,972
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1366
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,845
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1367
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,680
the Dietrichson claim.

1368
01:21:50,753 --> 01:21:52,880
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1369
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:54,047
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1370
01:21:54,123 --> 01:21:55,147
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1371
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:56,748
No. Never been up there.

1372
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:59,553
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1373
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:03,291
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1374
01:22:03,599 --> 01:22:06,898
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1375
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:10,030
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

1376
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:12,505
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1377
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:14,906
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1378
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:16,501
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1379
01:22:16,578 --> 01:22:18,045
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1380
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:21,412
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1381
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:22,472
Tonight?

1382
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:25,815
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1383
01:22:25,888 --> 01:22:28,686
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

1384
01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:32,284
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1385
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:34,719
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1386
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:37,095
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.

1387
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:43,337
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1388
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:46,135
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1389
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,676
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1390
01:22:48,744 --> 01:22:51,645
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1391
01:22:51,714 --> 01:22:53,739
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1392
01:22:53,816 --> 01:22:56,683
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1393
01:22:56,752 --> 01:22:58,049
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1394
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,556
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1395
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:04,091
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1396
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:05,558
But it isn't twice as safe.

1397
01:23:05,627 --> 01:23:08,790
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1398
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,991
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1399
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:12,829
where they can get off
at different stops.

1400
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:15,165
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1401
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:16,704
all the way to
the end of the line.

1402
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:19,104
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1403
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:20,971
She put in her claim.

1404
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:24,204
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1405
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:31,548
Let her sue us if she dares.

1406
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,418
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1407
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:37,015
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1408
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:48,129
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1409
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:51,195
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1410
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:54,834
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1411
01:24:21,904 --> 01:24:24,532
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.

1412
01:24:28,243 --> 01:24:31,178
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

1413
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:34,546
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1414
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:37,210
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1415
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:39,083
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1416
01:24:39,154 --> 01:24:42,055
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

1417
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:46,292
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1418
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,158
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1419
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,061
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1420
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,498
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1421
01:24:52,568 --> 01:24:56,060
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1422
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:59,972
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1423
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:01,973
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1424
01:25:02,044 --> 01:25:03,068
The way she died.

1425
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:06,171
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1426
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:08,011
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1427
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:10,415
She's been seeing you. I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1428
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,181
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1429
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:14,984
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1430
01:25:15,057 --> 01:25:17,389
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1431
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:18,653
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1432
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:19,921
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1433
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:21,189
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1434
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:24,528
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1435
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,535
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1436
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:29,867
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1437
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:32,805
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1438
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,809
I said, leave her out of this.

1439
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:41,043
It's me I'm talking about.

1440
01:25:41,116 --> 01:25:43,277
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

1441
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:44,751
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1442
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:47,448
We can't go through with it, that's
all. We have gone through with it.

1443
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:48,615
The tough part
is all behind us.

1444
01:25:48,724 --> 01:25:51,192
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1445
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:53,993
stick close together
the way we started out.

1446
01:25:54,062 --> 01:25:55,324
Watch it.

1447
01:26:13,115 --> 01:26:15,709
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1448
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:19,276
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1449
01:26:19,354 --> 01:26:22,983
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1450
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:26,221
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1451
01:26:26,295 --> 01:26:29,992
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1452
01:26:30,165 --> 01:26:32,725
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1453
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:36,532
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1454
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:44,906
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1455
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:49,547
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1456
01:26:49,618 --> 01:26:52,086
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1457
01:26:52,154 --> 01:26:54,554
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1458
01:26:56,191 --> 01:26:58,091
...where the cemetery was.

1459
01:26:59,528 --> 01:27:02,793
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1460
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:05,695
They're to put dead people in.

1461
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:11,099
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1462
01:27:11,173 --> 01:27:12,697
Dead, I mean.

1463
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:16,469
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1464
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,577
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

1465
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:25,084
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1466
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,120
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1467
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:30,624
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1468
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:02,518
Why are you crying?

1469
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:06,656
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1470
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:10,730
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1471
01:28:11,967 --> 01:28:14,868
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

1472
01:28:15,037 --> 01:28:17,904
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1473
01:28:17,973 --> 01:28:20,464
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1474
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:23,244
What makes you say that?

1475
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:26,944
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1476
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:29,415
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1477
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:33,746
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1478
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:35,915
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1479
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:39,518
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1480
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:42,495
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1481
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:44,390
Sick!

1482
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:50,871
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

1483
01:28:56,478 --> 01:28:59,777
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1484
01:29:00,816 --> 01:29:02,841
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1485
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:07,014
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1486
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:16,796
<i>Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1487
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,561
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1488
01:29:24,206 --> 01:29:27,300
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

1489
01:29:27,809 --> 01:29:30,801
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

1490
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,375
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1491
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:37,350
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

1492
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,649
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1493
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:47,318
Hello, Keyes. Just hang
on to your hat, Walter.

1494
01:29:47,396 --> 01:29:49,364
What for?
Oh, nothing much.

1495
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:52,499
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1496
01:29:52,768 --> 01:29:55,794
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.

1497
01:29:57,005 --> 01:29:59,235
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.

1498
01:29:59,307 --> 01:30:01,002
The somebody else?

1499
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:04,606
No kidding? Yeah. She
just filed suit against us.

1500
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:05,976
It's okay by me.

1501
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:09,107
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1502
01:30:09,184 --> 01:30:11,414
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

1503
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:12,475
With two olives.

1504
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:14,852
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1505
01:30:14,923 --> 01:30:18,017
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1506
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:20,356
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1507
01:30:20,429 --> 01:30:21,726
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1508
01:30:21,797 --> 01:30:25,927
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1509
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,297
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1510
01:30:32,607 --> 01:30:35,440
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1511
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,673
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1512
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,278
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

1513
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:17,341
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1514
01:31:17,419 --> 01:31:19,080
<i>Confidential.
Dietrichson file.</i>

1515
01:31:19,888 --> 01:31:22,652
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1516
01:31:22,724 --> 01:31:24,419
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1517
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:26,859
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1518
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:30,762
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.</i>

1519
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:34,802
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1520
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:38,169
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1521
01:31:43,912 --> 01:31:46,813
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1522
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:49,248
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1523
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:53,117
<i>whereas I am now able to report that
such a connection has been established...</i>

1524
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:55,315
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1525
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:58,357
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1526
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:01,793
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1527
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:06,262
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1528
01:32:06,368 --> 01:32:08,859
<i>former medical student,
age of 28...</i>

1529
01:32:08,937 --> 01:32:11,201
<i>residing at
Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1530
01:32:11,273 --> 01:32:14,174
<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1531
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:18,167
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1532
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:21,044
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1533
01:32:21,483 --> 01:32:24,714
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

1534
01:32:24,786 --> 01:32:28,483
<i>It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1535
01:32:28,557 --> 01:32:31,617
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

1536
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:34,885
<i>I strongly urge that this whole
matter be turned over to the office...</i>

1537
01:32:34,963 --> 01:32:36,897
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1538
01:32:36,965 --> 01:32:39,058
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1539
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:18,967
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1540
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:22,433
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1541
01:33:23,044 --> 01:33:24,443
How's 11:00?

1542
01:33:25,614 --> 01:33:27,411
Don't worry about Keyes.

1543
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:30,451
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1544
01:33:30,518 --> 01:33:33,453
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1545
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:38,015
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

1546
01:33:39,094 --> 01:33:41,995
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1547
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:45,288
Goodbye, baby.

1548
01:33:49,237 --> 01:33:50,966
<i>I guess I
don't have to tell you...</i>

1549
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:53,701
<i>what I intended to do
at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

1550
01:33:53,775 --> 01:33:57,336
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to
get clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1551
01:33:57,412 --> 01:34:00,245
<i>and of Phyllis, too,
all at the same time.</i>

1552
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:02,709
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1553
01:34:03,351 --> 01:34:06,718
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

1554
01:35:06,214 --> 01:35:07,806
In here, Walter.

1555
01:35:22,664 --> 01:35:24,063
Hello, baby.

1556
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:28,997
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

1557
01:35:30,538 --> 01:35:33,439
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

1558
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:44,885
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1559
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:47,786
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1560
01:35:48,156 --> 01:35:50,681
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1561
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,660
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1562
01:35:53,728 --> 01:35:55,593
And what are you
thinking about now?

1563
01:35:55,663 --> 01:35:57,961
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1564
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:00,430
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

1565
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:04,661
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

1566
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,533
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1567
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:10,100
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1568
01:36:10,178 --> 01:36:13,614
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1569
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:16,984
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1570
01:36:17,051 --> 01:36:19,679
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1571
01:36:19,754 --> 01:36:22,052
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1572
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:24,421
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1573
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:26,790
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1574
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:30,024
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

1575
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:32,861
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1576
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:37,371
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1577
01:36:37,438 --> 01:36:40,896
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

1578
01:36:40,975 --> 01:36:42,306
A Mr. Zachetti.

1579
01:36:42,377 --> 01:36:44,174
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1580
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:46,873
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1581
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:47,972
I was a sucker.

1582
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:50,813
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1583
01:36:50,885 --> 01:36:53,547
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1584
01:36:53,988 --> 01:36:56,047
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1585
01:36:56,124 --> 01:36:57,716
That's not true.

1586
01:36:57,792 --> 01:37:00,920
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1587
01:37:02,197 --> 01:37:05,689
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1588
01:37:05,767 --> 01:37:08,827
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1589
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:12,270
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1590
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:21,709
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1591
01:37:21,783 --> 01:37:23,080
That's what Keyes thinks.

1592
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:25,415
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1593
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:29,820
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1594
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:31,756
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1595
01:37:31,893 --> 01:37:36,387
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1596
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:40,758
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1597
01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:44,532
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1598
01:37:44,973 --> 01:37:47,464
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1599
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:51,000
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

1600
01:37:52,113 --> 01:37:54,377
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1601
01:37:54,449 --> 01:37:58,351
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1602
01:37:58,419 --> 01:37:59,886
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1603
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:03,181
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1604
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,590
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1605
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,093
so we can get the money
and be together.

1606
01:38:07,495 --> 01:38:10,623
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1607
01:38:10,698 --> 01:38:12,757
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1608
01:38:12,834 --> 01:38:14,825
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1609
01:38:14,903 --> 01:38:17,098
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1610
01:38:17,171 --> 01:38:21,574
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1611
01:38:21,643 --> 01:38:24,339
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1612
01:38:24,412 --> 01:38:28,473
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1613
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,011
We're both rotten.

1614
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:32,780
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1615
01:38:32,854 --> 01:38:34,947
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1616
01:38:35,023 --> 01:38:38,550
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1617
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:41,686
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1618
01:38:41,763 --> 01:38:44,459
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1619
01:38:44,532 --> 01:38:47,831
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1620
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:52,367
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1621
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,595
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1622
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:17,593
Better try it again.

1623
01:39:20,368 --> 01:39:22,700
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1624
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:35,705
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1625
01:39:44,726 --> 01:39:47,126
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1626
01:39:52,834 --> 01:39:56,793
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1627
01:39:56,871 --> 01:40:00,329
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1628
01:40:00,575 --> 01:40:03,806
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1629
01:40:03,878 --> 01:40:06,312
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1630
01:40:07,482 --> 01:40:09,211
until a minute ago...

1631
01:40:10,351 --> 01:40:12,979
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1632
01:40:14,589 --> 01:40:17,319
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1633
01:40:18,326 --> 01:40:20,886
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1634
01:40:20,962 --> 01:40:22,691
Just hold me close.

1635
01:40:29,137 --> 01:40:30,627
Goodbye, baby.

1636
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:26,521
Zachetti.

1637
01:41:28,696 --> 01:41:30,027
Come here.

1638
01:41:35,903 --> 01:41:37,564
I said, come here.

1639
01:41:40,308 --> 01:41:43,334
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

1640
01:41:43,411 --> 01:41:45,038
What do you want?

1641
01:41:45,113 --> 01:41:46,410
Look, kid.

1642
01:41:47,582 --> 01:41:50,847
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1643
01:41:51,018 --> 01:41:53,077
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1644
01:41:53,154 --> 01:41:54,746
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1645
01:41:54,822 --> 01:41:56,915
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1646
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:58,754
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1647
01:41:58,826 --> 01:42:01,386
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1648
01:42:01,462 --> 01:42:02,554
She isn't worth a nickel.

1649
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:05,121
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1650
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:06,223
Tough, aren't you?

1651
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,325
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1652
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:10,165
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1653
01:42:10,438 --> 01:42:12,998
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1654
01:42:13,074 --> 01:42:15,599
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1655
01:42:15,676 --> 01:42:17,906
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1656
01:42:17,979 --> 01:42:21,244
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1657
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:23,508
Go on. That way.

1658
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:35,922
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1659
01:42:37,298 --> 01:42:38,356
It's cold.

1660
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:44,029
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1661
01:42:44,105 --> 01:42:46,232
or if they've found her
by now.

1662
01:42:47,909 --> 01:42:51,208
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1663
01:42:55,483 --> 01:42:58,475
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1664
01:42:59,353 --> 01:43:04,290
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1665
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:09,657
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1666
01:43:14,268 --> 01:43:17,066
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1667
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,507
Hello, Keyes.

1668
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:32,578
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1669
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:37,354
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1670
01:43:38,092 --> 01:43:41,255
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1671
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:42,921
The janitor did.

1672
01:43:43,764 --> 01:43:46,392
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1673
01:43:46,467 --> 01:43:47,559
Yeah.

1674
01:43:48,035 --> 01:43:49,900
Wouldn't be surprised.

1675
01:43:51,339 --> 01:43:54,900
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1676
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:56,675
So I gather.

1677
01:43:58,346 --> 01:44:01,713
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

1678
01:44:01,782 --> 01:44:04,774
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1679
01:44:05,686 --> 01:44:07,677
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1680
01:44:07,755 --> 01:44:10,189
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1681
01:44:10,825 --> 01:44:13,555
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1682
01:44:14,829 --> 01:44:17,423
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1683
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:21,401
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1684
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:24,400
Let's have it, Keyes.

1685
01:44:25,773 --> 01:44:28,970
Walter, you're all washed up.

1686
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:34,104
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1687
01:44:35,449 --> 01:44:37,576
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1688
01:44:39,787 --> 01:44:42,415
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1689
01:44:43,491 --> 01:44:46,153
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1690
01:44:46,227 --> 01:44:49,628
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1691
01:44:49,697 --> 01:44:51,289
Is that it, Keyes?

1692
01:44:51,365 --> 01:44:53,026
Something like that.

1693
01:44:54,001 --> 01:44:56,299
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?

1694
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:57,735
Look, Keyes.

1695
01:44:58,105 --> 01:45:00,505
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1696
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:02,940
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1697
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:05,604
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1698
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,274
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1699
01:45:08,549 --> 01:45:12,485
Give me one good reason. I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1700
01:45:12,553 --> 01:45:15,750
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

1701
01:45:16,657 --> 01:45:19,558
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1702
01:45:19,627 --> 01:45:21,185
Good enough to try for.

1703
01:45:21,262 --> 01:45:24,698
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

1704
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:26,889
Just watch me.

1705
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:29,496
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1706
01:45:29,737 --> 01:45:30,726
So long, Keyes.

1707
01:46:00,368 --> 01:46:01,665
Hello...

1708
01:46:01,736 --> 01:46:04,364
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1709
01:46:06,574 --> 01:46:08,542
Yeah. It's a police job.

1710
01:46:28,362 --> 01:46:30,922
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.

1711
01:46:33,167 --> 01:46:36,694
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1712
01:46:37,271 --> 01:46:39,000
They're on the way.

1713
01:46:43,344 --> 01:46:45,972
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1714
01:46:46,046 --> 01:46:47,536
I'll tell you.

1715
01:46:48,082 --> 01:46:51,347
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1716
01:46:51,419 --> 01:46:54,047
He was right across
the desk from you.

1717
01:46:54,255 --> 01:46:56,246
Closer than that, Walter.

1718
01:47:00,394 --> 01:47:01,918
I love you, too.
