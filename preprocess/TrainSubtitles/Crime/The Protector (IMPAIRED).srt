1
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,284
Those are the four Jatubaht warriors

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,428
that protect the King's elephant.

3
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,279
why do they have to protect it?

4
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:51,582
the elephant is so big! Who can hurt it?

5
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,172
because the King is riding on the elephant

6
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,600
that is why we have to be careful at the bottom.

7
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,688
careful of what Dad?

8
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,179
you see,

9
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,050
if we lose our sword we need to use Muay:

10
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:07,934
throw, sit, cut, grab, break

11
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:09,764
careful of what Dad?

12
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:11,611
i can't tell you now

13
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,015
but im going to be Jatubaht

14
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:15,946
so i must know!

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,076
not now Kham,

16
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,953
but one day you'll know.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,760
sawadee krup [hello sir]

18
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040

splash here son

23
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,554
Dad! Por Yai [Big Father] is bullying me again!

24
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,767
Por Yai, you're bullying him?

25
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:47,759
Por Yai don't bully him!

26
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,658
splash here

27
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:10,492
Dad im here!

28
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:11,376
come join

29
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,581
Dad! Dad! Where is Por Yai going?

30
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,334
let him be Kham

31
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:49,849
pull it tight

32
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,653
pull it tight

33
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:53,414
yeah yeah

34
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:55,688
like that

35
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:38,769
if, one day, Dad has the chance to offer Por Yai to the King

36
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,120
it would be the greatest thing ever to happen to me

37
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:50,839
at least it wont be a waste, to be born into a Jatubaht warrior family

38
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,971
Khon! Look at this! Is it pretty?

39
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,938
this year Songkran [Thai New Year] should be fun

40
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:43,017
Mr Sutem is hosting everything

41
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,080
hosting a huge party!

42
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:48,109

43
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:50,850
its actually good, returning
favors to the villagers

44
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:54,468
Koi! Hey there is going
to be an elephant examination

45
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,872
why dont you take your elephant there?

46
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,720
maybe you'll get good luck!

47
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,228
say your farewell to Por Yai, Kham

48
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:17,577
tommorow after the examination we may never see him again.

49
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,778
it is your chance, dont worry about us.

50
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,687

94
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:01,152
Kham, go look for Por Yai.

95
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:07,611
hey!

96
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:10,851
who the fuck are you?

97
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,263
have you met with a foot before?

98
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:26,260
go! Go!

99
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,421
go! Go!

100
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,629
where are Por Yai and Khon?

101
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:19,808
where are they?!

102
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,379
you don't know!?

103
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,516
Johnny took them!

104
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,092

105
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,476

111
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,175
sawadee ka

112
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:56,359
how much are they?

113
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,341
you want some mangoes?

114
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:00,558
don't worry about it

115
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:01,970
here, take them!

116
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:02,746
how much?

117
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:03,810
don't worry

118
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,019
oh, you sure that's okay?

119
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,185
of course, don't worry!

120
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,585
since you insist, i'll take another two

121
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:10,014
thankyou very much

122
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:10,843
you're welcome

123
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,126
your face looks like you've been holding in a shit all day!

124
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,270
shit, Tui! You stupid twat!

125
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:12,846
what the hell are you doing?

126
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,600
sergeant, how'd you know it was me?

127
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:16,044
you have such a long face

128
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:17,068
who wouldn't recognise you

129
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,212
drop the gun!

130
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:20,092
don't come any closer

131
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,384
or i'll shoot you sergeant!

132
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,076
hey... I don't care if you shoot me

133
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,790
but... your Mum

134
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,701
if your Mum comes, you're going to be dead

135
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:26,870
she comes, you're dead

136
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:28,868
don't try to trick me

137
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,144
my Mum's not here!

138
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:31,848
not here? Really! Look behind you

139
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,368
go, go, go! damn you!

140
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:37,310
go, go, go!

141
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:41,806
shit, when was it cut?

142
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:43,004
fuck it, why didn't you tell me...

143
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,294
from the front door to the room

144
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,705
we have people on guard every ten metres

145
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:41,768
Uncle, I have already prepared everything

146
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:46,133
I hired the best cook in this town,
especially to make Pao Hue soup

147
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,729
for our other important guests to eat also

148
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:52,302
I hope that everyone will enjoy it, especially you Uncle

149
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,366
eat up, so you will have good health

150
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:56,694
when you are in good health

151
00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:00,247
you will continue to manage the business
of our family for a long time to come

152
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,310
you sure this is Pao Hue?

153
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,093
not salty, doesn't smell good,
not sweet, tastes like a worm!

154
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,248
you all know worms?

155
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,183
crawling creature that has
both sexes in a single body

156
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:33,328
you who could do anything?! what has happened to you, Rose?

157
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:36,355
you can't even take care of the taste of the food

158
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,464
how are you going to protect me?

159
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:43,817
my personal safety is now the concern of Cheun

160
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:50,937
ever since her Father died,
Cheun has taken care of this anyway

161
00:30:53,975 --> 00:30:57,151
her actions are considered as not respectful to others

162
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,857
all the people that we will be talking to
are representatives from the government

163
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:04,724
if we are on the same side with them

164
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:07,892
our business has a massive potential for growth

165
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,709
and for you, you can take care of a small restaurant

166
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:17,630
for you, even this should be enough, Rose

167
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,380
that stupid old man! He embarasses me in front of everyone!

168
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:30,588
he's not crazy

169
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:34,345
and there is no need to rush

170
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,361
when you already have this thing, haven't you

171
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:50,215
i think my fate is greater than that old man's fate

172
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,507
what you doing round here?

173
00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:14,984
what? You're Thai?

174
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:16,935
well , I'm speaking Thai!

175
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,230
where do you think I'm from?!

176
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,970
are you an illegal immigrant in Sydney?

177
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,799
no, I'm looking for Por Yai and my brother

178
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:24,906
looking for your relatives?

179
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:25,606
yes!

180
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:27,169
what do they look like?

181
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:28,602
chang [elephant]

182
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:35,045
chang? hmm... that name sounds familiar

183
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,523
let's just go talk down at the station

184
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:46,837
sawadee ka

185
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:47,936
how's it going Goong?

186
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:49,870
getting alot of customers?

187
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:50,811
not at all!

188
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,989
it's because you never come and support my restaurant

189
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:54,076
I'm very busy at work

190
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,887
hey, look we have a new promotion for lunch

191
00:37:57,771 --> 00:37:59,024
i'll make sure I come when I'm free

192
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:03,265
the name of the restaurant is Thai

193
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:05,681
Tom yum goong soup is even thai food

194
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,834
I wonder why they let a Vietnamese like Johnny be the manager?

195
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:11,347
Johnny! Johnny!

196
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,219
see you later

197
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,848
ok, back to work

198
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:17,917
me too

199
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:22,294
hey, don't cause problems

200
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,659
follow him! Hurry!

201
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:24,606
quiet, quiet

202
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:30,391
they're the ones who kidnapped Por Yai and Korn

203
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:31,915
you don't have any evidence

204
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:33,495
you can't accuse someone just like that

205
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,917
I have a picture but it's in the taxi

206
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:37,886
don't be so sure, we'll talk at the station

207
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,511
Johnny! Where the hell are my elephants?

208
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:20,755
give me back my elephants!

209
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:44,024
Johnny! Give me back my elephants!

210
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:52,099
hey, I want to warn you since were both Thai

211
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,359
dont mess with them, they're big trouble

212
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,214
damn! Your face gets scarier every day

213
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,160
the King is riding the elephant

214
00:49:45,898 --> 00:49:47,885
that is why we have to be careful at the bottom

215
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:52,909
enemies will attack there

216
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:00,838
the four Jatubaht warriors will protect the elephants legs.

217
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:07,186
what's the crucial technique dad?

218
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:14,856
one day... you'll know Kham.

219
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:40,291
Tui?

220
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:42,642
what the fuck are you doing?

221
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:45,156
sergeant... they forced me... I...
