1
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,712
(Male voice) I`m very
honored to introduce

2
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,815
our guest lecturer today.

3
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,386
He graduated from here
about 15 years ago.

4
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,330
He`s gone on to a fabulous career.

5
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,391
I can `t think of a single
person who `s more qualified

6
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,632
or more adept at the final procedures

7
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,674
you`ve been studying lately.

8
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,334
Now you`ve learned the science,

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,176
now`s your chance to learn the art.

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,705
Students, Mr. Bernie Tiede.

11
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,353
Thank you, Professor.

12
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,015
Thank you.

13
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,923
It`s always an honor to be asked back

14
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,484
and I do it gladly because I feel..

15
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,497
if even one thing I
say or demonstrate today

16
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:42,001
helps you in any way as
you embark on your careers,

17
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,195
then everyone will have benefited.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,865
You, those who are grieving,

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,932
and the deceased.

20
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,970
The nails have to be clipped,

21
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,311
shaped and brought back to life.

22
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,216
And you must cast the
nails to the person.

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,878
You wouldn`t want a mechanic

24
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,013
to have the nails of a flight attendant.

25
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,113
Would you?

26

[machine buzzing]

28
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,853
It is very important to
remove any unwanted nasal,

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,390
ear, or facial hair.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,402
We can never be too vigilant

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,033
in the Iookout for that
one stray rogue hair.

32
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,542
[blows]

33
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,408
The eyes are often a minor problem

34
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,640
because they usually want to stay open.

35
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,175
It`s almost Iike they want one
Iast Iook at this miraculous world.

36
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,414
But with some Super GIue..

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,082
a Iittle dab will do you..

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,594
and it`s no more peeking.

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,995
Even though the features have
been set during the embalming,

40
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,999
you have to reassess and readjust

41
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:55,235
because of continuing
emaciation and dehydration.

42
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,333
Perfect expression of the mouth

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,868
would be relaxed, natural,
with a Iittle bit of a smile.

44
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,813
Can`t have him Iooking
unhappy to be there.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,752
And we must always be on guard
for the mischievous lip drift.

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,948
Even the slightest hint
of teeth can be disastrous.

47
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:16,621
You cannot have grief
tragically become a comedy.

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,358
Then, after a foundation

49
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:23,630
mixed with massage cream
to prevent dehydration,

50
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,796
even out coloration,

51
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,807
then apply highlights.

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,070
Do not over-cosmetize.

53
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,307
Most of those who service the
deceased apply far too much blush.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,371
Just a note to always remember:

55
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,577
too much color does not
make one Iook more alive.

56
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,449
The last detail to be managed

57
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,251
is the deceased`s body position.

58
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,554
Left hand over the right,

59
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,561
over the umbilicus,
in an attitude of ease,

60
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,620
of repose, of retirement.

61
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,065
The position of the
head is oh so important.

62
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,726
Neither star gazing

63
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,270
nor navel gazing,

64
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,861
but perfectly centered,

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,670
turned ever so slightly to the right..

66
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,334
in greeting.

67
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,774
He`s now been cosmetized,

68
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,747
he`s ready to be dressed,

69
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,979
and casketed.

Bernie was a very charismatic man.

81
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,490
A Ioving person.

82
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,825

out, ready to shake it,

90
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,247
good with questions.

91
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,152
He could remember if your
daughter was at Texas,

92
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,315
and your son was at A&M.

93
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,086
He`d remember that and he`d ask
you questions about those kids.

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,390

So people were drawn
to him all the time.

And because of that, that personality,

(male voice) Carthage is in east Texas.

118
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,945
And it`s totally different
from the rest of Texas,

119
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,545
which could be five
different states, actually.

120
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,822
You got your west T exas out
there with a bunch of flat ranches.

121
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:14,595
Up north, you got them Dallas
snobs with their Mercedes,

122
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,830
and then you got Houston,

123
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,465
all the way up to Louisiana.

124
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,704
Then down south, San Antonio, uh,

125
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,940
that`s where the Tex meets the Mex.

126

And, and, and truth be
known, it`s a good place.

134
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,132
Carthage has such a good reputation

135
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,078
that it`s Iisted in The Best
small Towns of America, volume Two

136
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,674
as the best small town in T exas.

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,514
That`s right. Page 157.

Oh, hell, most people Iive in
Carthage because they were born here.

139

Carthage sits on what was once one of
the biggest gas fields in the world.

140

as much as I Ioved football and whatnot.

Look at these green
benches. I Iove them.

00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,433
Yeah, we changed those.

00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,538
and I was a Iittle worried
about this green. I don`t know.

165
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,207
People don`t complain.

166
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,216
I..I don`t either, I
think they`re great.

167
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,823
Oh, I hit the jackpot with that guy.

168
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,725
He`s the most qualified
young man I ever met.

169
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,888
He was excellent at removals,

170
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,898
an artist in the embalming room,

171
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,991
could fix hair like
nobody in the business.

172
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,002
Waited well on the families
in the morning parlor,

173
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,265
could sing like a bird.

174
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,966
He ran a funeral like a professional,

175
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,565
any aspect of the funeral business:

176
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,439
eulogizing, scripture reading,

177
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,002
singing..man, he could do it.

178
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,809
(male voice) But most of all,

179
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,817
we `re gonna remember
Fred as our friend.

180
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,412
Our..really..close..friend.

181
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,830
[murmuring]

182
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:22,815
[soft clear voice]? Amazing grace?

183
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,484
? How sweet the sound?

184
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,792
? That saved a wretch?

185
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:36,392
? Like me?

186
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,731
[singing continues in background]

187
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,668
I`II walk you to your car.

188
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,731
You poor thing.

189
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,571
This is so hard.

190
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,842
It`s just so hard.

191
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,906
You`re very brave.

192
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,417
Here now.

193
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,544
(female voice) Oh, honey,

194
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,144
he was a magician.

195
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,248
He made all of us just Iook beautiful.

196
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:03,192
I mean, he could make your
wrinkles all just go away,

197
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,062
and he would, if, if you had a overbite,

198
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,760
he`d fix it so it wouldn`t
be so sticky outie.

199
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:14,101
And he would, um.. take a
bouquet of small white roses

200
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,004
and put it in your hand.

201
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,772
I mean, he just made
everybody Iook so beautiful.

202
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,679
Except too bad you were dead.

203
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,910
It seemed Iike no matter
what happened to us,

204
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,215
whether it was car
wrecks or heart attacks

205
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:33,054
or household poisons, or guns Ieft
Iocked and Ioaded around the house,

206
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,956
or choking on a Iittle piece of meat,

207
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,621
in the end, he always made us Iook good.

208
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,927
Oh, you name the song, he`d sing it.

209
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,059
If country folks came in requesting
an old gospel, he`d sing it.

210
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,296
Or trailer trash came in
requesting Loretta Lynn,

211
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,236
he`d sing that, too.

212
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,968
But as great as Bernie was
at performing a service,

213
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,805
he was even better at sales.

214
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,742
If you pardon my reach, Mrs. Thompson,

215
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,474
this is a memory drawer.

216
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,539
It wasn`t bullshit, he really believed

217
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,174
that all those little
touches were necessary.

218
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,742
He even came up with this idea:

219
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,310
for 150 extra..

220
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,152
``Oh, that I had wings Iike a dove,

221
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,661
I would fly away and be at rest.``

222
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,563
At this moment, as the casket
descends into the ground,

223
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,997
we now release a white dove

224
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,399
symbolizing Mr. Callahan`s soul..

225
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,994
passing on to the next world,

226
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,403
to the mystery of the great beyond.

227
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,948
[flat voice] Yes, I agree,

228
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,080
that is a Iot of money
to put down in advance.

229
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,352
But there`s a right way and
a wrong way to approach this.

230
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,360
It was his idea to put up
more crosses on the wall

231
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,521
and change the lighting,

232
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,326
make it feel more like a
church or a sacred place,

233
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,491
Iess like a business or an office.

234
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,127
Were you thinking
interment or cremation?

235
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,465
I beg your pardon?

236
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,165
He means buried or burned.

237
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,367
Buried. We already have the plots.

238
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,137
I am so happy for you.

239
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,178
Can I tell you, I am
not fond of cremations.

240
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,612
I just don`t Iike the idea
of someone spending eternity

241
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,842
in something the size
of a motel ice bucket.

242
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,817
I`d just soon drop you in a ditch

243
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,875
by the side of the road.

244
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,215
Hey.

245
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,550
I want to keep it simple.

246
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,386
Yeah, this is..this is fine.

247
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,619
- I see.
- Yeah.

248
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,025
Now, these composite wood with
cloth we sell mostly to the county

249
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,725
to bury the unclaimed, the indigent,

250
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,734
and also no warranty, of course.

251
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,167
Warranty?

252
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,669
Oh, with our better caskets,

253
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,706
we, uh, guarantee that your remains

254
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,071
will be untouched by
rainwater, pesky insects,

255
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,906
burrowing animals searching for food..

256
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,242
AIso, now tall are you, Mr. Eccles?

257
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,338
About 6`2``.

258
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,246
Oh, dear.

259
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,751
These economy boxes are not very Iarge.

260
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,414
We may have to make a Ieg
adjustment to get a proper fit.

261
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,354
Leg adjustment?

262
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,255
Well, not necessarily break
the Iegs but definitely

263
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,089
- bend the feet..
- No! No,

264
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,822
I..I won`t have it.

265
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,763
Then may I suggest..

266
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,266
the Corinthian.

267
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:00,067
? Just as I am?

268
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,197
? Without one?

269
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,004
I`m pretty sure the first
time Bernie met Mrs. Nugent

270
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,374
was at the time of Mr. Nugent`s funeral.

271
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,438
? Was shared for me?

272
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,714
? And that thou be come?

273
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,618
Her husband, Dwayne,

274
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,420
he was just a tough old typical old man.

275
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:25,225
And he Iiked to do
business just a handshake,

276
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,525
He would say things like..

277
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,863
I`II
guaran-damn-tee yah..

278
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:33,303
He was some kind of exploration
guy with a big oil company

279
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,136
and he made a whole Iot
of money back in the 60s.

280
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,369
He was too tight to spend any of it

281
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,072
but he Iiked to invest his
money in everything he could.

282
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:46,209
? T o thee who`s blood can cleanse?

283
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,153
? Each spot o` Iand?

284
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,658
As a matter of fact, he even
bought a bank here in town.

285
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,162
I believe it was `87,
he bought the bank.

286
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,323
He run that sucker with a hard fist.

287
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,798
Just, I mean, he was kinda..

288
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,269
abrupt, and the way..

289
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,929
I appreciate it.

290
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,133
the way he done business and stuff.

291
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,335
Of course, then after he
died, well, then she took over

292
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,006
and she started having
a position that he had

293
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,174
and if it was said that he was kinda

294
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,684
disliked in the way he did business,

295
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,187
you`d have to say that
she was literally hated,

296
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,916
`cause that old heifer,

297
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,982
she turned down Ioans just for a hobby.

298
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,862
She was just a mean old hateful bitch.

299
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,528
Hey. There`s just no
other way to put it.

300
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,195
She wasn`t friendly.

301
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,330
She..she really wasn`t,

302
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,808
and she probably.. there
are people in town, honey,

303
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,210
that woulda shot her for
five dollars, ya know?

304
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,214
I mean, when you Iive in a small town,

305
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,546
you`ve got to be friendly
and nice to folks.

306
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,348
She would chew your ass
at the drop of a hat.

307
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,446
I mean, she`d rip you a brand new

308
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,185
three bedroom two bath double
wide asshole. No problem.

309
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,786
In the fourteenth chapter
of the book of John,

310
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,660
Jesus said, ``Let not
your heart be troubled.``

311
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,223
Well, I heard that she hadn`t talked

312
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,826
to her sisters in over 20 years

313
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,531
but when the mother died,

314
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,573
she was right in there fightin ` them

315
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,903
over quilts and chairs.

316
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,376
Can you believe that?

317
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,347
And one of the sisters even wanted
to donate land to the church,

318
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,474
but she interfered

319
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,519
because she didn `t want
the church to have it.

320
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,577
She didn`t Iike that pastor.

321
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,091
He wore Bermuda shorts on his day off.

322
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,887
(pastor) Friends and Ioved ones..

323
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,053
Everybody in town

324
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,097
knew that Mr. and Mrs.
Nugent weren`t exactly friends

325
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,428
with their son Dwayne
Junior and his family.

326
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,060
He was a doctor out in Middleton,
almost never came to visit.

327
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,502
One of his daughters had
actually sued her grandparents

328
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,836
trying to get at the
money in that trust.

329
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,104
That made her so mad she never
spoke to any of them again.

330
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,077
Let us pray.

331
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:58,549
Marjorie Nugent. she was..

332
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,053
not a very nice Iady
and her nose was so high

333
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,249
she`d drown in a rainstorm.

334
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,919
Mrs. Margy, she was the kind of person

335
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,895
that I believe she was born old.

336
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,023
She was just born with this prune face.

337
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,260
That`s pretty much the
impression people got from her.

338
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,133
I got a buddy of mine, Louie.

339
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,230
He`s a decent fellow I work for.

340
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,639
Mrs. Nugent took a
broom to his ass one day.

341
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,905
Would you Iike me to get
up and do the back in there?

342
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,140
- Get out.
- Ooh.

343
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,308
[inaudible]

344
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,544
Oh.

345
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,789
- Beautiful service.
- Thank you.

346
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,917
- I`II see you on Sunday.
- Thank you very much.

347
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,656
[deep sigh]

348
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,789
He was great
with the D-L-O-Ls.

349
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,390
That`s what we all called the
``dear little old ladies. ``

350
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,993
All the widows in town
had crushes on Bernie.

351
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,904
Just thought I `d bring you a hankie.

352
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,736
Oh, yeah, old Bernie.

353
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,573
H e Ioved to hug and
kiss on those older women.

354
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:05,207
At his age now, they were Iucky
to get the time of day from him.

355
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:14,419
[deep sigh]

356
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,154
Hi.

357
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,856
Hi, Mrs. Nugent, I just, uh..

358
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,762
wanted you to know I
was thinking about you.

359
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,927
- These times can be hard.
- Oh, thank you.

360
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,594
Okay.

361
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,195
I never asked him to do this and

362
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,331
he wasn`t getting paid to do it,

363
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,137
but he would always stop
by and check on the widows

364
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,871
after he `d done their
husbands ` funerals.

365
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,640
He just really cared about them.

366
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,943
I mean, that guy was just a sweet guy,

367
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,846
and they just Ioved him to death.

368
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,623
[knocking]

369
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,691
Room service.

370
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,026
Hi, l`m just dropping
by again, Mrs. Nugent,

371
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,292
to pay my respects.

372
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,129
I brought you some soaps

373
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,964
and a Iittle bubble bath
to soothe you in the tub,

374
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,595
and some chocolate cupcakes
for a Iate night snack.

375
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,129
Come in.

376
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,801
Oh! That..would be my pleasure.

377
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,505
[clears throat]

378
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,841
[slurps]

379
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,814
[classical music playing]

380
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,578
In high school I wanted
to be an evangelist

381
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,415
to save the souls of my fellow students.

382
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,887
A Iot of them were
starting to drink and smoke

383
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,151
and ride motorcycles

384
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,058
and have premarital sexual
experiences and all that.

385
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,652
- Oh, yes please!
- Here you go, Bernie.

386
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,756
Thank you, Esmeralda.

387
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,357
When.

388
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,029
Miss Marjorie?

389
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,539
[sigh]

390
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,074
One time I got four teenagers

391
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,736
to re-dedicate their Iives to Jesus,

392
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,577
but eventually I realized I was meant
for other equally important things.

393
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,412
Oh, please, Bernie,

394
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,078
touching all those cold
bloated bodies. PIease!

395
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,247
Don`t you think you were
meant to do something more?

396
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,018
No, no, no, no, Mrs. Nugent.

397
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,116
It isn`t bad at all.

398
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,685
Their souls are already with the
Lord by the time I`m involved.

399
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,458
It`s just my way to serve

400
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,896
and show respect for the lives they led

401
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,126
and comfort all the Ioved ones

402
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,259
that they Ieave behind.

403
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,465
[deep sigh] Well.

404
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,770
And some day, if I`m Iucky,
many many years from now,

405
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,811
I will give you such
a beautiful funeral..

406
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,973
with all the roses in East Texas.

407
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,486
I know it`II be the event
of the season in Carthage.

408
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,885
You know, I think
that Bernie was the one

409
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:29,485
that got Marjorie back to
church after her husband died.

410
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,324
(female voice) Well,
I know the Bible says

411
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,887
Jesus turned water into wine,

412
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,299
but it didn`t say Iiquor store wine.

413
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,100
It had to have been non-alcoholic wine,

414
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,006
because it didn`t have time to ferment.

415
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,340
If Jesus could walk on the water,

416
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,778
he could make any kind
of wine he wanted to.

417
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,281
Fermented or not.

418
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,011
Right on the spot.

419
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,177
(male voice) Morning, ladies.

420
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,585
Sorry to interrupt.

421
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,021
Mrs. Marjorie, it is so good to
have you with us this morning.

422
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,718
I just want to put a
bug in your ear now.

423
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,160
Many of you know we`re
hoping to start construction

424
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,163
on our new prayer wing soon.

425
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,199
[several] Mmm.

426
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,859
Well, l`m hoping l can
count on a few of you

427
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,369
to join the fundraising committee. Okay?

428
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,302
Think about it, now. God bless you.

429
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,833
[all singing]? This is
my story This is my song?

430
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,176
? Praising my savior AII the day Iong?

431
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:27,480
? This is my story This is my song?

432
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:31,716
? Praising my savior AII the day Iong?

433
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,727
[sings alone]? Perfect
submission Perfect delight?

434
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,061
? Visions of rapture
Now burst on my sight?

435
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,399
? Angels descending Bring from above?

436
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,531
? Echoes of mercy Whispers of love?

437
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,840
? This is my story This is my song?

438
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:58,212
? Praising my savior AII the day Iong?

439
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,445
(Mrs. Nugent) Uh-uh,
no, we `ll take my car.

440
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,249
No, I insist.

441
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,416
Don`t be silly, Bernie.

442
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,152
Good, I`II see you Saturday afternoon.

443
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,921
I`m..I`m Iooking forward to it, too.

444
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:14,489
Okay, Mrs. Nugent, bye.

445
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,204
Oh, so sweet.

446
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,039
That was Bernie Tiede, the
assistant funeral director.

447
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,204
He`s very sweet and very nice to me.

448
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,944
Can`t think of anyone who`s
been that nice to me in 50 years.

449
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,952
Now, you!

450
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,612
You`ve got two minutes to
explain these accounts to me.

451
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,349
Or three minutes from now

452
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,288
I just might get myself
another stockbroker.

453
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,589
I can explain everything, Miss Marjorie.

454
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,720
It`s a very simple case of them
changing their accounting statements.

455
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,027
They changed their
formatting, it`s re-formatted..

456
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,761
in a different format.

457
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,065
Hey, listen.

458
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,072
I couldn`t help but hear
the end of that conversation.

459
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,074
I gotta tell you, Bernie,

460
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,734
you have got to be about
the bravest man in this town.

461
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,142
She isn`t all that
mean Iike everyone says.

462
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,646
Now you sure about that?

463
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,477
Well, she doesn`t have anyone, Don.

464
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,484
She`s a very Ionely
person. She needs someone.

465
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,417
I`ve asked her to
accompany me this Saturday

466
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,979
to the Van CIyburn Piano
Competition in Fort Worth.

467
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,321
Well, have fun.

468
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,793
Ain`t Iike she`s the
richest widow in town.

469
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,762
Hell, maybe she`II
even pay for everything.

470
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,923
- Don!
- Hey..

471
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,661
And if she does offer
to pay for everything,

472
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,465
order up a couple of them
bottles of Dom Perignon.

473
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,005
You get her Iiquored up,

474
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,097
[whispering] you might get Iucky.

475
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,472
No, Don!

476
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,774
He sincerely believed that..

477
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,145
it was better to give than to receive.

478
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,309
Well, Bernie had a problem with money.

479
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,650
He was generous. some
folks say overly generous.

480
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,247
What he was was a buy-aholic.

481
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,849
And, uh..hell, he `d walk into a store,

482
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,361
seen something he
Iiked, he`d buy the store

483
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,523
out of every goddamn item he wanted

484
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,031
and give the shit away.

485
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,863
And that`s crazy.

486
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,698
But that Bernie, he Iiked
to make people smile.

487
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,396
He wanted friends.

488
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,031
Acceptance, I guess,
is what you call it.

489
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,769
And Bernie could do just about anything.

490
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,301
I mean, he could hang
wallpaper in people`s houses,

491
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,974
and I`ve never seen any man do this,

492
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,313
but he could make curtains for people

493
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,512
and he was the head honcho

494
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,612
for the Chamber of Commerce

495
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,782
Christmas decorating committee.

496
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,622
That`s a big thing in
Carthage, too, a big thing.

497
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,457
Bernie was really smart.

498
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,123
H e helped people do their
tax returns, you know,

499
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,030
financial counseling..

500
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,965
Anything that you pay for on the job

501
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,129
that the company, the oil company

502
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,298
doesn`t reimburse you for,
that`s a tax deduction.

503
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,399
So, for instance, Toby,
these work coveralls,

504
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,910
did the company provide you with these?

505
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,639
No, we got to buy our own.

506
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,181
Bingo. That is a tax deduction.

507
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,080
And how about your Iunch buckets

508
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,709
and your steel toe workboots,
they give you those?

509
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,754
- Why, hell no.
- That`s what I thought.

510
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,413
- You kidding
me? - Uh-uh.

511
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,253
That`s tax deduction
number two and three.

512
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,350
(male voice) Thank
you, sheriff Huckabee.

513
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,725
You`re listening to KGAs,
the heartbeat of East Texas.

514
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,263
Now before we get to the
school cafeteria menu,

515
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,892
and the wedding
anniversaries for the week,

516
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,404
here`s Bernie Tiede from
Leggett Funeral Home.

517
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,496
Thank you, Jerry.

518
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,336
As some of you are already aware,

519
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,273
Mr. Harvey Gunnolds Ieft
this world all too soon

520
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,904
this past Wednesday after
a brief hospital stay.

521
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,073
I used to Iove having him on the air.

522
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:21,414
I mean, every Friday people
would tune in just to hear Bernie.

523
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,681
And when he did the obituaries,

524
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,191
it wasn`t Iike a so-and-so was
survived by so-and-so kind of thing.

525
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,352
It was..Iet`s see if I can remember..

526
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,726
Left in sorrow to mourn the
passing of the beloved Mr. Gunnolds

527
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,265
are Mima Gunnolds, his mother, Georgia..

528
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,030
And the way he would make
them ``Iook good`` in death,

529
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,197
well, he`d make them sound good, too.

530
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,764
Like Gunnolds was a drunk,

531
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,969
always startin` shit wherever he went.

532
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,808
He finally got himself
killed in a pool hall.

533
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,314
Now how do you say something
nice about somebody Iike that?

534
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,648
Well, to Bernie, it
was, ``He was known..``

535
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,584
..for his social engagements and his..

536
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,145
conversational abilities..

537
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,316
A kid would wrap his car around a tree

538
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,122
and with Bernie it was..

539
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,822
..and yet, death slipped
up on young Mr. Shotwell,

540
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,831
as gentle as a fallen mist.

541
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:14,395
[crowd murmuring]

542
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,599
(female voice) What happened?

543
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,803
[inaudible dialog]

544
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,350
I regret to inform you

545
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:35,018
that four of your classmates
have just been killed.

546
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,754
Now this is gonna happen to you

547
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,286
if you drink and drive.

548
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,801
Is this what you want to happen to you?

549
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,860
(female voice) It didn`t
make no difference what it was

550
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,532
or who ask it, if it was
good for the community,

551
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,542
Bernie `d give it all he had.

552
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,771
All the time.

553
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,211
He was very serious about
his commitment to Carthage.

554
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,215
Life is so beautiful,

555
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,079
every moment a miracle,

556
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,052
and yet in a blink it`s gone.

557
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,850
T oo young. [inaudible]

558
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,187
[shouts to crowd] T oo young!

559
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:11,024
Oh, he really had a way of
bringing the community together.

560
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,291
Not just at the funerals
and at the church,

561
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:17,301
he organized a ``Beautify
Carthage`` campaign,

562
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,395
and he put on the very first
East T exas art festival

563
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,339
and invited artists from
all around the region

564
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,638
to display their works.

565
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,721
[inaudible]

566
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,691
Are these all..?

567
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,057
I`m sorry to stop you, are
these all done with that..

568
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,993
the, uh, what`s that called?

569
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,257
It`s all chain saw.

570
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,925
How do you do that?

571
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,332
I wake up in the morning with an idea

572
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,598
and cut away everything
that ain`t that idea.

573
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,162
Can I talk to you at some time?

574
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,037
- Do you have a card?
- Yeah.

575
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,666
Because I have an idea I
would Iove to commission.

576
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,540
I don`t know if you work that way, but..

577
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,603
Look at that card, he
put it on a piece of wood.

578
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,581
- I`m gonna call you.
- AIright.

579
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,617
- You`re a gem.
- Thank you.

580
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,913
Thank you. Okay.

581
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,510
- See you Iater.
- Bye.

582
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,282
Oh, yeah, Bernie took her everywhere.

583
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,055
He took her to the Van
CIyburn Competition,

584
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,958
took her up to the junior college

585
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,361
to see some of the rehearsals of shows

586
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,899
that he was working on.

587
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,127
Oh, yeah, he always had Mrs. Nugent.

588
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:29,697
? I`ve never Been in Iove before?

589
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:33,107
? Now all at once it`s you?

590
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:38,582
? It`s you forever more?

591
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,713
? l`ve never been In love before?

592
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,053
? I thought my Heart was safe?

593
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:51,152
(female voice) He had come to
a production in a local theater,

594
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,821
and he thought it could be better

595
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,331
so he volunteered to help out

596
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,598
and pretty soon he was the
musical director for one show,

597
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,467
a director in another one,

598
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,100
and an actor in almost all of them.

599
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,268
He just had a real knack for drama.

600
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:12,180
? PIease forgive this
H elpless haze I `m in?

601
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,583
? I `ve really never been?

602
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:21,353
? In Iove before?

603
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:26,989
??

604
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:32,469
(girl singing)? l`ve
never been In love before?

605
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,370
? Now all I want to be?

606
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,874
I saw them at a restaurant one time.

607
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,604
They was out to Iunch together, and he
reached over and kissed her on the cheek.

608
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,374
But it wasn`t a kiss Iike you
give your momma or your grandma.

609
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,144
It was more of a romantic,
sexual kiss to me, you know?

610
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:50,176
He had that graoning sound in the back
of his voice. It was kinda strange.

611
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,189
It just didn`t Iook right to me.

612
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,658
The word was it wasn`t
a week after the funeral

613
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:01,393
Mrs. Nugent gave Bernie Mr.
Nugent`s $12,000 Rolex watch.

614
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,334
Hell, for that kinda money,
I bet he did kiss her.

615
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,531
In a small town, people will always

616
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,006
suspect the worst of someone.

617
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,873
But they`II also suspect the best.

618
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,676
So we just thought they were companions.

619
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,740
Look, it was widely assumed

620
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,251
that Mrs. Nugent was paying Bernie

621
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,720
to ``accompany her`` places.

622
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,518
Oh, I`d estimate they spent

623
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,320
nearly a hundred thousand
a year on vacations.

624
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,191
They went to Russia,
Acapulco, New York City.

625
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,492
They went to Europe on the Queen Mary,

626
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,090
always first class, always some spa,

627
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,761
some resort, some..sittin` in some

628
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,933
hot spring mineral peeling water bath.

(female voice) Margy
looked so much better.

635
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,789
You see pictures of her
on these trips with Bernie.

636
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,629
she had nice hair, she looked good,

637
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,793
she seemed happy,

638
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:16,569
and she had Bernie to thank for that.

639
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:21,806
Marjorie realized she had
everything in front of her.

640
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,145
she could do anything
she wanted in her life,

641
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:30,586
and she wanted to travel.

642
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,783
[Marjorie, chuckling]

643
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,588
Money was no object

644
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,825
but unfortunately, she
had no friends or family

645
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,596
that she wanted to travel with.

646
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,503
Until she met Bernie.

647
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,337
Hey, I `II tell you one thing for sure.

648
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,104
On that trip to Belize,

649
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,111
they stayed in the same room.

650
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,669
And you know damn right well

651
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,444
they saw each other in their underwear.

652
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,677
And I know for sure

653
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,279
that when she went to Shreveport,

654
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:08,689
to get some sexy Iingerie
at Doris` Iingerie shop,

655
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,627
she got herself a see through nightgown

656
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,154
that showed her breasts.

657
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,463
I mean, give me a break.

658
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,934
What is a woman her age

659
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,436
wanting to do showing her boobs?

660
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,666
Seriously.

661
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,207
Disgusting.

662
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,547
Bernie was a Iittle effeminate.

663
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,051
I mean, an unmarried
man in his Iate 30s,

664
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,853
going to all the musicals with
a bunch of old blue-hairs..

665
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,486
Ah! You know, I heard that he was gay,

666
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,827
but he was such a good Christian man,

667
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,233
everybody thought, you
know, how could that be?

668
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,737
That dog don`t hunt. Nah.

669
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,296
There was always talk about Bernie being

670
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,171
a Iittle Iight in the Ioafers but..

671
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,540
I always thought he was celibate.

672
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,512
He was a nice-Iooking man and there
were Iots of girls in the community

673
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,810
who would`ve Ioved to
have a date with him,

674
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,850
but he never seemed to
show much interest in that.

675
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,580
He stayed busy all the
time and was working.

676
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,679
He had a tendency to hold on

677
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:16,090
to another man`s hands, touched
too Iong after shaking it,

678
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,856
and he had a subscription
to men`s fitness magazine.

679
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,591
Now if you`ve ever seen Bernie
Tedie, you know darn well

680
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,259
it wasn`t for the workout tips.

681
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,325
And when you see him around town,

682
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,598
if he wasn`t at the church or
at work in the funeral home,

683
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,267
he would always be where we these
doggone hemmed, starched shorts.

684
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,106
With his belt Iine.. above the navel.

685
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:39,172
And the kicker is he
always wore sandals.

686
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,411
Our Lord and Savior always wore sandals

687
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,545
and he never married.

688
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,283
And he had 12 disciples

689
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,418
and I don`t think any
of them ever married.

690
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,363
And the apostle Paul, he
was a Iifelong bachelor.

691
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,957
And you never heard
anybody in the New Testament

692
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,630
say that they was a bunch of queers.

693
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,571
[pfft] No.

694
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:07,476
No, he had homosexual relations.
I know that for a fact.

695
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,410
This ain`t San Francisco,

696
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,314
so around here we got a Iot
of ``closet homosexuals.``

697
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,217
And I know of at Ieast two men
that he had relationships with

698
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,551
that were heterosexual.

699
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,750
Were.

700
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,454
Now one of the main things
and why I have this job,

701
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,793
and why I feel like l`m good at it is,

702
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,889
you see, l`m naturally suspicious.

703
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:33,494
Sometimes I find myself waking
up in the middle of the night.

704
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,300
I`II be staring off

705
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,773
out through the backyard
into the woods and I..

706
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,434
I`II be thinking about
all the crime and mayhem

707
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,808
happening out there,

708
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,940
and that`s..that`s when I start
putting it together in my mind.

709
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,848
I stop the criminal.

710
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,285
I wait, I watch,

711
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,686
and I Iisten.

712
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,123
When the time`s just right..

713
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,492
[fftt] that`s when I pounce.

714
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,393
Ain`t nothing I enjoy more

715
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,262
than the sound of a criminal
that`s just wriggling

716
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,130
on the end of my hook, hey, you know,

717
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,000
and folks Iike to see the D.A. at work.

718
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,437
But no county ain`t gonna hire a D.A.

719
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:13,170
who doesn`t know that
this is a full time job.

720
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,712
AII the time.

721
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,773
One thing Danny Bucks is good at

722
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,842
is getting Danny Buck re-elected.

723
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,047
And he gets his Iittle
photo ops in the paper,

724
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,990
busting up the copper
rings or the hub-cap rings,

725
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,960
or the meth Iabs, but in slow times,

726
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,690
Danny Buck be out digging up some shit.

727
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,288
Let me show y`all something.

728
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,130
You`re gonna Iove this.

729
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:42,536
I call this my wheel of misfortune.

730
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,041
Now what I`ve done is,
I`ve assigned numbers

731
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,873
to all the suspected
drug dealers around here.

732
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:55,579
If your number comes up,

733
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:00,022
number eight, Danny Buck`s
come to get you first.

734
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,719
And not one of you dope
pushers is gonna get away.

735
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,059
Not one.

736
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,155
The best trick I ever pulled

737
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,723
is the time I arrested
five deadbeat dads

738
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,269
all at the same time.

739
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,828
You see, I was having
trouble finding them.

740
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,740
Actually, what I did is I used the
annual hands on a hardbody contest

741
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,607
the one at the Dodge dealership on 79?

742
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,374
People were standing
around for days and days

743
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,608
with their hands on the pick up truck,

744
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,412
and the last one with their
hand on the truck wins it.

745
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,045
What I did, is I got a rig

746
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,454
where they invited these five dads
who aren`t paying child support.

747
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,082
I figured the idea of a new truck

748
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,024
might get `em to come out of hiding.

749
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:41,690
Did it work?

750
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,290
You bet your butt it did.

I think we`d Iike to move
some out of financials

maybe a Iittle more Apple.

And we`d Iike to get a thousand
shares of Tommy Hilfiger.

What do you know about
stocks and investing?

Let me remind you: you bury people.

You`re a mortician. You`re
not an investment advisor.

763

No one uses the word
``mortician`` anymore, LIoyd.

764
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,838
It`s ``funeral director.``

Or in your case
assistantfuneral director.

Pardon me?

798
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,438
You know I have to take
my pills before eating.

799
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,273
You were supposed to bring them,

800
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,609
so where are they? Give them to me.

801
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,946
I`m sorry, Marjorie, there must
have been a Iittle misunderstanding.

802
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,814
I`d be happy to go to
your room and get them.

803
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,753
Excellent!

804
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,811
Okay.

805
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,187
Okay.

806
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,555
(male voice) she put his
name on all her bank accounts,

807
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,600
and then she gave him
a power of attorney,

808
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,263
which meant he could spend
her money any way he wanted to.

809
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,330
And he did.

810
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,866
[airplane motor running]

811
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,501
Been on the Iine for a while.

812
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,630
Won`t Iet go.

813
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,038
Hello, Marjorie, I..

814
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,202
I`m sorry, I`m sorry,
I thought I told you

815
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,678
what I was doing this morning.

816
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,214
Well, I don`t have my phone on

817
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,046
while I am up there. You know that.

818
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,847
I`m sure we won`t be Iate for Iunch,

819
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,184
but I`m on my way.

820
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,156
Okay. Bye-bye.

821
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,490
- This is my Iife.
- Okay.

822
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,721
[groan]

823
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,025
Somewhere along the way,

824
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,725
Mrs. Nugent convinced Bernie to
go to part time at the funeral home

825
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,392
and go working full-time for her.

826
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,403
She got rid of all the usual help

827
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,200
and it was just Bernie.

828
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,297
He was her business
manager, travel companion,

829
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,272
her servant.

830
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,349

[deep sigh]

00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,185
[door opens]

833
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,250
Bernie! You should`ve
been here hours ago!

834
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,354
But we still have time. We`II
be there on time, Marjorie.

835
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,092
I need you to go by the
cleaners and pick up my dress.

836
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,259
Now I`ve got to wear something else.

837
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,361
You fooling around with those
damn planes all the time, Bernie.

838
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,201
I told you I was going to be..

839
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,036
Okay, you told me. What
good does that do me?

840
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,099
Things change and I needed you here.

841
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,271
And because you never Ieave
your cell phone on all the time,

842
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,406
this is a pager.

843
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,780
You`re going to wear it on your
person at all times, correct?

844
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,615
- Correct.
- Go get me a dress.

845
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,017
- Okay.
- Hurry. Hurry.

846
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,453
Hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry.

847
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,683
Ugh.

848
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,633
Marjorie, please.

849
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,039
I can understand chewing
each bite of some food

850
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,874
25 times Iike chicken fried steak,

851
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,573
but I don`t think you have to chew

852
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,811
your refried beans that many times.

853
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,216
It doesn`t really make sense.

854
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,120
It`s unnecessary additional
work for your jaws.

855
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,089
Think of your poor TMJ muscle.

856
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,318
It can`t be good for it.

857
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,089
[sigh]

858
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,154
It`s inefficient. Think about it.

859
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,395
You this drives me crazy. PIease stop.

860
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,333
This is Iike nails on a chalkboard.

861
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,168
Okay, go ahead, chew Iike
that, chew Iike that all day.

862
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,674
[deep sigh] Ah!

863
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,835
Well, Bernie was so nice,

864
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,314
so accommodating,

865
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:11,014
so willing to keep from
hurting other people`s feelings,

866
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,081
he just couldn`t tell
anybody to piss off.

867
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,770
(Mrs. Nugent, distant)
Bernie, l`m still waiting.

868
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,654
Would you rather hear
``Drama in Real Life? ``

869
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,699
``Tips for Better
Summer T omatoes`` or..

870
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,928
Tips for Better Summer T omatoes.

871
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,731
``The best summer tomatoes..

872
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,931
she was demanding,

873
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,270
condescending,

874
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,333
even conniving.

875
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:45,041
And she had intentionally put
him in a dependent position.

876
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,016
She was jealous of his time,

877
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:51,919
envious of his community status,

878
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,015
and..overly generous to him.

879
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,061
So as to make him stick around.

880
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,620
(Bernie) so you just show
people around the boat?

881
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:02,962
All around the boat?

882
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,625
Yeah, I give tours.

883
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,465
And I bartend in the captain`s cabin.

884
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,300
- Oh, you have a Iot of jobs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,862
You`re a jack of all trades.

886
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,635
It`s good though. The money`s good.

887
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,472
Not bad. And you get
to see the world, right?

888
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,409
- Yeah, we do.
- That`s cool.

889
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,776
- Yeah.
- Marjorie?

Hello, Mrs. Nugent.

892
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,984
Bernie, we`re scheduled to be there now.

893
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,646
- I`m ready. Okay.
- Be still.

894
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,383
Okay. Do you want me to get this?

895
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,719
- Stop asking questions.
- Okay, you got it.

896
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,258
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

897
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,226
- Let`s go.
- Thank you.

898
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,922
- Let`s go, Iet`s go, Iet`s go.
- Nice talking to you.

Okay.

00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,084
Okay, everybody, Iet`s work on the
arrival of the Wells Fargo Wagon.

908
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,989
This wagon has all of
our instruments on it

909
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,425
so we`re very excited about it..

910
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,156
[pager buzzing] Uh-oh, hold on.

911
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,858
Grrr. So I want to have
a pulse on each beat,

912
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,093
and I want to have everybody`s
eyeline on the horizon

913
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,692
going Iike this and I
want some people to do this

914
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,328
because everyone`s doing this right now.

915
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,837
It`s Iooking a Iittle too uniform, okay?

916
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,034
One, two, three, four and oh!

917
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,169
And ho! That`s it. Okay.

918
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,770
Very good, relax the pose.

919
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,145
This is only going to take a second.

920
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,879
If I don`t call her, she
will give me Iiving hell.

921
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,286
Hello, Marjorie, how are you?

922
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,121
Mm-hm. Can I bring you anything?

923
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,660
Can it wait till right after rehearsal?

924
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,389
We got another 40..

925
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,397
Okay, right away. I`II be there.

926
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,365
Bye-bye. [deep sigh]

927
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,162
Can you clean this up?

928
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,497
I have to go right away. Thank you.

929
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,970
[deep sigh]

930
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,905
((Bernie) How`s it going, Carl?

931
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,779
OId Mrs. Nugent just fired me.

932
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,548
What happened?

933
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,088
She said I stole a Iawn mower.

934
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,590
Snuck it out to my place in Niggertown.

935
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,752
What?

936
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,193
Why does she think that?

937
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,890
Oh, she saw me Ieave with it,

938
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,229
I was taking it to get it fixed.

939
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,166
Let me talk to her, okay Carl?

940
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,863
Don`t go getting a new job just yet.

941
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:25,705
Okay. But I ain`t going back up there.

942
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,266
Not today anyway.

943
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,437
I don`t blame you.

944
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,448
I will get to the bottom of it
and I will call you back. Okay?

945
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,949
So sorry about this.

946
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,177
AIright.

947
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,059
Oh, you just pop up whenever
it`s convenient for you!

948
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,925
Just when you think it`s fine for you,

949
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,295
you come! Well, fine fine, fine, fine!

950
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,061
What happened with Carl?

951
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,295
I got rid of him! I
caught him red handed!

952
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,804
God knows what else he`s
been stealing from me, Bernie!

953
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,738
He says he was gonna get it fixed.

954
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,570
- That`s what he says.
- Well, I don`t think Carl..

955
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,773
And those flowers he`s
supposedly planted,

956
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,905
they were supposed to
bloom two weeks ago.

00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,951
He`s a Iazy good fer nothin`.
The man`s never done anything!

958
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,919
I don`t think that he would
ever do anything Iike..

959
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,320
Why are you stickin` up for his kind?

960
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,621
Marjorie, you`re making it
very hard to be your friend.

961
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,126
I`m gonna come back some other time.

962
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,288
Oh, just go ahead, desert me.

963
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,298
Just Iike everybody else, go
ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

964
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,266
Go, go, go! You hate me!

965
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,825
Marjorie, I am not going to take part

966
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,099
in this argument. You know [inaudible].

967
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,470
- I know you hate me!
- No!

968
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,338
Like everybody else!

969
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,434
[tires screeching]

970
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:38,311
[whimpering]

971
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,679
[click]

972
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,577
Oh.

973
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,660
Basically, it was like
Bernie became her property.

974
00:48:55,732 --> 00:49:00,260
You`II never Ieave me. Never.

975
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,533
He was her sole source of entertainment,

976
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,700
had to do everything for her.

977
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,540
I truly believe the guy felt
he was smothered, choked,

978
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,273
unable to get his wind.

979
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:14,374
I don`t know how the guy stood it. Well.

980
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,385
Come on, just pull the damn trigger.

981
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,387
I don`t think I can. It
doesn`t feel aimed right.

982
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,888
Look, Iook, all I want

983
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,390
is for you to shoot that armadillo

984
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,483
that is digging up my garden, okay?

985
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,289
I mean, is that too much for me to ask,

986
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,728
for you to be a man
for once in your Iife?

987
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,732
[shout]

988
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,893
Fine.

989
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,164
Now I`m holding you responsible

990
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,866
for anything getting
dug up in my garden.

991
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:41,001
Okay? You go out and
fix those holes yourself.

992
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,707
Dig one you can fit in.

993
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,080
Let me see.

994
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,381
Did you go by the cleaners
to pick up my dress?

995
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,921
Yes, earlier.

996
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,422
Did you Iysol my kitchen counters?

997
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,424
Mm-hm.

998
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,925
Did you pick up the
Preparation H from the pharmacy?

999
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,155
No, but I figured we`d go by there

1000
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,594
on the way to Iunch. Do you still
want to go to Jalape? o Treat?

1001
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,997
- I guess.
- Okay, hold still.

1002
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,329
Jeez.

1003
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,733
Will you be attending

1004
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:09,499
our dress rehearsal tonight?

1005
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,767
No.

1006
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,135
[gunshot]

1007
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,288
Marjorie?

1008
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,659
Marjorie, are you okay?

1009
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,493
Marjorie, say something to me.

1010
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,328
Marjorie, can you talk to me?

1011
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,662
Marjorie, can you say something?

1012
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,293
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

1013
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,602
Oh, Jesus, no, no, no, what have I done?

1014
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:22,270
Oh, God! What have I done?

1015
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,835
PIease tell me what to do!

1016
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,576
I`II do whatever you want me to do!

1017
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,995
? Seventy six trombones
Led the big parade?

1018
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,526
? With a hundred and ten
Cornets close at hand?

1019
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,541
? They were followed by Rows and
rows of the Finest virtuosos?

1020
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,136
? So is the cream Of every famous band?

1021
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:59,046
??

1022
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,995
? Seventy six trombones
Hit the counterpoint?

1023
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,625
? While a hundred and ten
Cornets blazed the way?

1024
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,726
? To the rhythm Of
march! march! march!?

1025
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,532
? AII the kids began to march?

1026
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:25,803
? And their marching
Still right today?

1027
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,708
Great job, everyone.

1028
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,680
It seemed Iike the
flags were a Iittle Iate,

1029
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,344
also I want to make sure
that those fleahops are right.

1030
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,319
Now I got off that time

1031
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,753
but I feel Iike I got off
because one of you got off.

1032
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,688
But it was a really great job.

1033
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,919
Take five, we`re gonna
take it again from the top.

1034
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,689
I don`t think too many of us

1035
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,162
ever asked very many questions

1036
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,995
about Mrs. Nugent, and if we did,

1037
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,934
he would always have a
very plausible explanation.

1038
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,336
Hello, Billy, this is Bernie Tiede

1039
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,239
calling on behalf of Mrs. Nugent.

1040
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,573
Yes, yes, she missed her
holiday haircut appointment

1041
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:06,844
but she`s asked me to tell you
that she won`t be coming back in.

1042
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:11,081
She wants to try someone else.

1043
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,179
Well, I`m sorry to say this

1044
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:18,057
but she says that you take
too Iong and charge too much.

1045
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:21,063
Billy, I`m sorry, but
I`m just the messenger.

1046
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,567
I was rather devastated at the very idea

1047
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,432
that she was not coming
anymore after 30 years

1048
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,701
of being her friend, hairdresser,

1049
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:34,232
confidante sometimes,

1050
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,303
and she just was gonna vanish.

1051
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,042
(male voice) It was easy
for her to disappear.

1052
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,708
Nobody was looking for her.

1053
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,481
Not her son, not her two sisters.

1054
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,317
One of them lived here in Carthage.

1055
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,323
They hadn `t spoken in about 10 years.

1056
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,825
You want to sign this for Mrs. Nugent,

1057
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,657
our generous benefactor?

1058
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,321
Only person Iooking for
her was her stockbroker.

1059
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,264
[phone rings]

1060
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,497
Oh, God.

1061
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,662
Hello?

1062
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,332
Bernie? Bernie!

1063
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,237
Wh..where`s Marjorie?

1064
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,502
I..I..I haven`t spoken
to her in over five weeks,

1065
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,840
I`ve Ieft 11 messages.

1066
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,846
She`s with me right now, LIoyd,

1067
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,506
and I`m sorry I
couldn`t tell you earlier

1068
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,675
but she`s had a series of small strokes.

1069
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,686
I`ve been meaning to call you
and Iet you know her situation.

1070
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:22,987
Mm-hm. No, she should not
be attempting to talk. No.

1071
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,289
No, you can`t talk. The doctor said..

1072
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:29,492
She`s indicating for me
to tell you hi from her.

1073
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,431
He sends you all his best.

1074
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,332
[sighs] Okay, well,

1075
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,530
we`II be in touch when
she`s feeling better.

1076
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,163
In the meantime, Iet me know

1077
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,174
if I can help you with anything. Okay.

1078
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:43,008
Okay, bye-bye.

1079
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,877
Bernie knew better
than touch my accounts.

1080
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,009
But he was going after what
would go into her bank accounts

1081
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,882
because that`s where all
the royalty checks went.

1082
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,481
It`s usually 50,000 a month.

1083
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,048
Now he really started being generous.

1084
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:01,996
He paid 5,000 dollars for the Shreveport
orchestra to come over play the Messiah.

1085
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:06,502
He bought a high dollar
harpsichord for school.

1086
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:09,561
He paid for the choir to go to Russia.

1087
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,699
Well, yeah, he hired
me back for more money,

1088
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,244
which is fine with me.

1089
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,542
Oh, he bought jet skis,

1090
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,912
he bought nine cars,

1091
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,178
he bought struggling businesses,

1092
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,915
he paid 40,000 dollars
for Carthage Awards.

1093
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,854
That`s a trophy shop.

1094
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,893
He loaned the money to
the Yokums over here,

1095
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,155
that opened up Boot
scootin Western Wear.

1096
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:36,596
I guess that was Carthage
`s answer to Neiman `s.

1097
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,863
Bernie just told everybody to
pay him back when they could.

1098
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,597
You know, pay me when you can.

1099
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,502
But they never did.

1100
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,598
Bernie knew my twin girls`
birthday was coming up,

1101
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,199
and he thought they should have

1102
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,110
a big nice playhouse, you know?

1103
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,273
Little girls.

1104
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,445
Bernie bought this
playhouse for my girls.

1105
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:04,556
Oh. [chuckling]

1106
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,424
Thank you.

1107
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,589
Thank you.

1108
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,395
I just feel Iike I need to say,
Bernie Tiede, God bless you, son.

1109
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,369
You`ve done more to transform the
town of Carthage than anyone else.

1110
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:20,307
- Oh, thank you.
- God bless you, Bernie.

1111
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,813
Bernie could`ve bought a mansion
for himself with the money.

1112
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,474
But he kept that little house

Now he bought cars for
folks that needed it.

1115
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,149
And he paid cash for those.

1116
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,661
But that old Lincoln he was drivin`?

1117
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,491
He had it financed.

1118
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:44,260
And he was usually
behind on his payments.

1119
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,132
No, there really
wasn`t any greed in him.

AImost everything he
got from Mrs. Nugent,

he gave to somebody else.

LIoyd seems to be pretty concerned.

1123
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,323
He thinks the family
should get involved.

Oh, good Iord, you gotta be kidding me.

She`s at the Scott White
Nursing Home in Temple.

1128
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,370
She didn`t want everyone to know,

1129
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,702
`cause she`s afraid
the family would come in

she pulled the heads off my dolls,

because he`s Iosing
commissions during her illness.

the way he`s used to, so..

01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,834
Oh, there`s one man in
particular I can think of

1273
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,067
I sure would Iike to talk to.

1274
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,870
Hey, Sheriff, did you
actually find him yet?

1275
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,342
We`re still Iooking for him.

1276
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:23,708
He wasn`t at Carthage aviation,

1277
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,041
Carthage Awards or his house.

1278
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,207
AIright, Iook..

1279
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,843
we`re gonna throw a net over
the entire tri-county area

1280
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,978
to find our number one suspect.

1281
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,578
We might be dealing with a madman here,

1282
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,180
a bonafide deranged killer.

1283
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,420
Achieving goals, mastering skills,

1284
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,893
the opponent isn`t the other team,

1285
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,657
it`s really just yourself.

1286
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,255
And if you`ve worked hard,

1287
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,924
and done the absolute best that you can,

1288
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,935
then no matter what the scoreboard says,

1289
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,665
you are the winner in the game of Iife.

1290
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,331
You can hold your head high..

1291
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,069
Mr. Tiede, may we have a word with you?

1292
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,543
Of course. Right now?

1293
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,204
Sure.

1294
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,805
I`m gonna go talk to the police.

1295
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,114
Gentlemen, you have earned yourself..

1296
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,450
a great dessert. Go, Rattlers.

1297
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,285
I`m so proud of you. [clears throat]

1298
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,518
This way.

1299
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:16,292
(male voice) How long you been
thinking about killing her, Bernie?

1300
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,233
I never thought of me
killing Mrs. Nugent.

1301
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:24,932
I`d..I guess I fantasized
about her death,

1302
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,636
but I was never the
one responsible for it.

1303
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,578
She always died accidentally Iike..

1304
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:36,949
in a car accident or falling down
the escalator at the mall in Longview.

1305
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:40,546
I was always the one
weeping by her open casket.

1306
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,491
Comforting others,
being comforted myself.

1307
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,825
Why`d you want her dead, Bernie?

1308
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:52,459
Mm, she had become so
mean and possessive of me.

1309
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,629
I..I couldn`t face being
around her any Ionger.

1310
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,797
And then it just..happened.

1311
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,603
I don`t know. I shot her!

1312
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:04,340
I shot poor Mrs. Nugent four times.

1313
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:09,112
With the armadillo gun.

1314
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,550
Then what?

1315
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:19,183
Well, then the Lord called her Home.

1316
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:25,530
I know I done wrong and I
must atone for my sins. Oh!

1317
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:33,804
[Ioud sobs]

1318
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:38,609
EIizabeth, I just heard Bernie
killed your sister Margy.

1319
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,808
Oh, honey, no.

1320
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,215
Marjorie`s in a nursing
home over in Timble.

1321
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,654
No, no, she is in a deep
freeze going to Dallas.

1322
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,283
Nobody in a million years

1323
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,884
could`ve imagined that
that could`ve happened.

1324
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:57,899
Shock! I could not
believe Bernie did this.

1325
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,093
No way.

1326
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,731
Well, it was fucking unbelievable.
Nobody could believe it.

1327
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,741
You know, I could see somebody
wantin` to do that to her,

1328
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,710
but Bernie Tiede`s the Iast
person I woulda thought done it.

1329
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,407
I mean, we were just shocked,
just shocked. Just disbelief.

1330
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,383
The Bernie I knew was
somewhat of a sissy.

1331
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,249
And it just ain`t no way

1332
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,254
I can see him ever killing anybody.

1333
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,846
I thought they`d made a mistake.

1334
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,893
You got this sweet guy, you got Bernie,

1335
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,484
who`s just the nicest
fella I`d ever met,

1336
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,927
and I`ve known him for a Iittle while,

1337
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,760
and then you got..Mrs. Nugent

1338
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,266
who is not nice,

1339
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,734
not nice to a Iarge degree, just evil.

1340
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,067
So you got this sweetness
and you got this evil,

1341
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,767
and they`re kinda
battlin` each other, uh..

1342
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,003
and you know that something
at some point`s gotta give,

1343
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,011
something`s gotta break

1344
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,411
and she was justs more evil
than he was nice, I guess,

1345
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,040
and he just exploded.

1346
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,609
We`re all capable of that dark moment.

1347
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,282
If we ever get angry enough.

1348
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,621
He must`ve wanted to get caught.

1349
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,558
AII he had to do was put her body

1350
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,357
in one of his airplanes,

1351
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,024
fly her out over the Gulf
and push her right out.

1352
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:07,091
No body, no arrest.

1353
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,296
A woman Iike that with a bad heart..

1354
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,135
he shoulda just shoved the
pillow right over her face.

1355
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,642
Then they probably wouldn`t
even done an autopsy.

1356
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,940
A few days Iater, he`d
be doing her funeral.

1357
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,071
Oh, I just started shaking my head

1358
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:21,582
going, ``Oh Bernie,
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.``

1359
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,744
Who in their right mind
would kill their meal ticket?

1360
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,651
It was crazy around here.

1361
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,488
People were on Danny Buck
Iike ticks on a coon dog.

1362
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,493
Yeah, Danny Buck, you
know Bernie didn`t know

1363
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,994
anything about shooting a rifle.

1364
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,792
He didn`t go huntin`,

1365
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,764
he wouldn`t know a deer
blind from an outhouse.

1366
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,630
That he wouldn`t.

1367
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,260
There are not enough
nice men in this town.

1368
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,998
Leave poor Bernie alone, Danny Buck.

1369
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,562
We don`t even think he did it.

1370
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,574
He confessed.

1371
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,405
Danny Buck,

1372
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,968
you knew Mrs. Nugent as
well as any of us did.

1373
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,343
Did you ever stop to think

1374
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,974
maybe, just maybe

1375
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,610
Bernie did it in self defense.

1376
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,187
Self defense.

1377
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,620
Maybe it was a forced confession.

1378
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,350
They could`ve beat it out of him.

1379
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,016
He`s too sweet to stand
up under interrogation.

1380
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,856
Look, there was no interrogation.

1381
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:09,091
He walked in, sat down
and told us everything.

1382
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,029
Simple as that.

1383
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,692
Well, hell.

1384
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,292
Even if he did do it,

1385
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,701
she was so mean and ornery,

1386
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,466
she had it coming to her.

1387
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,769
It`s not as bad as people say it is.

1388
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,868
He only shot her four times, not five.

1389
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,378
You know what?

1390
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,346
You people are as crazy as a coot.

1391
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,940
I Iike Bernie Tiede as much as you do.

1392
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:32,351
He did shoot her though!

1393
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,389
I tell you what.

1394
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,980
I don`t claim to know what Bernie did

1395
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,821
or did not do.

1396
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,191
I figure that`s between
him and God AImighty.

1397
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,890
Mm-hm. And the way I figure it,

1398
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,798
that`s where it should stay.

1399
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,895
Man, I hope I`m on that jury.

1400
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,908
Yes, we need to be able to forgive
someone who`s done something wrong.

1401
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,342
And no matter what the truth is,

1402
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,576
Bernie is going to need our prayers.

1403
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,083
so, folks, we need to understand

1404
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:07,384
that tragedies are
simply tests of our faith.

1405
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,549
And right now, Bernie needs to know,

1406
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:14,187
especially during this
testing of his faith,

1407
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:18,165
that God and this congregation

1408
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,896
have not abandoned him.

1409
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,733
[Buck clears throat]

1410
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,034
(pastor) Good to see
you, thanks for coming.

1411
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,438
Good to see you.

1412
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,066
God bless you for everything.

1413
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,077
Reverend. Now Iisten,

1414
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:34,275
I understand you going all
New Testament on him but uh..

1415
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,409
you got to at Ieast take
him off the prayer Iist.

1416
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:40,114
Hey, I gotta stay neutral,
everybody needs a preacher.

1417
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,214
Neutral?

1418
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,226
Reverend, basically you were
supporting a criminal act.

1419
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,558
You know, all I hear is poor Bernie.

1420
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,290
Nobody`s talking about poor Marjorie.

1421
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,595
Hell, everyone seems to be forgetting

1422
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,261
that there`s a Iady, a
member of this congregation,

1423
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:55,894
shot in the back four times

1424
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,461
and put in the freezer.

1425
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,268
Danny, the Bernie you`re talking about

1426
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,572
is not the Bernie this church knows.

1427
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,702
The heck it isn`t.

1428
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,872
It sounds Iike the only Bernie
you`re choosing to remember

1429
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,940
is the one that donated 100,000
dollars to your church. Reverend.

1430
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,315
Danny, Iook, I`m sorry you feel that..

1431
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,481
It`s been hard on everyone.

1432
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,490
AIright, kiddos.

1433
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,150
AII the good that Bernie
had done for everybody,

1434
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,889
or for us around here, it just..

1435
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,988
they come in, and then
it was gonna get all

1436
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,125
Mrs. Nugent`s money back
that Bernie had spent.

1437
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,135
We Iost our airport,

1438
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:31,331
we lost our best store,

1439
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:35,400
cars, some people lost their houses,

1440
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:38,344
jet skis.

1441
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,508
He spent 600, 000 dollars
of Mrs. Nugent`s money.

1442
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,860
No paperwork, anything?

1443
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,021
A receipt [inaudible]?

1444
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,928
I don`t know, I mean..

1445
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,490
he just gave it to me,
said I could have it.

1446
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,268
Well, you know, at
least they could`ve left

1447
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,534
some money for the church.

1448
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,044
Hell, [unintelligible].

1449
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,636
(female voice) Here they come!

1450
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,011
[cheering]

1451
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,676
(female reporter, off) Although
rumors have been circulating

1452
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,481
about a possible plea bargain

1453
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,818
to lesser charges or
a probated sentence,

1454
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,982
District A ttorney Danny Buck Davidson

1455
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,185
has shocked East Texas

1456
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,558
by filing first degree
murder charges against Tiede,

1457
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,063
which could result in a life sentence.

1458
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,123
[shouting]

1459
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,169
Clearly, the tiny town
of Carthage is buzzing

1460
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,170
with opinions over the murder.

1461
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,139
He didn`t shoot Mrs. Nugent in the back.

1462
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,573
He didn`t do it.

1463
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:44,134
Bernhardt Tiede ain`t no monster.

1464
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:47,740
Ain`t no jury gonna convict
Bernie of first degree murder.

1465
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,716
In fact, I don`t know

1466
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,253
if a jury`s gonna
convict him of anything

1467
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,516
and I `II say this, if
a jury as to convict him,

1468
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,353
they`II probably gonna
give him probation.

1469
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,222
They ain`t gonna send
him to the penitentiary.

1470
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,557
In the meantime, Bernie
sits in the county jail

1471
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,530
where he`s reportedly already become

1472
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,190
a popular inmate

1473
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,200
Ieading a Bible study group

1474
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:08,259
and cooking meals for the staff.

1475
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,202
(Bernie) Now, we are
going to line the bottom

1476
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,206
of the pie dish with cheese

1477
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,572
to provide a barrier between
the Iiquid and the crust.

1478
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,907
Now a Iot of people use grated cheese,

1479
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,447
but I found that if you cut it
in Iittle quarter inch cubes,

1480
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,382
it does a better job of keeping
the crust from getting soggy.

1481
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:28,583
Now, we are going to saut the
broccoli Iightly in olive oil

1482
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,784
till it`s just bright green.

1483
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,588
That keeps the flavor in.

1484
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,595
If you put it in raw,
it`s completely flavorless.

1485
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:38,793
I`m not saying we want
the case totally dropped,

1486
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,303
but isn`t there some way to keep
Bernie from getting punished too much?

1487
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,931
That`s $14.74.

1488
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,975
So Iet me ask you something, Mrs. Beck.

1489
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,205
If someone came along and shot
you in the back four times,

1490
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:54,238
would you still be fine with me not
Ietting them get punished too much?

1491
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,409
If I`m on that jury, Danny Buck,

1492
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,976
I`m votin` to acquit.

1493
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,387
As far as convicting Bernie,

1494
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:09,658
I feed you straight. I mean, even
with the confession in my pocket,

1495
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,995
I was a bit trepidacious.

1496
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,833
I mean, it`s Iike he cast a
spell over the entire area.

1497
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,270
AII the Iittle old Iadies,

1498
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,331
Methodist church people,

1499
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,468
anybody he`d ever given anything to.

1500
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,842
With Mrs. Nugent`s money.

1501
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,438
AII the closet homosexuals. Everybody.

1502
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,279
Everybody thought he was gonna get off.

1503
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:33,014
But I had one card left to play.

1504
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,181
And I went all in.

1505
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,749
Trials are generally moved
when the judge determines

1506
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:42,763
that the defendant can`t
get a fair trial Iocally.

1507
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:48,997
And that`s usually because the crime
is so egregious and so well known

1508
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,130
that everybody in the
community has already convicted

1509
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,369
the poor son of a bitch accused of it.

1510
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:58,038
But in all the years I`ve
been doing this for a Iiving,

1511
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,740
I have never heard of the state

1512
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,647
seeking a change of venue

1513
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:05,209
because the defendant was so well Iiked

1514
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,687
that they couldn`t get a conviction.

1515
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:13,058
So when I heard that the judge had
actually agreed to move the trial,

1516
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:18,122
giving in to Danny Buck`s
harebrained request,

1517
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,795
my first thought was, ``Oh, shit.

1518
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,202
Our donkey`s in a ditch.``

1519
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:27,070
??

1520
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,700
Bring in the freezer.

1521
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,874
Let the jury be able to see

1522
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:39,910
where Mrs. Nugent spent the first
nine months of her afterlife.

1523
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,252
A poor excuse for a casket.

1524
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,259
Boys, make sure it opens up to the jury.

1525
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,922
There `s some wild shit on
both sides of the courtroom.

1526
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,591
But, you know, this was the big stage

1527
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:55,068
the big town, the big show
they`d been waiting for

1528
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,832
and they pulled out all the stops.

1529
01:17:56,905 --> 01:18:00,602
They wheeled in the actual deep freeze.

1530
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:06,579
Mm-hm.

1531
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:12,053
They projected pictures
of frozen dead Mrs. Nugent.

1532
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,284
And then they started bringing
out the crying weeping relatives.

1533
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,883
And then I went to the freezer.

1534
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,450
And I saw

1535
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:24,465
underneath her corn and her steak and..

1536
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,229
her pot pies was..

1537
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:31,466
the top of her head.

1538
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,007
It was so horrible.

1539
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,374
No further questions, Your Honor.

1540
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,815
When was the Iast time you
talked to your grandmother?

1541
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:49,482
Um, I don`t remember.

1542
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,219
Isn`t it true that you and your brother

1543
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:55,821
sued your grandmother
almost four years ago?

1544
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,297
We were advised to by a Iawyer.

1545
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,300
A Iawyer?

1546
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:05,102
You mean, just some old
boy come in off the street?

1547
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:08,233
Or are we talking about your Iawyer?

1548
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,006
I guess he was working for us.

1549
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,604
I`II say he was working for you.

1550
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,015
He was trying to get your
grandmother`s money, wasn`t he?

1551
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:25,191
Did you ever speak to her after that?

1552
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,488
I don`t think so.

1553
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,085
Oh, you don`t think so.

1554
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,654
Well, you know you didn`t.

1555
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:33,667
But you told us earlier that you
were real close to your grandmother.

1556
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:37,000
Now was that the same woman
you were suing for money?

1557
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,199
Is that the same woman

1558
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:43,210
that you have not
spoken to in four years?

1559
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,805
I felt in our hearts
we were still close.

1560
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,373
[scoffs]

1561
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,816
I knew he was in trouble

1562
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:53,286
when I saw that jury.

1563
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,847
And Bernie was just gonna have to
get up there and explain himself

1564
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:01,453
to a bunch of Saint Augustine
cousin-countin` rednecks over there.

1565
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,624
I mean, they got more tattoos than teeth

1566
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,566
and there ain`t no brain
in the whole dozen of `em,

1567
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,729
and they`re supposed to decide

1568
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,296
big things Iike this?

1569
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:16,902
I mean, shoot, I wouldn`t
Iet `em work on my car.

1570
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,412
Now, Bernie,

1571
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,507
after you were arrested you
gave a confession, correct?

1572
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,576
Yes, sir.

1573
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:29,385
How did you feel about Marjorie Nugent?

1574
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,051
I cared for Marjorie deeply.

1575
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,391
I Ioved her very much.

1576
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,225
And I`ve sent Ietters
from jail to her family

1577
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:40,598
asking their forgiveness
for ruining Margy`s Iife

1578
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,934
and the pain I`ve caused.

1579
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,337
Well, if you cared for her,

1580
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,104
even Ioved her,

1581
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:52,112
why do you reckon you killed her?

1582
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,011
[deep sigh]

1583
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,515
I could probably describe
it Iike being in prison

1584
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,576
to some degree.

1585
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,587
She wouldn`t allow me
to have any friends,

1586
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:03,750
and I`m a people person.
I got to have my friends.

1587
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,554
[sigh]

1588
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:10,428
She was very jealous and
possessive of my time.

1589
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:14,798
She had become so hateful.

1590
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,634
I don`t even remember
picking up the gun that day.

1591
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,641
It was Iike someone else was doing it.

1592
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,143
so why did you leave the body there?

1593
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,145
It would seem to me that

1594
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,147
if you didn`t want to get caught,

1595
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,445
you`d find some way to dispose of it.

1596
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,814
Oh no, no, no.

1597
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,150
I could never do that.

1598
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,950
That was never my intention.

1599
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,321
Everyone deserves a proper burial.

1600
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,724
And I was..

1601
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,991
I was just waiting for
my chance to give her one.

1602
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:53,998
Thank you, Bernie.

1603
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,408
I`II pass the witness.

1604
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:00,937
So help me out here, Bernie.

1605
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:06,511
On this trip with Mrs.
Nugent to New York City,

1606
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:11,491
did you fly first class?

1607
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,027
Yes, I believe we did.

1608
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,529
Tell us the difference between
like the first class seats

1609
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,691
and the regular old seats
in the back of the plane.

1610
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,702
I..I`ve never been up there.

1611
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,534
I`d say the seats are
a Iittle Iarger maybe.

1612
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,699
More comfortable.

1613
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,266
Don`t they have people waiting`
on you and stuff too, you know?

1614
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,710
I mean, people bringing you fancy food,

1615
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,978
and serving you whatever you
want to drink and stuff like that?

1616
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:39,316
Yes, the service is
probably a Iittle better.

1617
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,685
Oh, so you Iike the
first class treatment.

1618
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:47,456
First class Iifestyle, the
best that money can buy.

1619
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,394
I was accompanying Mrs. Nugent

1620
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,455
who usually preferred these
things when she traveled.

1621
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,524
- Mm-hm.
- So.

1622
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,900
Now, on that New York City trip,

1623
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,735
it says here that you and Mrs. Nugent

1624
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:04,403
stayed at the.. the Ritz Carlton?

1625
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:08,075
That`s a fancy hotel near
Central Park, isn`t it?

1626
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,084
Yes, I believe that is where we stayed.

1627
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:14,019
It also says here that while
you were in New York City,

1628
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:16,387
you saw an opera.

1629
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,323
And a Broadway play.

1630
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:21,419
I think it`s called ``Les Miserables. ``

1631
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:26,763
[French accent] Les Miserable.

1632
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,430
That`s impressive.

1633
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,995
What?

1634
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:35,770
So culture is important to you.

1635
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,744
In what way?

1636
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:40,576
Well, you seem to know all
these fancy words and such.

1637
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,775
Well, that one`s not very difficult.

1638
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:47,117
[Iaughter]

1639
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:52,592
Not for you.

1640
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,756
You know all about the
high class Iife, don`t you?

1641
01:23:56,831 --> 01:24:01,632
I..what..Iike what?

1642
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,036
Like, I don`t know,
say for instance what..

1643
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:09,805
what kind of wine are you
supposed to have with fish?

1644
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,904
No, I don`t.. white usually.

1645
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:17,315
Mm-hm. That takes a Iot of money

1646
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,478
to have so much culture, don`t it?

1647
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:22,114
To..to enjoy the finer things in Iife

1648
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,215
that you Iove so much.

1649
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,955
The ritzy hotels, first class
flying off to the big cities.

1650
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:30,088
I mean, it takes a Iot of money

1651
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:31,655
to Iive that way, don`t it?

1652
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,667
No, I..Ieft to my own devices,

1653
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,635
I would not have been
traveling in such an expensive..

1654
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,001
But Ieft to someone
else`s devices, you were!

1655
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,564
And after you killed Mrs. Nugent,

1656
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,473
you kept on spending
her money, didn`t you?

1657
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,478
A Iot of it!

1658
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,446
And if you wouldn`t a been caught,

1659
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,005
you`d still be spending her money today.

1660
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,483
Wouldn `t you?

1661
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,749
Wouldn`t you?

1662
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:57,189
[thud with hand]

1663
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,749
Ladies and gentlemen,

1664
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,728
after Iistening to all the evidence,

1665
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,096
I`m sure that you will agree

1666
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:10,001
that the defendant is a Iiar, a coward

1667
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:14,030
and a backshooter.

1668
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,703
Now, come on.

1669
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,609
That`s got to be about the Iowest thing

1670
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,616
a man could ever do, ain`t it?

1671
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,881
shoot a little old lady in the back?

1672
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:29,481
Four times.

1673
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,117
There is no doubt in my mind

1674
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:37,130
Bernie Tiede is a
calculating evil actor.

1675
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,666
He fooled a whole town

1676
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,294
for nine months.

1677
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,304
Now if he can do that,

1678
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,862
there ain`t no telling what he`II do

1679
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,067
if you Iet him back on the streets.

1680
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:58,579
That poor woman stayed frozen
stiff for nine whole months.

1681
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:02,349
In a freezer.

1682
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:06,588
It took two days to thaw her out.

1683
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:10,688
Just so they could
perform a proper autopsy.

1684
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:16,101
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1685
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,729
I`m sorry.

1686
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:27,076
Your honor, counsel, Iadies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1687
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:30,083
all Danny Buck Davidson
wants to do in this trial

1688
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:33,917
is get you to believe that
Bernie is some kind of monster.

1689
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:38,925
That he is something other
than a fellow human being.

1690
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,858
Look at him, Iadies and gentlemen.

1691
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:45,025
There is not one hint of
premeditation in this case.

1692
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,125
If there was, he`d have
done it a Iot differently.

1693
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,364
He mighta gotten away with it.

1694
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:54,465
Did he try to poison her slowly? No.

1695
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,635
Did he burn down the house?

1696
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,272
Say it was an accidental fire? No.

1697
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,905
He still knew he done wrong.

1698
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,417
He knew he was gonna get found out.

1699
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,213
He just didn`t have the courage

1700
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,151
to tell on himself.

1701
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,281
But Iike a good funeral director,

1702
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:14,454
he preserved the body so that
she could have a proper burial.

1703
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:20,764
And in the meantime he did a
lot of good for a lot of people.

1704
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:25,932
Till he finally got caught.

1705
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:30,341
He just doesn`t sound Iike any
kind of monster I`ve ever heard of.

1706
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,641
Thank you.

[Iively chatter]

1708
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:46,024
(Danny) That doesn`t excuse
the crime that was committed.

1709
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,120
Now Iook, everybody`s describing
Bernie Tiede as such a great guy.

1710

``Oh, he`s so wonderful.
He`s an angel.``

1711

Let me tell you, he`s an angel alright.

Mr. Foreman, it is my understanding

1716
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:43,481
that the jury has reached a verdict.

1717
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:46,247
Yes, sir, we have, Your Honor.

1718
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,380
Is it unanimous?

01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:33,523
I`m the choir director,
teaching four classes.

1741
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,256
I`m in the craft shop most of the day.

1742
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,524
I miss my freedom.

1743
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,828
Well, sure you do, hon.

1744
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:41,528
I`m making the best of it.

1745
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:43,194
Got a Iot to Iive for.

1746
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,432
You do. You do.

1747
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:46,837
I wanna help people here.

1748
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:48,876
[shouting]

1749
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,468
Hm, well, I have to
tell you what I`ve done.

1750
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,480
I wrote the warden a Ietter.

1751
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,345
Yeah, I did.

1752
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,475
I told him that he had
to give you a work release

1753
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:59,485
or something Iike that

1754
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,818
so that you could sing at my funeral.

1755
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:04,380
Now, I`m not sick or
anything, but now Bernie,

1756
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,326
you promised me that you would do that.

1757
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:10,228
And I totally mean wear
those chains or whatever

1758
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,732
if it made them feel better so..

1759
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,166
That is awful sweet, Lenora.

1760
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:18,034
And it would be an honor
but don`t count on it.

1761
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,333
I don`t think they`re Ietting
me out of here for nothing.

1762
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:21,534
Oh! [pfft]

1763
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:24,077
Sure they will. I told him that
you went temporarily insane.

1764
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,841
And we`re all going
insane sooner or Iater.

1765
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:29,405
I mean, that`s the way I Iook at it.

1766
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:33,921
Uh-oh. He`s telling me our time is up.

1767
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,819
I cannot tell you how
much it means to me

1768
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,915
that I`m still in your prayers.

1769
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,516
And that I`II always be with you.

1770
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:42,427
Yes. And you know how much we Iove you.

1771
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,590
And I will tell you, I Iook around here.

1772
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,098
You need to take care of yourself

1773
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:47,759
and be real careful because I think

1774
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,598
this could be a dangerous place.

1775
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,661
- You think?
- I do.

1776
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,604
And we`II come back
in a couple of weeks.

1777
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:54,766
Take care. I Iove you.

1778
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:58,209
I Iove you, baby.

1779
01:31:58,312 --> 01:31:59,711
You take care of him.

1780
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:11,056
I don`t care what he did.

1781
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,616
Yes, I do care.

1782
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:17,061
It was wrong.

1783
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:22,933
But I believed that if Bernie
were truly sorry for what he did,

1784
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,632
and would ask God`s forgiveness,

1785
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:30,075
God would forgive him.

1786
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:36,708
And after all, that`s
all that really matters.

1787
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:39,582
I will miss him.

1788
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:41,246
AII of us will.

1789
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,950
[slow sad violin music]

1790
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,754
[violin music continues]

1791
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,473
[fast music]

1792
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,445
I`II never believe

1793
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:56,107
till the day God calls me home

1794
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:58,515
that Bernie Tiede killed Mrs. Nugent.

1795
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:00,519
And..and that`s just the way I feel.

1796
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,681
And my husband told me,
``Daisy, when you go up there,

1797
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,987
``you don`t change your mind
if you see some of those people

1798
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:07,357
``standing out there in the
courthouse that you Iove,

1799
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,362
``that`s your friends too.``

1800
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:13,526
I said, ``Hey, I don`t think
Jesus could change my mind.``

1801
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,126
That`s just the way I feel from day one.

1802
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,034
And I will always feel that way.

1803
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:19,629
Bernie was a good man.

1804
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:21,265
Bernie had a great heart.

1805
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:23,674
We need more Bernies in this world.

1806
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:26,542
Murderers come along once
in a blue moon over here

1807
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,549
and typically, they`re family related,

1808
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,608
I mean, it`s just how it works out,

1809
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:33,516
we don`t have strange killings,

1810
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:35,350
it`s just some family member
got upset with the other

1811
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,684
and shot him, killed him dead,

1812
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:38,054
and they know they gonna go

1813
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,717
to penitentiary for a while.

1814
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,194
Now we even have Iess murder trials

1815
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:43,992
`cause most of `em plead out.

1816
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:46,396
So this thing becomes a media circus,

1817
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:49,300
we got people coming in from
all across the United States.

1818
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:52,737
OId Danny Buck, we caught
him with a stiff neck,

1819
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:54,832
he..he got kind of stiff neck,

1820
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:56,638
kinda get your neck a Iittle stiff,

1821
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,177
he got a stiff neck, he
was Iike a pig in shit

1822
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:00,110
when all this was going up.

1823
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:03,412
Talking about what
wine to drink with fish,

1824
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:07,215
I mean, those people drink
warm beer with fried mudcat

1825
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:09,813
and he`s trying to say..

1826
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:13,690
I took one Iook at the
jury and I said, Uh-oh.

1827
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:15,695
[chuckles]

1828
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,822
Scrappy, you ain`t gonna do it, buddy.

1829
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,559
I mean, you ain`t gonna do it.

1830
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:21,567
You don`t have enough equipment to bring

1831
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:24,433
these people outta their
dang hovels over there.

1832
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,201
Jesus, he`s my daddy, he`s my cousin.

1833
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:29,606
It`s Iike, some of them people

1834
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,577
shouldn`t be allowed out of the county

1835
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,943
and we took the whole damn
trial over there, you know?

1836
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:36,107
What are they asking
for? I don`t get it.

1837
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:38,242
I don`t get the Iegal system.

1838
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,777
? He put her in the freezer?

1839
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,189
? And pulled down the Iid?

1840
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:47,523
? Didn`t even move it?

1841
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:51,361
? Just made sure It was plugged in?

1842
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:54,424
? He gave a Iot of parties?

1843
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:57,129
? Kept her packed on ice?

1844
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,934
? No one suspected anything?

1845
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:04,500
? `Cause Bernie Was so nice?

1846
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:07,309
? Oh, Bernie, oh, Bernie,?

1847
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:10,475
? What have you done?

1848
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:13,714
? You killed poor Mrs. Nugent?

1849
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:16,312
? You never even ran?

1850
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:19,484
? Oh, Bernie, Oh, Bernie?

1851
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,120
? What have you done?

01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:29,168
? You never even run?

1854
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,932
? After all those months?

1855
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:35,169
? No one had seen her face?

1856
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,767
? The Iocal Iaw decided?

1857
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,939
? They should Search the place?

1858
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:43,916
? And when the search That ended?

1859
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:46,646
? To everyone`s surprise?

1860
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,621
? They found her Shot and frozen?

1861
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,786
? As Bernie took her Iife?

1862
