when he refused to share
his week's receipts with them.

- Yeah. That's my job.

Do you always put so much
of yourself in yourjob?

You're not gonna know that
till you testify.

You're a good man, Tracy.

00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,884
And I want to do the right thing.

Hello, Miss Mahoney.

00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,585
You must be Miss Trueheart.
Tracy's told me so much about you.

Oh?

01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,134
'Cause I still got love
I still got rhythm

1538
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:01,929
But look at what
I got to go with 'em

1539
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:07,560
"Who could ask for anything more?"
I hear you query

1540
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:12,565
Who could ask for anything more?
Well, let me tell you

1541
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:15,651
Dearie

1542
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,990
Got my diamonds

1543
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,284
Got my yacht

1544
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:27,914
Got a guy I adore

1545
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:32,460
I'm so happy with what I got

1546
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:37,006
I want more

1547
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,342
Count your blessings

1548
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,677
One, two, three

1549
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:46,140
I just hate keeping score

1550
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:50,269
Any number is fine with me

1551
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:54,148
As long as it's more

1552
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:57,735
As long as it's more!

1553
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:02,240
I'm no mathematician

1554
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:06,953
AII I know is addition

1555
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:10,873
I find counting a bore

1556
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,751
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting

1557
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,753
More!

1558
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:22,927
I got rhythm

1559
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:25,221
Music, too

1560
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:29,809
Just as much as before

1561
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:34,313
Got my guy and my sky of blue

1562
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:39,026
Now, however, I own the view

1563
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:42,905
More is better than nothing, true

1564
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:47,785
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1565
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:53,082
Nothing's better than more

1566
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,003
One is fun, why not two?

1567
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:59,172
And if you like two
might as well have four

1568
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,465
And if you like four why not a few

1569
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,844
Why not a slew more?

1570
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:07,054
If you've got a little, why not a lot?

1571
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,265
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle

1572
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,517
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot

1573
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,853
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle

1574
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:16,022
More!

1575
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:18,316
More!

1576
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,568
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

1577
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:22,862
If it's gonna rain, let it pour

1578
01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:25,072
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

1579
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:29,994
If you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many much more?

1580
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:34,540
Or does that sound too greedy?

1581
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:39,045
That's not greed, no indeedy

1582
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:43,174
That's just stocking the store

1583
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:45,885
Gotta fill your cupboard
Remember Mother Hubbard

1584
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:48,137
More!

1585
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,223
More!

1586
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:54,936
Each possession you possess

1587
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:59,440
Helps your spirits to soar

1588
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:04,028
That's what's soothing about excess

1589
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:07,782
Something's better than nothing, yes!

1590
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:12,745
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1591
01:44:12,829 --> 01:44:15,248
Except all, all, all

1592
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:21,796
Except once you have it all

1593
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,881
Have it all

1594
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:29,136
You may find all else above

1595
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:32,014
Else above

1596
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:36,352
That though things

1597
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,562
Are bliss

1598
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:45,319
There's one thing you miss

1599
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:48,656
And

1600
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,993
That's

1601
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:55,454
More!

1602
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,665
More!

1603
01:44:57,749 --> 01:44:59,959
More! More! More! More!

1604
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:01,752
More! More! More!
