00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:26,457
Nina: We had a walk-in.

659
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,409
Well, tell me about
Arkady's movements.

660
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:35,383
Your report can wait an hour.

Arkady: Da?

00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,003
Martha:
[ Coughs ] Hello?

668
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:48,089
How are you feeling?

669
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:51,042
Ugh, I don't know
what happened.

670
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:54,128
It wasn't like this yesterday,
but then it just hit me.

671
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,164
[ Sighs ]
Anyway, um, guess what.

672
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,266
I-I talked
to Personnel today,

673
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:03,187
and even though there aren't any
clerk openings

674
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:05,356
in Counterintelligence
right now,

675
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,008
they gave me an application
to fill out.

676
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,011
So if something opens up,
I will be on the list.

677
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:13,013
That's great.
Listen.

678
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:14,348
Oh, you're not
gonna believe this.

679
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,483
My flight got canceled.

680
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,401
Ohh!

681
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:19,353
Oh, no.

682
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:23,190
Yeah, I'm stuck in
a Howard Johnson's in Boston.

683
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,459
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to bring you soup.

684
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:27,194
That's sweet.

685
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:30,414
Well, don't worry about it,
I guess.

686
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,049
Get some rest.

687
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:33,200
I will.

688
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,369
And you, uh,
you feel better, honey.

689
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,371
Clark, um...

690
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:41,041
everybody has been talking
about those murders.

691
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:44,228
[ Sighs ] Yep.

692
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:47,181
Agent Brooks says that crime
is at an all-time high

693
00:39:47,232 --> 00:39:49,383
and that it's only gonna
get worse in DC.

694
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:53,104
I think women should be able
to protect themselves.

695
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:55,356
Things like that
are really rare.

696
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:58,242
I'm gonna get a gun.

697
00:39:58,326 --> 00:39:59,443
Martha.

698
00:39:59,528 --> 00:40:01,162
Clark!

699
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:04,115
I don't want to be a victim.

700
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:23,250
Hello, operator?

701
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:27,271
Could I get the area code
for Cresson, Pennsylvania?

702
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:36,263
Hi.

703
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:39,316
I'm looking for the phone number
and address for Helen Leavis.

704
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,292
Hi, everybody!
I'm home!

[ Keys clank ]

706
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:51,045
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, dad.

707
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:52,079
How are you?

708
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,332
- You're home.
- You okay?

709
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,218
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

710
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:02,389
Yeah, I, uh, heard your voice
on the phone,

711
00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:05,392
so I thought I'd drive
straight through.

712
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,294
Good night.

713
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,346
Good night.

714
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,270
You okay?

715
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,138
Yeah.

716
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:02,182
What are you gonna tell
the kids?

717
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:03,234
Lava.

718
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:10,124
I signaled the Centre.

719
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:14,078
It will be tomorrow
if they want us to go.

720

[ Sighs ]

721
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:23,203
I keep thinking
about their son.

722
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,094
I saw him...

723
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,546
walking back to the room...

724
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:34,548
when I was leaving.

725
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,018
I heard him screaming.

726
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:44,024
What's gonna happen to him now?

727
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,192
[ Sighs ]

728
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:48,112
Centre will make sure he's...

729
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:51,064
- taken care of.
- Taken care of how?

730
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:56,203
Yeah.

731
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:57,454
[ Sighs ]

732
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:04,044
Philip, all these years,

733
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:08,215
I... I never worried

734
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:11,435
about Paige and Henry
being safe.

735
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,440
What happened
to Emmett and Leanne,

736
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:19,109
I always knew that was a risk.

737
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:26,033
But seeing Amelia...

738
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,274
I mean, how are we gonna live
like this?

739
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,330
We'll get used to it.

740
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:42,333
Like we got used
to everything else.

741
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:49,306
I can't believe I pulled Henry
into that--

742
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:54,011
I... I pulled him into <i>this.</i>

743
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:57,314
You didn't have a choice.

744
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,483
Yeah.

745
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:03,437
I did.
