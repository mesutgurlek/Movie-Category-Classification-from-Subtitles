EDDY: According to my sources,
the Organization, Chicago branch...

656
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,913
...caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

657
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,519
They estimate he siphoned off...

658

...about two million bucks
while operating their wire service.

Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

664
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,272
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.
