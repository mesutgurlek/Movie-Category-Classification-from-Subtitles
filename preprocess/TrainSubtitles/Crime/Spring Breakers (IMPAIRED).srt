00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,083
TEACHER: Okay, guys,
you might remember last week

6
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,375
I gave that great lecture on
Elvis Presley and the 1950s,

7
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,917
but today
we have to change gears

8
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:12,875
and talk about something
that's a little bit deeper,
a little harder to get at,

9
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,292
which is the
civil rights movement,
or the black freedom struggle,

10
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,708
or what some
historians have called
the second reconstruction.

11
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,625
Which I really like
because it ties it to
the first reconstruction

12
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,292
after the Civil War
to show that
there is a continuum,

13
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:30,167
there is a constant
struggle on the part of
African Americans in the south

14
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,042
to claim their freedom,
their liberty.

15
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,583
And, without a doubt,

16
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,625
uh, World War II really
provides the fuel for this,

17
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,250
that when you go
overseas to fight Hitler,

18
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,000
you get shot at,
you see your friends killed,

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,625
you're going to come home
a different person.

20
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,042
You're going to come back
a radicalized individual

21
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,583
willing to risk
life and limb.

22
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,167
So the Double V Campaign
during the war
is quite interesting.

23
00:03:56,167 --> 00:04:00,583
It stood for
victory at home
and victory abroad.

24
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,542
Defeat Hitler and fascism
and his racist policies,

25
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,792
but also defeat Jim Crow,
the racist south.

26
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,000

"But when you are tempted,

01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,500
<i>I want to be happy
and have fun.</i>

930
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:46,667
Yeah, Mommy,
I think that's the
secret to life.

931
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,000
Being a good person.

932
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,583
<i>Hi, Mom, it's Candy.</i>

933
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,750
I'm sorry I haven't
called in so long.

934
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,875
I know.
No, I know, I know.

935
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,250
I apologize. Yeah.

936
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,625
<i>Look, we went
on spring break.</i>

937
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:11,167
<i>Yeah.
It was so much fun.</i>

938
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:14,958
You have no idea, Mom.
We had such an amazing time.

939
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,750
It was a blast. Yeah.

940
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,875
<i>I just wanted
to let you know
that I'm coming home,</i>

941
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,833
<i>back to school
and everything.</i>

942
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:26,083
<i>And I just...
I love you so much, Mom.</i>

943
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,708
And I'm gonna do better now.

944
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,667
I'm going to be
the best I can be.

945
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,208
ARCHIE: That's it, baby.

946
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:50,792
Do it just like that.
Yeah, make it all sparkle.

947
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:53,500
Get it squeaky
clean for me.

948
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,708
<i>ALIEN:Seems like a dream.</i>

949
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:54,417
<i>Seems like a dream.</i>

950
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:02,542
<i>Seems like a dream.</i>

951
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:11,875
(GUN SHOTS)

952
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:38,708
<i>CANDY OVER PHONE:Yeah, Mom,
it was really great.</i>

953
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,500
<i>I think we found
ourselves here.</i>

954
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:44,875
<i>We finally got
to see some other
parts of the world.</i>

955
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,875
<i>We saw some beautiful
things here.</i>

956
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:52,125
<i>Things we'll never forget.
We got to let loose.</i>

957
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:56,792
<i>God, I can't
believe how many
new friends we made.</i>

958
01:23:56,792 --> 01:23:58,375
<i>Friends from
all over the place.</i>

959
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:03,000
<i>Everyone was
so sweet here.
So warm and friendly.</i>

960
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:08,000
<i>I know we
made friends that
will last us a lifetime.</i>

961
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:11,875
<i>We met people
who are just like us.</i>

962
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:14,125
<i>People just
the same as us.</i>

963
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:17,792
<i>Everyone was just trying
to find themselves.</i>

964
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:21,875
<i>It was way more than just
having a good time.</i>

965
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:26,250
<i>We're different people now.
We see things differently.</i>

966
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,625
<i>More colors, more love,
more understanding.</i>

967
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:32,500
<i>God, it was so nice
to get a break from
reality for a little while.</i>

968
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:39,208
<i>I know we have to go back
to school, but I'll always
remember this trip.</i>

969
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:43,250
<i>Something so amazing.
Magical.</i>

970
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,167
<i>Something so beautiful.</i>

971
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:52,750
<i>Feels as if
the world is perfect,
like it's never gonna end.</i>

972
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:43,333
<i>And at night here,
we can see way
past the stars.</i>

973
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,875
<i>We can see
into the light.</i>

974
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,875
<i>It's just... Ah!
It's beautiful.</i>

975
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,458
<i>I never want it to end.</i>

976
01:25:58,083 --> 01:25:59,875
<i>Spring break forever.</i>

977
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:03,792
<i>Spring break forever, bitches.</i>

978
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,708
<i>Spring break forever.
(LAUGHS)</i>

979
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:19,458
<i>Spring break forever, bitches.</i>
