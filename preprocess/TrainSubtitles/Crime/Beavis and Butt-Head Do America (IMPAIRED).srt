Uh, hey, baby. Uh huh.

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,333
I'm, like, pretty tall.
Uh huh huh...

11
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,500
Damn it, cut it out.
I'm trying to score.

12
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,833
Nah! Yah!

13
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,333
Look at you, you bung-holes.

Hey, baby, how's it goin'?

16
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,083
- Hey!
- No way, Beavis. I saw her first.

17
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,417
Damn it. I'm gonna kick your ass.

18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,792
Damn it, Beavis.
I saw her first. Get outta here.

19
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,208
Hey, Butt-head.

20
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,958
Butt-head! Wake up!

21
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,250
Uh... uh... Damn it, Beavis,

22
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,458
I was about to score.

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,708
But check it out. It's gone.

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,792
- Mm mm mm...
- Uh... What?

25
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:30,667
- The TV! Mm mm mm...
- Uh... Oh, yeah.

26
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:34,083
Uh huh huh... Well, where is it?

27
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,083
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was gone.

28
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,167
And look, the window's broken.

29
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,458
We'll get 100 bucks for this.
Heh heh heh.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,625
- No...
- Hmm. Uh huh huh huh...

- Oh, no...

Uh huh huh... Uhh...

36
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,083
I think I just
figured something out, Beavis.

37

W-w-what? Mm mm, heh...

38
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,042
This sucks. Uh huh huh...

39
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,792
Yeah, it really sucks.
Heh heh heh...

40
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,333
This sucks more than anything
that has ever sucked before.

41
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,708
We must find this butt-hole
that took our TV.

42
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,917
Yeah. Yeah!

- What if we never find it?

to school. We gotta find our TV.

Shut up, Beavis. I got an idea.
Uh huh huh huh...

Let's just wheel this thing
back to the house.

Uh huh... yeah.

Uh, hey, excuse me, boys.
What's going on here?

We're just gonna use this one.
Get outta the way.

belongs to the school, mm-kay?

This could be a really positive
experience for you guys.

don't need TV to entertain us.

Entertain us... anus. Oh, yeah.

75
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,292
Have you guys
heard a word I've said?

76

Uh, yeah. Anus.

Yeah, yeah. Heh heh...
Yeah, I heard it, too.

78
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,667
Look, guys, just take the TV
back to the A/V room right now.

79
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:37,458
And try to be a little more open
to life experiences, mm-kay?

- Aah!
- That was cool.

00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,792
- No, it wasn't.
- Uh... oh, yeah.

85
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,167
Uh, what's going on out here?

86
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,083
Oh, no!

87
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,083
Uh, that belongs to the school.

88
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,792
It's supposed to be in the A/V room.

89
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,458
- Wasn't our fault.
- Get back here!

90
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,292
Beavis and Butt-head,
you're both expelled!

91

Cool.

92
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,583
Whoa, check it out, Beavis.
I didn't know Anderson had a camper.

93
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,708
Yeah. Maybe it has a TV.

94
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,875
Oh, hello. Are you boys here
to look at the refrigerator?

95
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,542
Uhh, no.

96
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,708
We're here to look at the TV.

97
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,542
Tom didn't tell me
it was broken. Go on in.

98
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,250
- Cool.
- Heh heh heh.

99
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,042
Well, that ought to hold her.

100
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,042
You know, the most important thing
you can have on a camper

101
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,125
is a good butane regulator,

102
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,875
and this here's
the best one they make.

103
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:59,292
I hope we can fix that fridge.

00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,208
Marcy, we've been plannin'
for this trip our whole lives...

105
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,375
- And we're gonna go...
- Da-da-da...

106
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,500
What in the hell is that?

107
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,333
Dah... dah... da-da-dah

108
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,083
Ah, must be them damn buzzard hawks.

109
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,542
Let's get something to drink.

110
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,208
Ahh.

111
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,042
Aah! This crap is warm.

112
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,375
Beavis, you butt-hole, you broke it.

113
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,750
Aah, no, no, damn it!

114
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,833
Hey, what the hell's goin' on here?

115
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,167
- They're here to fix the TV.
- What? The TV ain't broken.

116
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,833
Uh... yeah, it is.

117
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,250
Yeah. Heh... heh heh...

118
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,750
Hey, wait a minute.

119
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,625
You two look kind of familiar.

120
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:53,917
Ain't you them kids that have
been whackin' off in my tool shed?

121
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,000
Uh huh huh...

122
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,250
We still don't have a TV, Butt-head.

123
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,667
I know, Beavis.

124
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,667
And damn it,
I can't sleep without a TV.

125
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,208
BUTT-HEAD: Dumb-ass.

126
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,292
H-help. Help me.

127
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,417
No... no...

128
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,167
What's your problem, Beavis?

129
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Uhh... I need TV.

130
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,250
I need TV now! Damn it!

131
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,625
Whoa. TV.

132
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:33,083
Yeah, yeah. TV. Heh heh.

133
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,458
TV! Yeah.

134
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,542
Unh... unh... damn it.

135
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,333
Uhh... no.

136
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,917
Damn it!

137
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,500
(COUGHING)

138
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,500
You sure these guys
can pull this off, Earl?

139
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,125
It's gotta look like an accident.

140
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,667
Ohh! Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,958
Ohh...

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
Uh huh huh...

143
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,042
Ohh...

144
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,875
Beavis and Butt-head,
y-you little bastards!

145
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,583
Can we watch your TV?

146
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,333
No! Y-you're expelled.
Now, get outta here!

147
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,000
Wait a minute. Damn it!
I need a TV now.

148
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,750
We're missing everything.

149
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,083
Yeah, hold on a minute.
That must be them now.

150
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, I'll call you back. Come in!

151
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,958
Ahh...

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,083
TV. Yeah.

153
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,917
You're late. (COUGHS)

154
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,125
Really? Did we miss Baywatch?

155
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,458
Earl said you guys were young,
but, jeez...

156
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:52,333
As long as you can get the job done.
What are your names?

157
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,500
Uh, Butt-head. Uh huh...

158
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,875
Oh, I mean, Beavis. Heh heh heh...

159
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:03,083
That's OK. I'd rather not know
your names, anyway. Mine's Muddy.

160
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,458
I'm gonna get right to the point.

161
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,583
I'll pay you ten grand plus
expenses, payable after you do her.

162
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,375
Uhh... do her?

163
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,833
That's right - do her.

164
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,250
I'm offering you $10,000
plus expenses to do my wife.

165
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,583
We got a deal?

166
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,333
Um, actually,
we just want to watch TV.

167
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,083
Shut up, Beavis.

168
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,083
Uhh... yeah, we'll do your wife.

169
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,667
N-no! I wanna watch TV.

170
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,167
Aah!

171
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,208
Damn it, Beavis, you butt-munch.

172
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,917
This guy wants us to score with
his wife, and he's gonna pay us.

173
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,958
We can buy a new TV.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,375
Heh heh. Really? Heh heh. Cool.

175
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:47,958
Uhh, huh huh... we'll do it, sir.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,958
Well, all right, then.
Let's get down to business.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,083
Here she is, boys.
Her name's Dallas.

178
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,458
She ain't as sweet as she looks.
She stole everything from me.

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,875
Watch out. She'll do you
faster than you do her.

180
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,250
Whoa. Uh huh... cool.

181
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,625
Heh heh. Yeah.

182
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:11,333
She's in her room in Vegas.
I got you one next to hers.

183
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:15,708
Your flight leaves in an hour.
I'll drive you to the airport.

184
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,542
Holed up.

185
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,667
Uh huh huh...

186
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,333
Hole.

187
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,542
Can we watch some TV first?

188
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,500
No.

189
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,625
(TYRES SCREECH)

190
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,917
Now, listen to me.
This is real important.

191
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,250
My wife's got this leather satchel.

192
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:40,250
A black bag, this big.
I need it back, boys.

193
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,708
Sentimental value,
you know what I mean?

194
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,500
Any questions so far?

195
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,958
Uhh, does she have big hooters?

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,250
Heh heh. Yeah, she sure does.

197
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,375
Uh huh... this is gonna be cool.

198
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,583
Y-y-yeah. Boi-yoi-yoi-ing.

199
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,208
Heh heh heh...

200
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,375
You guys are funny.

201
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,250
Let's have a drink on it, huh?

202
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,542
(MEEEOW)

203
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,875
(TYRES SCREECH)

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,417
Now, don't let me down.

205
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,792
We're gonna get paid to score.

206
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:25,125
Yeah. Then we're gonna
get a big-screen TV...

207
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,333
with 2 remotes.

208
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,250
Beavis, this is the greatest day
of our lives.

209
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,417
Yeah.

210
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,542
Here you are.

211
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,917
Hey, Beavis, she touched my butt.

212
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,583
Hello there.

213
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,958
Are you two headin' for Las Vegas?

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,208
Yeah. We're gonna score.

215
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,750
Oh. Well, I hope
to score big there myself.

216
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,458
I'm mostly gonna be doin' the slots.

217
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, yeah. I'm hoping
to do some sluts, too.

218
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,875
Do they have lots of sluts in Vegas?

219
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:11,292
There's so many slots
you won't know where to begin.

220
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,250
Whoa. Hey, Butt-head,
this chick is pretty cool.

221
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,917
She says
there's tons of sluts in Vegas.

222
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,583
Cool. Uh huh...

223
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:23,833
It's so nice to meet young men
who are so well-mannered.

224
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:27,083
I'm gonna have money
and a big-screen TV,

225
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,292
and there's gonna be
sluts everywhere.

226
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,750
- It's gonna rule.
- Oh, that's nice.

Hi. Can I help you with that?

(CLICK)

236
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,708
- There. All set.
- I love you. Uh huh...

237
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,875
Hey, cut it out.
I want HER to do it.

Hey, wait a minute. What's going on?

242
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,250
Aah! We're gonna die!

Aah! We're all gonna die!

244

Come to Butt-heaaaah...

245
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:44,708
Uhh, could you, like,
do that thing with my belt again?

246
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,333
Yeah. This is her.

247
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,458
Oh, she looks lovely.

248
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:58,542
I'm probably going to make out
with her first before we, uh...

249
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,167
you know, heh heh, get down.

250
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,125
I'm sorry.
You have to speak up, son.

251
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:07,208
I have this ringin' in my ears.

252
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,292
My doctor says it could be related
to my heart palpitations.

253
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,542
Heh. Really? I poop too much.

254
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,958
Ooh.

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,458
Maybe you're lactose-intolerant.

256
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,000
No, no. I poop too much!
And then I get tired.

257
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:29,417
Tired? Oh, well,
I know all about tired, dear.

258
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,625
I have just the thing for ya.

259
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:37,458
Take a couple of these.
They perk me right up.

260
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,583
Thanks.

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,708
Tastes like crap. What else ya got?

262
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:49,167

Hi. We're serving dinner now.

270
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,458
Our selections tonight are
chicken piccata or seafood gumbo.

271
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,625
- Piccata! Titicaca!
- Does the gumbo have corn?

272
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:29,458
I am Cornholio.
I need piccata for my bung-hole.

273
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:30,958
You'll have to wait.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,292
Are you threatening me?
My bung-hole will not wait.

275
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,000
Heh heh. Bungholio.

Get outta the cockpit!

This is Las Vegas?

287
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,292
Yeah. I thought there'd be
casinos and lights and stuff.

288
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,167
This isn't very good.

289
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,500
Hey, Butt-head,
why is that guy holding a sign?

290
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:24,625
Uhh...

291
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,208
maybe he's blind.

292
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,750
Uh huh. Check this out.

293
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,875
Ahem. Excuse me. Heh heh.

294
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:40,125
You guys know
where I can find these guys?

295
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,208
Oh.

296
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:47,208
Uhh, Be-a... Be-ave?

297
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,958
Um, Buh... Boo...

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,250
Boot? Someone named Boot?

299
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,167
This says Beavis.

300
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,375
And Boot-head.

301
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:01,625
Uhh... that's Butt-head.
Don't you get it, Beavis?

302
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,375
These dudes
have the same name as us.

303
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,667
Whoa, really? We should party.

304
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,583
(SIGHS) This way, sirs.

305
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,208
Where are those guys?

306
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,667
Where the hell is he?

307
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,958
You sure this is the right place?

308
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,875
(COUGHS)

00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,792
What are you, cops?

311
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,375
No. Earl sent us, you know,
to take care of your wife.

312
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,833
What? Take care...

313
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,375
What the hell are you talkin' about?

314
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,292
- Who were the other two clowns?
- Huh?

315
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,667
God damn it! She did it again!

316
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,167
I'm going to Vegas
to kill all three of them!

317
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,667
I noticed your TV was broken.
Wanna buy a new one?

318
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,833
(TYRES SCREECH)

319
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,708
Just leave it.
Worthless piece of crap.

320
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,042
Really, man. We gotta start

483
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,917
I didn't think so.

484
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:45,917
You wanna let me go, or wait
till I file a wrongful arrest?

485
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:51,208
We got nothing. We can only hold her
another couple of hours.

486
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,083
Damn it! Cut her loose.
Where's that damn unit?

487
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,167
BUTT-HEAD:
Uh huh huh huh. We're in Washington.

488
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,208
BEAVIS:
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna score now.

489
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,125
OLD LADY: Actually, son,
we're at the Hoover Dam.

490
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,125
BEAVIS:
Um, no, no. We're in Washington!

491
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:12,792
BUTT-HEAD: Yeah.
We're gonna score now!

492
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Over 40,000 tons of concrete
were used to build the Hoover Dam.

493
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:23,375
From top to bottom,
the dam is 51 stories.

494
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:25,708
It has a maximum capacity
for generating...

495
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,375
- Wow. Really?
- 2.074 Megawatts of electricity,

496
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:31,333
but on average,
it generates about 25% of that.

497
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,792
BEAVIS: I'll be damned.

498
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:36,625
Does anybody know how much energy
it takes to power Vegas?

499
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,000
Um, yeah, I just have a question.

500
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,333
Is this a God dam?

501
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,458
Uh huh huh.

502
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,625
You know, God damn. You know?

503
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,417
GUIDE: If you'll follow me this way.

504
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,750
BUTT-HEAD: This is dumb.
Let's go find that chick.

505
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,167
Yeah. Enough of this crap.

506
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,750
Whoa. Check it out, Butt-head. TV!

507
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,208
Cool.

508
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:02,750
I gotta hit the head.
Can you get me some coffee?

509
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:03,833
All right.

510
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,042
Talk to me, Bork.

511
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,792
A witness saw two teenagers

512
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,583
leaving Dallas's room
shortly before we arrived.

513
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,958
Did he get a full cavity search?

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,292
Uh... the witness?

515
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,792
You can never be too careful, Bork.

516
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:26,292
I didn't think it was necessary.
We have a picture from the elevator.

517
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,875
Here. Have a look.

518
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,292
What the hell?

519
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,250
They look like a couple of kids,
Chief.

520
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:34,625
Don't you know
what kids are capable of?

521
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,375
Don't you read the papers?

522
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,583
What the...

523
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,292
Damn it!

524
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:44,125
All they have
is these shows about water.

525
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:47,167
Yeah, really.
They need some shows about fire.

526
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,750
- Uhh, what are you doing, Beavis?
- Something's wrong with my butt.

527
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,375
Your butt sucks.

528
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,042
Hey, how come there's no sound?

529
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,958
Uhh... I'll fix it.

530

It doesn't get any better than this.

This here is God's country.

Uhh...

00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,667
I think I found the remote.

542
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,333

I swear, that's all I know.

545
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,167
They got on a tour bus heading west.

546
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,917
Uhh! Please...

547
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,667
I'm gonna kill 'em!

548
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,375
That was boring.

549
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:18,167
Yeah, yeah. Just the same thing,
over and over again.

550
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,792
Uhh, wait a minute.

551
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:23,125
We can't leave Washington
till we find that chick.

552
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,167
Oh, we're a long way
from Washington, Bob.

553
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:29,375
This is the Hoover Dam.

554
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,250
Dam. I'll be damned. Heh heh.

555
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,333
You boys better show up.

556
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,583
- See that, Bork?
- I don't get it.

557
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:52,250
You got half the state after you.
How do you get away?

558
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,333
Cut the power!

559
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:56,708
Damn right.
We're dealing with pros here.

560
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,167
My opinion - terrorists. What's
the scoop on that stolen unit?

561
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,125
Well, sir, it's not good.
Roll the tape.

562
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:07,792
The X-5 unit is a new
top-secret biological weapon.

563
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,125
A man-made virus,
the deadliest known to man.

564
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:14,125
It could wipe out
five states in five days.

565
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:17,500
Here's what happened
when it was tested on army recruits.

566
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,750
Look at these guys, Chief.

567
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:24,583
This thing
is a veritable Doomsday device.

568
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,500
Jesus jumped-up Christ!
If it falls into the wrong hands...

569
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,958
It gets worse.

570
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,417
The unit wasn't finished.
It has a flaw - the casing.

571
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,542
If hit hard, it could open,
releasing the virus.

572
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:40,208
As of now, these are
the most dangerous men in America.

573
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,083
I want these faces in front of every
Fed and sheriff within 1,000 miles.

574
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,833
The orders are dead or alive.

575
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,667
Let's just pray
that nothing hits that unit.

576
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,042
Ow! Ow!

577
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,208
Cut it out!

578
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,667
Get outta the way.
I wanna sit by the window.

Old Faithful here
is one of the largest.

599

During an eruption, the water
can reach as high as 200 feet.

Uh, the geyser

602
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,958
shoots out over 12,000 gallons
of water in a single eruption.

Forgive me, Father. I've sinned.

00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:04,833
I slept with a woman, and, uh...

00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,417
BUTT-HEAD: Really?
Uh huh huh. Was she naked?

Well, yes, Father.
Please forgive me.

Uhh... I don't know.

I don't suppose
you tried to stop them.

They're not getting away.

I want roadblocks - every road
out of here for 200 miles.

Um... this sucks.
It's all hot and stuff.

They need to put
a drinking fountain out here.

Yeah, like,
a 7-Eleven or something. Heh.

Well, I'll be danged.

That's them kids that have
been whackin' in my camper.

Wait a minute. Me and the missus
are on our way to Washington...

Now!

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,375
Now, wait right there.

706

You're dealing with a veteran
of two foreign wars.

707
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,208
They're the ones been whackin'.

708
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,375
I find anything broken,
you and I'll tangle.

Masturbating in the man's camper.

710
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,875
We're dealing
with two sick individuals.

711
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:39,917
I want that camper torn apart,
full cavity searches all around.

712
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,958
Something tells me
he could be involved.

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,333
What in the... Wait just a minute!

714
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,875
Chief, 2 days ago,
Express Airways had a disturbance

715
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:52,500
by someone calling himself
"Cornholio".

716
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,542
Guess who matches the description?

717
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:57,625
Finally, a real break.

718
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:00,333
Get me the departure point.
We'll kick ass.

719
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,375
- Uh huh huh.
- Nuhn.

720
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,917
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm hm, heh.

721
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,083
Uhh...

722
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:17,292
Uhh huh... hey!
One of you bastards got a match?

723
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:21,083
Uhh, yeah. My butt and your...

724
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,625
uhh... butt. Uh huh huh.

725

Uh huh huh. Uh huh.

- Hm, heh heh.

727

- Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.

728
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:41,083
Here's a song that might help you
cope with those feelings, mm-kay?

729
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,958
It's called Lesbian Seagull.

730
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,083
# She flies so gracefully

731
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,958
# Over rocks, trees and sand

(SIRENS)

733
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,417
# Soaring over cliffs

734
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:58,042
# And gently floating down to land

735
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,083
# She proudly lifts her voice

736
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,750
# To sound the mating call

737
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,208
# And soon her mate responds

738
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,542
# By singing, "caw"

739
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,917
# "Caw, caw"

740
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:13,750
# Come with me

741
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:17,167
# Lesbian seagull

742
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:23,417
# Settle down and rest with me

743
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,708
# Fly high

744
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,542
# Lesbian seagull... #

745
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,292
Uh, that's him!
He's their teacher!

746
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,542
Uh, huh, yeah.

747
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,958
Uh, what's going on here?

748
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,708
I'll ask the questions.

749
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,208
Are these your students?

750
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,708
I assume you're a government agent.

751
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,708
I would think you would know

752
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,375
there is something in this country
called due process, mm-kay?

753
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:52,417
That's the talk I'd expect
from the guy who taught these two.

754
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,542
Take this scum away.

755
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:57,083
I believe I'm supposed
to be read my Miranda rights.

756
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,042
Now... Whaa!

757
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,375
I always knew they were no good.

758
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,125
Uh, I hate...

759
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,917
Shut up! You've been harbouring
two criminal masterminds.

760
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,250
Chief, you know that guy whose
camper they were whackin' off in?

761
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,417
Bork, you are a federal agent.

762
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,750
You represent
the United States Government.

763

Never end a sentence
with a preposition.

764
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,542
Oh. Uh...

765
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,750
You know that guy
in whose camper they...

766
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:27,625
I mean that guy off
in whose camper they were whacking?

767
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,458
That's better. Yes?

768
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,458
We've run a sample through
the criminal sperm bank

769

genetic matches for a father.

Aha... fire.

774

Uh, here's another true story.

775
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,500
About 15 years ago,
we stopped in this toilet...

776
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:58,667
uhh, called Highland.

777
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:01,875
Really? That's where we're from.

778
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:04,208
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

779
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,875
Anyway, here's the story.

780
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,542
I scored with these two chicks.
True story.

781

Heh heh heh. Yeah. Me, too.

782
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,083
You scored with two chicks?

783
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:15,875
Yeah. They were sluts.

- Shut up, dumb-ass!

786
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:24,958
You didn't score.
I scored with both of 'em.

787
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,375
Uh, do you think these two sluts
still live in Highland?

788
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,792
That would be cool.

789
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:36,583
Hey, you want to see
something really cool?

wants to give his thanks.

1277
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,792
Beavis and Butt-head,

1278
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:35,458
on behalf of your fellow Americans,

1279
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,708
I extend my deepest thanks.

1280
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:41,875
You exemplify a fine new crop
of young Americans,

1281
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,917
who will grow into the leaders
of this great country.

1282
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,917
Uh huh huh huh. He said "extend".

1283
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,292
Oh, yeah.

1284
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:52,875
In recognition
for your great service,

1285
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,500
I'm appointing you honorary agents

1286
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:58,333
in the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco & Firearms.

1287
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,417
Whoa!

1288
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,792
Alcohol and tobacco?

1289
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:02,917
Yeah.

1290
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:06,250
- And firearms! Yeah.
- Cool, huh?

1291
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,750
Cigarettes and beer kick ass.

1292
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:09,917
Yeah! Yeah!

1293
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:14,042
We're in the Bureau
of beer and fire and cigarettes.

1294
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,833
And maybe some chicks, too.

1295
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,542
This is gonna be cool.

1296
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,917
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh heh.

1297
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,917
You know what sucks?
We never scored, or got any money.

1298
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,583
Yeah. Really.

1299
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:34,750
Um...

1300
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,792
And my butt's still sore,

1301
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,042
and that chick with the braces...

1302
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,375

01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:57,750
Hey, Butt-head.
Do you think we're ever gonna score?

1309
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,875
Uh, I probably will.

1310
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,292
But not you. Uh huh huh huh.

1311
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:04,625
You're too much of a butt-monkey.

1312
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:09,333
- Shut up, dill-hole. Mm heh heh.

Shut up, Butt-head.

Um, hey, doesn't Tom Anderson
live on this street?

1316
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:22,292
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause, um...

1317
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:26,292
I just need to stop by his tool shed
for a minute.

Heh heh heh.
You know what I'm saying?
