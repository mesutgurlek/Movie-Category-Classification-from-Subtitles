1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,200
- daddy, wake up!

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,600
Wake up, daddy, wake up!
Wake up.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,900
- oh, hey.
What's going on, sweetie?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
- it's time to put my patch on.
Hurry up daddy.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,000
- trinity has got to quit
smoking.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,000
I can't have her smoking
anymore, it's ridiculous.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,900
- she was on cigarettes
last year,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,000
And they put her on the little,
little patch she used to wear

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
And I thought she was off
the cigarettes.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,600
Now apparently she's back
on the cigarettes,

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,200
And she's on them hard too.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,500
- she had the idea
we quit together,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,800
A good father/daughter thing.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,000
So we're gonna quit,
go on the patch.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
- I only got one patch left,
so I to give you half.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,700
- you took the last patch?!

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,800
- well, I just needed it
last night. Here.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll give you half of it.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,000
- I want a cigarette.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,800
- I want one too, but we can't.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,500
We promised we're gonna quit
smoking together. Remember?

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,400
We can do this, can't we?

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
- we can do it.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,000
- let's go to the store
and get some more patches.

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,000
You want to start the car up?
- yeah.

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,800
It's the gas injectors, daddy.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,200
- no, it's probably
out of gas, honey.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
I have to steal gas
cause I'm broke.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,500
Gas is a fortune now
with all this government
bullshit taxes and stuff.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
It pisses me off,
cause provinces like texas
and calgary, it's not so bad.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,200
It should be the same
everywhere.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,300
But the government is friggin
screwed up that way.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Drives me nuts.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,600
- ricky, what are you doing?
Do you want to go back to jail?

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
- borrowing a little bit of gas.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
You can't go back to jail
for that.

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,800
- is that true, julian?

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,200
- yeah, you can't go back
to jail for stealing gas.

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,900
- supreme. Can't believe
lahey burns supreme.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,400
- jail is fun, and the food
and stuff is really good there,

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
But you know, I guess
it's more fun outside of jail

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,800
When you can still do crazy
things and get better dope

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
And get drunk
and stuff like that,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,300
So it's not
that we don't like jail,

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
But we just don't really want
to go back to jail anytime soon

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
So we decided talking to people
in jail that the best thing
we can do

47
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,700
Is still break the law but do it
on a lower-type-scale
kind of thing.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
You guys are probably wondering
why we called this meeting.

49
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,300
We want you to shut the fuck up
and listen to julian.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,900
- alright, guys, I'm never, ever
going back to jail again, okay.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
I've got a plan
to make money.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
I think it's perfect.
We're gonna do low-risk crimes

53
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,400
And open up some small
semi-legit businesses.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
- you gotta do two things.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
Instead of breaking the law
big time for a big payday,

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,500
You gotta break the law a lot
but little tiny crimes

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,700
And then you still make
as much money and the cops
won't mess with you.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,100
And you need to set goals
is the second thing,

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,100
Where you want
everybody to want do something.
So what we're thinking,

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,700
Or what julian is thinking,
I don't mean
to take credit for it,

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
He wants us to go on a cruise.

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
Break the law,
work towards that.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,600
So you don't get people
ratting you out

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,200
And got something
to look forward to.

65
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,500
When you're breaking the law,
you know it's for something.

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,400
- if you guys work for me,
you'll get employee benefits.

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,300
You'll get paid
like any other job,

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Except there's gonna be
a higher vacation-pay deduction.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
- he's taking off
60% of everything,
it goes into this fund,

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,000
And we get on a big boat
and go party.

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
It's gonna be wicked.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,100
- you mean one of those big
cocksuckers out on the ocean?

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,500
- yeah.
Awesome food, there's booze,

74
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,400
There's ladies,
I'm talking dope.

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
- ladies. Video games.
- all inclusive.

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
- probably got video games,
yeah, everything.

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
- oh boys, I hope you're not
teasing me right now.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,100
That would be cruel. Cause
I wanted to go on a trip

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,500
Since I don't know when.
I couldn't ever afford it.

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,700
- guys, if we all
work together on this,
we can make this happen.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,300
- what's the first thing we need
to do, julian? Sign me up.

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,400
- we're gonna open up
a little gas station
here in the trailer park.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,900
- ha! Let's do it.

84
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,200
- I'd do anything
to go on a cruise, julian.

85
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,500
- there's no way
this can get fucked up.

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
- it's gonna be just like
a real gas station
we're running at ricky's.

87
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,300
Julian's making me
the gas-distribution manager,

88
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,800
Which is the most important job
there is.
I can't let the boys down,

89
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,700
I gotta work my ass off
so that we can do the, uh,
go on the cruise.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I've never been
on a fucking cruise before.

91
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,400
- you gas this up yesterday?

92
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
- yeah,
I put fifty bucks in her.

93
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,500
- the gas gauge reads empty.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Siphoning.

95
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,000
What kind of idiots
would steal gas
from the trailer-park supervisor

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
And think they could get away
with it, randy?

97
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,900
- unleaded, blue container.
Supreme, red container.

98
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,200
Diesel in the green. Okay,
are we clear here, guys?

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
- yeah, but how can you tell
which is the supreme?

100
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
- what are you stupid?
You fucking taste it.

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,500
Unleaded tastes a little tangy,

102
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,600
Supreme is kind of sour
and diesel tastes pretty good.

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
- will you please...
For godsake's, stop it.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Man, can you do something
about your daughter?

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
- just let her hit you, corey.
Stand down and listen to me.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
- stop it! Stop it!

107
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,700
- hey, hey. Corey.

108
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
You gonna fight my daughter
who's nine years old?

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,300
You're probably
going to get hurt, okay.

110
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,800
Stand down and listen to me.
Boys, don't fuck this up.

111
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,500
I am your boss.
You do what I say when I say it,

112
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
Or I'll report you to julian

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
And you won't be going
on this cruise, okay?

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,500
- come on,
that's ridiculous, dude.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
- corey, shut up and leave
my daughter alone, and listen.

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Go to the store,
get julian some rum
and go siphon some gas.

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
I gotta take trinity
to get patches.
- sure, man.

118
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,500
- can we take bubbles?
- you bet we can.

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,400
- we'll take the money
from the gas station
and launder it here,

120
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,400
So you don't have any onsite.
- cool. That's a great idea.
- yeah, I know.

121
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,100
- we'll have coupons
from the salon
so that you know who's cool.

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Different-coloured coupons
for a different amount.

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
If somebody
gets a perm coupon,

124
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
It's like twenty or forty bucks'
worth of gas.

125
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
- great idea, lucy.
And we'll take twenty percent.

126
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
- twenty percent.
Come on, girls. Fifteen percent.

127
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not gonna go any higher.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
- no, julian. I said twenty.

129
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,100
- alright, if we're gonna do
this coupon thing,
twenty percent. That's fine.

130
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,200
- okay. Lucy and I will sell
coupons all over the park.

131
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
- hi, mr. Lahey.

132
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,900
- we're about to sail
into a shit typhoon, randy,

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,400
So we better haul in the jib
before it gets covered
with shit.

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
- what are you doing here,
mr. Lahey?

135
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,500
- video evidence, randy. Because
video evidence doesn't lie.

136
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
In a court of law,

137
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Video evidence
is tantramar to the truth.

138
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
- hi jacob.
- oh hey, trin.

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,400
- how's it going?  I need
a box of nicotine patches.

140
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
- whoa! What are you doing?
Don't shoot me.

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
- I went in to buy some patches
and all of a sudden,

142
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,200
My gun was out,
which is no big deal,

143
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
And he freaks out, thought
we were robbing the place.

144
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
- oh no, no, it's alright.
We're not robbing you

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
Or anything like that.
Oh, trinity!

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
(gunfire)

147
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
(screaming)

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,400
- everything is cool. Get
the fuck back up here, jacob.

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,700
Everything is fucking cool here.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
- trinity, how many times
does daddy have to tell you,

151
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,300
You can't play
with his handguns.

152
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
- you shouldn't leave it
laying around.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
- it's okay, sweetie.
- we're on video camera.

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,300
- so since it was
on video camera,

155
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,000
I decided,
we take a bit of shit.

156
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,200
- for the legal record,
we were not robbing the store.

157
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,800
- it looks like
we robbed the place.
Go grab some groceries, bubbles.

158
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,500
- we're not taking anything,
ricky.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,700
- it's not robbing.
Instead of suing,
we're gonna take a bit of shit.

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
I want a copy
of the videotapes.

161
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
If the cops saw this shit,
I'd go to jail for ten years.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,900
- if you're gonna go to jail for
robbing the place you may as--

163
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
(dog barking)
will you shut the fuck up, dog?

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,400
If it looks you robbed a place,
you take some shit.

165
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,900
I'm not gonna jail
for robbing a place.

166
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,000
So we took a bit of stuff.

167
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
- are you alright, ricky?
- yup.

168
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,500
- you said you're not supposed
to smoke with the patch on.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
- daddy's bigger than you
so he can.

170
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm having a couple
cause they were free.

171
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
- ricky! Where
did you get this stuff?

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,100
Don't tell me you stole it.
- I didn't steal it.

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
- they did steal it.

174
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,200
- oh no, julian, uh, going
into a store, firing a gun off,

175
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,000
And leaving without paying for
everything, that's not stealing.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
- yes, it is stealing.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,500
- trinity accidentally
fired my gun off,

178
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,800
It looked we robbed the place,
so we took a bit of stuff.

179
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,500
- of course,
it's not a big deal.

180
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,900
- ricky
got the surveillance tape.

181
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,200
He's got everything
under control.

182
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
- exactly.
- nothing to worry about.

183
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,600
- you've got to stop fucking
around, okay, please!

184
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,000
You keep pulling stunts
like this,

185
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,200
We're gonna be back in jail
so fast ricky.

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
- we're not going back to jail.

187
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,600
- julian!
We got our first customer, boys.

188
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,900
- how's it going?

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,000
We got a perm coat coupon,
that's 20 regular.

190
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,800
And a cut and blow.
We're gonna need
a safety inspection, bubbles.

191
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
- safety inspection!

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
- get the fuck out of my way!

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
- sorry about this.

194
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
- julian, he's got
a cigarette lit and I'm covered
in flammable liquids.

195
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,700
- put that out!
Put it out, ricky!

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
Put it out!

197
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,500
- oh my god.
- daddy, I want a smoke!

198
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,800
- you can't smoke
with the patch on.

199
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,400
Give me that cigarette.

200
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
- you have a patch on
and you're smoking it.

201
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
- I'm way bigger than you.
Trinity,
don't lit that cigarette.

202
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
- why not?

203
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,800
- julian, hold this for a
second. Give me that cigarette.

204
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
- how come ricky's
in charge of the gas?

205
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,400
- I'm serious,
I need that cigarette.

206
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
Mummy's gonna be mad.
You know what mummy will say.

207
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,300
- well, mummy will say,
mummy will get mad at you

208
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Because you're smoking
with the patch on.

209
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,000
- trinity, give daddy
the cigarette, please.

210
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,200
- drop your cigarette.

211
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Step on it.

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
- give me the cigarette.
- no.

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,000
- it's diesel, man.
- man, I'm feeling sick, dude.

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,300
- maybe we should stop
doing this.

215
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,900
- yeah man, but the cruise.
We gotta do the cruise.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
- yeah,
I guess it's not that bad.

217
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,400
- oh, shit, security dude.
- oh, fuck man.

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
What the fuck are you doing?

219
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,200
- oh! Oh!

220
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,200
- fuck you.

221
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
(horns honking)

222
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
- we're drawing
too much attention.

223
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,800
We gotta shut it down
for a while.

224
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,700
- it's ricky's fault.
- listen, man, we're drawing
too much attention.

225
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,400
Lahey could come around.
J rock, tyrone,

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
We're shutting down for a while.
Move these cars out.

227
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,700
- people are yelling at me...

228
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Change tires and--
- I paid for it!

229
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
- that's a fucking good muffler.
I'm keeping that fucking thing.

230
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
- get the fuck going, come on.

231
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,300
- I bet you this coupon
doesn't get you a perm.

232
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
- it says perm
right on it there, mr. Lahey.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
- randy,
there's a distinct possibility

234
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,200
That ricky and julian are
operating a prostitution ring.

235
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
Is this rolling?

236
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,400
- rolling.
- see the camera?

237
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
- can't see a thing.
- let's move.

238
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,200
- I was thinking
of more height in here.

239
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,700
What the hell
do you want, lahey?

240
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,900
- well, we'll have whatever
these coupons will get us.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
- alright, have a seat.

242
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
- thank you.

243
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
- have you ever had one
of these before?

244
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
- never.
- hey, what are you doing?

245
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
- undoing my pants,
they're a little tight.

246
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,800
- you can do them back up.
- jesus, randy.

247
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,100
- look, there's a lot of traffic
in ricky's lot.

248
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Ergo, they're doing
something illegal.

249
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,200
We're gonna get them
on videotape,

250
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,600
And when we have
enough evidence,

251
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,500
We're gonna call in 9-1-1,

252
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,600
Law enforcement,
the cops, the boys in blue.

253
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,400
We'll have it all
on tape, randy.

254
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,400
- right, come ahead.
Alright, j rock,
I'm opening up again, okay.

255
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,200
I want to keep
everything low-key,

256
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,700
I don't want to see
a traffic jam here, alright?

257
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,000
- let's get this pump going.
Got your coupon?

258
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
- yup, right here.
- twenty bucks, perfect.

259
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,200
- what are you doing?

260
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,600
- pumping your fucking gas,
what does it look like?

261
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,300
- with a cigarette
in your mouth?
You're gonna kill somebody, man.

262
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
- give me a level, randy.
- check one,

263
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,200
Check two, test one, test two.
- that'll do.

264
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
We've got them on multiple
angles, so they're fucked.

265
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,700
Rundown, randy, let's go.

266
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,300
- pull into the zone,
contact the target.

267
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,900
Procure stolen merchandise.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Ensure we capture
the exchange on tape,

269
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,100
Then fall back
to the designated safety area.

270
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
- I'll be in the woods.

271
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,500
The sale goes down,
I'll call in the heavies.

272
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
Are we clear?
- clear, mr. Lahey!

273
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,000
- hey julian, we just saw lahey
and randy snooping around.

274
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,400
- they've got a video camera
hooked up to their car.

275
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
- holy shit.
- what are you doing with this?

276
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,800
- you have her working here?
- she's not working here.

277
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
- you've got my daughter working
at an illegal gas station.

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,600
- she's my daughter too
and she's not working.

279
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,300
- let's get her out of here.
You better not fuck this up.

280
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,100
- that's my squeegee.

281
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,700
Julian, do you think
that's true?

282
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,300
Lahey's gonna have us on
videotape selling illegal gas.

283
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,000
- ricky, ricky, get over here.
Get over here. Alright, boys.

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Everybody stay calm.
There's no money onsite here,
okay?

285
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,200
We can shut this business down
at any time.

286
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
Lahey doesn't have shit on us.

287
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,600
- well apparently lahey's
got all these cameras.

288
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,600
He's got some in his car
and he's got handheld video.
He's gonna catch us on tape.

289
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,000
So, julian's got
this great idea, we throw it
right back in his face.

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,700
- boys! Where in the hell
were you guys?

291
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
- we're sick, julian. We've been
drinking fucking gas.

292
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,000
We've just gotta sit down
for a minute.

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,300
- what the fuck took so long?
- come on, dude.

294
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,900
Here's your shit, man.
(smashing sound)

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,300
- oh, fucking nice one, corey.
You smashed the rum.

296
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
- I'm sorry, dude.

297
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
- you're gonna have to
get him more.

298
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
- I'm all fucked up, man.
Drinking this shit.
I think I'm dying.

299
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,900
- you've got a customer, julian.

300
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,400
- j rock, take care
of this customer.

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
- you guys
just got gas sickness.

302
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,900
Drink some water
and dilute it, man.

303
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,100
You'll be fine
in six to eight days.

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,800
- ricky, you can't smoke
with the patch on.
You're gonna get dizzy.

305
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,000
- I'm fine. Oh fuck,
here comes fucking randy
and his stupid fucking cameras.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
- boys.
- what are we gonna do?

307
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,600
- stay calm and do what
we rehearsed, alright?

308
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,400
- hey boys. What's going on?
- hey randy.

309
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,300
- everything's cool.
I know what's going on here.

310
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,900
I just want some cheap stuff,
just like everybody else.

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,400
- randy, you better go on
with your perm coupon,

312
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,200
Gut cassidy and
the sundance cheeseburger.

313
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,500
- what?

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
- what are you looking
at my eyes for?

315
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,900
I got no candy for you.
- just a second, randy. Boys.

316
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
- holy fuck, I'm dizzy.
- don't look now.
- it's the patch.

317
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,200
- don't look now,
but lahey is in the woods
with a video camera. Don't look.

318
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,200
- fuck, julian,
what are we gonna do?

319
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,500
- just stay calm
and stick to the plan.

320
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,000
- he's gonna get us.
- corey, trevor.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,300
Deal with randy.
Let's go, trevor.

322
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,100
Get up. Take care of randy.

323
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,500
- okay, boys.
Here's twenty dollars cash.
Fill it up for me, please.

324
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
- ricky?

325
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,100
- we don't want your money,
corey and trevor.

326
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
- what's wrong
with you guys anyway?

327
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,500
- we're sick
from all the fucking gas
we've been stealing.

328
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,700
We should be better
in six to eight days though.

329
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
- why corey and trevor,
that's highly illegal.

330
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,300
You shouldn't be stealing gas,
corey and trevor.

331
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,700
- it's fucked up
to be stealing gas
like corey and trevor did.

332
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,100
And I don't want anything to do
with corey and trevor's
gas stealing.

333
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,300
- is this the gas
you were stealing right here?

334
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
- what the fuck
was that all about?

335
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,800
- is this the gas you stole?
- is that the gas you stole?

336
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
- it's what you told us to do.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,100
- good job, guys.
- I just gotta chill out

338
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
For a second, guys.
I'm fucking dizzy here.

339
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,300
(explosion)

340
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,000
- holy fuck, boys!

341
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,500
- holy fuck, ricky!
What are you doing, mo-fucker?

342
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
(sirens)

343
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,400
- it wasn't me!
I didn't do shit!

344
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
(yelling and swearing)

345
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,200
- thank you, mr. Lahey,

346
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
For your expert testimony

347
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
And for providing
this very illuminating tape.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Your honour,
I think the video evidence

349
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,700
Clearly speaks for itself

350
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
And that any sane
and rational person

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Would have no choice
but to convict

352
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
These individuals
of these ridiculous crimes.

353
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,500
- blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, fuck.

354
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,900
- oh, objection.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,700
That's the seventeenth time
that he has sworn so far.

356
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,100
- richard, please?

357
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,400
- alright. I'm fuck... I'm sorry
about all the bullsh...

358
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,100
About all the stuff.

359
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
But the prosecutor
is a f... He's a f...

360
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,000
He's an f-ing bad guy
and he's pissing me off.

361
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
- he can't even speak
without swearing.

362
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
Your honour, this is ludicrous.

363
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,700
It's a disgrace
to these proceedings.

364
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,100
- richard, since you chose
to defend yourself

365
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,700
And fire the public defender,

366
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,300
I guess it's your turn
to question the witness.

367
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,900
- thank you, your majesty.

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
- and richard, before you begin,

369
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,600
I'd like to say
that I think this is a bad idea.

370
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
However, you do have
a right to defend yourself,

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
So proceed, but please remember
to watch your language.

372
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
- look, I can't speak
without swearing
and I've only got my grade 10.

373
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,600
I haven't had a cigarette
since I've been arrested

374
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,300
And I'm ready to snap,
so I'd like to make a request

375
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,900
Under the people's freedom
of choices and voices act

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
That I be able to smoke
and swear in your courtroom.

377
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Cause if I can't smoke
and swear, I'm fucked

378
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,000
And so are all these guys.

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
I won't be able to properly
express myself

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
At a court level
and that's bullshit.

381
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,500
It's not fair,
and if you ask me,
I think it's a fucking mistrial.

382
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,800
- this man
can't represent anyone.

383
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
Your honour,
he's a complete and total idiot.

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
- well, although I am opposed
to that kind of language
in my courtroom,

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm gonna allow it,
as unfortunately,

386
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,000
It is part of your right
to a fair trial.

387
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,700
So you may proceed,
but please,

388
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,900
I want to remind you
that this is not a carnival.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Richard, you have permission
to smoke and swear.

390
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
- thank you. I've just gotta get
some cigarettes actually.

391
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,200
Let's go, smokes.

392
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,800
- but I only got two left.
- I don't care.

393
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,500
You've been a dick.
It's the least you can do.

394
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,400
- oh, for the love of god.

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,500
- just the defendant please.

396
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
- my first order of business
is to tell the prosecutor

397
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
To shut up and wipe
that stupid grin off his face,

398
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,800
Cause it's distractulating
my case.

399
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,400
Next I'd like to announce
that randy and lahey

400
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,900
Have been drinking
all fucking day,

401
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,400
They're wasted out of their
minds and they're both assholes.

402
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,900
And the testimony they just gave
was total fucking bullshit.

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
I can prove it
and I'm gonna show
you what happened here.

404
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,500
- okay, boys,
here's twenty dollars cash.
Fill it up for me please.

405
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,700
- don't know what that's for.
Probably prostitution.

406
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,300
We don't want your money.

407
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,500
Watch him put right, right
in his pocket, right there.

408
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,500
- oh, man, we're sick
from stealing so much gas.

409
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,100
But we should be better
in like six to eight days.

410
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,700
- stealing gas!
Why, corey and trevor,
that's highly illegal.

411
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
You shouldn't be stealing gas,
corey and trevor.

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,900
- that's right, it's fucked up
to be stealing gas
like corey and trevor did,

413
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,700
And I don't want anything to do
with corey and trevor's
gas stealing.

414
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,700
We wanted nothing to do with it.
- me neither,
you know what I'm saying?

415
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,300
Only whack suckers
like corey and trevor
steal gas, and deal dope.

416
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
- now, I don't want
to say anything about the dope,

417
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,800
Cause you know,
I don't know
anything about that.

418
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,200
But clearly they accepted money
on film and they admitted

419
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
They stole gas.
And they're sick,
I mean look at them.

420
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,800
That's gas sickness.
Fucking idiots.

421
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
I've got nothing else to say,

422
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Except that the crown and lahey
can go fuck themselves.

423
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,100
- you're not buying
any of this bullshit, are you?

424
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,100
- sit down, sir, or
you'll be in contempt of court.
And watch your language.

425
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,700
- yeah lahey, sit the fuck down.

426
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Truth fucking hurts, doesn't it,
you son of a bitch.

427
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Whatever. Defence rests,
everybody else can fuck off.

428
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
Except you. I didn't mean you.

429
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
- thank you, richard.
You may be seated.

430
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,800
- can you guys get the fuck out
of the way, please?

431
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,600
- okay, well I think
I've heard enough,

432
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,500
And I'll be back shortly
with my verdict.

433
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,700
- well you know, just because
these young men

434
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Have little education
and live in squalor,

435
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,800
It doesn't entitle them
to commit antisocial behaviour
and get away with it.

436
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,900
- there's two things mo-fuckers
gotta know about j to the r o c.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,800
First of all, I spin more rhymes
than a lazy susan

438
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,200
And I'm innocent
until my guilt is proven.

439
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,400
Peace. Representing sunnyvale,
straight the fuck up.

440
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
- be seated please.

441
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,000
Well, I've reached a verdict
in this ridiculous case,

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
And I do mean ridiculous.

443
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,800
Given richard's deconstruction
of the video evidence,

444
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
Clearly trevor and corey
are the only ones

445
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,400
With any hard evidence
against them here.

446
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,600
- but we were framed.

447
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,100
- quiet please.
- you fucked up.

448
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,700
- therefore, I find richard,
julian, jamie and bubbles

449
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,900
Not guilty on all counts.

450
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
(cheering)

451
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,000
- order please. Order please.

452
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,200
Trevor and corey, please stand.

453
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,900
I find you guilty
and sentence you
to 450 hours' community service.

454
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
Case closed.

455
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,000
- trevor and corey
got a bit of community service,
which sort of sucks,

456
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,000
But it's good experience
they should be doing

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,700
That sort of stuff,
going to jail once in a while.

458
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,300
We do it.
Why they shouldn't be doing it?

459
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't really
feel bad about that.

460
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,100
It's their fault.
- what's going on guys?

461
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,700
We haven't seen you in so long.
What's up?

462
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
- julian,
tell them why we're here.

463
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,700
- we just wanted to say thanks
for not ratting us out,

464
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
And to not forget we're going
on a cruise. Remember that.

465
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,900
- we'd never rat you out julian.
- yeah, man.

466
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,300
- ricky, give them the stuff.
Come on.

467
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,800
- brought you guys some smokes
and a couple of joints, alright.

468
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,700
- oh man, thanks, dude.
That's dope.

469
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
- thanks a lot.
- so we're cool?

470
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,800
- yeah, man.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
(tires squealing)
