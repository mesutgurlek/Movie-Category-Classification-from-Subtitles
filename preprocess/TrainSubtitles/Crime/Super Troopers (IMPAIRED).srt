00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,389
What's the matter, your mama
didn't teach you how to chug?

150
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,059
Come on, Thorn.
Come on, Thorn.

151
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,649
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.

152
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,240
[ Belches ]
I am all that is man.

153
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,909
- Every time.
- Finish it up.

154
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,240
[ Sighs ]

155
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,500
See, there you have it.
You're doing it all wrong.
Open your throat, relax the jaw.

156
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,879
Don't forget to cup the balls.
You're never gonna win...

157
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,000
with those thin little
bird lips you got there.

158
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,169
This guy's got these
big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?

159
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,259
So much of my authority is
derived from the power right here.

160
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,679
Hey, guys.

161
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,389
Wow.

162
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,190
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
-Sorry, Urs.

163
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,029
- Why couldn't they chug ketchup?
- [ Laughs ]

164
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,409
It's a good thing
you didn't order hash browns.

165
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,659
I mean, if they had been
chugging the ketchup.

166
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,539
[ Rabbit ] You get the score of that
Red Sox game last night?

167
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,500
- I turned it off just after--
- Ah, waiter. There you are.

168
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,419
I will have the enchilada platter
with two tacos and no guacamole.

169
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,379
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.

170
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,720
I don't get it. Tacos?

171
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,889
They think I'm Mexican.

172
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,139
You're not Mexican?

173
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,889
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?

174
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,110
Yeah, if they can figure
which hole to stick it in.

175
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,019
- Ah, what the fuck?
- [ Laughs ]

176
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,320
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.

- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin' started it!

180
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys
get that syrup in them...

181
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,470
they get a little antsy
in their pantsy.

182
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,470
You just can't
keep them under control.

183
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,809
You should keep these dogs
on a leash, John.

184
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,929
Let's go.

185
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,019
* A-number one top gun cadets *

186

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,330
Hey, what's up, bone diddlies?
Did I miss the song?

191
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,750
- [ Mumbling ]
- Sing it again, rookie bitch.

192

Farva.

193
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,500
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.

194
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,919
All right, all right.
Let's get started.

195
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,299
I got the latest
shit list, gentlemen.

196
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,009
It's down to Flagstone,
Deer Lick and us.

197
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,429
And if we keep up these low numbers,
you can bet your sweet butts...

198
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,059
we're gonna get
the big, ugly ax.

199
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,059
- Who'll bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!

200
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,730
- [ Booing ]
-And you better believe
that Grady and his goons...

201
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,029
have got a copy of this list,
so we need to step it up.

202
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,690
Who wants cream?

203
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,240
Nobody? Okay, no cream.

204
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,909
Foster, how many tickets
did you issue last week?

205
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,539
- Uh, I don't have my figures
here in front of me.
- Three.

206
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,919
- I can't make 'em speed.
- Try hidin'.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,710
- And grow a goddamn
moustache, why don't ya?
- I haven't shaved in two weeks.

208
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,419
- I'm growin' mine.
- Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?

209
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:09,799
- I'll tell you when
it's time to grow a moustache.
- Coffee's served!

210
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,350
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's.
That's Rabbit's.

211
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:15,389
- I get it. It's Rabbit's.
- Oh, look, a bar of soap.

Oh, shit!
I got you good, you fucker!

213
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,559
- Awesome prank, Farva.
- Better than the crap you pull, Frank.

214
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,360
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook.
Make him look like a dick.

215
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,860
every Thursday night I walk
into the Lodge to play Hearts...

216
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,159
and they always have my
Old-Fashioned just waiting there.

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,700
- I like that.
- Bite it. Bite--

218

Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!

219
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,500
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.

220
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,299
I'll be damned if I'll let
Grady and those buttheads
get their hands on it!

221
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,840
Thorny, you're
the ranking officer here.

222

Let's do your jobs
and keep this place open, huh?
Let's do it. Farva!

223
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,480
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.

Oh, yes.

- All right, hit it.

was talking about.

228

No, no, no.

- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?

Am I saying "meow"?

- I-I-I thought--
- Don't think, boy.

- Meow, do you know

Meow, what is so damn funny?

I could have sworn
you said "meow."

- Do I look like a cat to you, boy?
- [ Laughs ]

- Think that's funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

267
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,630
Also heard something funny
about how you got suspended.

268
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,630
Something about
a school bus full of kids?

Oh, you heard that, did ya?
Let me tell you another
funny story, New Jack.

270
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,430
Back in '7 4...

271
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,470
the great Charlie Rich was
named Country Musician of the Year.

272
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,769
Then in '75, he had to hand
the award off to the new one.

273
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,940
And you know who that was?

274
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,769
Mr. "Sunshine on
My Goddamn Shoulders,"
John Denver.

- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?

- Amazing.
- Yeah.

Well, I'll be damaged
if Mr. Rich didn't pull out
his cigarette lighter...

00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,539
and light that award on fire
in front of everyone.

Do you get it?

281
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,420
So you're saying you'll set
my Country Music Award on fire?

282
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,210
I'm saying when my suspension's up,
you better watch your ass.

283
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,089
Or you'll light my ass on fire?

No. I've been thinking a lot
about what the captain said.

- Okay.

Excuse me one second.
[ Chuckles ] No.

wrong, officers...

because I know
I wasn't speeding.

- Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?

- Oh, man.

Nah, we just parked it
across the street.

about this Galikanokus guy?

- Fake soap company.

- No, like they don't exist.

I got a theory, Cap.

These, uh, bales of pot,
they have that red Johnny Chimpo
sticker on them.

And that dead woman
in the Winnebago had the same
logo tattooed on her back.

518

See, a lot of drug dealers
use stickers to mark their
products. Like a brand name.

Shut up, Farva.

- Was there any marijuana
on that Winnebago?
- Nope.

cheap Japanese cartoons?

No? This is basically
a cheaper Afghani knockoff.

It's this monkey that basically
travels around the world...

You're gonna have a hard time
shutting us down now,
right, Mr. Mayor?

a drug bust the next.

00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:53,059
You know, you can't
tell anybody about this.

732
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,809
- I already told
my mom about you.
- [ Giggles ]

733
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,619
- Ohh! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
- [Wood Creaking ]

734
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,329
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.

735
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,670
Wow! What is this?

736
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,469
- Rabbit, you're off the road!
Shut up, Farva!
- It's a good move, Cap.

737
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,389
Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.

738
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:35,179
- Wait a minute--
- What do you want me
to do about it?

739
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,519
My hands are tied!
It's all over the police band!

740
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,849
Rabbit, you couldn't
have picked a worst time!

741
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,860
I got a Q-17 request form today.

742
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,280
We have to inventory
our equipment.

743
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,030
Which means our balls are
this close to the band saw.

744
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:53,449
What are you sellin',
Mac, hot dogs?

745
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,250
- There's a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?

746
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:58,869
-[ Humming Fanfare ]
- Let me guess.

747
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,539
You just humped the mayor's wife
and burnt down City Hall.

748
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,130
I'll do you one better,
Captain.

749
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,630
So I'm walkin' down
by the local police station,
minding my own business.

750
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,179
But there's something
funny in the air.

751
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,219
I feel like I just gotta
get into that Winnebago.

752
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:17,849
- So after I jimmy the door,
I do a quick recon.
- Bullshit.

753
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,150
I can see there's something
not right about that bed.

754
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,440
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.

755
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,690
And just sittin' there
were ten huge duffel bags
of these mothers.

756
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,320
Let me get this straight.
You went into the impound,
scaled the fence...

757
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:37,829
broke into the Winnebago
and smashed the bed,
all on a hunch?

758
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,750
I'll believe that when me shit
turns purple and smells like
rainbow sherbet.

759
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:44,840
What? Do you think
I just grew this weed?

760
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,710
How could you know
to look underneath the bed?

761
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,969
It must have been my sixth--
or even my seventh sense.

762
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,050
You know, Rabbit,
a good cop doesn't really
know why he does anything.

763
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:58,559
- Disregard that, Rabbit.
- And you didn't even think
to call in your partner?

764
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,809
So these local mothers
have got a hundred keys
of chiba and don't know it?

765
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,320
Not a clue.
It's totally hidden.

766
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,070
And Grady's walkin' around
like he's hot soup.
All right, we got a chance here.

767
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,280
But we got to beat
these guys to the punch.

768
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,159
Mac, you and Foster
check out the truck stops...

769
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,750
and find out what you can
about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.

770
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:23,500
I'll talk to Grady
and play a little hardball.
Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.

771
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:25,789
You got to promise me
no more bullshit.

772
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,670
Cap, you know I'm cool,
but I can take no responsibility
for these white devils.

773
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,590
Well, you're gonna have to.

774
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,969
Now, Rodney, we're under
a lot of pressure here.

775
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,809
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens...

776
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:41,730
count to ten,
take some deep breaths.

777
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:43,769
Ten deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.

778
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,070
[ O'Hagan ]
Foster, you’re on duty.

779
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,280
Trust me, skipper,
we'll make you proud.

780

-[ Foster ] You are awesome.
-[ Chuckling ]

- You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.
- Keep goin'.

782
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:03,420
Uh, and then somebody said,
I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...

783
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,800
- "Foster,
you deserve a promotion."
- Hmm. I think you get a star.

784
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,300
Mm. Foster? Wait.
I don't know if this is gonna work.

785
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,809
- This steering wheel
is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.

786
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,739
Ow! Okay.

787
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,949
In New York City, a guy
could pay ten bucks to watch
two cops have sex in a cage.

788
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,119
Yeah? [ Moans ]

789
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:45,619
Oh.

- Foster?
- Yeah?

791
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,960
In our cruisers,
somebody has to let you out
of the back seat.

792
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,550
Oh, fuck it!

793
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:05,599
Do we look like
the two dumbest guys
in the world to you?

794
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,269
Is that why
you choose to treat us
with such disrespect?

795
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,519
Look, all I'm sayin', man,
is switch partners. It'll be fun.

796
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,030
- I don't think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.

797
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,070
- Mm, no fuckin' way.
- [ Chuckles ]

798
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,449
Come on, Mac,
you know you're always sayin'
how funny Foster smells.

799
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:26,159
- Oh, look out for Thorny,
master of psychology.
- Do I really smell?

800
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,960
All right, assholes,
quit talkin' about me.

801

Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let's kick some tail.

802

- We weren't talkin' about you,
you big idiot.
- Bullshit.

- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.

804
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,429
But the captain
didn't say anything
about going undercover.

805
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:44,429
Do you think they're
gonna tell us anything
if they know we're cops?

Look, you're fuckin' super cop.

- Plus, we can't take our car...

removed last night.

in the damn thing.

I told you
I was in a very deep sleep.

813

Yeah. You wanna
tell that to O'Hagan? Maybe
we can borrow his car today.

- That reefer's locked
in the Winnebago...

which is locked in your impound,
which is guarded by assholes.

1018
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,420
All right.
Here's what I'll need.

1019
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:30,179
Five ski masks, a case
of smoke bombs--the good ones--

- and banana peels, lots of banana--
- Foster?

just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?

Yeah. What the hell.
We'll work together.

- Like Cagney and Lacey.
- [ Chuckles ]

Yeah. Well, Cagney
and Lacey were women.

our flak jackets.

before using his equipment
in the field?

- They test it. Exactly.

today, Thorn?

that little fella?

How are we going to get
into the local impound?

Most of the local cops
will probably already
be at the banquet.

1040
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:48,130
They'll leave, like,
one or two of the dumbest

is distract whoever
they leave there.

that Halloween costume?

ten minutes, you and I
can get into the impound...

and get it to the governor
before she leaves?

- Me?

- Now, don't get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?

1052

You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

1053
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:25,329
[ Thorny ] Lookin' good, Rabbit!
Now don't move!

1054

- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Cap!

- All right, Thorny.
Why'd you call me up here?

[ O'Hagan ] Good to know
you're still battin' for us with
the budget committee, Mayor.

1063

Well, I don't want
to mince words, John, but
it doesn't look too good.

1064
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,039
Maybe not to the untrained eye.

1065
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:14,420
But if I was a bettin' man,
I'd put money on us changin'
the governor's mind tonight.

- Then why are we here?
- Oh, I think we're pretty
well covered, Mr. Mayor.

1072

a lot of decisions to make.

01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:23,560
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.

1301
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:26,359
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.

1302
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,319
Farva, clean the cells!
I'm a cop, goddamn it!

1303
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,369
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!

1304
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,909
It's what I gotta do!

1305
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:41,039
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.

1306
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:45,090
Okay. Okay, I did!
I did, I did.

1307

-[ O'Hagan ] I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.

1308

- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.

1309
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,590
- [ Sobbing ]
- Listen, listen.
This is your big chance.

1310
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,180
When we go up there,
and we're wrong, no big deal.

1311
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,640
But if we're right,
you can be a hero.

1312
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:04,939
Come on. Team Ramrod!

1313

[ Foster ]
Will you look at that?

1314

[ O'Hagan ] There's Canadian
markings on that plane.

1317
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:25,000
Okay, Foster.
You and Rabbit come around
in a classic pincer move.

1318
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,130
- Mac, I need you to take--
- No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!

1319
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,460
We outflank 'em, and we do,
like, a submarine move.

1320
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,010
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.

1321
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,510
- [ Mac ] Farva, you're leaning--
- [ Rabbit ] Wait a minute!

1322
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:40,350
[ All ] Oh! The locals!
I hate those fuckin' guys!

1323
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:44,770
Goddamn it, you dipshits!
If I had my car, I'd have
been in on this bust!

1324
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:48,649
Shh! Rodney! Rodney,
get your ass back here!

1325
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:52,359
[ Thorny ] Here we go again--
What the fuck?

- Oh, did you see that?
He kissed that guy!
- Shh!

1327

Holy shit!

01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:03,409
[ Thorny ]
God! We should have known.

1329
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:08,130
So, wait. The local cops are selling
Afghani grass to the Canadians?

1330
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:10,670
-Assholes!
-[ Thorny ] No, Rabbit,
it's comin' in from Canada.

1331
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:13,510

-Assholes.
- No!

1333
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,930
The local mothers are
running protection for' em.

1334
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:21,180
- [ Sighs ]
- Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.

1335
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,850
- [ Surprised Shouts, Gasps ]
- I'm sorry we didn't
wait for you, but--

1336
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:27,939
Listen to me, Foster.
I need to tell you something.

1337
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:33,439
- What, are you guys drunk?
- [ All, Chattering ] No!

1338
01:24:33,529 --> 01:24:35,449
- Your local buddies are runnin' grass!
- Listen, I know.

1339
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:39,949
- I know what they're doing.
I've known for awhile.
- You know this?

1340
01:24:40,029 --> 01:24:42,119
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?

1341
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:46,579
No! They keep me on dispatch.
I didn't know what to do
when I found out about it.

1342
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,420
- I was afraid I'd lose my job.
- Oh.

1343
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,500
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.

1344
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:54,550
- Yeah, we used to be cops,
remember? Shh!
- I remember--

1345
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,880
No offense,
but the less you guys knew,
the less you could screw up.

1346
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:01,390
- Oh.
- I was trying to stop it
without getting brought down.

1347
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:04,640
Th-That's why I helped you find
the reefer, that's why I helped
you guys steal the Winnebago...

1348
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,350
and that's why
I brought you...here tonight.

1349
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:10,439
- Ah!
- You didn't do this because
you like Foster? Shh!

1350
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,770
No, I mean--
I do like Foster, but I--

1351
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:16,609
- But you used him.
- Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.

1352
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:18,739
Ah!

1353
01:25:18,819 --> 01:25:22,279
- [ Mac ] This is so good--
- This is kind of awkward.

1354
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:28,039
I hate to break up the "like-fest,"
but it's prime time for crime-time!

1355
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,329
But wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding?
Look at yourselves.

1356
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,090
You saw what they did to
Galikanokus's girlfriend.

1357
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,800
And you guys are drunk,
and unarmed.

1358

- Oh, hey,
I am sober as a bird.
