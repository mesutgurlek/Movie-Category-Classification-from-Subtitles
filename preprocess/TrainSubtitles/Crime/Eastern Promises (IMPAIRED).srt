00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,695
This booze is just like gifts
for Papa's friends.

482
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,900
The real import stuff is
from Kabul.

483
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:38,930
You understand?

484
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:44,438
Papa! You scared me.
What's wrong?
We're just sampling.

485
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,312
What's wrong?

486
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,318
Your friend Soyka is dead.

487
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,555
Yeah?

488
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:57,185
So what? It has nothing
to do with me.

489
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,855
No, no, no. Don't lie to me.

490
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,397
Papa, believe me.

491
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,400
I said don't lie to me!
Papa. Papa!

492
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,698
Don't lie to me!

493
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,467
Kirill. Your dad is right.
No point lying to him.

494
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,673
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
What are you saying?

495
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,404
Azim's nephew slit
Soyka's throat.

496
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,279
Kirill paid him to do it.

497
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,545
Shut your fucking mouth!

498
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,185
Your dad always
knows the truth.

499
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,681
It's okay, boss.
You don't have to worry.

500
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,885
What? I don't
have to worry?

501
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,762
I got rid of body myself.

502
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,356
Police won't find anything.

503
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,368
My son commits a murder
on my own doorstep.

504
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,301
A fellow soldier.

505
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,703
And no one thought
to tell me about it?

506
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,471
<i>Vory v zakone</i> code says,
"Never speak to anybody
about your captain."

507
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,375
Kirill is my captain.

508
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,310
When I find out
what happened,

509
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,874
we do what we have to,
to clean up situation.

510
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,979
Soyka was spreading lies
about Kirill.

511
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,717
About your family.

513
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,993
It was the right thing.

514
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,361
I decide what's right
and what's wrong.

515
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,199
You do not kill a <i>vor</i>
for no reason.

516
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:18,163
You know as well as I do,
Soyka was talking to police.

517
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,640
For a driver,
you are well-informed.

518
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,740
I have connections
with Chechens exporting cars.

519
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:31,686
They tell me Soyka speaks
to Russian desk,
Scotland Yard.

520
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,552
Kirill did the right thing.

521
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,486
He did a good thing
for our people.
They will appreciate that.

522
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,330
Yeah, Papa! I swear.
Shut up!

523
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,136
If you are so well-informed,

524
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:56,478
you will know Soyka
has brothers.

525
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,146
That's okay.
Kirill has got me.

526
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,283
It's okay?

527
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,047
Okay.

528
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,559
Get boxes out of sight.

529
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,163
So you heard him, <i>patsan!</i>
Now you get these boxes
out of sight.

530
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,201
Ok, ok.

531
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,548
Here.
Thank you.

532
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,256
How can you eat?
I'm hungry.

533
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,400
That's their driver.

534
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,100
Here he comes.

535
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,994
Meet in public place...

536
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,630
Lot of people around.
Very wise.

537
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,401
And I see
you bring bodyguards.

538
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:30,836
Also very wise.

539
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,909
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN) When I was
in the KGB, we knew how to
deal with scum like you.

540
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,143
And you did what there?

541
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,408
Stepan.

542
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,580
Anna?

543
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:13,842
Okay.

544
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,950
Thank you.

545
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,823
Now, you give me the address.
What address?

546
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,388

547
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,894
I don't know
what you're talking about.

548

See? You see?
I told you it would
happen like this.

She was 14! Read the diary.

551
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,681
She was 14 when he raped her.
You bastards murdered her.

552
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,514
Calm down.

553
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:54,651
Anger is very dangerous.
Makes people do stupid things.

Please, forget any of this
ever happened.

In this business,
sometimes the biggest danger

567
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,604
comes from
the most stupid things.

568

You can't afford to
be careless in any area.

569
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:46,325
So, what was the lie
Soyka was spreading
about my son?

570
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,203
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
It was nothing important.

571
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:52,172
Kirill had him killed
for nothing important?

572
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,439
I don't like to repeat this.

573
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,011
For me, you will repeat it.

574
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:05,043
You play with the prince
to do business with the king.

575
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:09,115
If you want to
do business with me
you must be open with me.

576
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,717
Thieves in law.

577
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,930
So what was Soyka saying
about the prince?

578
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,065
That he's a drunk.

579
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,143
And also,

580
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,577
a queer.

581
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,589
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
My only son.

582
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:53,529
You know,
it never snows in this city.

583
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,529
It's never hot.

584
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:01,037
London is a city
of whores and queers.

585
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,711
I think London is to blame

586
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,811
for what he is.

587
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,353
Why don't you go home?

588
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,087
Cold gets into my bones.

589
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:22,598
Also, KGB would
be waiting for me.

590
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,859
FSB.

591
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,670
They are called FSB now.

592
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,674
Whatever they call them,
they are worse even
than the KGB were.

593
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,278
The midwife said
she had an uncle.

594
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,114
A Russian.

595
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,552
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
I met him.

596
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,120
So you know
what he looks like.

597
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,322
Yes, yes.

598
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,863
She said he has
read the diary.

599
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,961
You cannot trust a Russian
with that kind of information.

600
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,000
Do you understand me?

601

Yes.

602
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,918
Perhaps you can
deal with him.

603
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:46,575
I thought that
I should bring it back
before it got stolen.

They were going to kill me.

643

Those Chechens are savages.

644
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,157
What did they say
about my son?

645
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,402
They said

646
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,101
they would spare me

647
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,701
only if I delivered
Kirill to them.

648

You are being
very, very honest.

I... I fear you
more than I fear them.

Never.

653

I will never listen
to Kirill again. I swear it.

654
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,209
Do they know

where to find Kirill?

656
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,513
They are like wolves.

657

Do they know
what he looks like?

658
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,952
No.

659
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,891
They have just arrived
from the mountains.

660
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:10,358
Tell them you will
deliver Kirill to them.

661
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,462
And tell them

662
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,803
to give you two days.

663
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,307
Two days.

I don't know.
I was passing.

Well, if you're passing,
just pass.

What's she talking about?

679
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,558
I didn't catch it.

01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,330
the baby I delivered
last Sunday is his daughter.

I don't know.

684
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:38,780
When he raped her,
she was a virgin.
Then they gave her pills.

685
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,816
He has to be the father.

Forget her.

690
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,588
She was 14.
She was just a child.

691

You don't pronounce
the name of my father.

You stop talking shit
about him.

693
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,565
You don't look
at her anymore.

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
That's an order.

695
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,542
Tell him what I said.
Tell him what?

696
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,910
There is nothing to tell.

697

Slaves give birth to slaves.

Yes, you know,

01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:30,292
the girl you fucked
the other day in front of me.
The Ukrainian bitch.

701
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:34,462
Anyway, so,
the police arrives,
some ordinary fucking police.

702
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,064
They just kick down the door
and ask for her by name.

703
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,368
Then they just
take her away.

704
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,970
Like some fucking punter
just might have given them
her name or something?

I've never seen
so many old people

01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,718
Whose party is that?

The angel of death?

go down into the cellar
and bring up some brandy.

714
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,431
Twelve bottles.

Kolya, you hear that?

716
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:19,305
Go down in the cellar.
Get 12 bottles of brandy
for Papa.

717
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,907
No, no. He stays here.

718
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,975
I want to talk business.

719

Business?

720
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,147
What business?

721
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,159
Papa! What business?

722
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,357
His business is my business.

723
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,594
Go to the cellar, Kirill.

My father was

He fixed the cars

You went through the Crosses
in St. Petersburg?

776
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,009
I was in solitary confinement
a dozen times.

777
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,516
I was called 'T he Stump<i>'</i>
because they couldn't
shift me.

778
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,855
Your father was a bitch
and a weak fucker for
working for the Government.

You have no mother.

I have no mother
and no father.

...which I have
always followed.

Now I live in the zone

get hold of Stepan.

If he's not at home,
he's usually at his sister's

01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,225
but she hasn't heard
from him at all.

797
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,728
He did spit in
that awful man's face.

798
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:07,836
I don't think
the driver would do
anything to Stepan.

You haven't spoken
to him since, have you?

801
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,099
You're late.
I know.

802
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:36,966
I'm cold.

803
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,774
Let's go in.

804
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:55,021
Semyon recommends these places
for business meetings

805
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:00,584
because you can see
what tattoos a man has.

806
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:06,894
Come on.
We have a lot to cover.

807
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,304
Let's cook.

808
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:21,377
What you were saying
about Kabul?
Yes.

809
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:28,556
Our lines to Kabul are broken
every two or three weeks.

810
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,358
Why?
Why?

811
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:38,227
The Americans.
Fucking NATO.

812
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,372
Valery Nabokov

813
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:56,213
imports flowers
and television sets
into this country.

814
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:01,422
The television sets are
one in ten.

815
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,458
That means

816
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:09,463
one in ten have cargo
inside them.

817
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,128
Where do they unload them?

818
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,830
(LAUGHING)

819
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:23,802
I will tell you
when I return
from the bathroom.

820
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,541
Okay?
Okay.

821
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,707
Yeah.

822
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,680
I will be back.

823
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,814
Soon.

824
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,518
"Where do they unload them?"

825
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,847
Kirill is in there...

826
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,748
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
...there, there.

827
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:12,854
You will see the stars
there on his chest.

828
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:19,557
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Well done.

829
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,021
Are you okay?

830
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:21,990
Finish him off.

831
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,011
Enough.

832
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,131
My uncle,

833
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,501
the one who spat in your face,
he's disappeared.

834
01:21:56,711 --> 01:22:00,670
If we don't hear
from him soon,
we're going to the police.

835
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,717
Do you know where he is?

836
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,979
Yes. Scotland.

837
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,923
Edinburgh.

838
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,726
Five-star hotel.

839
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:21,196
Edinburgh?
Your uncle knew too much.

840
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,866
I was told
to send him to heaven
with bullet in his head.

841
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:32,938
Instead I sent him
to Edinburgh

842
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,107
with first-class ticket.

843
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,183
He's okay.

844
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:44,518
He's old school,
he understands situation.

845
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,320
Exile or death.

846
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:57,894
His hotel is called Caledonia.

847
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,468
Hello.
Hi.

848
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,981
Nikolai Luzhin, please.

849
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:12,543
For that patient, I will need
your security clearance
information, please.

850
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,196
You got my message.

851
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:33,598
Using a dead body
to file a progress report
is original.

852
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,508
It must be against
FSB regulations.

853
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,978
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
You didn't come here
to give me flowers...

854
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,238
No.

855
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,984
In view of what's
happened to you

856
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:48,785
and in the light of
other violent incidents
associated with you,

857
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,449
the Russian desk
at Scotland Yard

858
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,085
have made an official request
to the Russian embassy

859
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:56,619
that your undercover operation
in London be terminated.

860
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,331
You have gone beyond
what was agreed.

861
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:08,442
If they terminate
operation now
they will be wasting these.

862
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:15,512
So you tell the Russian desk
you have seen stars
over my heart.

863
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,882
Tell them
I'm through the door.

864
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,793
Tell them I'm going to
replace Semyon

865
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,700
as boss of
London organization.

866
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:38,036
What drugs are
they giving you?

867
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,597
I need you
to take Semyon
out of the picture.

868
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,269
I want you to arrest him.

869
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,107
Arrest him for what?

870
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:46,805
Rape.

871
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,714
The girl was 14.

872
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:56,416
And, of course,
she will testify?
She is dead.

873
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,516
But she had Semyon's baby.

874
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,724
If you can prove baby was his
and girl was underage,

875
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,561
that is statutory rape.

876
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,500
You have baby,
you need Semyon's DNA.

877
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:11,565
For poetic reasons

878
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,102
I suggest you take his blood.

879
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:29,617
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
What are you looking at, baby?

880
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,323
You.

881
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:38,029
What were you and Grandpa
shouting about last night?

882
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,536
Nothing, baby. Nothing.

883
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,631
Sounded like something.

884
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:54,376
It's just that
someone I know got hurt

885
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,341
so I blamed it on Grandpa.

886
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,354
Did you fight each other?
I heard banging.

887
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,516
No.

888
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:10,423
It's not a fight
if one of you
doesn't fight back, right?

889
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,420
Maria, go upstairs.

890
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,891
Go upstairs, I said.

891
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,933
So, Papa, what did
they want from you?

892
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,411
To poison me.

893
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,309
They took blood from me
with a needle.

894
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,679
Probably the same needle
they use for the junkies

895
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,154
and whores and blacks
and queers.

896
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,160
Now I probably have
the fucking queer disease.

897
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,428
Why would they want
your blood, Papa?
