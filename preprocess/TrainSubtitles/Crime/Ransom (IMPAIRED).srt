Well, it wouldn't be fair, Sean.
Your mother's a judge here.

And how would that look if you won?

157
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,745
Why don't I enter
under a different name?

158

- SEAN: No. Like Professor X.

159
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,419
Well, I don't think you'd get
away with that, Professor X.

160
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,004
I mean,
you're too young to have a degree.

161

You got to be bald,

- No, no. He's being smart, okay?

302
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,142
Keeping it nice and simple for you.

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,479
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you
won't have a problem coughing it up.

304
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,482
Maybe that's all he needs.

305
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,902
Can I... Can I just...

306
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,991
Look, the reason you're here
and not the police

307
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,744
is that we, my wife and I, we believe

308
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,036
that this might be somehow connected

309
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,331
- with the machinists' union indictments.
- Okay.

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,001
So Jackie Brown.

311
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,087
The man was caught on tape
taking a pay-off

312
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,466
during contract negotiations
with another airline, Infinite Air.

313
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,051
It was a sting, okay?
So there he is, dead in the water.

314
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,387
He says to your people,
"Can we do something here?"

315
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,348
And so he offers me up.

316
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,976
Yeah, he said Tom gave him
a quarter of a million dollars

317
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,686
for a sweetheart deal with the union.

318
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,481
Now, I have been
investigated exhaustively.

319
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,901
Me, my company, my family. My family.

and nothing. All right? Nothing.

322
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,991
Now Jackie Brown's in jail
where he belongs, and he's pissed,

323
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,160
and I think he's got some
pretty unsavory associates out there.

324
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,579
Mr. Mullen, obviously we're very aware
of the Jackie Brown situation...

325
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,498
- And?
- We're still working on it.

326
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,500
Jesus Christ, I think you should
pay a little more attention.

327
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,460
We're paying... No.
Can I make a suggestion, Mr. Mullen?

328
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,920
- What? What?
- Now, we are going to

329
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,131
get into all of this in time,
but for now, just hang loose.

330
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,966
Just sit tight so we can get a plan...

331

Hang loose? Hang loose?
Sit tight? Which one?

I'd be the same way. Believe me.

this kind of thing is kind of rare.

347
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,687
Well, out of the 10,
how many did you get back?

348
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,605
Got back seven.

No union, no government,

00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,212
I initiated the bribe.
I had a business to run.

424
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,631
I had 2,000 employees,
God knows how many customers

425
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,050
and I didn't have time
for a goddamn machinists' strike.

what I proposed and, and carried out,

00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,311
he's in jail and I'm not.

Did Jackie Brown take my son?

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,069
Do you wanna go ask him?

430

431
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,820
- Where's my son?
- What?

432
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,072
Do you think that ending up
in this place

433
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,033
is the worst thing
that can happen to you?

- Where is my son?

I got no job.

442
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,688

443
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,942

are accusing me?

We know that.

848

about who he was teamed up with.
Now, let me show you something.

The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes,
has been in jail twice for burglary.

Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

- Do you?
- No.

854
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:41,444
Okay. Now, this is Clark Barnes,
brother to the subject.

855
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,114
Now, we went back and we found him
in your son's video of the park.

856
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:48,117
This guy is the brains in the family

857
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,162
and we also know he's a lot higher up
the criminal food chain.

858
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,455
According to the NYPD,

859
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,041
this guy Clark, his brother Cubby,
they're supposed to be inseparable.

860
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,543
Now, I guarantee you, we are gonna
do our homework on this

861
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,629
and we will come up
with another player.

- Goddamn.
- Donna.

876
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,580
We have no officiaI report yet

Hey, hey, put the phone down.

What's the matter, Jimmy?
You don't want my mother to know

888

'cause you fucked up?

You want me to calm down, huh?
You want me to fucking calm down?

897

You realize they're looking for me
right now, Jimmy? I'm fingered!

898
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,558
I can't go back to my life! What do you
want me to do? You tell me!

899

That's it. That's it. Fuck the money.

- Good.

1064
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,981
- Bob, can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

1065
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,486
David.

1066
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:40,073
- MAN: All right, here we go.
- Okay, they're ready.

1067
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:54,463
MAN: Pull out of it.
All right, everyone. Look alive.

1068
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,592
Mr. Mullen, we're gonna get you
set up right over here.

1069
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,302
We'll get you wired up with a mic.

1070
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:04,515
I will signal to you
from next to the camera.

1071
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:10,270
Ready to go? On five, four, three, two...

1072
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,273
NEWSCASTER: Good afternoon.
We are interrupting this program

1073
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,776
to bring you an exclusive report.

1074
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,529
As you know, we've been foIIowing
the MuIIen kidnapping

1075
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,988
for about a day or so.

1076
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,573
We wiII get back
to our reguIar program,

1077
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,408
but right now we're going to
show you something

1078
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,577
that you wiII onIy see right here.

1079
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,080
Tom MuIIen, Sean MuIIen's father.

1080
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,414
Mr. Mullen?

1081
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,755
Tom, you're on.

1082
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,844
The whole world now knows

1083
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:46,431
my son, Sean Mullen, was kidnapped
for ransom three days ago.

1084
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,226
This is a recent photograph of him.

1085
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,104
Sean, if you're watching, we love you.

1086
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,274
And this...

1087
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,110
Well, this is what waits
for the man that took him.

1088
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,529
This is your ransom.

1089
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,614
MAN: Wait. I want to see this.

1090
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,701
Two million dollars
in unmarked bills, just like you wanted.

1091
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,745
But this is as close
as you'll ever get to it.

1092
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,957
You'll never see one dollar
of this money

1093
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,961
because no ransom will ever
be paid for my son.

1094
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,298
Not one dime. Not one penny.

1095
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:23,927
Instead, I'm offering this money
as a reward on your head.

1096
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,306
Dead or alive. It doesn't matter.

1097
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:32,227
So congratulations. You've just
become a $2 million lottery ticket.

1098
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,479
Except the odds
are much, much better.

1099
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,567
Do you know anyone that wouIdn't
turn you in for $2 million?

1100
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,778
I don't think you do. I doubt it.

1101
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,406
So wherever you go
and whatever you do,

1102
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,450
this money wiII be
tracking you down for aII time.

1103
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:50,162
And to ensure that it does,
to keep interest aIive,

1104
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,997
I'm running a fuII-page ad

1105
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,917


1106
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,002
for as long as it takes.

1107
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:01,340
But, and this is your last chance,

1108
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:05,177
if you return my son alive, uninjured,

1109
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,095
I'II withdraw the bounty.

1110
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,681
With any Iuck,
you can simpIy disappear.

1111
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:16,521
Understand you wiII never see
this money. Not one doIIar.

1112
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,275
So you still have a chance
to do the right thing.

1113
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,364
lf you don't, well, then God be with you

1114
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,115
because nobody eIse
on this Earth will be.

1115
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,117
MAN: Well, he's got nerve.

1116
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,373
That's it.

1117
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,919
NEWSCASTER: WeII, there you have
it, Rosanna. A shocking turn of events.

1118
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,922
The ransom has turned
into a $2-million bounty.

1119
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,299
ROSANNA: Tony, it's obviousIy
a very dangerous situation.

1120
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:47,052
Anything could happen. Of course,
we wish him the best of luck.

1121
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:51,890
Did you notice he described the
kidnapper as a $2 million lottery ticket?

1122
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,893
- The stakes are high on this one.
- Yeah, as you mentioned also...

1123
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,400
Could you turn it off?
Could you turn it off?

1124
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,567
ROSANNA: Mr. MuIIen
aIso appeaIed to his son.

1125
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,903
He said, "Sean, if you're
out there Iistening, I Iove you."

1126
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,864
- It was very heartbreaking.
- AIso, our producer is teIIing me...

1127
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:09,157
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

1128
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,244
- Yeah.
- MAN 1: Mullen, you're a fool!

1129
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,746
MAN 2: Stupid ass!

1130
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,876
WOMAN: I'm proud of you!

1131
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,007
NEWSCASTER: A pair ofarmed
bandits heId them up Iast night.

1132
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,592
PoIice say a
pair of gun-toting crooks went

1133
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,261
into the Korean church
at Murray Street

1134
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,680
in FIushing Iast night
and announced a robbery.

1135
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,391
- They took waIIets, handbags...
- Hey, where'd they take the kid?

1136
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,893
You know. The place we said.

1137
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,567
I had to do this.

1138
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,569
KATHERINE: You had to do this?

1139
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,240
You had to do this?

1140
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,869
Kate, please.

1141
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:59,374
I'm so scared, but I know if
I give him the money, he'll kill Sean.

1142
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,960
- I would if I was him.
- What did you just say?

1143
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,462
Just look at it from his point of view.

1144
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,923
TOM: You think you're smart.
You've got everybody off baIance.

1145
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,634
- You think you got it aII figured out.
- SHAKER: You trying to screw me?

1146
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,636
And then suddenIy, out of Ieft fieId,

1147
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,638
the one thing you thought
wouId never happen does.

1148
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,640
- We gotta end this...
- What are you doing?

1149
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,477
No ransom, no money, no profit.
Nothing. Nothing but downside.

1150
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,312
Because you've got this boy's father...

1151
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,482
He's coming on like a stark,
raving mad lunatic.

1152
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,569
- You turned her around, didn't you?
- l mean, the guy can piss $2 million,

1153
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,820
- but he's wiIIing to risk everything...
- Don't!

1154
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,072
...just to fuck you up.

1155
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,991
How can you negotiate with
a lunatic like that, huh? You can't.

1156
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,161
- Now you're off baIance.
- Get down. Lay down!

1157
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,498
You wanna stay down there forever,
maggot? Did I get my money?

1158
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:40,999
Pretty soon you realize if you don't

1159
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:43,085
return this kid in mint condition
as soon as possible,

1160
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,504
you're gonna be the most hunted man
on the face of the Earth.

1161
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:50,175
And this maniac will never,
ever quit until he's got you.

1162
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,469
Nobody pulls out on me.

1163
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,013
You know me.

1164
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,975
This is my show. I say when it's over.

1165
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,435
- Take it back.
- No.

1166
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,603
Tell him that you were wrong.

1167
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,854
- Kate, no, I can't.
- Take it back.

1168
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,106
No, Kate, there is no other way. None.

1169
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,607
He's my son too,
and I want you to pay him.

1170
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,192
Kate. They will kill him.

1171
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,778
Please, all we have is each other.

1172
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,865
Do you think any of them...
Do you think they give... It's just us.

1173
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,868
Do you think I don't
want him back? Is that it?

1174
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,120
You think I wouldn't do absolutely

1175
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:19,621
everything in my power
to get him back?

1176
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:23,041
I'd cut my arm off.
I'd... I want him back so bad.

1177
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,838
Katie, please. I don't think
I can take this if you're not with me.

1178
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,438
Don't quit on me.

1179
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,786
Tom. Now...

1180
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,084
I think what you did was wrong.

1181
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,087
You put your son at greater risk.

1182
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:12,841
Now, I need you
to withdraw that reward.

1183
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,885
Just pay this bastard.

1184
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,930
Now, I believe that
you will get your son back.

1185
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:23,768
And when we do,
we will nail this son of a bitch.

1186
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,106
Now, God forbid you don't...

1187
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,150
Your son...

1188
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,070
I swear to you
I will work on nothing else.

1189
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,448
If I have to, I will take
a leave of absence from the FBI

1190
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,326
and you can hire me as
your personal security consultant.

1191
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,621
And I will work on this
as long as I am physically able.

1192
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,372
- Lonnie, please. I...
- Tom.

1193
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,125
I never told anybody, any of my people

1194
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:51,838
about you and Jackie Brown, the real
truth of it, and maybe I never will.

1195
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,010
You think I'm worried
about going to jail?

1196
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,727
Mayor Barresi today voiced his
disapprovaI of Tom MuIIen's decision.

1197
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,729
Donna Hanoverjoins us
later in the broadcast.

1198
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,814
- You care for an update?
- Oh, yeah.

1199
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,985
Well, in the last two hours
since your husband's TV thing,

1200
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,071
we've had 4,000 calls.

1201
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,823
And you know how many real,
good, solid leads?

1202
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,492
How many?

1203
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,828
Zero. And every time one of these

1204
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:27,207
greedy little whack jobs calls,

1205
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:31,378
that is one less agent
looking for your child.

1206
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,880
Now, I gotta tell you, Kate.

1207
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:39,135
I have never been confronted with such
an unbelievable act of sabotage

1208
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,304
by a parent toward
the recovery of their child,

1209
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,682
as what your husband
pulled off here today.

1210
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:46,268
It is all on you now

01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

1514
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,689
Hey. I'll call you back, David.
Call you back.

1515
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,650
Mr. Mullen.
The doorman just called up.

1516
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,277
- FATIMA: Mr. Shaker wants to see you.
- Yeah, yeah,

1517
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:11,653
I'm sorry to show up like this.

1518
01:39:11,738 --> 01:39:13,864
Oh, hell, no. Come in.
I wanna talk to you.

1519
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,324
- Thanks.
- Come in. Come in.

1520
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,867
How's the shoulder?

1521
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,202
You know. I'll live.

1522
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,913
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
to see you up and about so quick.

1523
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:24,499
- Fatima, this is Jimmy Shaker.
- Hi.

1524
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:26,335
I'm very proud to meet you.

1525
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,087
- Very proud.
- Thanks.

1526
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,384
How's the kid doing?

1527
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:37,262
Oh, he's fine, you know,
all things considered.

1528
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:39,723
- It'll take a while.
- Yeah.

1529
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:45,228
Forgive me. I thought
we were gonna meet on Monday.

1530
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,647
Maybe I screwed up. I don't... I...

1531
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:50,233
Yeah, you're right.
Monday. We... That's what we said...

1532
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:53,487
DISPATCHER: (ON RADIO)
See the special officer holding 4-5-9...

1533
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,280
(SWITCHES RADIO OFF)

1534
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,785
Look, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me here,

1535
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:03,163
but I was hoping
we could do this today.

1536
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,791
- You know, the reward and all?
- Oh. Of course.

1537
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,292
- Oh, Jesus.
- 'Cause I gotta tell you,

1538
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:10,837
it's kind of crazy around me, you know,
with the press and everything.

1539
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:13,465
Oh, I understand. Yeah.
Look, they're maniacs.

1540
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,842
- Yeah.
- Nothing easier. Follow me.

1541
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:20,097
I'm not used to this, you know.
I just gotta get out of here.

1542
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,434
Kind of a private person, you know.

1543
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,855
To tell you the truth,
I never killed anybody before.

1544
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:32,609
Having a hard time with it.

1545
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,655
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

1546
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,950
I'm glad you did what you did.

1547
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,577
But I'm sorry.

1548
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,832
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

1549
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,669
So, is it... Is it Jimmy? James?

1550
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:53,296
James.

1551
01:40:57,427 --> 01:40:58,885
James'll do.

1552
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:18,530
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

1553
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,909
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

1554
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,957
Well, because I was dealing
with human garbage.

1555
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,793
No contract would have been
honored, not by them.

1556
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,755
You know, the funny thing is,
I would have paid 10 times as much

1557
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,799
if I had any sense that
they'd stick to the deal, but no.

1558
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,051
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. Really.

1559
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,137
(CHUCKLES)

1560
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,557
The thing that really kills me
about that is the woman.

1561
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,851
She'd been in this house five, six times
over the last year.

1562
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,645
Nice. Pleasant. You know.
You just can't...

1563
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:54,065
I don't know how people
can walk around with that...

1564
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,943
That cold-blooded, two-faced...

1565
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,279
That bitch.

1566
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:02,157
Well, you know, in fairness to the dead,

1567
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,702
we're all a little two-faced
in this day and age.

1568
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:12,793
It's a survival mechanism.
You know what I'm saying?

1569
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:22,093
I mean, you know, as a cop,

1570
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:25,305
you should hear some of the stuff that's
been thrown my way over the years.

1571
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,265
KATHERINE: Tom, just forget
about the gloves, honey.

1572
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:28,642
He wanted to come home.

1573
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,101
- Kate...
- Hi, Tom.

1574
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:33,271
- Mr. Shaker's here.
- Mr. Shaker.

1575
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:49,371
God bless you. Thank you.

1576
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,708
- You're welcome.
- Listen, you gotta meet Sean.

1577
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:55,377
I'll go get him.

1578
01:42:55,586 --> 01:43:00,632
No, he's, you know, had enough.
Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

1579
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:06,137
Yeah, yeah. He's had enough.

1580
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:09,391
Okay. Can I get you anything?

1581
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:12,018
SHAKER: No, I'm fine.

1582
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:13,520
KATHERINE:
Again, I can't even begin to...

1583
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,939
SHAKER: I understand. Don't mention it.

1584
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,276
Okay.

1585
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,532
KATHERINE: Fatima, would you please
help me with some things downstairs?

1586
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,450
I'll be right there.

1587
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:38,044
Well, this is one hell of a deposit
you've got here.

1588
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,630
Shouldn't be a problem.

1589
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:53,643
Well, you'll probably
wanna be on your way.

1590
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,897
Unless there's anything else
I can do for you.

1591
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,153
Good. Right.

1592
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:07,157
Well, I know how these vultures
out there can drive you nuts, so...

1593
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:08,617
You know, there's a back door out

1594
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:09,910
if you, you know,
wanna be a little more...

1595
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,329
This check is bullshit, Tom.

1596
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:16,124
What'd you think,
I'm just gonna waltz out of here,

1597
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,960
you lying motherfucker? Huh?

1598
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:20,253
Let you make a phone call,

1599
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:24,257
have half the cops in New York
waiting for me while I cash this thing?

1600
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:26,301
- You can't lie to me.
- Look...

1601
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:28,053
Shut your mouth.

1602
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:31,723
Fuck!

1603
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:47,238
You know who I am. Now you sit down.

1604
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,534
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

1605
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,246
But you had to go and put it together,

1606
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:58,500
and now we got
a little problem here, don't we?

1607
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,922
Tell me that part again about
why you didn't pay the ransom.

1608
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:05,840
- I think we can do something here...
- Say it!

1609
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:08,093
You were dealing with what?

1610
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,388
You had my son.

1611
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:14,224
You have no idea
what human garbage is, motherfucker.

1612
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:18,269
Do you know what the fuck you're
talking about? No, I don't think you do.

1613
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:20,730
'Cause look
where you fucking live, man.

1614
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:22,649
Look at the airline man here.

1615
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:26,569
This fucker won't pay one cent
to save his only kid.

1616
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,196
It wasn't gonna get him back, was it?

1617
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,323
Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

1618
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,866
Did you see the TV?

1619
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:35,328
I took a bullet.
I risked my life to save your kid.

1620
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:39,165
I took a bullet, and now you're gonna
try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

1621
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,001
- What's over here?
- Where are you going?

1622
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,252
Where's Mommy and Junior?

1623
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:44,963
- Now I'll pay. Now.
- Oh, yeah.

1624
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:48,133
You're gonna pay, all right. Right now.

1625
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,427
Do you have an account
I can wire the money to?

1626
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,303
I mean, you got to have been
all set up for this, right?

1627
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:56,641
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me,
we go right now to my bank,

1628
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,019
and we wire the money
from my account to yours.

1629
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,104
Just the push of a button. Just like that.

1630
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,649
We'll just go down to the bank
and get it done.

1631
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,737
Pick up the phone. Wire it from here.

1632
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,951
No, we'll go to the bank and do it.

1633
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:20,582
And you'll get the money and all I want
in return is you out of this house now.

1634
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:26,296
Hey. You do not call the shots.

1635
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:29,174
Well, then, you just go ahead
and kill me right here and now,

1636
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:31,259
you son of a bitch.

1637
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,888
You fuck! Fuck you!
I'm not picking up that phone.

1638
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:37,015
You got that? I'm not picking it up.

1639
01:46:38,559 --> 01:46:42,145
Look, you can kill me.
Go ahead. Kill me. Just kill us.

1640
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,731
Let us live. Doesn't matter.
Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

1641
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,191
Now, you can come with me
to the bank

1642
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:48,193
and be on the run with $4 million,

1643
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:49,944
or you can just start shooting

1644
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,030
and be on the run
with whatever you got in your wallet.

1645
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,740
It's up to you.

1646
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:57,911
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go to the bank.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1647
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:02,499
I got what I want.
Bottom line, I got my son back.

1648
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,876
And you delivered him.

1649
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:08,963
I got my own plane. I can fly you out
of here myself anywhere you wanna go.

1650
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:14,260
You can still win this thing.
Think. You can still win.

1651
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:35,156
We do what you say.
We go to the bank.

1652
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:40,203
If anything goes wrong, you're
gonna turn around and I'll be gone.

1653
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,872
Okay? And if that happens,

1654
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:45,125
from this day on,

1655
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:48,753
any time your kid leaves
this house to go to school,

1656
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:51,256
go play, see a friend,

1657
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:56,678
to buy a fucking comic book,
you're gonna have to ask yourself,

1658
01:47:57,847 --> 01:48:02,225
is today Jimmy Shaker day?

1659
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:04,936
I got to him once.

1660
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:07,939
I'll get him again.

1661
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,316
