Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.

336
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,647
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.

337
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,091
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.

338
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,096
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

that this is your son.

That is not Walter.

It's not Walter
as you remember him.

342
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:19,105
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.

343

A trial basis?

Yes, yes.

345
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:26,809
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,

346
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:30,821
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

347
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,653
you will see that
this is your Walter.

to you, I give you my word.

at all, you come and you talk to me.

No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,

but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.

He's three inches shorter.

You've both been through
a terrible experience,

of all his travails.

477
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:41,315
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.

478
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:43,948
I thought you were
here to help me.

479
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,512
Well, I am.

480
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,026
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes

481
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,618
and asked me
to drop in on him

482
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,289
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.

483
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,759
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.

484
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,999
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

485
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,474
now will they?

486
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,475
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

487
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,406
Yes.

488
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,848
Come.

489
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,318

CHRISTINE: He's
three inches shorter.

491
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,258
Ah, well...

492
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,860
(STAMMERING)
Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.

493
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:34,235
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

494
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,467
Given the stress
of the past five months,

495
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,001
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

496
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,046
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

497
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,081
And circumcision?

498
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,350
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

499
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,189
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

500
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,565
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.

501
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,595
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

502
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,062
I...

503
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,473
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

504
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,909
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

505
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:19,007
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

506
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,143
during his absence.

507
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,484
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?

508
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,947
I'm the mother.

509
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,983
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

510
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,958
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy

511
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,631
who has changed
from what you remember.

512
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,727
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

513
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,931
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns

514
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,838
is not the same anymore.

515
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:48,572
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,

516
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,081
sees these changes
and rebels,

517
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:54,115
insists that
this isn't your son.

518
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,516
Doesn't change the facts.

519
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:05,592

test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

647
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:11,346
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

649
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,655
He had two cavities
that needed filling.

00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,388
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

And?

652
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:29,460
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.

653
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:32,025
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

654
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,537
The boy in that room
has no such gap.

655

Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.

In some cases,
yes, it's possible.

657
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,741
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.

658
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,180
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

659
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:48,946
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.

that officially in writing?

MAN: Good morning.

689
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:49,664
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

690
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,469
And a five-month investigation

691
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,501
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

692
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,947
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

693
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,882
He was not my son.

694
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,887
The LAPD made a mistake,

695
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,652
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

he is not my son.

Since they have
refused to do so,

702
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,676
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

703
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:31,442
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

704
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,177

And now he's an

And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

says he's your son.

747
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,243
Why would he say that?

748
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,975
How would he know
to do that?

749
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:47,017
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

Because either
you know you're lying,

757

or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

I heard them talking.

943
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,592
You're here on code 12?

944
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,330
Police action.

945
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:48,928
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure

946
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,336
that if the police
brought you here,

947
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,432
there must be
a good reason for it.

948
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:54,909
There isn't a good
reason for it.

949
00:58:55,412 --> 00:58:58,677
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.

950
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:00,440
How?

951
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:05,316
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

952
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:09,222
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

953
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,056
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

954
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:16,690
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.

955
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,201
You've given this
a lot of thought.

956
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:24,934
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

957
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:28,175
You're a code 12,
so am I.

958
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,440
We're here for the
exact same reasons.

959
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:32,640
We both pissed
off the cops.

960
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:36,652
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?

961
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,154
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

962
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:42,248
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.

963
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:43,587
WOMAN: I want more juice.

964
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,854
And that one?

965
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:46,259
NURSE 3: Put your tray
back where it belongs.

966
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:50,561
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.

967
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:53,068
When she tried to
tell the papers...

968
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,867
And you?

969
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,066
I work nights.

970
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,101
WOMAN: Sure.

971
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,313
I mean, I work nights.

972
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,177
Oh.

973
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,413
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

974
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:12,546
I'm sorry.

975
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:16,422
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

976
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,552
so I filed a complaint.

977
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:21,096
And it turns out
he was a cop.

978
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,291
Next thing I know,
I'm here.

979
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,059
But they can't do that.

980
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:27,194
Are you kidding?

981
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,794
NURSE 3: All right, one
more and then that's it.

982
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,340
Everybody knows
women are fragile.

983

there's nothing going on upstairs.

986
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:40,707

If we're insane, nobody

990
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,352
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,

991
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,760
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,

992
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,593
or a police officer?

993
01:00:57,334 --> 01:01:00,360
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,

994
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,098
or we don't go home.

Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

1009
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,270
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border

I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.

I'm sure he has far
more important things...

be quite difficult at first.

Yes, it was.

1023
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:06,092
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

The Wassermman Test.

1028
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:27,009
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.

1029
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:30,917
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,

1030
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:32,852
does that upset you?

1031
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,254
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.

1032
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,725
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

According to your file you
believe that the police substituted

01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,421
a fake boy for your son.

No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.

1043

He's not my boy.

1044

They brought home
the wrong boy.

My son is still missing.

1046

Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article

with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.

you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

time for this, okay?

Listen to me!
He said...

1103
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,982
What?

1104
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,783
What did he say?

1105
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:30,155
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.

1106
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:33,252
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

All right.

Let's start at
the beginning then.

(SOBS)

1112
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,649
We killed some kids.

What?

1114
01:07:57,053 --> 01:08:00,648
Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.
He made me help him.

1115
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,317
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1116
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:06,089
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.

1117
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:09,154
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

1118
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,597
Look.

1119
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,499
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?

1120
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:16,094
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1121
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:17,662
Names?

1122
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,764
How many?

1123
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,331
How many kids?

1124
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,775
All together?

1125
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:28,047
About 20, I guess.

1126
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:30,818
No, you're lying.

1127
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:33,253
No! It's true, I swear!

1128
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,983
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

1129
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:38,515
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1130
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:43,263
I stopped counting
after a while.

1131

Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.

But...

1133
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:56,702
No.

1134
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:59,612
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

1135
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:00,876
We did.

1136
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,480
We did.

1137
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,448
How?

1138
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,926
Most times we'd just
have one or two.

Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.

they didn't have time to come find you,
