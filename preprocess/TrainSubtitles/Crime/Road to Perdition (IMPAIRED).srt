about Michael Sullivan.

3
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,940
Some say he was a decent man.

4

Some say there was no good
in him at all.

on the road with him...

...when they find out we're gone,
they're gonna come after us.

Please, Pa.

326
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,340
All right, here, take this.

327
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,820
- No. I don't want it.
- Take it.

328

- I don't want it.
- Boy, take it! You got six shots.

Do not go to Father Callaway.

I don't have any business with you,
Mr. Kelly.

332

But I have business with you, Mike.

333
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,450
Go ahead.

334
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,130
What is that?

335
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,060
25,000 dollars. Mr. Rooney wants you
to know there's more if you need it.

336
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,170
You have friends in Ireland, Mike.
Why don't you take Peter and leave?

337
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,020
I can't take Peter.

338
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,500
He's dead.

339
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,620
- So where's Connor?
- He's in hiding.

340
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,900
- Where?
- You know I can't tell you that.

341
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,420
You think sticking a gun to my head
is gonna make any difference to me?

342
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,220
If I tell you, I'm a dead man anyway.
We both are.

343

Think, Mike. Don't be stupid.
I'm just the messenger.

344
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,580
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.

Where are we going?

To Chicago.

349
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,890
There's a man there who runs things.

350
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,940
I've done some work for him.

351
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,340
We have to find out where he stands.

353

I want you to wait for me here.

354
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,530
- Sure.
- I won't be long. You'll be all right?

00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,490
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

- Hello, fellas.

It's nice to see you. We heard what
happened. How you holding up?

358
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,090
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.

359
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,660
- He's awful busy.
- I can wait.

- Yes, thank you.

370
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,460
So, what can I do for you, Mike?

371
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,820
I'd like to work for you.

372
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,890
Well, that's very interesting.

373
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,650
And in return, I'd like you to turn a
blind eye to what I have to do.

And what is that?

375
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,810
Kill the man who murdered my family.

376
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,940
Is one more body
gonna make a difference?

377
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,900
This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.

378
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,730
I will work only for you,
and you know I can do a good job.

379
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,220
I respect you, Mike. I do.

380

We would like nothing more than to have
you come work for us. But not like this.

381

What you're asking me is impossible.

382

Is it?

383
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,500
Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven't realized.

384
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,220
All these years, you've been living
under the protection...

385
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,530
...of people who care about you.

386

And those same people
are protecting you now, including me.

387
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,820
So if you go ahead with this,
if you open that door...

388
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,050
...you're walking through it alone.

389
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,970
And all that Ioyalty, all that trust,
will no longer exist for you.

390
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,970
And Mike, you won't make it.
Not on your own.

391
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,740
And not with a little boy.

392
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,330
You're protecting him already?

393

We're protecting our interests, Mike.

394

I drove all through the night
to see you.

395
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,580
I appreciate that.
Now I suggest you drive yourself back.

396

Go home and bury your wife and child.

I grew up on a farm.

807
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:02,340
And I guess, in a way, I did.

808
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:07,580
But I lived a lifetime before that...

809
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,460
...in those six weeks on the road...

810
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,340
...in the winter of 1931.

811
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,620
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan
was a good man...

812
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,460
...or if there was just no good
in him at all...

813
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,650
...I always give the same answer.

814
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,410
I just tell them:

815
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,140
"He was my father."
