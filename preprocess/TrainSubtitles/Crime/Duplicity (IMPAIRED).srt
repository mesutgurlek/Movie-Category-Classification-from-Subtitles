151
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,977
I own you.

152
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:49,146
-You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.
-Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

153
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,183
I like this gig.
I like the money. I like the hours.

154
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,557
So I'm not going anywhere,
and you're gonna get over it

155
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,357
because if you ever mention again
that you don't wanna work with me

156
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,991
or that we've met before or that you think
someone else might do a better job,

157
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,763
if I get replaced for any reason at all,

158
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle

159
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,768
and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

160
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,443
Be a shame to let the last 14 months
go down the drain, wouldn't it?

161
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,887
So where's my package?

162
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,359
Tell Duke this is the one
he's been waiting for.

163
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,959
-You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
-I thought you tried that already.

164
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,967
RAY: You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

165
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,652
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

167
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,761
She said, "Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for."

168
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,635
-PAM: Do you wanna do it?
-Go ahead.

169
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,810
DUKE: Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

170
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,771
-Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
-Duke.

171
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,609
All right, go ahead.

172
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,312
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

173
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,982
-For Christ's sake, Duke, keep your shirt on.
-Just...

174
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,322
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

175
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,322
Wow. Look at this.

176
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,163
So is this the big one?

177
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,967
-I gotta call Garsik right away.
-PAM: Yeah.

178
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,673
DUKE: Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

179
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,995
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

NED: Who are they?

182
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,883
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

185
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,157
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

186
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,030
-Unexpected?
-Very.

187

Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house,

188

-and the wife has a heart condition.
-All right.

189
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,073
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

Why does this guy look familiar?

193
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,887
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

194
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,384
-ls this the guy who bought the boat?
-Same guy.

195
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,693
-All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
-I sent them this morning.

We're in a meeting.

198
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,430
Now? Everyone?

199
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,541
Well, did they say why?

200
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,613
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

201
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,948
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

a very busy schedule today,

marketing presentation at 3:00.

-Cancel.
-They're in the building.

206
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,022
Make it tomorrow.

The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

You've got a premium diaper teleconference

-at 4:15.
-Tape it.

The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

-They wanted 15 minutes at around...
-Cancel!

213
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,047
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

214

RlCHARD: All right, let's have a look at me.

215
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
There should be another vehicle.

216
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,632
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

230

Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

for all the money that I'm spending on this,

233
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,233
you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

Why are we here?

237
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,726
We are here today
because the rules have changed,

238
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,902
We're here because the fabric of integrity
has been so abused and mangled

239
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,066
that it is little more
than a threadbare memory,

240
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,276
We're here because it's no longer enough
to have the best ideas,

241
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,250
or the best manufacturing,
or the best pipeline to deliver your product.

This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

247
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,805
I believe the history
of all successful endeavors

248
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,436
can be reduced to a series
of decisive moments,

of just such a moment,

You were chosen by that standard,
You've been paid and treated accordingly,

by announcing its development,,,

at the summit of the global marketplace."

-No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
-We caught a break? You call this a break?

in nine days.

Oh!

Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

that is when he's gonna use it,

because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

No, I would wait till he is right in the middle
of a big old standing ovation.

293

I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration,

300
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,000
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

301
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,003
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

302
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,004
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

303
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,569
I mean, we've spent
the last 10 months probing.

304
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,875
We got nowhere.

305
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,916
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes

306
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,817
are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

307
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:36,087
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

308
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,225
We paid a little visit down to the vendor,

309
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,426
and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

310
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,499
Call this the Ghost.

311
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,505
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here

312
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,564
allows us to hijack signal traffic

313
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,667
without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

314
00:26:54,045 --> 00:27:00,075
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

315
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:05,046
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 12 units already.

316
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,914
PAM: The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester

317
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,553
hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1997.

318
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,123
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

319
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,463
Number one, we graph the volume of traffic

320
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,969
and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

321
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,097
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments

322
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,436
of everybody on site.

323
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,477
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of lnternet shopping

324
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,547
and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

325
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:34,051
Stocks are down, porn is up
and there's plenty of free parking.

326
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,144
There's nothing going on here.

327
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,814
We're confident
that whatever this new product is,

328
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,754
it comes from outside the company.

329
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,224
The moment this meeting breaks up,

330
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:46,093
we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 18 months.

331
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,631
We'll find it.

332
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,099
FETYOV: This B&R building is very strong
with security.

333
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,666
Is the same for us like the computer.

334
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,003
We are all the time feeling our way
around this building,

335
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,099
but not getting anywhere.

336
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,646
Then we make a big discovery.
Travel Department is not in the big building.

337
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:09,186
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

338
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,781
-(CHUCKLES) Very simple and very basic.
-Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

339
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,849
They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel,

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,920
so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

341
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,026
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

342
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,298
Very simple and very basic.

-Excuse me?
-Can I make a suggestion?

would make this a lot less awkward.

Wow. That's a strong play.

361
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,740
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like,

362

with someone else.

Look, I don't know who you think I am, but...

You talk me up, seduce me, screw me,

372

then you drug me and ransack
my hotel room.

And how sick is this? The last thing
I remember before I passed out

Three days? All this?

450
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,859
What was the objective? Rug burn?

451
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,392
Who knows, maybe you didn't want me
in Cairo yesterday.

452
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,666
God, that's so sad.

453
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,605
Because that's exactly
what I was just thinking.

454
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,111
That maybe you're playing me,
that you canceled my call.

455
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,945
That this was just some revenge
to get back at me for Dubai.

456
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,551
Then I'm thinking how terrible it is
that I think that way.

457
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,386
Then I realize we both think that way.

458
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,589
Then I'm thinking,

459
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,222
is that what makes this so worth it?

460
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,091
Is that it?

461
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,438
That I know you're thinking
exactly what I'm thinking?

462
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:35,478
Because then I'm thinking, do we both
think like that because of what we do?

463
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,605
Are we good at what we do
because we think like that?

464
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,048
Everybody thinks like that.
They just don't say it.

465
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,144
-Civilians don't think like that.
-Bullshit.

466
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,988
-Nobody trusts anybody. We just cop to it.
-Okay. So cop to it.

467
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:52,062
-Me? I think you better go first.
-Why? What am I hiding?

468

This wasn't an accident, was it?

469
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,660
Being here. Meeting like this.

470
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,499
You came looking for me, didn't you?

471
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,904
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-I'm right, though, aren't l?

472
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,170
Because you went looking for me, right?

473
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,439
But why? Just for this?

474
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,845
-lsn't that enough?
-Not for you.

475
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,243
What are we into, Claire?

476
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,123
Can you imagine living like this?

477
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,454
-How much fun we could have?
-Aren't we in enough trouble?

478
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,853
I mean, having the money.

479
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,991
-Keep going.
-How much do you think we'd need?

480
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,137
-$20 million?
-I was thinking 40.

481
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,336
So what do you have to do
to get $40 million?

482
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
Go private.

483
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,713
Be smart.

484
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,615
Get lucky.

485
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,120
How smart?

486
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,852
Smart enough to pick the right partner.

487
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,324
-Private, you mean...
-Corporate.

488
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,727
And lucky?

489
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,065
Be someplace when something's happening.

490
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,466
Be there first, hear it first.

491
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,005
-Something inside.
-Something big.

492
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,565
-But do it up right.
-Set it deep. Take your time.

493
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,201
Know your way out before you go in.

494

-You know what I think?
-I think you like the idea.

495
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:25,319
-I think you missed me.
-I think you canceled my call.

The plan is good. It's up to him.

I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

it's too late to get ticketed now,

so I'm gonna have to spend the night
at the airport

just to make sure I can get on the plane.

Last night, Dale ran a timeline,
and we found a day last March

605
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,030
when B&R bought seven companies
in one afternoon.

-No.

607
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,102
So they're hiding something.

00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:24,262
-What are they hiding?
-I think it's Dunwoody, Georgia.

the amount of traffic last summer

00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,940
between New York City
and Dunwoody, Georgia.

at least six separate visits,

about the children, you know.

in the area up there.

Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

-Because a lot of people confuse the two.
-I don't know.

724

Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's have that!
Let's have that! I mean, if...

725
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,941

is Tully's secret weapon,
