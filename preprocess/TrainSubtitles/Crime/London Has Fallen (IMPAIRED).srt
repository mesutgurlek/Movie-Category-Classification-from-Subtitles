National day of mourning in the Philipines,

00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:39,828
Philipine authorities now say the toll in yesterday's
hotel bombing has risen to 146 dead and 231 wounded

7
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:46,128
It is the most devastating terrorist attack in Asia,
in 10 years. And the worst ever, in Manila.

8
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,568
While no organization has taken
responsibility for the blast,

9
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:52,478
Western intelligence sources have identified

10
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:58,448
chemical traces that are the hallmark of
the infamous arms-dealer, Aarmir Barkawi

11
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:06,608
International security experts say that the Barkawi
family is now instigating violence in remote capitals

12
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:13,128
To foster instability, and thus fuel
massive arms sales around the globe.

Did Philippine Intelligence track you?

15
00:02:58,798 --> 00:02:59,848
Father,

16
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,098
- You did well,
- Thank you.

We need to discuss Major General Rahmad.

It's your sister's wedding.

19
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,308
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

20
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:25,338
I think your ISI officer was compromised.

21
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:30,548
Kamran, all Pakistani intelligence
officers are compromised.

22
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:34,818
One of our Afghani friends discovered
a German BND agent in his circle.

23
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:35,568
And?

24
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:45,228
That particular general won't be very
useful to us anymore. He's been eliminated.

25
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,508
Thought you might want to know.

26
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:51,848
Don't forget his family.

27
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:58,098
Vengeance must always be profound,
and absolute.

28
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,208
Very happy.

Everyday the same damn joke.

Seriously?

00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:19,498

- Really?
- Hell, no!!

If it's a girl, maybe.

00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,318
Voight,

41
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:47,358
- Voight, you want to run over him for me?

A little problem in the nursery.

46
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:19,168
Alright, so six cameras, right?

47
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:24,508
One, two, three, four, five, six.

48
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:26,698
- Why is that too much?
- Yeah, maybe.

49
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:28,658
Yeah, it's too much.
and I thought that.

50
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,698
They're baby gifts from the guys.

51
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,678
- I'll take them down.
- All we need ..

52
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:38,798
- Is one baby monitor.
- One baby monitor, right.

53
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:39,818
Okay,

54
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,298
- And a kevlar mattress.

Come here,

56

- Unhand me.
- Never

Guess who just got the next week off.

Oh, don't toy with me, young man,
cause there will be consequences.

- What?
- Yeah.

62
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,528
Oh, I gotta show you this amazing paint.

63

Mr. President,

76
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,918
you need to take this, sir.

Sir, Speaker of the House?

You need to take this now, sir.

This is the President.

British Prime Minister James Wilson

He is believed to have
suffered a heart attack.

85
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:20,008
Possibly, from complications
after the surgical procedure

86
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,008
to repair his knee a day earlier.

87
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,168
An autopsy has been scheduled
within the next 48 hours.

Questions?

105
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:35,128
And what special requests did
the [ ?? ] circus demand so far?

106

Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders,
part of the [ ?? ] possibly?

Any issues or special concern
with our current assessment?

112

We all know about he 350 or
so British nationals who

113
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:01,368
have traveled back and forth
to Syria in the past year,

114
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,128
As we've seen before in Iraq,
and Afghanistan.

115
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,148
Of rising concern is the handful
we believe to be former military.

116
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,218
- Is any of this actionable?
- No.

117
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,408
Very well ..

118
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,498
then we send off our dear friend James,

119
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,128
with dignity.

120
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,078
Give him a ceremony he deserved.

121
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:28,858
Sir,

122
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,858

126
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:47,328
The Brits are world-class.
We all know their reputation.

127
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:48,458
But still,

128
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,198
These are the trips I hate.

00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:53,198
Last minute, out of the country,
no time to plan.

130
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:55,968
Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?

131
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,088
Lynn, it's a state funeral.

Alright.  I spent half the night
on the line with our advance team.

134
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,048
Metropolitan Police will secure the parameter

135
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:08,868
of the funeral around St. Paul's Cathedral.

136
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:11,258
Air Force One will land at
Stansted Airport (London)

137
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,328
On the ground, it's all Mike.

138
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:17,858
Touch down. Then a 12-minute chopper
ride to Somerset House.

139
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,788
From there we take an armoured vehicle escort

140
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:24,078
down Sweet Street .. to the Cathedral

141
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,408
You don't seem thrilled.

142
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,498
The British have their hands full.

143
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,648
It's a cluster-fuck .. sir.

144
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,218
Well,

145
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,148
Forty different countries,
with 40 different security teams.

146

Minimal flexibility on approach routes.
funeral seating, egress.

147
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:46,358
- Can we make it work?
- Mike?

148
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,778
I always do, sir.

149
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,458
Good.

150
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,918
I know it's not great timing for you, but ..

151
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,628
It's what I do.

152
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,298
Thank you sir.

153
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:16,118
- There's my man.
- Mr. Vice-President,

154
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,008
- How was your vacation, sir?
- Son,

155
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:23,058
Do you have any idea, the joy a man feels

156
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:26,848

Prepare Air Force One for departure. Copy.

312
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,938
Copy. Air Force One prepped and ready to go.

313
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:04,748
It was a trap.

314
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:06,958
That's an understatement.

315
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:14,478
Holy shit.  It's one thing to plan
for this. Another to live it.

316
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:15,778
Alright, well, we're good now.

317
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,298
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

318
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:21,408
We'll be on secure ground in 10 minutes, okay?

319
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:26,808
There was no chatter on this. None.

320
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:31,268
Something of this magnitude, it took
years to plan. And we're in a daze.

321
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:33,128
It's a fucken bloodbath.

322
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:38,508
- How did they do this, Mike?
- They only have to get it right once.

323
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,328
Today, they got it right way more than that.

324
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:54,288
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
- Marine Three is down.

325
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,718
Roof-top three O'clock, you see him?

326
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:13,288
[ ?? ]

327
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:18,328
- We're being pinged.
- Stingers.

328
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,058
Deploying flares.

329
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,018
Okay, Stinger gone.

330
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:39,768
Stinger at three O'clock.

331
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:02,728
- Marine One out of flares.
- Marine Two, out of flares.

332
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:06,648
- Marine Two, prepare for sacrificing.
- Copy.

333
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:17,328
Marine Two is down.

334
00:39:18,078 --> 00:39:19,328
It's a lock on.

335
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:24,518
Mr. President we're going to take a hit.
Brace for impact.

336
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:47,128
Our families, remotely from the sky.

337
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:50,178
Your time .. is over.

338
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,388
We're bringing the war, to you.
Make no mistake.

339
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:59,288
This is the day,
when your world changes forever.

340
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:06,408
- Jesus. -- This is all over social media too.
Everybody in the world has seen this.

341
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:09,528
Aamir Bakawi.

342
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,338
Number six on the 10 list.

343
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:14,478
This man is responsible for
more deaths than the Plague.

344
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:17,318
Sells arms to every failed state in the world.

345
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:22,178
Has a vast array of connections,
terrorists, mercenaries, corporations,

346
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:30,158
- Mr. Vice-President, it's Barkawi.
- Put him through.

347
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:39,158
Thought you might take my call.
You understand if I make it difficult to track.

348
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,158
You have me at somewhat of a loss.

349
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:46,088
I thought you would've learned a lesson
by now, about crawling out of your hole.

350
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:51,518
- I've never lifted a finger against you.
- You arm those who have.

351
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:57,318
I sold triggers, Mr. Trumbull.
Just like you.

352
00:40:58,548 --> 00:40:59,528
What do you want?

353
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,078
Your President.

354
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:04,918
You can end this right now.

355
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:10,098
- Just hand him over.
- That's not going to happen.

356
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,298
Then every death from this moment
forward, will be on your head.

357
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:33,348
Barkawi, sells arms to dummy companies.
Some of them probably in London.

358
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:35,358
Find a connection to him.

359
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:40,308
He's probably been planning this for
years. Everybody makes a mistake.

360
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,038
We have to find him before
he finds the President.

361
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:45,748
Let's get to it.

362
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:06,878
- Mike is a bully?
- Yeah.

363
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:10,238
Not exactly standard police issue.

364
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:14,738
Really?

365
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:17,638
Oh, my god.

366
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,198
- I've never seen a man suffocate before.
- I didn't have a knife.

367
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:27,978
Got  more ammunition than
the entire US Army.

368
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,028
How can they pull something like this off.
Gots to be somebody on the inside.

369
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:34,288
Yeah, looks like it.

370
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,028
These aren't you typical hill-trained
hillbillies. These guys are pros.

371
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,378
- We should go for the Embassy.
- They'll be expecting that.

372
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,118
There's a MI-6 safehouse near here.
I have a contact there.

373
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:50,798
We go there, we get geared up, and get an extraction.
- Do you trust them? -- Yeah.

374
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:55,798
The fact is, every single one of these guys
is a terrorist asshole. Until proven otherwise.

375
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:59,608
The only person you trust right now,
is me, okay?

376
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,958
Come on, let's go.

377
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:08,368
- Gotta get underground.
- These guys are everywhere.

378
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:28,228
Let's go.

379
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:38,728
Stay here. I'll be back.

380
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:37,938
Raza ..

381
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:42,968
Raza

382
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,358
Here ..

383
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,168
We can do easy, or the hard way.

384
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,508
Raza. Answer me, brother.

385
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,988
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.
He's a little bit fucked up.

386
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:10,988
Hey, you. What's this dick guy's name?

387
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:18,438
- This is Kamra. Who is this?
- Hey, Cameron. [sic]

388
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:22,478
- My name is Mike Banning.
- You are the one with the President.

389
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:28,318
Bingo. So why don't you boys pack up your shit and head
back to Fuckeninstan or wherever it is you're from.

390
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:35,148
You should've let us kill him quickly.
Because now, we're going to kill him slowly.

391
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:39,558
And stream it live. For the whole world to see.

392
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:42,188
Can you hear me, Mr. President?

393
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,428
- Tell him,
- Yeah, he can hear you.

394
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:48,488
And here's something I want you hear first.

395
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:02,828
That's the sound of your brother dying. Yeah.

396
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:07,438
Not much of a talker, that one.
But I bet one of your men will.

397
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:10,418
I'll see you soon, Cameron [sic]

398
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,538
- Was that really necessary?
- No.

399
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:27,228
The Brits are compromised.

400
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:31,618
The police for sure.
Who do you trust?

401
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,678
We can also assume all communications
are compromised.

402
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:37,938
Anything that isn't secured,
could get into the wrong hands, sir.

403
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:41,288
- And Banning would know that too.
- So how could he even reach out for help?

404
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:45,128
There, freeze that. Sir,

405
00:46:46,908 --> 00:46:49,338
- Is Banning left-handed?
- No, right-handed.

406
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,458
Okay, well, the President doesn't move
without a drone or satellite over his head.

407
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:56,828
- Banning knows that.
- That's his left hand.

408
00:46:57,128 --> 00:47:00,458
- Southpaw .. six.
- Shorthand for MI-6.

409
00:47:01,878 --> 00:47:04,778
Look for any MI-6 location in that are.

410
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:06,968
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, Banning.

411
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:22,088
- You okay?
- Yeah.

412
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:25,228
- [ ?? ] , bad choice.
- Hah,

413
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:28,208
Sit down, take deep breaths.

414
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:36,188
How many you think died?

415
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,458
I don't know .. A lot.

416
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:46,138
All those innocent people.
Dead ... Because of me.

417
00:47:46,308 --> 00:47:48,268
No. Not because of you. Because of them.

418
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,298
They tried to kill you, sir.

419
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:54,958
And they killed all these people, just
to make everyone else more afraid.

420
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:56,878
Well, fuck that.
Fuck them.

421
00:47:57,418 --> 00:48:01,558
Mike ..
You don't let them take me.

422
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:03,728
- I'm not going to.
- You need to do it.

423
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:07,108
If it comes to it.  If it's going south.

424
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:12,138
If it comes to it, I want you to kill me.

425
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,488
That' an order.

426
00:48:18,018 --> 00:48:20,218
I will not be prosecuted for propaganda.

427
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:24,138
As my son and the American people see me on
fucken YouTube for the rest of their lives.

428
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:30,828
.. Okay.

429
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:40,738
- Vice President Trumbull is among us, sir.
- Inspector.

430
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,168
I'm afraid our .. news isn't promising.

431
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:46,358
Our dearly departed Prime Minister
James Wilson was assassinated.

432
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:51,568
Poison in his anesthesia, and his doctor's
body found dumped about an hour ago.

433
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:52,768
State funeral ..

434
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:57,338
Must-attend event for western leaders.
Each one a target.

435
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,388
Goddamn.
And we walked right into it.

436
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:03,248
And all dead. By your men and ours.

437
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:04,688
What's happening on the ground?

438
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:10,578
The terrorists have killed 19 first-
responders. We've another 30 unaccounted for.

439
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:14,888
They're impersonating us. Our people
are walking right into ambushes.

440
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:16,168
Say the word and we go in.

441
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:20,778
But make no mistake.  We risk turning
London into another Fallujah.

442
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:25,128
That's the last thing we need.
The President in the middle of an urban battle.

443
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,888
Or the citizens of London.

444
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:29,768
Or you're just as likely to take out
half the Metropolitan Police Force,

445
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:33,258
Unless you can tell me how you can tell the
difference between the good guys and the bad guys.

446
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,178
- We're have to stand down our Emergency Services.
- Surrender London?

447
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:38,038
He's right.

448
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:44,448
Take out all legitimate personnel.
Anyone that remains .. is a terrorist.

449
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:45,898
Look, the sooner we end this,

450
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:48,818
The more chance there is of stopping
London becoming a complete warzone.

451
00:49:48,878 --> 00:49:50,808
Well, how do we get the
word out to our people?

452
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:53,468
[??] system.

453
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:57,528
We [??] sound that, people know to
stay secure in their place, then ...

454
00:49:58,138 --> 00:49:59,628
You have the military sweep in.

455
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:02,388
door-to-door, if necessary.

456
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,048
Clear these bastards out.

457
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,568
- Good evening.
- Is Auntie M in?

458
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:05,908
Put that away.

459
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:10,608
- Are you who I think you are?
- Unfortunately

460
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:24,838
What a pleasure this is, two handsome men
visiting me on such a lovely evening.

461
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:29,868
- Long time, Jackson. -- Eh, not long enough.
-- Mr. President.

462
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:31,488
Sir,

463
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:36,268
- Jaqueline, MI-6 finest.  Don't fuck with her.
- Hello.

464
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:50,538
The phones are down.  That said,
It did allow us to pick up this..

465
00:51:52,928 --> 00:51:55,658
Mr. President, Banning ..

466
00:51:56,628 --> 00:52:01,568
I hope this finds you well.
Mike, we got your message.

467
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:05,728
And I'm sure you don't know
who you can trust,

468
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:09,018
and all prior authentications
may be compromised.

469
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:11,618
So .. I offer you this,

470
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:19,888
Do you have any idea the joy a man experiences pulling a
70-lb King Mackerel out of the waters around Jekyll Island?

471
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:21,828
That's him.

472
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:29,408
a Delta Team has been clandestinely inserted.
By now they should en route to your position.

473
00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:36,208
They'll take you to the US Embassy, where an armored
convoy stands by to get you out of SAM range.

474
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:38,618
- And on to a military train.
- Thank god.

475
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,298
- Let's get us out of here.
- Alright, sir.  So who's behind all this?

476
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:45,428
Aamir Bakawi.

477
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:54,278
Bakawi provides armaments.
He's a fucken criminal.

478
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:56,658
Shielded by governments.

479
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:02,928
Mike, there was a drone strike, to get him.
Two years ago, authorized by the G8.

480
00:53:03,018 --> 00:53:03,968
So we took a shot.

481
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:06,988
He survived

482
00:53:07,658 --> 00:53:12,378
We didn't know his family was there.
His daughter was killed.

483
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:15,248
Well, he certainly got his revenge.

484
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:20,148
- Civilians?
- Well, they're not being targeted specifically, but ..

485
00:53:20,618 --> 00:53:22,828
- Collateral damage?
- Yeah, quite a lot, I'm afraid.

486
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:27,118
[??] targeting. No official support from
any countries Barkawi shows, but..

487
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:31,828
Didn't have any problems finding the creeps today,
United Nations all with blood on their hands. [??]

488
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:36,988
- Who's on the inside? There's gotta be somebody.
- Yeah, you're right.

489
00:53:37,818 --> 00:53:40,448
They've infiltrated our CCTV system.

490
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,478
And they've copied the Wi-Fi network. [??]

491
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:46,758
- Yeah, but who?
- I don't know.

492
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,738
Mike ..
if you hadn't move our schedule up.

493
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:57,458
- Here you go sir, get this in you.
- Thanks.

494
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:00,548
- I don't know about you, but I'm thirsty as fuck.
- Yeah.

495
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:17,318
- How're you doing?
- I was thinking about my son.

496
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:24,288
He sends me these jokes every day.
It's kind of our, our thing.

497
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:28,608
A little off-color.
His mother wouldn't approve.

498
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:33,488
I tell you something Mike, These little
messages I get from him everyday,

499
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:36,878
They mean everything, you'll see.

500
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:45,578
Most important thing, never criticize.
Always encourage.

501
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:50,128
You just want them to be passionate.
That's what I always tell my son.

502
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:52,628
Find something you care about, and care deeply.

503
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,828
That and the Golden Rule.
Treat others as you like to be treated.

504
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:03,378
- That's it?
- Yeah, basically.

505
00:55:03,978 --> 00:55:05,528
What about all the other stuff.

506
00:55:06,578 --> 00:55:12,118
Sleeping, eating, electrical outlets,
diapers, stairs, and ...

507
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:14,078
That stuff takes care of itself.

508
00:55:14,598 --> 00:55:18,608
- Really?
- No, hah ha, you'll figure it out.

509
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:22,108
Okay, your dates have arrived.

510
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:27,498
That's under construction.
No one lives or works there.

511
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:33,338
- That's why this is particularly interesting.
- I had my NSA analysts take a peek at the power usage ..

512
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:35,638
Through the roof the last three weeks.

513
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:38,978
pretty odd, considering no one
lives or works there.

514
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:44,998
Central London.
Right under our bloody noses.

515
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,078
Tell the SAS that we're going
to make a house call.

516
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,548
Mike,

517
00:55:56,888 --> 00:55:58,248
[??] to your right.

518
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:04,738
Left.

519
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:22,218
There's no way to dress this up, sir.
It isn't good.

520
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:26,138
Could be worse. Could be [??]

521
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:30,678
Atta boy.  Don't stop for anyone.

522
00:56:53,308 --> 00:56:58,488
- Are we clear?
- Yeah, ha hah. We fucken made it.

523
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:00,618
Ha ha, we did.

524
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,118
Where is he?

525
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:15,448
Where the fuck?  Where is he?

526
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,848
Were did they take him?

527
00:58:20,268 --> 00:58:22,888
[??] UNINTELLIGIBLE [??]

528
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,318
Back off, take it easy, take it easy!

529
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:30,468
You've gotta be Banning.

530
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,718
(introduces himself),
Captain Tutu, SAS [??]

531
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,468
President Asher has just been taken.

532
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:41,058
And these assholes intend
to publicly execute him.

533
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:44,028
We know, at 8:00 PM.
It's all over the internet.

534
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:47,908
- We'll take care of that.  Move out!
- Hey, hey, wait.

535
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:51,758
[??] you come this with me.

536
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:54,638
How many times you've saved this man's ass?

537
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:58,468
Now, I'm going to go get him.
And you can kill me,

538
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:00,378
Or you can come with me.

539
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:03,448
But I ain't going to go any other way.

540
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:08,798
After you.

541
00:59:28,008 --> 00:59:30,328
- CCTV is back up.
- What did you do?

542
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:34,798
Disable the authorization code
that shut down the CCTV system.

543
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:40,778
[??]

544
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:44,768
Wait ..
What authorization code?

545
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:50,768
:::: 19:50 ::::

546
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:08,398
You should be thankful.

547
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:15,108
How many men get to experience
their death witnessed by billions .. live?

548
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:17,808
You are going to go down in history.

549
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:21,568
I'm not the only that's going
to die today, Kamran.

550
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:43,168
- Post Command.
- Banning.

551
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:48,428
Mike Banning? Chief Inspector Hazard,
Scotland Yard. Hold your position.

552
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,558
- Our military will be on your location in 20 minutes.
- No sir.

553
01:00:51,608 --> 01:00:54,368
- The President's going to be dead in 10.
- You don't understand,

554
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:58,258
We have NSA imagery of where you're going.
It's their base of operations.

555
01:00:58,718 --> 01:01:01,018
There are nealy a 100 terrorists in there.

556
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:03,648
Yeah, well.
They should have brought more men.

557
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:12,928
- Things are ready to get sporty.
- Just watch your balls.

558
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:14,558
Will do.

559
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,768
RPG!

560
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:20,758
[??]

561
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:24,208
Yeah, they kill the President
the second we try it.

562
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:28,028
Alright call Fox Command .. [??] the utilities here.. [??]

563
01:03:28,128 --> 01:03:31,578
[??]

564
01:03:32,348 --> 01:03:35,128
- The generator? -- Yeah
- Let's pull out the plug. -- Yeah.

565
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:46,008
- What happened?
- The power supply was just cut.

566
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,288
Get the emergency generators up.
Come on!

567
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:56,408
Banning, this is what we got.
This is a three-story building..

568
01:03:56,518 --> 01:04:00,868
The entry point is here.  There are
two stairwells. One here, and one here.

569
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:05,038
We believe the President is being held
in this room, on the second floor.

570
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,608
Hold your position. I need you to hit
this building with everything you got.

571
01:04:09,658 --> 01:04:12,008
- You got it.
- Keep them busy. I'll sneak inside.

572
01:04:15,288 --> 01:04:18,938
Take that. Do not press that
button till I tell you.

573
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:22,688
- Are you fucken crazy?
- Yeah. Wish me luck.

574
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:52,448
:::: 19:55 ::::

575
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,478
They are almost here.
Why don't you just kill him now?

576
01:06:24,538 --> 01:06:27,208
No!
The whole world needs to see this.

577
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:34,618
Hear that, Kamran?
That's the sound of inevitability.

578
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:44,098
I am going to kill you live. But that doesn't
mean you can't suffer privately first.

579
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:56,768
Look at me!

580
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:05,038
I held my sister as she died in my arms.

581
01:07:06,908 --> 01:07:09,118
You're the monsters, Mr. President.

582
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:15,588
It won't justify your insanity
to make you better about yourself.

583
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:27,418
Shoot him!

584
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:52,268
:::: 19:57 ::::

585
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:27,868
Almost, waiting for
the internet connection.

586
01:08:29,078 --> 01:08:33,198
Technology, only as good as
the dumbshits that are using it.

587
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:36,678
- How long?
- Seconds.

588
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:40,778
- We are live now.
- Okay.

589
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:53,728
Say hello to the world, Mr. President.

590
01:08:57,648 --> 01:09:00,648
:::: 20:00 ::::

591
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:11,968
Any last words, Mr. President?

592
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:20,738
I do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute
the office of the President of the United States.

593
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:22,978
Son of a bitch.

594
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:26,748
.. the United States.

595
01:09:30,068 --> 01:09:36,908
And to the best of my ability
preserve, protect, and defend ..

596
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:52,128
Oh, my god.

597
01:10:12,468 --> 01:10:14,068
I'm not watching this.

598
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:05,238
You know what you guys don't get:

599
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:15,288
We're not a fucken [??],
we're not a fucken flag,

600
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:17,428
we're not just one man...

601
01:11:17,988 --> 01:11:22,088
And assholes like you, have been trying
to kill us for a long fucken time..

602
01:11:22,298 --> 01:11:23,528
But you know what,

603
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:25,628
A thousand years from now..

604
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,098
We'll still fucken be here.

605
01:11:36,648 --> 01:11:38,118
Mike! Grenade!

606
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:57,598
- What took you so long?
- Sorry, I had a couple of errands to run.

607
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:03,438
Shit, does this fucker ever die?

608
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:12,848
Alright, we gotta get out of here,
You good?

609
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,778
Go! Move, move, move!

610
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,588
Mike!  Come on!

611
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:11,288
I'm out.

612
01:13:19,118 --> 01:13:20,468
I'm out too.

613
01:13:22,578 --> 01:13:26,828

Two weeks after the devastating
attacks on the British capital,

A new government has been installed,

"London may have fallen, but it has
always endured, and will rise again."
