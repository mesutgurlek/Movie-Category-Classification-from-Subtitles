He'll be right back.

We don't.

I don't have anything
to say to you.

The only difference
between you and him

is he knows he's an asshole.

With all due respect, Brother Fareed,

for you to come all the way here
over one phone call.

We have reason to believe
that this particular phone booth

has been used by
Nathir's operatives in the past.

00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,754
No, I set off a bomb.

642
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,572
Look, I know you paid
a price to get this far.

643
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,607
Okay?. You' re close.

644
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,735
You' re very close.

645
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,673
I don't know, man.
You tell me.

646
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:23,947
Do we stop?.

647
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,950
[thunder rumbling]

648
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,051
[speaking Arabic]

649
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,601
What made you learn Arabic?.

650
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,433
I took a class in college
and got hooked.

651
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,737
I even switched my major
from Religion to Arabic Studies.

652
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,437
You were a Religion major?.

653
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,207
My daddy was a Baptist minister.

654
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,874
His daddy was a Baptist minister.

655
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,281
It's in the blood.

656
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,445
You know, when J. Edgar
were in office,

657
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,183
he never would have
let you into the FBl.

658
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,952
Wasn't my original plan.

659
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,927
Not a lot of jobs, however,
for Ph. D. s in Arabic Studies.

660
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,327
Oh, I get it now.

661
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,491
You were an egghead
who got dragged into a street fight.

662
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,362
Nobody gets dragged into a street fight.

663
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,532
[bell dings]
[wheels screeching]

664
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,088
[speaking in Arabic]

665
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,122
Welcome to T oronto, Brother Samir.

666
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,226
It's a great honor, Emir.

667
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,668
Please, sit.

668
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:55,999
Thank you.

669
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,841
- T ea?.
- Y es, thank you.

670
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,078
Omar tells me that you play chess.

671
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,915
Only a little. Thank you.

672
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,683
I n chess and in war,
the key to winning

673
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,919
is to anticipate what your opponent
will do in advance.

674
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,325
Think two moves ahead.

675
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,693
The art of asymmetrical warfare

676
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:26,667
is less about inflicting damage
than provoking a response.

677
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,034
T errorism is theater.

678
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,939
And theater is always performed
for an audience.

679
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,773
Ours is the American people.

680
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:41,806
But we are dispersed
across a large country.

681
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,819
The question is,

682
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:47,618
how to convince them
that nowhere is safe.

683
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,426
Samir, imagine a bus
traveling cross-country

684
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,223
filled with average, everyday Americans.

685
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,729
People from-- from all over.

686
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,459
From small towns,
from the country.

687
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,559
I magine the effect it would have

688
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:04,403
if that very same bus
were to suddenly explode.

689
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,965
Now multiply that by 50.

690
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:11,275
Fifty buses across
the heartland of America,

691
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,076
all at the same time,

692
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,640
on the same day.

693
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:20,348
We call this operation
Risala Shukra Al-hiba.

694
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,914
For years we've been planting
martyrs in their midst.

695
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,452
They are waiting for a signal,

696
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,555
instructions, material.

697
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,303
We need somebody who can move
about the country without drawing attention.

698
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:38,602
Somebody who blends in.

699
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:44,037
An American messenger, Samir.

700
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,756
He isn't capable of this.

701
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,424
I don't like having to show
these to you, Chandra.

702
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:06,468
But we need to find him
before this happens again.

703
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:11,701
Samir always said that these people
were lslam's worse enemies.

704
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,334
Oh, he fought a Holy War
with these folks in Afghanistan

705
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,275
and then again in Bosnia.

706
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,280
He was trained to kill.

707
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,942
He was a soldier, not a murderer.

708
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,851
I believe he deceived you
as much as anybody else.

709
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:34,289
His faith was a source of strength.

710
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,063
Not this.

711
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,045
- Welcome to the U. S.
- Thanks.

712
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,752
I ' m a friend of Nassim's.

713
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,152
I ' m here to see lqbal.

714
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,505
Shukran.

715
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,984
They transferred the funds for
the Spain bombing the Middle Eastern way.

716
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,851
You give a thousand Euros
to somebody in one city

717
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,981
and their cousin or uncle
pays it in the--

718
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,549
Than k you, M r. Hayes,
we do know what a hawala network is.

719
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,492
The money trail ended in London.

720
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,861
A Pakistani with some
shady business dealings

721
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,560
was the source of the money
for the Spain operation.

722
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,762
Yesterday he transferred
$25, 000 to Los Angeles.

723
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,430
Do you have an I D on h i m?.

724
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,034
We 're close.

725
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,445
That's an encrypted phone.
You can cal I me on it safely.

726
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,003
Nobody can I isten i n.

727
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,072
I ncl ud i ng the FBl?.

728
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,347
Y eah. Especially the FBl.

729
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,379
When do you think you can
get in a room with Nathir again?.

730
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,424
I don't know.

731
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,426
Probably not until I do
what it is they sent me to do.

732
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,825
Then you keep on going.

733
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,296
Well, the problem is,
to keep going means

734
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,833
I'm going to have to put real bombs
in their hands now soon.

735
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,563
If that what it takes
to keep your cover.

736
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,496
[scoffs]

737
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,106
Do you realize how far I 've gone
to protect your identity, Samir?.

738
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,739
I have kept you completely
off the books.

739
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,307
My boss, his boss--
nobody knows you even exist.

740
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,512
Look, I don't give a shit
about any of that, okay?.

741
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,214
We need to rethink things.

742
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,816
If you don't succeed,
we may not get another chance.

743
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:56,396
How far are you willing to take this?.

744
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,626
We've got blood on our hands.

745
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,134
We've killed innocent people.

746
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:03,229
Y eah, and if we stop now,
they' ll have died for nothing.

747
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,137
This is a war.

748
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,472
You do what it takes to win.

749
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,308
You know who you sound like, right?.

750
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,476
We' re the good guys, Samir.

751
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,247
Oh, I know.

752
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,252
Hey!

753
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,418
Remember who you answer to.

754
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:28,231
I answer to God.
We all do.

755
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,305
- Any problem?.
- No.

756
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,999
Omar. Omar, Omar!
Don't! Don't!

757
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,800
[laughs]

758
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,363
Can't blow up unless
there's a detonator in it.

759
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,137
- Don't worry.
- It still makes me nervous.

760
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,875
We gotta talk about
how we're gonna send these e-mails.

761
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,180
What do you mean?.
I thought we decided to use coded e-mail.

762
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,378
No, no, we did. We did.

763
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,148
But the problem is e-mails
can get intercepted.

764
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,747
I got a better idea.

765
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:32,555
We're gonna give each of our people
an e-mail account and a password. All right?.

766
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:35,119
Then when we' re ready to go,
we log onto each one,

767
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,791
we write the instructions,
but we don't send them.

768
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,232
We save it as a draft.

769
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:43,295
The next morning they log on,
they check their unsent messages.

770
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:44,339
Nothing is sent.

771
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,204
There's nothing
for the FBl to intercept.

772
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,470
Y eah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like this.

773
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,307
Here are the names.

774
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,513
There's only ten.

775
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,984
We don't risk putting them
all on one list.

776
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,420
None of them even knows
that the other exists.

777
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,686
Ah. I like that.

01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,795
Sorry.

782
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,491
That's okay.

783
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,795
They want that file translated right away.

784
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,130
Sure.

785
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,039
From British I ntelligence, huh?.

786
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,472
Y eah.

787
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,541
Good night.
Good night.

You have to get out, now.

Leave nothing.

Get your hands up!

Right there! Against the wall!

797
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,950
M r. Raman, how are you?.

798
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,751
Perhaps you haven't had time
to read the fine print of the Patriot Act,

799
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,054
but any person operating
a money transmitting business

800
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,423

960
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,033
Where have I heard that before?.

961
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,236
Our phone intercept.

962
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,677
Your intercept only picked up
the first part of the code name.

963
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:55,511
The date of the attack
is in the full name. Leyla?.

964
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:56,914
"Risala " means " message, "

965
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,818
"Shukra " means "thanks"
and "Al-hiba " is "the gift. "

966
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:03,153
So the literal translation is
" Message of thanks for the gift. "

967
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,089
Thanksgiving.

968
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,219
Exactly.
That's when they' re gonna strike.

969
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,092
I n two days time.

970
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,529
What about the target?.

971
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,828
Well, we found traces
of Semtex in the vehicle

972
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,391
Horn abandoned in Chicago.

973
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:16,437
But that was purchased
in California a month ago.

974
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:20,668
And he could have been distributing bombs
right across the entire country by now.

975
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:25,144
We' ll raise the threat level.

976
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:28,205
Double up protection on bridges,
airports, monuments, the White House.

977
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:32,083
Sir, I would also suggest that we place Horn
on the high-value target list, too.

978
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,643
He killed a good man.

979
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,951
You're not going to get
any objections from us.

980
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,145
- You let me win, Omar.
- No.

981
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,512
No, I swear.
[laughs]

982
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:02,811
You've gotten better, my friend.

983
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,476
Please, don't bullshit me.

984
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:08,010
You beat me enough times
for me to know when you' re throwing a game.

985
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,148
[sighs]

986
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:19,030
Fareed has made up his mind.

987
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,865
Sorry.
It's not your fault.

988
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,532
I did this.

989
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,675
We're only men, my friend.

990
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:36,313
I have a girl in Paris, Samir.

991
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:40,013
Beautiful. Beautiful.

992
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:43,057
She thinks I'm a music producer.
[laughs]

993
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:46,025
You know, it's true what they say.

994
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,289
War is the lesser jihad.

995
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:52,629
T o overcome temptation,
to live rightly,

996
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,635
that is the great jihad.

997
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,174
And is that what we've been doing?.

998
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,806
You ever ask yourself that?.

999
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:16,354
Sometimes.

1000
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:18,449
But Nathir is the leader.

1001
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:21,051
And my duty is to follow.

1002
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,025
Come, let's pray.

1003
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,776
We've just received word
from our source in Washington.

1004
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:46,251
It appears you' re on
the high-value target list.

1005
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,222
What is that?.
What does that mean?.

1006
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,485
It means I owe you an apology, Samir.

1007
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,426
That means that the American government
has put a fatwa on you.

1008
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,328
[laughs]
They want you dead.

1009

[speaking Arabic]

1010
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:14,779
Hang on. This is--
The system's running really slow.

1011
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:20,643
We need to get back on the road
and make it to Halifax by tonight.

1012
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:22,485
Halifax?.

1013
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,396
They will be looking for us
big time after tomorrow.

1014
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:33,230
We' ll be cruising
across the ocean by then.

1015
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,529
All of us.

1016
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,439
[typing]

1017
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:50,108
[scoffs]
Computer's frozen.

1018
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,583
[sighs] What?.

1019
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,347
Jeez, I gotta reboot the whole thing.

1020
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,252
- What do you mean?.
- Good God.

1021
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:57,553
- I gotta get some coffee.
- No, no, no. You stay here.

1022
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,956
I ' ll get it.

1023
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:02,462
Make sure you get
the numbers exactly right.

1024
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,363
I want each person
on the road at the same time.

1025
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,832
Got it.

1026
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,885
That's it.

1027
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,516
- Done?.
- Y eah, we' re good.

1028
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:07,356
Let's go.

1029
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:38,382
Aah.

1030
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,797

[Male Reporter talking indistinctly]

[Archer]
You've got to be shitting me.

1035
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:51,055
The U. S. is going to be attacked today
and we just arrived at the ass-end of Canada.

1036
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,490
- Roy Clayton?.
- Y eah.

1037
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,221
This fax came for you.

1038
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,887
What is it?.

1039
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,227
The county records for the two
State Department employees

1040
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,267
killed at the consulate bombing in Nice.

1041
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:03,235
Well, these people died as infants.

1042
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,534
Wait a sec.

1043
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:07,506
These deaths are fake.

1044
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,065
Y eah.

1045
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:40,063

1048

[Man]
A few dozen ships in port right now,

1049
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,178
but only these five are scheduled
to head out today.

1050
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,079
All right, all these ships
are destined for U. S. ports

1051
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,412
except for this one--
The Ivory Star.

1052
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,544
- It's a tanker registered out of Aden.
- Y emen?.

1053
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,882
- That's gotta be it.
- That's gotta be it.

1054
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:04,186
You want to board her, we' ll need
an official request from the FBl in Washington.

1055
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:06,818
We go through HQ, this information's
gonna get leaked right back.

1056
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:07,986
Wait a minute.

1057
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:11,190
Customs can search any ship that it wants
if it thinks it has drugs on board, right?.

1058
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,562
You have any friends left
in Narcotics?.

1059
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,692
We' ll soon find out.

- [speaking Arabic]
- Welcome, my friend.

1064
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:26,764
This is going to be a great day.

1065
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,450
It's almost time.

1066
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,055
[speaking Arabic]

1067
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:28,728
The Americans love to brag about
how their government represents the people.

1068
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:33,296
So we should accept that every American
shares equal responsibility

1069
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,865
for their government's crimes.

1070
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,935
Nobody is innocent.

[Man]
We're leaving harbor soon, Emir.

1072
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,446
We have to stay below decks for a while.

1073
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,609
What's the matter with you?.

1074
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:48,018
Uh, I ' m getting a little seasick.

1075
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:51,990
I think I need to take some air.
May l, Emir?.

1076
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:03,602
- You' re the head of security, brother?.
- Y es, sir.

1077
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:05,696
And how many men in your detail
guarding the Emir?.

1078
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,503
Seven crew members.
Don't worry. We' re certainly safe.

I think he's leading us
on a goose chase.

01:39:58,192 --> 01:39:59,284
That was the harbor master.

There's one more ship
going into international waters today.

Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1094
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,166
What have you done, Samir?.

1095
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:17,135
- I didn't come here to kill you, Omar.
- You are a traitor!

01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:19,468
No! Nathir was the traitor.

1097

Fareed was the traitor.
They betrayed lslam!

- It doesn't matter.

I was dead as soon
as I stepped foot on this ship.

But I had to stop them.
I had to stop this--

What the hell are you talking about?.
You haven't stopped shit!

No. No, that can't be.

01:42:34,848 --> 01:42:37,373
I changed the e-mails, Omar.

1117
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:43,789
It's over.

1118
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:52,094
[crying]

1119
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:54,430
I put my trust on you.

1120
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,935
I thought you were my brother!

1121
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:08,476
Omar.

1122
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,653
Omar.

1123
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:25,365
I am your brother.

1124
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:34,268
They used you, Omar.

1125
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:36,901
They used me, too.
All of them.

1126
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:38,808
They used us for our faith.

1127
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:46,550
[metallic clang]

1128
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,117
- Drop your weapon!
- [men shouting indistinctly]

1129
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:51,214
Omar. Omar!

1130
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:56,726
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

1131
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:05,768
- Samir?.
- [groaning]

1132
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:09,205
Samir, where's Nathir?.

1133
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:28,286
Hang in there, Samir.

1134
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:30,387
Call a paramedic.

1135
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,764
It'll be okay.

1136
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:09,559
Samir.

1137
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:15,240
You wanna take a ride and talk?.

1138
01:45:18,045 --> 01:45:20,377
We can talk right here.

1139
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:31,856
Good to see you up and about.

1140
01:45:31,925 --> 01:45:34,120
Didn't know if you'd make it.

1141
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:35,889
How's the shoulder?.

1142
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:38,522
I'll live.

1143
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:41,066
I don't suspect
anybody's said this to you,

1144
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:45,594
but this country owes you
a huge debt.

1145
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:49,870
You came all the way out here
just to tell me that?.

1146
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:51,535
Come on, Clayton.
I'm going someplace.

1147
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:52,942
What do you want?.

1148
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:57,545
I've had your file wiped clean.

1149
01:45:57,617 --> 01:45:58,879
Everything.

1150
01:45:58,952 --> 01:46:01,477
The bombing at France,
the bus, all of it.

1151
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:06,049
Effectively, you're a free man
but there's still a lot that you can do for us.

1152
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,754
I ' m a free man?.

1153
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:11,423
This doesn't feel like freedom
to me, Clayton.

1154
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,557
You think because you hit "delete"
on some computer somewhere

1155
01:46:13,633 --> 01:46:15,191
that that's it, it's over?.

1156
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:17,099
I made choices about people's lives.

1157
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,603
- And I gotta live with that.
- I understand.

1158
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:20,469
- Forever, Clayton.
- I understand that.

1159
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:23,941
But you and I both know
that this fight is far from over.

1160
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:31,280
You know, the Qur'an says
that if you kill an innocent person,

1161
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:34,115
it's as if you've killed all mankind?.

1162
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:38,156
[sighs]

1163
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:43,686
It also says that if you save a life,
it's like you've saved all mankind.

1164
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:46,096
You' re a hero, Samir.

1165
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:53,666
Look, whatever you want to call me,

1166
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,401
I ' m done.

1167
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:00,978
Well, we know how to find each other.

1168
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:05,984
As-Salamu Alaykum.

1169
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:11,150
Wa alaikum assalam.

1170
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:18,564
And you should start
the conversation with that.

1171
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,632
