Maybe you thought I was gonna learn

what Jacques said was true,

1871
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,522
that I was deluded...

That I was as evil
as the rest of them.

But maybe you're the one

But sometimes how it looks
and how it is

1876
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,543
are two different things.

1877

And I saved Sarah.

1882
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:34,266
She stayed with me
a couple months.

1883
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,560
They were not bad times.

1884
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,022
Though, they were most likely

1885
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,399
out of Sarah's sense of obligation.

1886

she moved on.

1888
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,787
I thought it was me at the time,

01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,457
that I was the chosen one,

1890

but it was Sarah all along.

1891
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,879
And that's why I needed to save her.

1892
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:08,550
She needed to finish school,
to study anthropology,

1893
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,635
because Sarah knows something about people.

1894

We're not able to even feel
the love that...

1895

She needed to go back to her meetings,

1896
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,809
where she had insights
that struck others uniquely.

1897
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,811
"FINE" means,
"Fucked up, Insecure,

1898
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,647
Neurotic, and Emotional."

1899
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,649
And sometimes she needed to have nightmares

1900
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,320
of those ugly times at Jacques' ranch.

1901

Because a kind man,

and didn't know it,

1903

needed to learn how to comfort someone.

1904
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,504
And maybe most of all,
Sarah needed to have

1905
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:50,342
