Yeah, Deonte, what's up?

40
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,513
I'm at The Caveat,

41
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,550
and I got a strange female
in the bed with me.

42
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:20,751
All right, what's the problem?

43
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,086
She want money?

44
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,189
No, man.
I fucking think she's dead.

45
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,157
Did you kill her?

46
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,191
No!

47
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,892
I didn't even fuck her.

48
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,759
She was doing blow all night.

49
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,061
I think she had a overdose.

50
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,033
Oh, my God!

51
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,667
All right.

52
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,367
Put your fingers on her neck
and feel for a pulse.

53
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,503
I can't do that.

54
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:39,771
I think there's blood there.

55
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,407
She had a nosebleed.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,175
And my dick is covered in blood!

57
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,611
This is so extreme, man!

58
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,380
Do it now, Deonte.

59
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,616
If she's still breathing,
we need to save her life.

60
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,850
I can't.

61
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,652
What if she passed?

62
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,387
You think you're the first
person I've dealt with,

63
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,220
woke up in bed with a dead body?

64
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,192
Take your fingers
and feel for a pulse.

65
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:01,393
All right, hold on.

66
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:07,199
(breathing deeply):
Oh, fuck.

67
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,711
She's dead, dawg.

68
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,247
She... aw, shit, man.

69
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:23,816
I don't even know her, man!

70
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,219
I met her last night.

71
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,017
I don't do drugs,
I'm an athlete!

72
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,287
Listen to me.

73
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,955
Don't touch anything,

74
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,224
don't call anyone.

75
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,756
I'm sending someone over now.

76
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,827
I just signed an $80 million
endorsement, cuz!

77
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,362
TMZ was following me
around last night.

78
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:38,632
Calm down.

79
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,833
I'm on it. Just sit tight.

80
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,436
(phone ringing)

81
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,737
Yeah?

82
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:48,474
Av? We have a situation
at The Caveat.

83
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,977
Deonte Brown's
in bed with a dead girl.

84
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,444
I think she overdosed.

85
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,447
Get over there
and hold his hand,

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,647
see what's what.

87
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,083
Okay, I'm on it, Raymond.

88
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,121
(phone ringing)

89
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,520
Yo, boss.

90
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,990
Lena, honey.
Get over to the office now.

91
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:05,257
I'll call you back
in ten minutes

92

when I'm on the road.

93
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,829
Deonte Brown's at The Caveat
with a dead girl.

94
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,130
I hate it when that happens.

95
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,466
Okay.

96
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,670
Hey. I gotta leave.

97
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:17,872
Get dressed, let's go.

98
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,944
You're not going
to school in that.

99
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:26,012
This is how they dress
in Calabasas.

100
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,980
You want her to dress
different, she needs to go

101
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,614
to Marlborough
or Harvard-Westlake.

102
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,884
BRIDGET:
I'm not wearing a uniform.

103
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:45,098
- That's nice, honey.
- She needs to talk to Bunchy and Terry.

104
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,667
She has to interview everyone.

105
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,968
Hey, how come they didn't
have any kids?

106
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:51,038
Terry's got Parkinson's, honey.

107
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:53,073
- Does that mean we're gonna get it?
- What's that?

108
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:54,540
ABBY:
Your son's getting in fights.

109
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,010
Bullshit.
I fell at soccer.

110
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,347
Are we gonna get it?

111
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,579
No, Terry got it
from boxing.

112
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,349
He got hit in the head
too much. Let me see that.

113
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,685
So why didn't Bunchy have kids?

114
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,322
Well, you know, Bunchy's, uh...

115
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,355
He has issues.

116
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,856
He got molested by a priest
when they were little.

117
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:12,859
- Really?
BRIDGET: Yeah.

118
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,527
That's why Dad was
always so obsessed

119
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,097
about nobody touching
our privates.

120
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,931
And it's why we don't
go to church.

121
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,569
I gotta go. Where's my iPad?

122
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,071
ABBY: You didn't tell me
you're doing something

123
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,340
for Stu Feldman.

124
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,875
He's on the board
at Marlborough.

125
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,178
I'll try.

126
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,243
ABBY:
Not good enough, Raymond.

127
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,545
Promise me.

128
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:38,751
I promise.

129
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,953

00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,434

133
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,146
AVI:
Yeah?

134
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,980
You got it under control?

135
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:08,181
So far, so good.

136
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,586
Okay, you're
the boss.

137
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,719
(phone ringing)

138
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,887
Lena, what's up?

139
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,457
I called our plant at TMZ,

140
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,059
nothing about anything
with Deonte or The Caveat.

141
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,060
Good.

142
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:19,292
Get me Lee Drexler.

143
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,298
Okay, here's Lee.

144
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,765
I'll stay on the line.
Thanks, doll.

145
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,333
LEE:
Yeah?

146
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,837
Lee, where are we with
the Tommy Wheeler thing?

147
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,471
His career's finished,
that's where we are.

148
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,807
Guy has a $200 million
heterosexual movie

149
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:34,176
coming out in a month?

150
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,576
Picks up a tranny
on Sunset Boulevard?

151
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,647
Can you get him
into your office now?

152
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,914
Ten minutes or so?

153
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,184
Yeah, I'll teleport him.

154
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,950
Get him there
as soon as you can.

155
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,251
I got an idea.

156
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:46,621
We can kill two birds
with one stone.

157
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,826
(Lee shouting indistinctly)

158
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,630
LEE: ...that is the
stupidest thing...

159
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,933
You know what

160
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,334
this asshole
just told me?

161
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,468
That he was raised
to help a woman.

162
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,235
<i>A woman.</i>

163
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:04,106
Women don't have
cocks, you moron.

164
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,073
It was the middle of the
night, she ran out of gas.

165
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,610
Shut the fuck up.

166
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,145
I didn't know it was a guy,
on my life.

167
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,678
LEE:
Yeah? What about the one

168

<i>who called Marty
Grossman at Stalkerazzi</i>

169

saying you picked him up
the month before that?

170
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,686
You know how many people
out there look like me?

171
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:19,219
Guys are asking for the Tommy
Wheeler body at my gym.

172
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,392
LEE:
You fucking cocksucking liar.

173
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,893
You know what's
gonna happen to you?

174
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,726
You are gonna be taking
it up the ass in 3-D

Let me handle this.

I didn't know it
was a guy, I swear.

179

Guy had an Adam's apple
the size of my fist!

Tommy, look at me.

181
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,325
I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,260
I'm so embarrassed.

183
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,994
I-I feel like I'm addicted
or something.

184
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,264
Tommy, listen to me.

I have a way to get
you out of this.

RAY:
Lena.

187
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,002
Call TMZ and leak the news
that Tommy Wheeler is

188
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,936
at The Caveat with a dead
girl. Then get over there

You're his publicist

Got it, boss.

194
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,613
Did I kill her?

00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,018
No.

196
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,018
She overdosed.

197
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,320

What'd you tell
your wife?

204
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,581
DEONTE: That I got
back from Vegas early.

205
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,583
Missed her. I'm gonna
take her to The Ivy.

206
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,454
No, have breakfast here.

207
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,589
That way, if someone sees you
here, you're with your wife.

208
00:10:58,621 --> 00:10:59,888
Nobody connects you
with the dead girl.

and smear it on your dick.

213
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,632
What?
She had a nosebleed.

214
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,236
She bled on your dick.

215
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:12,301
Now go!

216
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,604
Bring the cup back to me.

217
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,239
Now.

<i>LENA:
Okay, listen up.</i>

220
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,843
I can confirm Tommy Wheeler is
in the hotel.

221
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,344
That's all I can tell you
at this point.

This gonna fly?

Yeah, worked out fine.

226

They'll let him go
in a few hours.

We'll put him
straight into Voyages.

Suck one cock,
you're a cocksucker for life.

229
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,858
Get caught with a dead girl,

230

admit to a drug problem,
and go to rehab, no problem.

I'll deal with the studio.

Stu Feldman called, you're late.
You gotta get over to Paramount.

233

I was gonna go see Ezra.

234
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,338
My partner's fine.

235
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,805
He's grieving. You'll see him
tomorrow at the service.

236
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,974
Get over to Paramount!

Lee, he's not fine.

Don't tell me what to do.

240
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,353
Marty, my friend.
I told you he's not a fag.

241
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,986
Did you see that tranny?

242
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,555
I would have fucked that tranny.

243

You drop the fag stuff,
I will give you

the first interview with him
from rehab.

Tommy Wheeler, look at me!

What happened over there?

249
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,871

251
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,710
Tommy, want to make a statement?
Tommy, look over here.

I want you to follow her.

See if she's fucking
around on me.

255
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,278
I'm married.
Lee told you that, right?

256
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,451
You think I'm a scumbag, right?

257
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,287
Married, but I'm fucking around
with this chick?

I'm not here to judge you.
It's not what I do.

You think I don't
know what you do?

260
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,494
Lee said
you're the best in town.

261
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,200
I love my wife...

262
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,504
but this chick...
has her claws in me.

263
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,775
My wife doesn't want to have sex
with me anymore.

264
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:33,280
I don't feel good about myself.

265
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,915
(phone buzzing)

266
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,284
You ever do
growth hormone?

267
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,316
No.

268
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:47,760
(stammers)
You think it's Kabbalah, right?

269
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,430
It's not. It's-It's to remind me

270
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,564
it's the hand of taking,
you know?

271
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,331
It should be the hand of giving.

272
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,167
You know, I want to give more.

273
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,469
I don't want
her to know

274
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,239
that I'm having her followed.

275
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,473
She has trust issues.

276
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,242
No problem.

277
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,075
She was one of
those Disney kids.

278
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,412
Parents stole all her money.

279
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,614
Now she's a singer.

280
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:09,849
Like Britney.

281
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,154
All right, good, good, good!

282
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,360
You don't talk a lot.
I like that.

283
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,331
I'm gonna start doing that.

284
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,433
Makes you very
mysterious.

285
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,803
I think I give away
my power too much.

286
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,271
I'll be in touch.

287
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,078
(dispenser whirs)

288
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,119
I'm gonna go sit
on Feldman's girl.

289
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:48,523
Okay.
Terry's called three times.

290
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,390
All right,
see if you can get him.

291
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:57,865
That's it. You go to the
body, then you move upstairs.

292
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,800
Everything behind
the jab, okay?

293
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,603

Your brother's on the phone!

294
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,506
Which?
Ray.

295
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,591
What's up?

296
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,459
RAY:
What's going on, Ter?

297
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:26,828
Bunchy had a slip.

298
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,866
Where is he?

299
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,703
MAN: He was a big,
charismatic guy.

300
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,237
Tells my parents
I'm an athlete.

301
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,276
This was a big deal
in my family,

302
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:44,544
a priest paying attention to me.

303
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,446
I was, I was so flattered.

304
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,083
Takes me to
this health club

305
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,719
and tells me we have
to shower first.

306
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,121
Motherfucker.

307
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:56,357
And that was the first
time he molested me.

308
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:01,763
I come into the house,
and my mother says, uh...

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,169
She says, "How was it,
Kev? Was it thrilling?"

310
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,108
I'm gonna tell my mother
that this man raped me?

311
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,675
This man's
next to God.

312
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:16,378
(phone ringing)

313
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:18,279
That's God's representative
on Earth.

314
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,821
Hey.

315
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,555
RAY:
Hey, Bunch, what's up?

316
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,892
You talk to Terry yet?

317
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,394
Yeah.

318
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,126
What's going on, Bunchy?
Talk to me.

319
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,597
My settlement just came through.

320
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,901
$1.4 million 'cause
some priest messed around

321
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,736
with me when I was a kid.

322
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,239
I thought I'd be so happy
when the money came.

323
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:47,677
You want me to send someone?
Come get you?

324
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,975
Send someone?

325
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:53,014
Nah, I ain't done drinking yet.

326
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,936
(dog barking)

327
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:38,362
I got his plates.

328
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:40,863
I'm gonna call it in
to Lena for an address.

329
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,167
I got a bad feeling.

330
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:48,804
Ray, what are
you doing?

331
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:50,472
You can't fucking
do that.

332
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,179
You said you weren't
gonna do this shit anymore.

333
00:17:55,211 --> 00:18:00,649
She's not the client!
Stu Feldman's the client!

334
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:01,783
(knocking)

335
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:07,156
Jesus, Ray Donovan!

336
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,523
You always open the door
like that?

337
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,362
Without asking
who it is?

338
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,862
I do when it's you.

339
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:13,731
How the hell
are you, Ray?

340
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,197
Pretty good.

341
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,701
You? Better than the
last time I saw you.

342
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:21,404
What was I, like, 16?

343
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:24,207
Trying to get my fucking money
back from my parents.

344
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:27,210
Assholes.

345
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,745
Did I ever
thank you?

346
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,349
You tried.

347
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,118
(chuckles)

348
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,087
So, what are you doing here,
Ray?

349
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,021
You have a stalker.

350
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,623
Right. That was good.

351
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,227
I'm, like, being punked, right?

352
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:45,427
No.

353
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,714
ASHLEY:
So, what, I'm supposed

354
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:05,382
to look over my shoulder
every minute now?

355
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:10,319
How did you even
know about him?

356
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:14,957
Look at me.
It's Stu, isn't it?

357
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:16,927
He hired you to spy on me?

358
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,261
Yeah.

359
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,665
Fucking asshole!

360
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:25,069
He's married.
Did you know that?

361
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,406
What does he want
from me?

362
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:32,275
I've had guys jerking off
to me since I was 15.

363
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,083
But you weren't like that,
were you, Ray?

364
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,427
Why are you telling me
about him?

365
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,428
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

366
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:51,864
Oh, my God! Hurt?

367
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,131
Who is this guy?
I don't know yet.

368
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:55,531
There are things we can do
to mitigate it.

369
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,302
Mitigate it?

370
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,935
I don't want another dog.

371
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,005
My last dog died of cancer!

372
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,711
I can't handle this right now.

373
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,315
♪ From the same old scam

374
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:13,683
♪ Feelin' like I'm stuck
in the same old rut ♪

375
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:18,055
♪ But I keep rollin'
'cause enough is enough ♪

376
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:21,024
♪ It ain't nothin' to me

377
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,828
♪ I keep on,
just fancy-free... ♪

378
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:25,630
Party's over, Bunch.
Let's go.

379
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,833
What are you, his mother?
We're fucking conversing here.

380
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,367
I'm not talking to you.

381
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,970
(mocking):
I'm not talking to you.

382
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,475
Man, what the fuck?

383
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,573
What the fuck you...?

384
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,542
(grunting)

385
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:47,686
How come
we never had a thing?

386
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,754
You're not really my type.

387
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,827
Of course I am.

388
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,664
Yeah?

389
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,366
(sighs)

390
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:09,073
Let me have
your hand.

391
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:10,674
What for?

392
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,677
Let me have
your hand.

393
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,083
Your heart line.

394
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,588
My heart line?

395
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:23,988
You fall in love easily.

396
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:31,597
All the little lost dolls.

397
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,802
(Ashley moaning)

398
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,314
(both moaning)

399
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:56,923
Hey.
Hey.

400
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,825
Oh, shit.

401
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:09,237
Hey, hey, look at me.
Ashley, you okay?

402
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:14,140
Oh, my God.

403
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:17,511
I'm so embarrassed.

404
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,781
I have epilepsy and I'm
not supposed to drink.

405
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,050
The sugar fucks me up.

406
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:26,119
What the fuck am I doing?

407
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:28,255
Why am I seeing Stu?

408
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:31,756
He's a terrible person.

409
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,861
God, I'm so fucked up.

410
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,965
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

411
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:43,670
You need to stop opening
your door to strangers.

412
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,540
Get a dog,
not a gun.

413
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,340
You got a gun,
they use it on you.

414
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:49,842
Get a security system.

415
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,079
Start doing what you need to do
to get your life in order.

416
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:57,652
(sighs)

417
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:58,684
(sniffs)

418
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,020
God, (laughs)

419
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,324
I really need yoga right now.

420
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:04,458
My wife does yoga.

421
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:05,493
Where?

422
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,495
Uh, Point Dume.

423
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,035
Look, I, um...

424
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,372
I got to go.

425
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,908
(grunts)

426
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,976
Can I see you again?

427
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:25,782
Let me make sure
you're okay.

428
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,715
Do my job.

429
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,316
With this guy.

430
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,421
Okay.

431
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,920
Thanks, Ray.

432
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,327
I love you.

433
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,061
All right.

434
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,464
Keep your doors locked.

435
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,068
And no more yoga
on the deck.

436
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,166
Yes, Daddy.

437
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,334
Don't worry.

438
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,071
You're in the solution now.

439
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:51,807
I remember that.

440
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,275
I love it.

441
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,277
What does it mean?

442
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:56,745
(door slams)

443
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:01,549
Yeah.

444
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,053
What?

445
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:10,558
I'm on my way.

446
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,780
How much do we
owe you for bail?

447
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:33,380
Nothing.

448
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:36,551
All right, it's not
the end of the world.

449
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:37,619
I'll get the charges dropped.

450
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:39,588
Come here.

451
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,593
What are you doing? Come here.

452
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:51,599
I was sober ten months,
three days until this.

453
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:52,800
I know, Bunch.

454
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:56,005
I know.

455
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,946
What's going on?

456
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,082
You remember
Dad's girlfriend Claudette?

457
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:08,351
Yeah.

458
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,617
They had a kid.

459
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:10,986
They what?

460
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,019
They had a kid, Ray.

461
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:15,923
When?

462
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,827
Before he went to Walpole.

463
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:23,331
How long have you known?

464
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,168
I told you
we should've told him.

465
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,334
How fucking long?

466
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:27,436
A long time.

467
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:28,769
He's grown.

468
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:29,839
His name's Daryll.

469
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,846
Hey, hey,

470
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:39,849
hey, hey, hey...

471
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:42,219
Okay, okay.

472
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:43,954
Hey, Ray.
No.

473
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,492
He doesn't like
strangers touching him.

474
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,158
All right, we can
work up to that.

475
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,866
We didn't think
you could handle it.

476
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,940
Did I say "Come in"?
I didn't say "Come in."

477
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:05,674
I heard my name so I thought
that meant "Come in."

478
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:10,381
He and Claudette come out here
about ten years ago.

479
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:12,814
She got sent away
for writing bad checks.

480
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,686
Ten years you've been
keeping this from me.

481
00:26:14,718 --> 00:26:16,252
A little longer.

482
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,490
Before you moved us out here
and I got the gym.

483
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,357
Dad wanted us
to get to know him.

484
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:23,260
(laughs)

485
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,995
Guy who threw rocks during
the Boston thing, screaming,

486
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,098
"Niggers, go home."

487
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:28,999
Is this a
fucking joke?

488
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:32,903
All right, take it easy.

489
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,403
Ray.

490
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,305
There's something else.

491
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:41,746

I'm a sexual anorexic.

828
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:40,478
You're kidding me.

829
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,478
I swear, bro.

830
00:49:41,513 --> 00:49:42,813
How do you like them apples?

831
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,753
Just go easy on him, Ray.

832
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,420
I mean, he wants
to make amends.

833
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,526
He feels real bad
about everything.

834
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:11,542
You hear about
this new law?

835
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,643
Egan's Law?

836
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,179
They got to notify you if
the Catholic Church moves

837
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,380
into the neighborhood.

838
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:17,648
(laughs)

839
00:50:19,485 --> 00:50:22,187
Come on, Ray, it's funny.

840
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,054
MICKEY:
If you can't laugh,

841
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,991
what are you gonna
do-- cry all the time?

842
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:27,359
What are you doing here, Mick?

843
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,791
MICKEY:
What am I doing here?

844
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,427
Last time I saw you,
I was the one going

845
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:32,197
to Hollywood-- what
the fuck happened?

846
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,298
You set me up,
motherfucker.

847
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,865
20 years.

848
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:37,735
Now look at you.

849
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:38,869
Such a big shot.

850
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:43,907
Well, this is great.

851
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,141
This is great.

852
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:46,811
All my boys are together.

853
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:48,380
Everyone's great.

854
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,280
Everyone's great,
Mick?

855
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:51,614
Really?

856
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,984
Bridget's dead,

857
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:54,585
Terry's shaking
like a fucking leaf,

858
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,386
and Bunchy can't stay sober
more than a month.

859
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:58,190
That's your legacy, Mick.

860
00:50:59,758 --> 00:51:01,225
MICKEY:
Hey,

861
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,395
Hollywood big shot.

862
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,797
I want to date Chita Rivera,
Rita Moreno, or Diahann Carroll

863
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,865
if Claudette don't
take me back.

864
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,202
Can you hook me up?

865
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:18,443
That priest,
I took care of him.

866
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:21,212
Some very powerful people
are gonna come after me now.

867
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:22,413
Very powerful.

868
00:51:22,448 --> 00:51:24,816
<i>Da VinciCode type shit.</i>

869
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,418
(laughing)

870
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:37,729
You deluded old fuck.

871
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,766
Only guys coming after you
are the guys you ripped off.

872
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:44,535
Only thing they need is the
address I'm gonna give 'em.

873
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,872
How's those grandkids

874
00:51:46,906 --> 00:51:48,907
of mine?

875
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:49,910
Motherfucker!

876
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:50,877
Ray, hold...

877
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,444
Ray, take it easy.

878
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,045
RAY: Motherfucker!
TERRY: Take it easy!

879
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:57,750
DARYLL: Chill!
TERRY: Take it easy.

880
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,792
You go near my family,

881
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,391
I'll fucking kill you.

882
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,562
You hear me?

883
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:31,784
(laughing)

884
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:56,809

885
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:27,841
♪

886
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,474

(grunting)

889
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,592
I warned you.

890
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,760
You deluded fuck.

891
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:21,895
Didn't I warn you?

892
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,408
(knock on door)

893
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:43,619
Mickey.

894
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,885
Pictures don't do
you justice, Abby.

895
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,920
You're beautiful.

896
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:50,092
When I wrote to you.

897
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:51,458
Those letters.

898
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:55,063
From the bottom
of my heart, Abby.

899
00:54:55,097 --> 00:54:57,232
I'm an old man, I need
to make it right.

900
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:00,836
He hates me, Abby.

901
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:04,036
Why? I don't know.

902
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,140
(sighs)

903
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,250
