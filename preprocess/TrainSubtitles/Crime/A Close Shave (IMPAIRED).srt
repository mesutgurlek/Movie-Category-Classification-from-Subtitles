1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,472
(Deep rumbling)

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,517
Ba-a-a-a! Ba-a-a-a!

3
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,435
Ba-a-a...!

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,317
(Brrrrp! Brrrrp! Brrrrp!)

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,514
(Click! Click! Click!)

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,718
Porridge today, Gromit! Tuesday.

7
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,615
Geronimo!

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,069
Aah-ow!

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,709
Oh!

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,075
(Splurge!)

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,915
Huh?

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,313
Huh? Oh!

13
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,629
Oh! Ow!

14
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,199
Calm dow... Turn it off!

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,714
(Splat! Splat! Splat!)

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,712
Aah! Ooh!

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,996
(Splurge! Splurge! Splurge!)

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,355
Mmmmff! Mmmm!

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,035
(Ssshhhhloooop!)

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,630
Um... Mice, do you think?

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,109
(Creaking)

22
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,198
I think I'll make my own porridge.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,752
(Munching)

24
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,679
Well, I'll be...!

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,709
Have you been peckish
during the night?

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,951
Only someone's been at me cheese.

27
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,953
(Rustling)

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,355
(Snap!)

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,516
(Wallace) Well, I don't know.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,353
There's something
very fishy going on.

31
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,555
(Sniffs)

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,557
Huh?! Do you think we should
get the pest control people in?

33
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,637
(Phone rings)

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,990
Hello. Wallace and Gromit's
Wash'n'Go Window Cleaning Service.

35
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,036
May we be of assistance?

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,272
(Woman) 'Yes.
My windows need a jolly good clean.

37
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,114
'The wool shop in the High Street.
As soon as you can.'

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,792
On our way, madam!

39
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,512
(Boooiiiiingg!)

40
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,238
(Gasps)

41
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,878
Oh!

42
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,520
Need wool, don't you, lad?

43
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,435
Thank you for coming so quickly.

44
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,872
Oh, dear!

45
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,952
Oh, allow me. Please.

46
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,395
(Wallace) Oh, I'm sorry!

47
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,517
I'll soon have these cleared up.

48
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,878
It's no trouble.
Oh, how embarrassing.

49
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,758
This is Preston, my dog.

50
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,796
All right, pooch?

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,514
(Wallace) Won't take a minute.

52
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,119
Well... I...

53
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,236
What was it you wanted?

54
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,030
Ahem...

55
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,269
I...uh...

56
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,920
Mmm...

57
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,116
Ramsbottom, Wendolene Ramsbottom.

58
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,830
Oh, charming.
I'm Wallace...the windows.

59
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,589
Is this place yours?

60
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,389
Mmm, my father left it to me.

61
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,232
Along with his debts...

62
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,709
and a few other things.

63
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,793
- He was an inventor.
- Never!

64
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,758
Well, I do a bit of that myself.

65
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,996
Oh?

66
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,111
(Wallace) I see they still haven't
caught those sheep rustlers yet.

67
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,236
Still, you've got plenty of wool.

68
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,031
Your dog's waiting.

69
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,032
Aye, I'd better see to him.

70
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,078
The bounce has gone from his bungee.

71
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,471
Oh, they're spanking!
You've done a grand job.

72
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,279
Windows are our speciality.

73
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,832
(Front door opens)

74
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,753
(Wallace) Let's get that kettle on.

75
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,158
Good grief! What's all this?!

76
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,118
(Wallace) Burglars? Thieves?

77
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,156
(Clunk!)

78
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,310
Oh. What a mess!

79
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,837
(Wallace)
I've never seen anything like it.

80
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,675
Heavens above, Gromit! Look at this!

81
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,718
The little chap
must be really hungry.

82
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,669
Come over here, lad.
No need to be sheepish.

83
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,513
We'll have to get you cleaned up.

84
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,990
There. Nothing to fret over.

85
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,753
Just a quick shampoo.

86
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,709
We've tested this on Gromit,
haven't we, lad?

87
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,672
Right! Off we go, then.

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,915
Baa! Baa! Baa! Baa!

89
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,396
(Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!)

90
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,513
(Wallace) Oh, 'eck!

91
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,468
Baaaaaaaaaaa!

92
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,469
Ba-a-a-a!

93
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,950
Oh! Do something, Gromit!

94
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,598
(Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!)

95
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,759
Oh, it's too late now!

96
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,554
(Wallace) Oh!

97
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,076
Turn it off, Gromit! Oh! OH!

98
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,995
Oh! Oh, dear!

99
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,669
Oh, brilliant, Gromit!
Smashing, this!

100
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,194
A bit tight here and there.

101
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,952
(Muffled bleating)

102
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,952
Ba-a-a-a!

103
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,316
Ah, he looks OK to me.

104
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,109
We'll call him "shorn", eh?
Come on, Sean!

105
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,033
(Grate squeaks)

106
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,440
(Chomping)

107
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,756
Gromit? You know
we're doing the clock tomorrow?

108
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,231
(Splosh!)

109
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,916
Sorry, Gromit! That was a bit thick!

110
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,512
Back in a tick, Gromit.
Won't be long.

111
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,960
(Wallace) Just thought I'd pop in...

112
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,593
(Sean) Ba-a-a-a!

113
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,029
Tell me about windows.

114
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,112
Well, it's only temporary,
you understand.

115
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,077
Oh, really?

116
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,357
Oh, yes. I'm inventing, mostly.

117
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,919
Only...

118
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,560
What sort of inventions?

119
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,915
Well, sort of...

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,753
Daddy would love to have met you.

121
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,434
(Sighs) Poor Daddy.

122
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,192
(Squeaking)

123
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,672
Ba-a-a-a! Ba-a-a-a!

124
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,510
Of all the women I've met...

125
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,558
Not that there have been many,
you understand...

126
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,632
(Clunk!)

127
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,911
Ba-a-a-a!

128
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,635
What I'm trying to say,
in a manner of speaking, is...

129
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,833
Ba-a-a-a-a-a!

130
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,797
..of all the LADIES I've met.... Ooh!

131
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,993
(Wallace) Oh! Oo-ow!

132
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,758
Same time next week?

133
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,039
Ba-a-a-a!

134
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,473
Ba-a-a-a!

135
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,313
Ba-a-a-a!

136
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,432
Ba-a-a-a!

137
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,788
Ba-a-a-a! Ba-a-a-a!

138
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,397
Caught bang to rights you were.

139
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,268
You've really let us down
this time, lad.

140
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,874
- Hey, give over!
- (Doorbell rings)

141
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,556
Shoo! Shoo! Go on with you!

142
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,036
I'm sorry about this.

143
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,588
For what?

144
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,671
Nothing.

145
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,472
Just stay away from me, from my shop
and my silly, silly windows.

146
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,120
Well, I...

147
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,954
Forget me. I'm no good for you.

148
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,514
I'm so sorry about Gromit.

149
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,475
Bye...

150
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,549
(Twang!)

151
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,232
- Aaaaaah!
- Ba-a-a-a!

152
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,233
Ba-a-a-a!

153
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,595
Oh, Gromit...

154
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,999
Oh, Gromit!

155
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,875
Oh, Gromit!

156
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,269
(Thud!)

157
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,118
(Bbbbbzzzzzz!)

158
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,434
Ba-a-a-a!

159
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,599
Ba-a-a-a! Ba-a-a-a!

160
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,040
Brilliant teamwork, lads!

161
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,519
Ooow!

162
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,909
- Oh!
- Ba-a-a-a!!

163
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,315
(Wallace) I suppose you'll have to
skip the country now.

164
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,277
A fugitive, eh?

165
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,434
You'll be hunted down like...
well, a dog.

166
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,835
Wendo...!

167
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,951
(Whistle)

168
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,116
Grrrr!

169
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,555
Stop it. Stop it, Preston!

170
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,310
Oh! Oh!
I want no more of this rustling!

171
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,428
It wasn't so bad when it was
just the wool, but this is evil!

172
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,398
Daddy didn't create you for this!

173
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,438
You're supposed to protect me!

174
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,990
Let me out!
You won't turn ME into dog meat!

175
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,832
Dog meat?!

176
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,755
- Help!
- Don't worry, Wendolene!

177
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,556
I'm on my way!

178
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,516
We've lost them!

179
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,635
Aah!

180
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,431
(Horn blares)

181
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,434
We're at maximum speed!

182
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,949
(Wallace) She won't go any faster!

183
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,551
Oh, 'eck!

184
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,354
(Wendolene) Wallace, help me!

185
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,197
Don't worry, Wendolene!
Everything's under control.

186
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,079
Ooowwww!

187
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,959
Ba-a-a-a!

188
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,713
(Wendolene) Be careful, Sean!

189
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,954
(Wallace) Hey, steady on!
Single file! Oh!

190
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,358
Single file, I said!

191
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,754
Get yourselves organised down there!

192
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,189
Huh?!

193
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,950
Watch out, lads!

194
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,512
Oh, no! Aah!

195
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,114
(Splat!)

196
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,872
Where did you get that from?

197
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,909
That's MY machine!
I've got patent pending on that!

198
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,036
(Wallace and Wendolene) Ooh! Oh!

199
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:43,354
- (Wendolene) Help! Oh, Sean! Help!
- (Wallace) Where's Gromit?!

200
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,951
Sean, do something!

201
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,951
(Wendolene) Help!

202
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,435
Attaboy, Gromit!

203
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,793
(Clunk! Clank!)

204
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,511
Well done, Gromit! That'll teach him!

205
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,672
(Thud! Thud! Thud!)

206
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,990
- He's malfunctioning!
- Mal-what?

207
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,914
Malfunctioning.
Preston is a cyber-dog!

208
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,356
- Cyber-what?
- A robot!

209
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,119
Daddy created him for good,
but...he's turned out evil!

210
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,874
Grrraaaarrrr!

211
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,757
Aaaaaaahhh!

212
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,393
Huh?!

213
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,914
Ah! It's a sheep-mincing thing!

214
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,753
Now THAT'S clever!

215
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,795
(Whistle)

216
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,272
Raaaaaarrrr!

217
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,838
Do something, Wallace!

218
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,434
Aaah! Whooaa!

219
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,354
Ba-a-a-a!

220
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,589
Duck!

221
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,795
Where?

222
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,275
(Boing!)

223
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,396
- Whooooaaa!
- Ba-a-a-a!

224
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,149
Ba-a-a-a!

225
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,309
By 'eck! I thought
we were all for the can then!

226
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,112
I couldn't pass by
without saying thank you.

227
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,117
He's just like he used to be.

228
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,589
(Wallace) Oh, don't mention it.

229
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,148
Thanks, pooch.

230
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,357
Give me a shout
if he goes wrong again.

231
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,908
You're very kind.

232
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,515
Come in. We were just about
to have some cheese.

233
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,594
Oh, no! Not cheese.
Sorry. It brings me out in a rash.

234
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,716
Can't stand the stuff.

235
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,313
(Gulps) Not even Wensleydale?

236
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,233
Got to be on our way.

237
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,518
Come on, Preston.

238
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,269
Goodbye...

239
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,828
..chuck.

240
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,998
What's wrong with Wensleydale?

241
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,438
Talking of which...

242
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,277
All the more for us
and not a sheep to worry us!

243
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,475
Get off me cheese! Get off! Get off!

244
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,950
Gromit! Gromit! Go for him!

245
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,952
Gromit! Oh!

246
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,153
Get off with you! Oh!

247
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,994
- Ba-a-a-a!
- Shoo off!
