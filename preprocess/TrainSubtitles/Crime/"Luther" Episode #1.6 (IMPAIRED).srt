he tends to make it look like

But this scene is
consistent with the thesis.

And to stage such a scene correctly

would require a very chilly heart.

themselves about three things.

They view themselves
in implausibly positive ways,

they think they have
far more control over their lives

than they actually do,

244

and they believe the future will be

better than the evidence

(GRUNTING) No!

483
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,721
- (GRUNTING)
- Mark!

484
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,280
Hey! Mark, listen to me.

485
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,045
Listen to me!

486
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,120
(PANTING)

487
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,685
I didn't do it.

488
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,646
It wasn't me.

489
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,089
Luther set the meet, here.

490
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,605
For what? A chat?

491
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,682
- Apparently.
- No, he's lying.

492
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,571
Of course he's lying, but why?

493
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,210
All you need to do is
be there at 9:00 a.m.

494
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,005
They'll be leaving, they'll ask you to
wait until they return.

495
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,527
- You'll be alone.
- So I do what you say and then what?

496
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,331
And then you say you want to leave.
They can't stop you.

497
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,765
Then you come back to me.

498
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,808
You're putting Reed
at very considerable risk.

499
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,008
I'm mindful of that, sir.
But he's right.

500
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,763
This is the best way
to bring Luther in without bloodshed.

501
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,367
And Reed?

502
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,201
Reed will be elsewhere.

503
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,761
CO-19?

504
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,285
Kitted and ready to go.

505
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,364
And if circumstances warrant,

506
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,761
you won't hesitate
to give the kill order?

507
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,005
Absolutely not.

508
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,121
(EXHALES)

509
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,487
Okay, okay.

510
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,041
(EXHALES)

511
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,811
You're not coming?

512
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,887
This doesn't fall within my compass,
for which I'm grateful.

513
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,449
I've no desire to see what happens next.

514
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,689
You know, you don't have to be there.

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,126
I do.

516
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,525
We ready?

517
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,645
I need to speak to you.

518
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,963
Okay, of course. It's just that
we have a live situation right now.

519
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,769
That's all right. I can wait.

520
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,007
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

521
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,411
I'll look after Mr North.

522
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,527
There's really no need. I can wait.

523
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,762
Nonsense. I'll keep you company
until the others return.

524
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,410
Mr North, if I may?

525
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,926
This isn't going to work
if you can't control your temper.

526
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,889
It's a weakness. He'll use it.

527
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,283
- I can control it.
- Well, you'd better.

528
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,050
'Cause if I understand correctly, police
marksmen don't shoot to wound.

529
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,485
No. They shoot to stop.

530
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,131
Go for the centre of mass.

531
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,725
Here. The heart.

532
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,685
How apropos.

533
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,928
(INDISTINCT SPEECH ON POLICE RADIO)

534
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,048
There he is, by the stairs.

535
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,725
- Sergeant?
- We've got a clear shot and good to go.

536
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,926
On my order. Not before.

537
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,365
Received and understood.

538
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,129
What do you want me to do?

539
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,765
Kill you?

540
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,891
Forgive you?

541
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,606
I don't understand
how you could believe I did this.

542
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,126
(SCOFFS)

543
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
You've changed your tune
since the last time we spoke, Ian.

544
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,641
No, John.

545
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,404
I believe you did it, Ian,
because you did it!

546
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,762
If you really believe that, deep down,

547
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,091
then why did you steal the gun?

548
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,321
JOHN: <i>The gun.</i>

549
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,643
<i>Yeah, you did a decent job with that.</i>

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,486
But it's gone now.

551
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
And so is the only piece of hard
evidence they've got against me.

552
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,165
So whatever you're trying to do...

553
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,925
Whatever you're trying to do
to save yourself, it's over.

554
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,681
It's done.

555
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,807
You're not answering my question.

556
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,961
I think I am!

557
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,041
IAN: <i>But if you didn't do it,</i>

558
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,885
<i>how could there be
any hard evidence against you?</i>

559
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,691
<i>- How's that possible?
- What are you trying to say?</i>

560
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,563
I've spoken to the doctors, John.

561
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,003
And what's happening to you
is called a dissociative state.

562
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,130
It's the mind distancing itself

563
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,567
from things that are
too much for it to process.

564
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,564
You're blaming me because you can't
bear to confront what you've done.

565
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,889
You're in pain, you're distressed.

566
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,804
You need help. So come home. All right?

567
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,881
Let us help you.

(LAUGHS)

569
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,601
Thing is, Ian,
you didn't come alone, did you?

570
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,646
Wouldn't have the balls.

571
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,921
No, you came with CO-19, who, right now,

572
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,924
have their assault rifles
trained on my centre of mass.

573
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,408
And we do not shoot to stop.

574
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,323
Not in our game, no. We shoot to kill!

575
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,731
Ain't that right, fellas?

576
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,086
- Sergeant?
- Still clear and good to go.

577
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,406
Ain't that right, boss?

578
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
You got the centre of mass, right here.

579
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,208
'Cause that's what
we're here for, isn't it?

580
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,807
You prod me, you wind me up,

581
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,241
I lose it, I threaten your life.

582
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,209
And then you have
a legal reason to shoot me.

583
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,926
Bang, bang, bang. There goes your
problems, all out of the window.

John, John, listen to me. You're ill.

586
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,644
(LAUGHS) And you're sick!

587
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,686
I wonder,

588
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,604
are you even interested
in why I've come here

589
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,841
if I knew what you was up to?

590
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,721
I don't know. Maybe you wanted to
get something off your chest.

591
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,688
About something you did
to Henry Madsen, maybe?

I've got nothing to confess.</i>

593
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,641
Henry Madsen fell. And you know
how hard I tried to save him.

594
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,051
I know how hard you tried.

595
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,806
No, I...

596
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,444
I came out here...

597
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,603
Still clear, still clear.

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,164

the locker rooms.

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,485
What's he saying?

600
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,210
...where you're keeping the diamonds.

601
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,611
Or where you were,
up until about five minutes ago.

- Ian, you do me a favour.
- What?

00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,090
Don't say her name.

Not any more.
No more. All right? It's over.

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,844
What can I do to prove it? just tell me.

Tell me, tell me what I can do.

I could listen to this.

To my face! Even now!

614

Just say what you did.

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,200
Do you know what you've done?

640
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,169
- Yes, I do, ma'am.
- Don't "ma'am" me.

641
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,326
Badge!

642
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,131
Arrest this man.

643
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,850
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

644
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,565
- Come on!
- Ah!

645
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,081
(GRUNTING)

646
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400
Come on!

647
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,244
- Ah!
- How'd it go?

648
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,570
I got what I wanted.

649
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,969
And how close did you come
to getting shot for it?

650
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,446
I didn't get shot.

651
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,965
Fine. Your funeral.

652
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,051
That dick!

653
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,724
- Let it go.
- Would you?

654
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,044
"Run, John". What was he thinking?

655
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,724
He thought he was being John's friend

656
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,644
and it's already cost him everything.
So let it go.

657
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,890
What, you suspended him?

658
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,564
And charged him as an accessory.

659
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,485
Ripley's finished.

660
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,041
Yeah, that's what being John's
friend does for you in the end.

661
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,368
We all paid a price for it.
Come on, let's get back.

662
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,205
Just, um.

663
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,563
Once more, if I may.

664
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,243
Um, Luther came to see you,

665
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,090
- uh, he was distressed...
- He was greatly distressed, yeah.

666
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,166
It feels unseemly to keep probing this,

667
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,764
such a raw wound, so soon.

668
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,451
I must ask what he said.

669
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,130
He said he didn't do it.

670
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,523
Well, I suppose all things are possible,

671
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,965
although not equally.

672
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,486
Is this going to take much longer?

673
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,051
No, I, uh,

674
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,248
think I've got everything
I want from you.

675
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,166
If I could just ask you
to wait a little bit longer.

676
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,406
The insight you've given
into his mental state,

677
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,569
- it may be of value...
- Can I please use the bathroom?

678
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,125
Of course.

679
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,210
(INDISTINCT)

680
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,970
All right. Get on with it.

681
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,326
Ian?

682
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,807
Thank you.

683
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,130
I'm sorry the... Um, um, bathroom?

684
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,850
- I was...
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

685
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,164
Yeah, it's out there, on the right.

686
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,006
The, um, flush is broken
on the cubicle nearest the wall.

687
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,320
You might want to watch that.

688
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,084
I will, thank you.

689
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,725
Listen, uh,

690
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,131
I'm sorry

691
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,082
for your loss. She was very special.

692
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,243
That's very kind. She was.

693
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,970
OFFICER: Excuse me.

694
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,482
I, uh, I need to be away from here.

695
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,288
Oh, yes, possibly that's the best thing.

696
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,121
We could arrange an escort,
a protective detail.

697
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,567
I don't think Luther will be back.

698
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,963
Even so, I, uh,
I hope you're not on your own.

699
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,721
It isn't healthy.

700
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,883
Yeah, I, uh, I have somewhere to go.

701
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,086
As you wish.

702
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,210
Come on. Come on.

703
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,722
It's Mark. I'm on my way.

704
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,241
All right.

705
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,642
Hi, this is DCI Reed.
Can you do me a favour?

706
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,929
Uh, can you run me a trace and track?

707
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,048
Okay, it's Mark North.

708

<i>John! Run! Run!</i>

713
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,971
How long did you want to
become a police officer, Justin?

714
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,041
Since I can remember.

715
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,480
And why?

716
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,369
Why a police officer?

717
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,846
What does it matter?

718
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,325
Big family?

719
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,331
- Yeah, pretty big.
- They're proud of you?

720
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,041
Yes.

721
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,208
Family's important to you, isn't it?

722
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,926
Family,

723
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,687
loyalty, trust.

724
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,446
And rules are important, too.

725
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,883
- Aren't they?
- Yes.

726
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,086
Yes!

727
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,690
So why throw it all away for nothing?

728
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,211
You're not a fool.

729
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,891
What have you got to lose?

730
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,371
Your pride, your self-respect?

731
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,485
Your job?

732
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,049

- What is it, Martin?

You corrupt everything around you.

For what? For greed?

752
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,610
Because you were scared?

753
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,727
Well, now, look.

00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,040

I do.

759
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,011
I wish I hadn't.
I didn't go there meaning to.

760
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,571
But I did.

just do what you got to do.

All right, just commit.

00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,884
Come on! just get it over with.

765
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,402
It'll be a relief. I'm sick of this.

766
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,446
I know.

767
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,328
I didn't come to kill you, Ian.

stealing the diamonds,
that was all a play?

(LAUGHS)

774
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,045
You set me up for a confession?

775
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,121
Pretty much.

776
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,406
If I was you, I'd have killed me.

No.

- Why not?
- Because I choose not to.

783

Did she ever tell you
about her and me? Zoe?

Oh, no, she didn't.
Of course she didn't. I knew that.

What do you mean?

786
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,050
It started one night...

787
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,087
You'd stayed away working
once too often.

788
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,290
That's not going to work, Ian.

789
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,930
She cried afterwards.

790
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,411
Yeah, washed the sheets.

791
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,769
That's one of the memories
I've got of her, crying,

792
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,922
naked, stuffing the sheets
into a machine.

793

Calling me an arsehole, a bastard.

794
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,888
Still made me do it again before I left.

795
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,166
It's not going to work.

796
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,844
She told me I taught her
how to really come.

797
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,405
You know, Ian, you can't play me.

798
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,049
You can't make me shoot you.

799
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,610
You can't choose...

800
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,280
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I can't play you!

You're John Luther!

Come on, John,

00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,809
after a marriage that long,
that unhappy, with a woman that needy?

804
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,285
Oh, there must have been quite a few.

805
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,209
Maybe you knew
about some of them deep down.

806
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,685
But you know what?

807
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,842
- I think I was her favourite.
- No more, Ian!

808
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,251
Because I was her revenge.

809
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,125
Every orgasm she took from me
was to pay you back.

Yeah.

He swore he wasn't going to kill you.

835
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,930
He thought the humiliation
of prison would be worse.

The beatings, the rapes,

the incessant fear for your life,
but I told him,

"No, John, you're wrong.

No! Alice!

Well, I'm in favour.

You're a liar.
