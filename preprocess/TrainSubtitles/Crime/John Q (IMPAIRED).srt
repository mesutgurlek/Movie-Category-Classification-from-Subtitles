in 15 minutes.

164
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:40,238
We're going to be late.

165
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,911
psst. Psst.

166
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,399
Whoo! Knock it out, baby!
Knock it out!

167
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:08,368
Come on! To the fence!
To the fence!

168
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,771
Come on, Tommy!

169
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,707
Come on, Tommy!

170
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,743
Whoo! Come on.

171
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,211
Ball four!

172
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,249
All right, Tommy!
Whoo! Whoo!

173
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,450
JOHN: Let's go, Mikey!

174
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,285
Let's go, Mikey,
let's go, baby.

175
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,590
Let's go, son.
Okay. All right.

176
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:31,326
Knock it out!
Knock it out!

177
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,494
JOHN: Keep your head
down on the ball, son.

178
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:35,831
DENISE: Knock it out
for your mama, baby.

179
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,499
Come on, Mikey.
Come on, Mikey.

180
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,768
Come on, Mikey.

181
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,302
JOHN:
Sometime today, pitcher.

182
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,571
GINA: Come on, Mikey!

183
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,572
Strike!

184
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,574
Strike? What?
Are you blind?

185
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,577
Keep your head
down on the ball!

186
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,579
I hate this pitcher.
How old is he?

187
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,282
Twelve.
Twelve, my ass.

188
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,752
His beard grew an inch
between pitches.

189
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,086
Let's go, Mikey!

190
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:59,655
Put your elbow up, son.
Elbow up.

191
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,690
Go! Go, baby! Go!

192
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,760
DENISE:
There you go, baby!

193
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:04,827
Safe!

194
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,696
Tie goes to the runner.

195
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,968
Go! Go!

196
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,602
Run! Run! Run! Run!

197
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,140
DENISE: Keep it going.
Let's go!

198
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:20,010
BOY: Second base!
Second base!

199
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,813
Second base!

200
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,984
Mike!

201
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,156
Mike.
Mikey!

202
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:33,958
Michael? Michael?
Mikey, baby.

203
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,860
Somebody call
an ambulance!

204
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,561
Mikey. Mikey.

205
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,663
Michael.

206
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,965
JIMMY: Somebody call
a frigging ambulance!

207
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,170
JOHN:
Get the door!

208
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,871
GINA: Get the door,
Jimmy.

209
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,706
JIMMY:
Come on, let's go!

210
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,275
I got it.

211
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,443
Take him, baby.

212
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,313
Give him to me.
Mikey, Mikey.

213
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,782
Come on, baby, it's mama.
Come on, Mikey.

214
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,985
We got to get
out of here. Mikey! Go!

215
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,051
DENISE: Help us!

216
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,219
Help!
Please, somebody.

217
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:33,419
Calm down.

218
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:34,921
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

219
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,124
All right,
come with me.

220
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,094
He was just playing baseball,
running to second base.

221
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,795
I don't know
what happened.

222
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,431
I need a doctor
right away, please!

223
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,466
JOHN: No. Jesus.

224
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,134
DENISE: Mikey?
What happened?

225
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,802
He collapsed
playing baseball.

226
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,872
Let's get him
on some oxygen.

227
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,474
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

228
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,409
Anything like this
ever happen before?

229
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,443
No, ma'am.

230
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,113
Any allergies?

231
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,048
Nothing. Nothing!

232
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,449
Allergies
to medication?

233
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:02,784
No, he's fine.

234
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,987
His liver's enlarged.
Flip him.

235
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,721
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

236
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,925
Pulse is 150, pulse Ox 78%.
B.P. 68 over 34.

237
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,260
What is the matter
with him?

238
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,328
Would you come with me?

239
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,997
There are procedures
we need to go over.

240
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:15,998
What procedures?

241
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:17,299
We're admitting your son.

242
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,835
You need to fill out
the proper forms.

243
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,504
Your son may need
a transfusion.

244
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,672
We'll need to test you both
for blood type.

245
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,808
Mikey, we're coming
right back, baby.

246
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:28,077
Wait a minute!

247
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,845
WOMAN:
First name, Mr. Archibald.

248
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,381
Uh, John.

249
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,815
Middle initial?

250
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:34,317
Q. Quincy.

251
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:35,919
Name of your
insurance company?

252
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,453
JIMMY: John!

253
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,854
Where is he?
Is he okay?

254
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,790
We don't know yet.
They're running tests.

255
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,626
We're waiting
to find the results.

256
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,228
Anything we can do?

257
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,762
Your card,
Mr. Archibald.

258
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,298
Mikey's hat.
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:48,632
Your insurance card.

260
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,701
I'll need to make a copy
for our files.

261
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,876
It's okay.
You can go in now.

262
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,542
Hey, sweetheart.

263
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,248
How you doing, slugger?

264
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:41,787
(WHISPERING)
I can't talk.

265
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,622
Don't worry about it.
Get your rest.

266
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,258
We're going to be
out of here in a while.

267
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,695
Okay.

268
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,331
We love you, son.

269
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,567
I love you, too.

270
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:58,872
What is all this?

271
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,842
This? This is so we can
monitor Mike's vitals.

272
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,612
Respiratory rate,
pulse oximetry, heart rate.

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,084
And this one is blood pressure--
diastolic and systolic.

274
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:13,120
We'd like this top number
to stay above 90.

275
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,655
If his blood pressure drops,

276
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:15,790
we're going to have to
do something.

277
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,925
We can't have him going
below 70 again.

278
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:22,262
Why? What would that mean,
if he went below 70 again?

279
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,733
70 and below,
he's in heart failure.

280
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,704
Okay.

281
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,106
If you need anything.

282
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,273
Thank you.

283
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:40,582
WOMAN:
How's the company insurance?

284
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,250
He works part time.

285
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,686
She works
as a grocery store clerk.

286
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,087
Can we do anything?

287
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:48,189
I got to go.

288
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,725
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

289
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,495
Hello, I'm Rebecca Payne,
hospital director.

290
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:54,330
Hi, there.
It's nice to meet you.

291
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,465
This is Dr. Turner,
the head of cardiology

292
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,600
and Michael's doctor.

293
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:58,601
Oh. Okay.

294
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:59,769
How do you do?

295
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,270
Good. My wife.
Hello.

296
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:02,805
How's our boy doing?

297
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,675
Please sit down.

298
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,695
Okay.

299
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,868
This X-ray shows a normal
nine-year-old's heart.

300
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:35,173
This X-ray is that
of your son Michael.

301
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,145
There are septal defects
here, here, and here

302
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,982
which have induced myopathy,
resulting pulmonary edema,

303
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,817
and malignant
ventricular ectopy.

304
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,319
As you can see,
Michael's heart is approximately

305
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,488
three times larger
than normal size.

306
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,058
I'm sorry. Uh...

307
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,060
I didn't understand
what you said.

308
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,063
Could you put that
in layman terms for me?

309
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,598
Basically,
there's not enough blood

310
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,701
being pumped
by Michael's heart,

311
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:06,739
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet.

312
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,242
His heart is trying,
but it's working too hard.

313
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,012
What, does he need
an operation, or...

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,716
Well, we're considerably
beyond corrective surgery,

315
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:19,419
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

316
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,387
Mike's heart is useless.

317
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,290
He's going to need a transplant
or he's going to die.

318
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:29,395
Wait a second.
There are other options.

319
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,464
What options?

320
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,933
To do nothing.

321
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:36,369
Medicate him. Make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

322
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,905
Start thinking
about quality of life now.

323
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:40,708
DENISE:
I don't understand.

324
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:45,446
We were just with him,
and he seemed fine.

325
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:48,449
He's going to seem fine,
but as his heart gets worse,

326
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,484
he will become
increasingly fatigued,

327
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:53,487
and he will sleep
more and more,

328
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:56,357
until one day
he will fall asleep,

329
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:59,961
and he won't wake up.

330
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,132
I know this is difficult,
but you have to face the fact

331
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,301
that your son
may not live much longer.

332
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,905
You might want to make it
a happy time, say good-bye.

333
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,574
God.

334
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,009
Transplantation
is high-risk.

335
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:16,578
You could lose your son
on that table.

336
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,048
You might not want
to take that chance.

337
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,288
If you, you know, if he
doesn't have the surgery...

338
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,396
If he doesn't have the surgery,
how long would he live?

339
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:36,966
Not long.
Months, weeks.

340
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,668
Days.

341
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,372
Come on. All right.
All right. All right.

342
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,141
Come on, now.

343
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,220
(WHISPERS)
I'm sorry. This--

344
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,355
this is a lot.

345
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,708
All right. Uh...

346
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,177
Okay.

347
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,312
If he was your son,
what would you do?

348
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,984
I'd do the transplant,
absolutely.

349
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,288
Okay. Okay?

350
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:34,493
Okay, let's do that.
Let's do it.

351
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,895
TURNER: Yes?
Yes.

352
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:39,132
Okay, first thing we've got
to do is get Mike's name

353
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,867
on the organ recipient list.

354
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:44,137
He's b-positive, so his name
should go right to the top.

355
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,271
It's not so simple.

356
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,939
There are
other considerations

357
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,876
before a prospective recipient
can be placed on a donor list.

358
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,545
Transplant surgery
is very expensive.

359
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,748
In most cases,
prohibitively so.

360
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,085
Oh, we got insurance,
major medical. He's covered.

361
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,020
We've already checked
with your carrier.

362
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,955
There are no provisions
in your policy

363
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,791
for a procedure
of this magnitude.

364
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:06,226
Oh, no, no, no,
that's a mistake.

365
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,295
Not that you're making
a mistake.

366
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,798
I'm just saying
that I'm insured.

367
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:12,500
My son's covered.

368
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,203
Mrs. Archibald,
do you have coverage?

369
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,371
No. I've only been
at the supermarket

370
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:20,041
a couple months, and you
don't get benefits until--

371
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,043
doesn't matter.
We got insurance.

372
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,648
Okay, I can see here that
you don't own your home.

373
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:30,451
You have no stocks,
no bonds, no investments.

374
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,921
You have a little over $1,000
in savings.

375
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,122
But we got insurance.

376
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:36,058
That may be.
Check with your carrier.

377
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,726
In the meantime,

378
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:40,395
we're going to have to
treat this as a cash account.

379
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:41,463
What?

380
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:43,465
How much
does a transplant cost?

381
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,468
Let me take care--
how much does it cost?

382
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,871
Transplant surgery,
doctors' fees,

383
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:51,006
postoperative care,
immunosuppressant drugs--

384
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,143
you're looking
at a minimum of $250,000.

385
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,277
Wow.

386
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:57,347
If you opt
for transplant surgery,

387
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:58,882
that is your choice,

388
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,384
but the hospital maintains
a very strict policy

389
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:03,186
with regard
to cash patients.

390
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,555
We require a down payment

391
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:08,158
before we put a patient's name
on a receivers' list.

392
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,593
How much?

393
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:14,164
30%--$75,000.

394
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:16,399
$75,000...

395
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,504
To put my son's name
on a list.

396
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:23,640
Our son is dying, and all you
can do is talk about money?

397
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,943
It costs money
to provide health care.

398
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:29,513
It's expensive for you,
it's expensive for us.

399
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,883
I'm sorry. You're going to
have to guarantee payment

400
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,285
before I can put
your son's name on the list.

401
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:39,724
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald,
please wait!

402
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,061
If you people don't want
to treat our son,

403
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:45,264
we'll take him
over to county memorial.

404
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,698
You don't want to do that.

405
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,200
They have to treat him.

406
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:50,668
No. Heart transplantation
is always considered

407
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:52,170
an elective procedure.

408
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:53,705
You're
in the right place.

409
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,640
What are we
supposed to do?

410
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,575
Talk to your
insurance company again.

411
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,511
Check with our
human resources department

412
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:00,712
for medical assistance.

413
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,881
There's money there.

414
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:04,083
There's children's
state services and medicaid.

415
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,085
You find a way
to keep him here.

416
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,788
You just don't take no
for an answer.

417
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:13,626
Your policy has changed,
Mr. Archibald.

418
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,329
Changed to what?

419
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,331
Yeah, we've recently
switched carriers

420
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,699
from a PPO to an HMO.

421
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,402
It's a less expensive
policy,

422
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:25,339
but unfortunately,
there are some restrictions.

423
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,007
What kind of restrictions?

424
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:29,243
Here's how it works.

425
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,946
Non-management part-time
employees such as yourself

426
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:35,082
only qualify for second-tier
catastrophic coverage.

427
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,551
No, no, I'm not part time,
I'm full time.

428
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,186
It's just slow right now.

429
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:42,656
Sure, but your coverage
is based on hours worked,

430
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:45,526
and like I said, you only
qualify for second tier,

431
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,763
and that has a maximum
payout limit of $20,000.

432
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,665
What?

433
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,536
You have been taking money
out of my check every week.

434
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:58,406
I've been paying into
this policy for years.

435
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:01,276
That's why we're going to
cover you for the full $20,000.

436
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:05,413
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, come on.

437
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:06,915
Let me get this straight.

438
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:10,953
You have dropped me
from full time to part time.

439
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:12,421
<i>You switched carriers.</i>

440
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:14,590
Now you're telling me
I'm not fully covered

441
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:18,194
even though I got a policy
that says I am?

442
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,196
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

443
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,631
No, it doesn't.
My son is very sick.

444
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,201
If I'm not covered,
I got a serious problem.

445
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:28,571
I understand that,
but there's nothing I can do.

446
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,474
Look, you can file
an appeal.

447
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,541
Yeah?

448
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:33,043
Here you go.

449
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,712
That takes about seven
working days.

450
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:53,131
WOMAN: Says here you already
have medical insurance.

451
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:54,265
JOHN: Not enough.

452
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,401
What little we have
is already used up.

453
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,936
You on welfare?
No.

454
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,272
You should be on welfare.

455
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,174
Welfare?
We both have jobs.

456
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:04,842
That's too bad.

457
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,045
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

458
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,913
Try county medical.

459
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,583
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak
to somebody in financial aid.

460
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,154
No, I don't want to hold.

461
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,822
I've been holding 15 minutes.
I don't want to hold.

462
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,093
(SHOUTING)

463
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:23,095
What? Should I get
another job?

464
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,196
I'm not yelling.

465
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:26,798
Yes, you're yelling
in here!

466
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,275
MAN: Next, please.

467
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:42,282
Oh, wrong line.
Window 15.

468
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,783
What?

469
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,151
Window 15.

470
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,438
no.

471
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:05,439
No what?

472
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,141
No, you don't qualify.

473
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,642
My son is dying,
I'm broke.

474
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,578
If I don't qualify,
who the hell does?

475
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,246
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:14,681
I don't need you to be sorry!
I need you to help me!

477
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,512
no, no, no,
this is an appeal.

478
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,947
An appeal is for
an already existing claim.

479
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,383
What you needed to file
was a grievance.

480
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,118
You filed
the wrong paperwork.

481
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:51,354
You're going to

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,697
Okay.
Thanks.

802
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:27,065
What do we got?

803
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,567
Gunshot wound
to the belly.

804
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,068
DR. KLEIN:
Anything from the EMTS?

805
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,737
No. Dr. Turner,
we're going to need your hand.

806
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,640
I just bought this suit.

807
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,509
Can you give me a hand?

808
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:39,245
On three,
two, one, lift.

809
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:41,847
Thank you.

810
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:44,183
Oh, no, I can't handle this.
This is a gut shot.

811
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,552
I'm a cardiac surgeon, not an
emergency room physician.

812
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,554
It's like
riding a bike, doctor.

813
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:50,389
Just pretend
you're getting paid.

814
00:43:50,457 --> 00:43:52,592
No, this is apples
and oranges. I can't.

815
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:54,160
The man is dying.
Help him.

816
00:43:54,228 --> 00:43:56,530
I haven't done this--
do it!

817
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:01,268
75 milligrams demerol I.V.,
Lidocaine 2% local.

818
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:02,536
I'll scrub now.

819
00:44:02,604 --> 00:44:04,538
DR. KLEIN: I'm putting him
to sleep.

820
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:07,274
When I get out of here,
I'm suing your security company.

821
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:09,610
What makes you sure
you're getting out at all?

You've got to stand
behind the line, sir.

Move this out of here for me,
please? Thank you very much.

828
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:47,582
Lieutenant,
we got a real problem here.

829
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,552
This guy's in for the long
haul--locked down the E.R.,

830
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,954
barricaded himself in,
killed power in the elevators.

831
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,723
We can bust down the door,

832
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,192
but this son of a bitch
might start killing people.

833
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,761
There's two pinpoint cameras
hidden in the E.R.

The hospital's
own surveillance.

Are you in charge
of security?

837
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,537
No. Wally Pitoniak.
It's his day off.

838
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,873
Not anymore, it ain't.
Get him down here.

839
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,911
All right, can you get me
a secure line?

840
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,013
Lieutenant, we've got
one of our guys inside.

841
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,649
He's got a walkie-talkie.
You might want to try this.

842
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,618
Put a clamp on all phone lines
to the emergency room.

843
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,722
If this guy picks up the phone,
I want him talking to me, okay?

844
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,024
Done.

845
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,659
Now, who's in charge here?

846
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,862

It's her day off, too.

work at this hospital?

going to take her?

858
00:45:58,023 --> 00:45:58,990
Good. Go.

00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:00,358
Come on, baby.

Excuse me.

00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,772
I think my fianc e
might have broken her arm.

866
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,509
I was wondering if we could
get somebody to look at her.

867
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:18,077
Yeah, sure.
What happened?

868
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:19,778
A drunk
ran a red light--

869
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:22,081
ran a red light.
He slammed into us. Right?

870
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,049
Yep. It was
an accident.

871

00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:57,252
That's right.

Q.

887
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:08,929
All right, John Q.

888
00:47:08,997 --> 00:47:12,468
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,
but I want you to call me Frank.

Can you do that?

890
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,404
Sure, Frank.

891
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:17,105
I'll be
the hostage negotiator.

892
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:19,908
I've been a cop 35 years.
This is all I do.

893
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:22,010
I don't play games.
I don't fool around.

894
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:25,181
If I say something,
you can take it to the bank.

895
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:26,915
Let's get down to it.

896
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:29,485
Is anybody hurt?

897
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:31,687
It's an emergency room.
Everybody's hurt.

898
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:33,021
Oh, right.

899
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,658
They're fine.
Good.

900
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:38,161
As long as it stays that way,
we can keep talking.

901
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:39,696
What is it you want?

902
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:42,098
You find Rebecca Payne,

administrative supervisor.

904
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,835
You find her.

905
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:49,105
Tell her I want my kid's name
on the donors' list.

906
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:52,175
You got that? My kid's name
on the donors' list.

907
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:53,643
Kid boy or girl?

908
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:54,944
A boy.

909
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:59,483
I got two boys myself, John.
Two girls and two boys.

910
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:02,152
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't handle me, Frank.

911
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,821
I don't want to be handled.

912
00:48:03,888 --> 00:48:06,156
It insults my intelligence
as a human being!

913
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:09,527
Take it easy. The idea
is not to get too excited.

914
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,363
I'm going to take it any way
I can get it, understand?

915
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,332
If I don't get it,
there's going to be

916
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,601
some dead bodies
on your hands in there.

917
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:18,169
You understand me?

918
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:20,004
I hear you loud and clear.

919
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:22,241
I'm going to jot that down.
Rebecca Payne, right?

920
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:23,975
All right.

921
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:27,846
Now, there's a lot of cops
out here, John.

922
00:48:27,913 --> 00:48:30,515
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

923
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,251
Yeah, I'm sure.

924
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:34,753
All right, sit tight.

925
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,655
You're in a tough spot,
John, a lot of trouble,

926
00:48:36,723 --> 00:48:39,325
but if you work with me,
if you're reasonable,

927
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:41,527
we'll figure a way
out of this, okay?

928
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:43,763
We have to have a little faith
in one another.

929
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,365
Why is that, Frank?

930
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:46,899
Why?

931
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,901
Because that's what faith's
all about--

932
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,672
believing when you don't want
to believe.

933
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,308
Besides, what else
are you going to do?

934
00:48:57,678 --> 00:48:59,679
MIRIAM:
I want my epidural.

935
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:01,214
Something for the pain.

936
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:04,351
Out!
She'll be fine.

937
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,887

939
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,864
Yeah. Yeah.

940
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:20,267
Just kind of nervous.
You know how it is.

941
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,702
Yeah, I was, too.

942
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,205
What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

943
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:28,242
Doesn't matter to me, man,
as long as my kid's healthy.

944
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:29,844
That's all I want.

945
00:49:33,816 --> 00:49:36,384
Listen, I didn't mean
anything by that, man.

946
00:49:44,294 --> 00:49:47,963
Who was driving?
The car--who was driving?

947
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,100
I was. What's that
got to do with anything?

948
00:49:52,168 --> 00:49:55,270
Why is your girl
all banged up and you're not?

949
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:59,442
What do you call this?
Ha ha.

950
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:01,510
What are you laughing at?

951
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,446
Somebody get this fool
a band-aid.

952
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,314
I don't want you
to bleed to death.

953
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:09,319
Ha ha. Screw you, man.
That shit hurts.

954
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:11,621
His air bag went off
and mine didn't.

955
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,923
What kind of car
you drive?

956
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,258
Mercedes 500.

957
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,627
You drive a Mercedes 500?

958
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,128
What year?

959
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:22,198
1986. It's a classic.

960
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:24,067
Mercedes didn't make

961
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:27,303
passenger-side air bags
till 1988.

962
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:30,775
(CHUCKLES) Busted.

963
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,042
What's your point,
John?

964
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,944
What's yours, Mitch?

965
00:50:34,012 --> 00:50:35,646
You from
the slap-a-ho tribe.

966
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:37,715
You like to beat
on that young lady,

967
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,550
and everybody here
knows it.

968
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:46,223
I was drunk, all right?

969
00:50:57,737 --> 00:50:58,970
Don't smoke in here.

970
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:02,173
Give me a break.
Work with me here.

971
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,709
I'm trying my best.

972
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:06,011
Mr. Q, could I get
some water?

973
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:08,213
And I need to tinkle.

974
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:11,050
I got missed-meal cramps.

975
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,986
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket
of chicken or something.

976
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,156
In a minute, okay?
How's it going in there?

977
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:19,091
He's going to make it.

978
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,628
You have any idea how much
blood this guy lost?

979
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:24,831
It's incredible.
He saved this man's life.

980
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:39,279
What's that?

981
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,181
Lasix.
It's a diuretic

982
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:43,717
to help get rid of some
of the fluid buildup.

983
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,718
But it's
potassium-depleting,

984
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:47,154
so he needs this one
to supplement.

985
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,189
And those?

986
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:51,091
Dopamine
for his blood pressure,

987
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:53,293
dig for his heart,
primacor.

988
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:56,982
Gosh, it seems
like so much.

989
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,267
Yeah, it's a lot.
This is antibiotic.

990
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:00,635
What for?

991
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:03,404
It's prophylactic,
just in case.

992
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:08,777
And those?
These two?

993
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:10,979
They're for pain.

994
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,448
I don't feel so good.

995
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:15,450
This is going to
make you feel yucky

996
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:17,987
for a few minutes, buddy,
but I'm going to get you

997
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,656
some of those crunchy
ice chips that you want.

998
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,057
How does that sound?

999
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,459
Yeah.

1000
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:25,895
Hey, Mike, by the way,
there was this guy,

1001
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,797
he stopped by to see you.

1002
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:30,232
He said he was
a friend of yours.

1003
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,134
I got him right here.

1004
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:34,637
I didn't know if I should
let him in or not.

1005
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:36,005
What do you think?

1006
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:37,640
Yeah, he's okay.
He's okay?

1007
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,977
Said he wanted
to hang out with you.

1008
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:41,277
He's okay.

1009
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:42,445
That's great.

1010
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:44,648

What are you up to?

1021

Never mind me.
You're worthless.

1022
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:41,941
You should have zapped
the bastard

1023
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:43,777
when you had the chance.

1024

sticking my neck on the line.

You want to stay alive,
sit tight

1030
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,102
and wait for the cavalry
to get here.

1031

are coming in shooting.

They don't care
about his kid.

Once he realizes that,
we're all history.

If he catches you
with that scalpel,

you're the one

A very upset father inside.

We'll give him
a couple minutes to cool off.

(LAUGHING)

00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:44,932
I don't understand why they
never found it, the doctors.

1096
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,334
My son has had
clean checkups every year

1097
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,736
since the day he was born.

1098
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,038
How could the doctors
not pick it up?

1099
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:53,074
He might not have been tested
thoroughly enough.

1100
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:54,208
Why not?

1101
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,181
You got an HMO, right?

1102
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,683
Yeah.
There's your answer.

1103
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,887
HMOs pay their doctors
not to test.

1104
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,022
It's their way
of keeping costs down.

1105
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,024
Say Mike did need
additional testing

1106
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,059
and insurance says
they won't cover them.

1107
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,495
The doctor keeps his mouth
shut, and come Christmas,

1108
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:17,399
the hmo sends the doctor
a fat-ass bonus check.

1109
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,868
Is that true?
Possible.

1110
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,272
Not likely,
but possible.

1111
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,041
These doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son,

1112

and they could have
treated him all along?

I don't know, John.

00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,115
Don't take this
personal, doc.

1115
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:33,549
You're a bunch of crooks.

1116
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,551
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1117
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,553
JULIE: What about
that thing you take?

1118
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,755
The thing?
That promise.

1119
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,825
It's called
the hippocratic oath.

1120
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,593
More like
the hypocritical oath.

1121
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,529
How's it go, doc?

1122
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:49,033
"I solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damn-near-dying,

1123
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,968
unless they ain't got
major medical."

1124
00:57:51,036 --> 00:57:52,203
Something like that?

1125
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,470
You've got it perfectly.

1126
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:55,940
It's funny, but it's
not far from the truth.

1127
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:57,774
This shit happens
all the time.

1128
00:57:57,843 --> 00:57:59,776
Paramedics bring in
some accident victim.

1129
00:57:59,845 --> 00:58:02,079
When the boys in accounting
find out they can't pay,

1130
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:03,447
they send them packing.

1131
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,283
Hospitals can't
turn people away.

1132
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:07,018
Isn't there laws
against that?

1133
00:58:07,086 --> 00:58:08,686
There's also ways
around those laws.

1134
00:58:08,754 --> 00:58:12,423
We have to stabilize them.
After that, we're off the hook.

1135
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:13,658
That's not how it works.

1136
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:15,293
That's exactly
how it works.

1137
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,128
Maybe not
on the fifth floor,

1138
00:58:17,196 --> 00:58:18,830
but in here
if you don't have money,

1139
00:58:18,898 --> 00:58:20,665
you get a band-aid,
a foot in the ass,

1140
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:21,967
and you're out the door.

1141
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:24,469
Enough already. I've heard
all the bitching and moaning

1142
00:58:24,536 --> 00:58:26,272
I can stand for one day.

1143
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,207
Look, if you all
want to regard me

1144
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,442
as some kind of blood-sucking
vampire, then fine.

1145
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,411
I'll be the bad guy.

1146
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:34,947
But who's holding
the fucking gun?

1147
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,755
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

1148
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:45,791
Sir? Lieutenant!

1149
00:58:48,229 --> 00:58:49,396
FRANK: Hello?

1150
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:50,463
Hello.

1151
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,632
John,
this is Frank Grimes.

1152
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,034
The line is clipped.

1153
00:58:54,102 --> 00:58:56,669
You pick up the phone,
you get me, okay?

1154
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,838
Now, what can I do
for you?

1155
00:58:58,907 --> 00:59:00,807
What's going on
with the list?

1156
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,010
I'm working on it,
but I need some time.

1157
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:04,544
Time I don't have, Frank.

1158
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:06,046
Let's talk
about the hostages.

1159
00:59:06,114 --> 00:59:08,548
Let's talk about them.
What do you want to know?

1160
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:10,584
What's going on in there?
How are they?

1161
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:12,520
They're fine.
They're full.

1162
00:59:12,587 --> 00:59:14,555
We're eating candy bars
and discussing HMOs.

1163
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,524
We're sitting here
waiting for you.

1164
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:18,526
I want you
to let some of them go.

1165
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:19,760
For what?

1166
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:22,463
I do for you, you do for me.
Show some good faith.

1167
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:24,532
A lot of nervous people
out here, John.

1168
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,367
Make everybody breathe
a lot easier

1169
00:59:26,435 --> 00:59:28,169
if we saw some happy faces.

1170
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:30,371
I'll do for you
when you start doing for me.

1171
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:31,773
MAN:
Lieutenant!

1172
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:34,576
...kid's name on that list.
I'm not kidding around.

1173
00:59:34,644 --> 00:59:35,978
FRANK: Good faith.

1174
00:59:36,046 --> 00:59:37,579
<i>JOHN: Good faith
only takes you so far...</i>

1175
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:38,948
What's the name?

1176
00:59:39,015 --> 00:59:42,017
...merit system. So far,
you haven't earned any points.

1177
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:43,752
I need to talk to you.

1178
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,055
This woman
is six centimeters dilated.

1179
00:59:46,122 --> 00:59:48,023
The baby is breeched.
I've medicated her,

1180
00:59:48,091 --> 00:59:50,525
but we have to move her
to maternity immediately.

1181
00:59:50,593 --> 00:59:51,526
FRANK: John?

1182
00:59:51,594 --> 00:59:52,528
Hang on, Frank.

1183
00:59:52,596 --> 00:59:53,863
Right down here.

1184
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,866
What the hell
is going on?

1185
00:59:56,934 --> 00:59:58,201
Do you know this man?

1186
01:00:01,372 --> 01:00:03,573
John Archibald.
He has a son here in ICU.

1187
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,575
Put people on the door.
Find the mother.

1188
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,077
I need to talk to her.

1189
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:08,311
JOHN: Are you there,
Frank?

1190
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:10,046
I'm here, John.
I'm here.

1191
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:12,115
I changed my mind,
all right?

1192
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:14,452
I'm going to let
some of the hostages go.

1193
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:15,652
That's the right thing.

1194
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,556
But when I do, the clock starts,
you understand?

1195
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,593
It's 4:15.
You got one hour.

1196
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,329
You got till 5:15,
you understand, Frank?

1197
01:00:25,397 --> 01:00:27,999
If my boy's
not on that list by 5:15,

1198
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,166
somebody in here
is going to die.

1199
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:30,667
Don't be stupid.

1200
01:00:30,735 --> 01:00:34,738
5:15, Frank. 5-1-5,
something happens for me!

1201
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:36,074
Got it.

1202
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:39,544
You're a cop.
Call the coroner.

1203
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:43,415
This is bad, Frank.
This has just got to go away.

1204
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:48,520
All right, Miriam...

1205
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:52,658
And rosa.

1206
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:54,726
<i>Yes?
Vamos. Let's go.</i>

1207
01:00:54,794 --> 01:00:56,695
Mr. Archibald,

1208
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:58,898
please let my husband
come with me.

1209
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:01,668
I need you to get out of here.
I will be okay. Just go.

1210
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:03,770
Shit, I'll go.
I'm free.

1211
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:05,271
MIRIAM: Steve, baby,
no, please.

1212
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:06,806
What kind of man are you?

1213
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:08,441
Screw you, Tyrone.

1214
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:10,443
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

1215
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:11,877
<i>Wait a second.
Screw me?</i>

1216
01:01:11,945 --> 01:01:14,046
Wait a minute, all right?
Just relax.

1217
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:15,748
Aah!

1218
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:20,788
Yeah, that's right,
tough guy.

1219
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:29,129
Julie, baby,
get the gun! Come on!

1220
01:01:29,197 --> 01:01:31,231
Go over there
and pick up that gun.

1221
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:34,034
Shoot him! Shoot him
right in the face, Julie!

1222
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,502
Right in the face!

1223
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,172
Get up! Get the gun!
There you go, baby.

1224
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,244
What are you--are you crazy?
What are you doing?

I knew damn well
you wasn't no blonde.

You understand me?
Yes.

Don't worry. Don't worry
about anything.

I'll always be there

Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

All right, Steve. You, too.
Let's go, both of you.

01:03:54,683 --> 01:03:57,384
He unlocked the door
and he let him inside!

When you're ready, chief.

1422
01:11:46,408 --> 01:11:48,742
(LAUGHING)

1423
01:11:51,714 --> 01:11:55,985
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

1424
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:58,187
(LAUGHTER)

1425
01:11:58,254 --> 01:12:00,022
Gus!

1426
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:02,624
My wife's calling.

1427
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:04,726
MAN: Worse, chief.
It's father time.

1428
01:12:04,794 --> 01:12:06,628
Come over here!

1429
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:10,132
Not one word, Frank.
I don't want to hear it.

1430
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,369
You son of a bitch,
you're going behind my back!

1431
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:13,870
What do you want?

1432
01:12:13,937 --> 01:12:15,872
Look at the clock!
Look at your watch!

1433
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,374
At a quarter after,

1434
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:19,342
he's going to start
killing people...

1435
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,977
This is
so goddamned stupid!

1436
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,812
Oh, really?
What's your great idea?

1437
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,349
There are no great ideas,
especially this!

1438
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:29,085
I got a shot at this guy.
I'm going to take it.

1439
01:12:29,153 --> 01:12:31,621
You know the drill.
Always take the open shot.

1440
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:33,624
The wife has agreed
to speak to him.

1441
01:12:33,691 --> 01:12:35,059
Let her talk him down.

1442
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,860
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

1443
01:12:36,928 --> 01:12:39,230
You used the wife
to set him up?

1444
01:12:39,297 --> 01:12:41,065
I'm going to use
whatever works.

1445
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:43,034
Let me paint
a picture for you.

1446
01:12:43,101 --> 01:12:44,735
We have a lose/lose.

1447
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:47,304
This guy starts whacking
hostages, that's bad.

1448
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:50,007
If we give into this asshole,
it's also bad.

1449
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:52,176
Bad for who?
Everybody.

1450
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:54,412
Me, you, everybody.
It's an election year.

1451
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:56,114
However it goes down,

1452
01:12:56,182 --> 01:12:58,316
this guy's
not going to make it.

1453
01:12:58,384 --> 01:13:00,519
So you kill him,
that's a P.R. Bonanza?

1454
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,454
I can live
with one dead bad guy.

1455
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:05,290
What I can't live with is one
innocent person being hurt,

1456
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:07,659
not one, not on my watch.

1457
01:13:09,028 --> 01:13:11,530
You know what, Frank?
You're out.

1458
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:12,931
<i>I'm out?</i>

1459
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:14,966
You're officially
relieved of duty.

1460
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:16,869
I'm going to
handle this now.

1461
01:13:16,937 --> 01:13:18,371
You?
Yeah, me.

1462
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:20,873
You think it's my first time
around the dance floor?

1463
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:23,776
How do you think I got these?
And watch it.

1464
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:26,779
I got a lot of pressure on me.
There's a lot of eyes watching.

1465
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:28,781
Someone's got to make
the call.

1466
01:13:28,848 --> 01:13:30,816
You're not
going to do it, are you?

1467
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:33,086
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1468
01:13:33,153 --> 01:13:35,654
What about the hostages,
the human beings?

1469
01:13:35,722 --> 01:13:37,823
Better keep
their heads down.

1470
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:51,505
Great.
What is it?

1471
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:53,707
The air conditioning
just turned off.

1472
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:01,816
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down, okay?

1473
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:03,251
I'll call you!

1474
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:05,620
Right on.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1475
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:08,289
Don't touch me! Excuse me.
Excuse me. Thank you.

1476
01:14:08,357 --> 01:14:10,592
Tuck Lampley, channel 8?
Right. You got it.

1477
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,761
Thanks, officer!
Excuse me. Whoo!

1478
01:14:14,763 --> 01:14:16,631
Where's my picture?

1479
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:19,334
I just got to unscramble
the police encryption.

1480
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:21,336
Hurry. I got a contact
in cardiology.

1481
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:23,439
The cops are going to
set up a call

1482
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:25,441
between this guy
and his wife.

1483
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:30,613
Are you with the wife?

1484
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,814
All right,
let's patch it through.

Okay. Wow.

Not too good.

he's going away.

Yeah.

They've done everything
they can for him,

Are you praying for our baby?

I believe.

How's my boy, huh?

Uh-huh.

How are you?

you're not here, dad?

01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:11,170
What?
You heard me.

1738
01:28:11,237 --> 01:28:13,806
Take my heart,
and you put it in Mike.

1739
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:16,141
MAN:
You done lost your damn mind.

1740
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,443
You can't be serious.

1741
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:19,745
You bet I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1742
01:28:19,813 --> 01:28:20,879
Oh, my God.

1743
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:23,349
Wow.
Man, you'll be dead.

1744
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,786
And my son will live.
It's the only way.

1745
01:28:26,853 --> 01:28:28,987
No, physically,
you can't do this.

1746
01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:31,558
Yes, I can.
I kill myself.

1747
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:33,627
You open me up,
you take my heart.

1748
01:28:33,695 --> 01:28:35,662
It's perfect.
That's crazy.

1749
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:39,599
We can't just remove your heart
and put it into Michael's body.

1750
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,336
Matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated.

1751
01:28:42,403 --> 01:28:44,971
There are critical tests
that have to be taken--

1752
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:47,341
cross matches for blood type,
chest cavity measurements.

1753
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:50,043
If both blood tissues are not
completely compatible--

1754
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:53,381
I know about compatibility.
We've been tested up the wazoo.

1755
01:28:53,449 --> 01:28:56,116
We're both b-positive.
Our tissues match.

1756
01:28:56,184 --> 01:28:59,053
His heart's three times the size
of normal, so mine will fit.

1757
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,021
You know damn well
we're compatible.

1758
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:02,457
Out of the question.
Too risky.

1759
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:04,525
Doc, I'm telling you,
he will make it!

1760
01:29:04,593 --> 01:29:05,626
Can't do it.

1761
01:29:05,694 --> 01:29:07,628
If I'm laying
on the floor, dead,

1762
01:29:07,696 --> 01:29:10,064
you're not going to take
my heart and save his life?

1763
01:29:10,131 --> 01:29:11,733
You'll let two die
instead of one

1764
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,268
because of a technicality?

1765
01:29:13,336 --> 01:29:15,738
I think what John
is trying to do is right.

1766
01:29:15,805 --> 01:29:17,573
Me, too.
It's so brave.

1767
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,208
What do you think Mike
would want? Your wife?

1768
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:22,277
Mike's too young to know
what's good for him.

1769
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:26,147
It's my job to protect him.
Denise would do the same thing.

1770
01:29:26,215 --> 01:29:30,469
John, look, I know what's
happening to Mike is bad.

1771
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:32,320
Matter of fact,
it's the worst.

1772
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:35,825
But killing yourself ain't
going to solve a damn thing.

1773
01:29:35,893 --> 01:29:40,296
Sometimes you just
got to let go and let God...

1774
01:29:40,364 --> 01:29:42,999
Just accept it, brother.

1775
01:29:43,066 --> 01:29:45,268
Accept it?

1776
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:47,670
Accept what?

1777
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:50,339
Accept what?

1778
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:51,775
That Mike is going to die.

1779
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:53,376
No.

1780
01:29:53,444 --> 01:29:57,548
No, I don't
accept that...Ever.

1781
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:00,484
No, I reject that
out of hand.

1782
01:30:00,552 --> 01:30:03,120
I mean, look, all right,
he's a patient to you,

1783
01:30:03,187 --> 01:30:05,989
I understand, but if you--
he's a good kid.

1784
01:30:06,057 --> 01:30:08,592
I mean, he's--
he loves bodybuilding.

1785
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:12,362
He wants to be a bodybuilder.
Can you believe that?

1786
01:30:12,431 --> 01:30:15,399
<i>He's funny, he's--
you'd like him.</i>

1787
01:30:15,467 --> 01:30:18,002
You'd like him, doc,
if you got to know him.

1788
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,270
I do like him.

1789
01:30:19,338 --> 01:30:22,040
Then, please,
I'm just begging you,

1790
01:30:22,107 --> 01:30:23,374
step outside the rules.

1791
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:25,376
I'd like to, John,
I really would,

1792
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:27,378
but what you're asking
crosses the line.

1793
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,648
It is completely
unethical.

1794
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,650
I'm crossing the line?
You're crossing the line.

1795
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,985
The whole system
is crossing the line.

1796
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:36,387
Maybe you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1797
01:30:36,456 --> 01:30:40,359
I don't give a damn.
My son's going to live.

1798
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:42,361
Maybe you haven't
figured that out by now.

1799
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:45,030
I'll do whatever I got to do
for him to live.

1800
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:48,668
What are you going to do,
shoot me if I don't operate?

1801
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,604
No.

1802
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:53,873
I'm going to kill myself.

1803
01:30:53,941 --> 01:30:55,575
(COCKS PISTOL)

1804
01:30:55,642 --> 01:30:59,078
All right?
Let's just see what happens.

1805
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:01,849
That's what this is all about, right?
He needs a donor.

1806
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,784
Somebody's got to die
for him to live.

1807
01:31:03,852 --> 01:31:05,418
I'm his father.
It's me.

1808
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:16,530
All right.

1809
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:18,164
MITCH: All right?
All right what?

1810
01:31:18,232 --> 01:31:19,566
I'll do it.

1811
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:21,568
You're going to let him
kill himself?

1812
01:31:21,636 --> 01:31:23,237
Once he's dead,
why not?

1813
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:25,640
You are the finest surgeon
I have ever known.

1814
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:29,377
You cannot throw your career,
your life away for this.

1815
01:31:29,444 --> 01:31:30,912
If you do this,
you're finished.

1816
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:33,114
What are they
going to do, sue me?

1817
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:35,182
Disbar me?

1818
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,652
Evict me
from the country club?

1819
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,021
No, this is still a hospital.

1820
01:31:40,088 --> 01:31:42,189
If there's a heart available,

1821
01:31:42,257 --> 01:31:44,392
I'm not going to let it
go to waste.

1822
01:31:44,459 --> 01:31:47,696
Doctor, Mr. Maguire,
let's get ready for surgery.

1823
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:17,027
WOMAN: (INDISTINCT)

1824
01:32:17,094 --> 01:32:18,562
MAN:
They're ready to harvest.

1825
01:32:18,629 --> 01:32:21,031
WOMAN:
All right, hurry up, guys.

1826
01:32:21,098 --> 01:32:22,832
Get her on the table.

1827
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,067
WOMAN #2:
What's our time?

1828
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:25,802
All right,
ready to lift.

1829
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,303
Count of three.

1830
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:28,806
WOMAN #3:
Oh-four-five.

1831
01:32:28,874 --> 01:32:32,409
(WHIRS)

1832
01:32:32,477 --> 01:32:33,811
WOMAN:
Scalpels laid out.

1833
01:32:33,879 --> 01:32:36,781
WOMAN #2: Where's his tray?
Got the other one ready?

1834
01:32:36,848 --> 01:32:39,316
(SAW WHIRRING AND GRINDING)

1835
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:45,422
What do we have?

1836
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:48,392
WOMAN: Female donor,
26 years old...

1837
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:51,129
She is 26 years old, 5'7".

1838
01:32:51,197 --> 01:32:52,530
...kidneys usable.

1839
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:56,167
Liver and kidneys
are both usable. Lungs?

1840
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:57,302
MAN: Okay.

1841
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:58,937
Lungs are okay.
Heart?

1842
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:00,438
Heart is good.

1843
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:02,407
Heart is good.
Blood type?

1844
01:33:03,676 --> 01:33:05,477
B-positive.

1845
01:33:08,615 --> 01:33:10,749
This is my, uh...

1846
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,687
My will.

1847
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,257
It says I'm leaving my heart
to my son,

1848
01:33:18,325 --> 01:33:20,994
and I need two witnesses
to sign.

1849
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:22,495
I'm not signing it.

1850
01:33:22,562 --> 01:33:24,130
I ain't going to watch you
kill yourself.

1851
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:25,698
Me, neither.

1852
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:28,935
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner you go home.

1853
01:33:30,303 --> 01:33:32,739
Okay. I'll sign.

1854
01:33:32,806 --> 01:33:34,508
Me, too.

1855
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:47,121
So you're just going to go
in there and off yourself?

1856
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,556
Only one thing
will stop me--

1857
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,458
if Mitch is b-positive.

1858
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:55,095
MITCH: No, no, no, no, no.
Type O. Swear to God.

1859
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:57,298
(LAUGHING)

1860
01:34:00,502 --> 01:34:01,502
Thank you.

1861
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:03,204
You be good, huh?

1862
01:34:03,272 --> 01:34:04,939
Be careful.

1863
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:06,207
Yeah, yeah.

1864
01:34:17,688 --> 01:34:19,822
See you in the funny papers.

1865
01:34:28,915 --> 01:34:31,000
Can I have a word with him?

1866
01:34:34,437 --> 01:34:35,705
Thank you.

1867
01:34:58,963 --> 01:35:00,564
Hey, Mike.

1868
01:35:00,632 --> 01:35:03,500

1869
01:35:03,568 --> 01:35:05,036
Mikey.

1870
01:35:13,812 --> 01:35:14,946
How you doing, buddy?

1871
01:35:15,013 --> 01:35:18,082
(WHISPERING) Hey, dad.

1872

Did you find me
a new heart?

1873

(WHISPERS)
Yeah, we got you one.

1874
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:29,995
I guess you got
a guardian angel.

1875
01:35:30,063 --> 01:35:31,230
Mike.
(WHISPERING) Mike.

1876
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:34,099
Just try to stay awake
just for a minute, okay?

1877
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:38,070
I just need to tell you
a few things.

1878
01:35:38,138 --> 01:35:40,538
Okay, dad.

1879
01:35:44,645 --> 01:35:47,981
You always listen
to your mother.

1880
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,183
You understand?

1881
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:52,585
Do what she tells you
to do.

1882
01:35:55,156 --> 01:35:57,223
She's your best friend.

1883
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,193
You tell her you love her
every day.

1884
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:02,595
Okay, dad.

1885
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:05,732
Now, you're--you're--

1886
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:08,869
you're too young for girls
right now, but...

1887
01:36:10,172 --> 01:36:13,073
There's
going to come a time.

1888
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:17,311
When it does, you treat them
like princesses,

1889
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:19,680
'cause that's what they are.

1890
01:36:23,518 --> 01:36:25,752
When you say you're
going to do something...

1891
01:36:42,071 --> 01:36:44,806
When you say you're going to
