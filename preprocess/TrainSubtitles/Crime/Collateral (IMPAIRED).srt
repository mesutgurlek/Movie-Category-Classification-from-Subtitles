- Right there.
- Thanks.

It was him in that gold Lexus

Are they still asking for
a change of venue?

of priors in the early '80s.

Downtown.

Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,673
Hold on. Take Sepulveda
to Slauson to La Brea.

Take La Brea north to 6th,

- What?

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,219
The 105 to the 110
will get you there quicker.

36
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,889
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

But once you get to La Brea
north of Santa Monica, it's jammed.

The 110 north of the 10, you get people
driving to Pasadena and they drive slow.

39
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,436
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand and then I...

No. Strings. Never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

There were two of us.
I had to kill the other one.

No, this is part-time.

This is a fill-in job.
Pay the bills.

67
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,529
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

68
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,610

- Just shaping up some things.

69

00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,520
It'll be like a island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

73
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,990
When you get to the airport,
you won't want to get out of my limo.

74
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,926
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases...

that you live out of.

a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

94

I love standing in that courtroom.

95
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,799

...clenched up thing
the night before the first days.

Clenched up? How?

98
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,550
I think I'm going to lose.

99
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,650
I think the case sucks,
my exhibits aren't in order,

100
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,595
I'm not prepared enough, people will
find out I don't know what I'm doing

101
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,258
and I've been running a charade
all these years.

102
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,461
I represent the Department of Justice,

103
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,131
and my opening statement will fall flat
at the most important point

104
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,333
and the jury will laugh at me.

105
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,610
And then I cry.
I don't throw up.

106
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,549
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

107
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,817
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement...

108
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,552
work my exhibits and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

109

I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

113
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,834
Not in a cab.
You need to get your head straight.

114
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,379
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic, you know...

- I go on vacation all the time.

- A dozen times a day.

It's my own private getaway.

120
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,825
Things get heavy for me, I take
five minutes out and I just go there.

121
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,732
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

122

- Here. Take it.
- I couldn't do that.

123
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,773
Take it because you need it
a lot more than I do.

124
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,113
And it'll help you.
I guarantee it.

Come on, man, I'm sorry.

I didn't hear you, man. Come on.

I'll take you.

139
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,572
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

Gotcha.

- [Man] How long you think this'll take?
- [Max] Seven minutes.

Seven. Not eight? Not six?

143
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,026
Two minutes from the 110 to Normandie.
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

144
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,659
Over to Union is one,
plus one for "shit happens."

- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,575
An apology.
Already offered my free ride today.

148

- To who?
- Some girl.

149
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,582
Did you get a date with her?

150
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,310
First time in L.A.?

151

No. Tell you the truth, whenever
I'm here I can't wait to leave.

311
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,148
- You don't have trunk space.
- I can't believe this.

312
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,553
- Believe it.
- Don't. I'll talk to them.

He's probably married.

315
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,093
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

- [Tapping]
- I'll take care of it. I got it.

317
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,327
Just a second.

318
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,907
How you doing? My partner's going
to help you out on that side.

319
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,571
- License, registration.
- Uh, yeah.

320
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,412
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

321
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,614
- All this current?
- Yes, officer.

322
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,493
You have a food fight in here?

323
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,031
Yeah. I'll just clean it up.

324
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,392
Is this blood up here

Yeah, uh, I...

327
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,801
- I hit a deer.
- You hit a deer?

328
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,936
Yeah, over on...

329
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,813
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

330
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:45,221
They out there. It ran right in front
of the car and I couldn't avoid it.

331
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,655
Why you still carrying a passenger?

332
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,957
I'm on my way to the depot and I could
just drop him. His drop is on my way.

333
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,657
Your cab's unsafe to drive
and we have to impound it.

00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,166
We got to do a vehicle inventory.

335
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:02,171
Pop the trunk and step out the vehicle.
Sir, you'll have to call another cab.

336
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,639
Is that necessary?
I'm half a mile from here.

337
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,873
I'm afraid it is. Step out the vehicle.
You too. Come on.

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,542

- You know what, it's been a long night.

339
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,348
Plus, the barn is right up there.
Just give me a break.

340
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,888
This is my first fare.

341
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,117
Get out the cab.
Open the trunk.

342
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,687
Step out.
You too, sir. Please.

Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him

- Four months. He's a low-level player.

They'll just take our stuff,
build their case, take the credit.

455
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,682
- What's the point?
- The point is my guy flew out a window.

456
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:46,286
So if my CI flies out a window,
he's got Felix's handprints on his ass.

That makes it mine.

458
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,594
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

459
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,501
- Just a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

460
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,042
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

461
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,704
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

462
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,446
- <i>[woman] Richard?</i>
- Yeah, it's me.

463
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,756
Ramone went through that window...
splat.

464
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,759
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

465
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,026
Maybe he jumped.

466
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,194
Sure. He's depressed so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

467
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,670
"That feels better."
Picks himself up.

468
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,106
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

469
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,200
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray!

470
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,677
Catch.

471
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,447
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

472
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,648
Old guy across the alley watching TV
says he saw a cab earlier tonight

473
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,956
- with two guys walking around the hood.
- Description? He see anything?

474
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,089
Kind of saw. Guy's got glasses
like Coke bottles.

475
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,657
There are 4,000 taxicabs in L.A. County.
You got anything else?

476
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,997
That's it.

477
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,164
Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

478
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,402
Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

479
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,206
Cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,

480
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,009
- then put the gun to his head.
- He flipped out. So what?

481
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,346
So that Oakland detective
never bought it.

482
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,444
Cabby had no criminal record
or history of mental illness.

483
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,149
Pops three people, then himself?

484
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,484
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

485
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,866
[Jazz music plays]

486
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,592
I never learned to listen to jazz.

487
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,200
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

488
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,760
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

489
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,260
Most people, ten years from now,

490
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,062
same job, place, routine.
Everything the same.

491
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,868
Just keeping it safe over and over.
Ten years from now.

492
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,340
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

493
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,076
Do you?

494
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,695
Who is that on the trumpet?

495
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,094
[Woman] That's Daniel, baby,
he's the owner.

496
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,963
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

497
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,097
- I got to buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

498
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,550
[Daniel] Now see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.

499
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,553
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

500
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,419
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

501
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:39,360
Take this one night. July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

502
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,260
[Woman] Bye, baby.

503
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,698
- Miles Davis. That's right.
- In the flesh?

504
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,329
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

505
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,736
Jesus.

506
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,300
Anyway, he had been recording a session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

507
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,538
So Miles comes through that door.

508
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,845
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

509
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,646
I mean, it had to be...

510
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:06,712
Oh, it was scary.
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

511
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,224
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway.

512
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,854
Everybody and their mama knew you don't
just come up and talk to Miles Davis.

513
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,422
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

514
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,700
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

515
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,172
And the guy says,
"Hi, my name is..."

516
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
Miles said, "Get out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

517
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,813
Take your silly bitch with you."

518
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,007
[Both laugh]

519
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,983
You know? That was Miles, man.

520
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,385
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

521
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,618
- But did you get to talk to him?
- Better than that.

522
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,217
I played for about 20 minutes.

523
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,887
[Vincent] Unbelievable.

524
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,692
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

525
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,632
You really ain't shit
playing next to Miles Davis.

526
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,225
But he carried my ass.

527
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,066
[Vincent] What'd he say?

528
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,834
He said one word: Cool.

529
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,307
Cool?

530
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,877
- That's it?
- Yeah.

531
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,344
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

532
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,041
It meant, "Look me up when you are."

533
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,549
Did you?

534
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:12,486
No. I got drafted
and got into some other things.

535
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,425
And by the time I got back to music,
season had passed.

536
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,090
You know, I was born in 1945,

537
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,964
but that night was the moment
of my conception.

538
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,163
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

539
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,571
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

540
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,768
What a great story.

541
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:40,111
I got to tell the people in Culiacan
and Cartagena that story.

542
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,529
You know the folks
in Culiacan and Cartagena?

543
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,193
Afraid so.

544
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,094
Just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

545
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,664
I am a cool guy with a job
I contracted to do.

546
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,143
- Come on, give the dude a pass.
- I'm working here.

547
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,680
You're the one talking
about improvisation.

548
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,808
You like the guy, how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz.

549
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,910
Improvi...
That's funny coming from you.

550
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,551
How's this?

551
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,689
- I'll ask a question.
- [Daniel] What question?

552
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,232
A jazz question.

553
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,100
Now, you get it right, we roll.

554
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,570
You disappear tonight.

555
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,699
If I walk out of here tonight,

556
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,836
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

557
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:47,440
And one more thing: These people
and their rep here, Felix...

558
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,782
Well, you tell them I'm sorry.

559
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:55,518
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

560
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,390
It was either play ball
or go back inside.

561
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,056
And I'm not going back inside.

562
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,494
Yeah.

563
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,541
Lay it on me.

564
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,008
Where did Miles learn music?

565
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,046
- I know everything about Miles.
- Then let's have it.

566
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,810
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

567
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,148
His father was a dentist,
east St. Louis.

568
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,813
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

569
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:31,623
He sent Miles to Juilliard School
of Music, New York, 1945.

570
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,026
Man.

571
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,537
Dropped out in less than a year, tracked
down Charlie Parker on 52nd Street

572
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,173
who mentored him
for the next three years.

573
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,902
Hey.

574
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,873
- No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
- Max.

575
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,608
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral, anyway.

576
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,980

577
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,013
[Max panting]

578
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,249
I am not playing.

579
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,628
You played him, man.

580
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,423
He got the answer right...

581
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,899
...would you have let him go?

582

What is it with this guy?

584
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,981
- You hassling my driver again?
- <i>Who are you?</i>

585
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,717

<i>Put him on the line, please.</i>

Hang on.

588
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,264
Carefully.

589
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,435

- <i>Are you all right? Where are you?"</i>
- [Vincent] Show for what?

592
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,577
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

593
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,909
<i>I'm not related to you.</i>
<i>Tell her yourself.</i>

594
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,914
Show up for what?

595
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,613
She's in the hospital.

596
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,587
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What's the difference?

597
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,920
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

598
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,189
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

599
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,166
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

600
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,637
Since when was any of this negotiable.

601

Flowers?

603
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,486
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

604
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,154
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

605
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,059
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

606

Excuse me.

607
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,871

614
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,510
Hey, Ma.

615
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,615
I've been calling and calling.

616
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,715
- I got caught up at work.
- Why couldn't you call me?

617
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,159
I'm lying here wondering if something
terrible happened to you.

618
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,163
- I brought you flowers.
- What am I gonna do with flowers?

619
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,823
- Cheer up.
- How?

620
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,701
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just going to wilt and die?

621
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,202
See what I mean?

622
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,276
I didn't buy you the flowers. He did.

623
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,935
Who?

624
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,516
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

625
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:28,023
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

626
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,252
No harm done, ma'am.

627
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,760
You paid for my flowers?

628
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,888
They're beautiful.

629
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,736
Well, Max?

630
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:52,145
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

631
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,415
I am very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

632
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,352
[Chuckling] Oh, just call me Ida.

633
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,755
Ida. I was with Max
when he got the call.

634
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,286
- [Lda] You came here to see me?
- [Vincent] It's nothing, ma'am.

635
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,887
Tell my son.

636
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:13,163
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

637
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,501
You must be one of
Max's important clients.

638
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,372
Client? You know, I like to think
of myself as his friend.

639
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,803
[Lda] Max never had many friends.

640
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,314
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

641
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,384
How many times I got to ask
don't do that?

642
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,452
Do what?

643
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,784
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

644
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,186
What's he saying?

645
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,852
[Vincent] He says he's standing
right here in the room here.

646
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:41,124
Yes, you are.
He's sensitive.

647
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,598
I know. But I'm sure
you're very proud of him.

648
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,660
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know?

649
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,865
Look at him today.
Here, Vegas...

650
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:55,104
Mom, he is not interested in hearing
about all that, okay?

651
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,909
I came to see you, I saw you,
you look good, let's go.

652
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,040
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

653
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,120
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

654
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,348
He drives famous people around.

655
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,788
Famous people. Limousine companies.

656
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,417
Now, that's quite an achievement.

657
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,862
- [Lda] What did you say your name was?
- My name's Vincent, ma'am.

658
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,126
Visit again?

659
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,327
[Vincent] No, I'm just in town tonight.

660
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,530
- [Lda] When you come back.
- [Vincent] Sure.

661
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,623
Max!

662
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,296
Don't!

663
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,264
[Max screams]

664
00:53:55,365 --> 00:54:00,132
All my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

665
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,263
[Ragged breathing]

666
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,942
Let's see what else you can do.

667
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,670
[Max groans]

668
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,583
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

669
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,692
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

670
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,956
No, next.

671
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:32,228
There's something funny
about this, though.

672
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:36,499
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

673
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,631
The kid and that last guy,

674
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,575
both done by the same shooter, I think.

675
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,646
Why do you say that?

676
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,113
Wound pattern.

677
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,776
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

678
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,321
This guy is shooting tight groups too,
all right? Check this out.

679
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,914
Double taps are
a couple millimeters apart.

680
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,994
Let's see this one.

681
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,304
See what I mean?

682
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,772
Holy shit.

683
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,775
Can I use your phone?

684
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,214
Come on, come on, wake up.

685
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,788
[Ringing]

686
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,930
Hello.

687
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:41,629
It's Fanning. I'm still down here
at the morgue at Sisters of Charity.

688
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,401
John Does didn't pan out, but you'll
never guess who's in the meat locker.

689
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,475
Who?

690
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:50,137
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer criminal.

691
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:55,684
<i>[Fanning] Including Ramone,</i>
<i>who he represented, who's still missing.</i>

692
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,583
Both are in
the exotic substances business together.

693
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,784
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

694
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,918
Stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

695
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,190
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

696
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,424
Good.

697
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,674
Going to a place called El Rodeo.
It's on Washington Boulevard, Pico Rivera.

698
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,870
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

699
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,007
Limos, huh?

700
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,144
Don't start.

701
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,916
I'm not the one lying to my mother.

702
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,958
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

703
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,153
Right. Maybe she hears
what you tell her.

704
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,754
Whatever I tell her's never good enough.
It's always been that way.

705
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,167
So, what's at El Rodeo?

706
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,896
Just drive.

707
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,832
They project onto you their flaws.

708
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:55,308
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

709
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,744
They rank on you instead.

710
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,208
How do you know?

711
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,181
I had a father like that.

712
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,244
- Mothers are worse.
- Wouldn't know.

713
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,448
My mother died
before I remember her.

714
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,525
What happened to your father?

715
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,191
Hated everything I did.

716
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:17,926
Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

717
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,371
Then what?

718
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,238
I killed him.

719
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,443
I was 12.

720
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,013
[Laughing]

721
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,951
I'm kidding.

722
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,556
He died of liver disease.

723
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,721
Well, I'm sorry.

724
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,595
No, you're not.

725
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,249
So, what is this "driving a cab temporarily."
It's all bullshit?

726
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,582
It is not bullshit.

727
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,451
[Vincent] 12 years isn't temporary.

728
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:17,253
Got to get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

729
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,555
Got to staff up,
get the right client list.

730
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,324
It's not just get the car
and put asses in the seats.

731
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:23,399
Why not?

732
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,061
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

733
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,470
It's like a club experience.
Cool groove.

734
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,542
Don't want it to end.

735
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,270
It's got to be perfect.

736
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,870
Perfect.

737
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,616
It's up here. Turn right.

738
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:01,204
Give me your wallet. Come on.

739
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,229
Give me your wallet. Come on.

740
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,637
Give you my wallet. For what?

741
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,644
I'll hold it for you
in case the people inside search you.

742
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,442
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

743
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,245
Go in, ask for Felix.
He's expecting you.

744
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:19,048
- Felix. What does he look like?
- I don't know, I never met him.

745
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,588
Who is he?

746
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,954
He's connected to the guys
who hired me.

747
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,026
I don't get it.

748
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,391
You destroyed my work-ups.
Number four is due.

749
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,488
What'd you think, night's over?
Called on account of rain?

750
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,897
Go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

751
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,799
- They'll be on flash drive or CD.
- How come you don't...

752
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,566
I don't meet people. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

753
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,973
You're not going to screw that up.
Contract's with their bosses.

754
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,376
These guys don't meet me,
or know what I look like.

755
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:49,075
If I don't pull it off, then...

756
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,676
They will kill you.
You got 10 minutes.

757
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:55,383
At 10:01, I execute your mother
on my way out of town.

758
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,324
- Don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this.

759
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,330
- I can't.
- Sure you can. Come on. Hey, hey.

760
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,799
If I do this, I'm just going to end up
getting people killed.

761
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,269
Out of options. Take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

762
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,867
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

763
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,774
Just in case they ask me.

764
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,305
- Private sector? Six years.
- Okay. All right. Six years.

765
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:25,046
You get benefits?
Or, you know, insurance? Pension?

766
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,055
No. No paid sick leave.
Quit stalling, get out of the cab.
