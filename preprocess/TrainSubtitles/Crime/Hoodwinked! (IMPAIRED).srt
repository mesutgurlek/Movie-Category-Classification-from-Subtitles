Maybe you should
"ax" him yourself. [laughing]

Or are you the Bandit?

941
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,307
Awkward!

942

- I'm being ridiculous?

Now, there's Sylvia Puckett
at the North Pole.

She found the best hot chocolate

It would seem that all of you
came together tonight by mistake.

Maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads
so we could get to the real truth.

- The Goody Bandit.
- That's right.

The Bandit's still at large.

1033

There's been a lot
of finger-pointing tonight,

but now all fingers point to the Bandit.

1035

- Not my finger!
- Oh, no,

But someone robbed me!
Have we lost track of that?

That's right, someone did.

1042
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:17,076
Maybe a snack food competitor.

Now, hold on a pea-picking minute!

1045
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,017
I may lead a double life
full of secrets and deception,

1046
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:27,578
- but that's no reason to be suspicious.
- Huh?

1047
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:31,251
A woman like you could have a lot
to gain stealing all those recipes.

And that's how she makes
her goodies so good! Huh?

Or she could just be another victim...

...of a hungry wolf!

1051

The wolf did it. Talk about profiling.

1052
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:46,264
Why should we trust someone
who wears disguises for a living?

1053
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:50,005
- Maybe he's not a wolf at all!
- You got me. I'm a poodle.

1054
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,708
- Just haven't been to the barbershop.
- Is this all just a big joke to you?

1055
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:57,343
- I just followed the girl here.
- You leave my granddaughter alone!

1056
00:55:57,419 --> 00:56:00,786
Yes, now we get to Little Red,

- Not my Red!

1061
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,314
Calm down there, Triple G.

1062
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,782
The only thing your
granddaughter is guilty of

1063
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:31,183
is flying hummingbirds
without a license.

1064
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:34,814
It would seem there is
another player in this game,

...and someone who was there

when the schnitzel truck
was schnitzeled.

What the schnitzel?

1077
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,893
Not the bunny!

- Uh, chief.
- Yeah?

1080

Get your boys to Red's place.
We need to head off that cable car.

And bring in a police sketch artist.
No, make it a cartoonist.

We gotta hurry to beat it down.
Bill, get everyone in the cars.

There's on old cable car station
at the top of the mountain.

We've got to follow them, boys.
Red's up there. I know it!

Get down the mountain.
You gotta stop those cops.

Run 'em off the road,
dangle a donut, I don't care.

Is that coffee?

I can't believe I'm saying this,
but... drink up.

You see how it works, Dolph?

1136
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:26,584
You prioritize, you set your goals,
you write a mission statement.

1137
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:30,716
You ask yourself,
"Where do I see me in five years?"

You're a delivery girl.
Then could you do me a favor?

Could you take this down the mountain?

So this is your big part.

This is the role of a lifetime.
Make them believe in you.

Don't act like an evil henchman,
be an evil henchman. Got it?

What is that, a ski mask?

I like that. See, that's scary.
That's good.

Hi there. What he means to say
is that I'm the building inspector.

You're an evil genius, right?

Well, I don't know
if I'd say genius, you know.

I was asked to join Mensa.

1259

You got an evil lair in a cave,
that's standard,

1260
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:39,524
but see, most masters of evil
that we deal with

1261
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,926
are up to evil genius code.

Are you familiar with the code?

1263

You know, I'm more of a
do-it-yourself kind of guy. Yeah.

I don't know. I don't...
Do you think I should?

Well, it's standard equipment
for a cave lair.

1267

I'm not saying you're
gonna zap someone today,

They gotta be calibrated.

that need a happy ending.

1388
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:46,178
I'm part of a secret organization
that makes sure that happens.

1389
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,586
"Happily Ever After Agency"?

1390
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:51,090
The woods don't
go around by themselves.

1391
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,650
We fight the bad guys,
swing through the windows

1392
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:55,559
secret-agent-style, right?

1393
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,860
So, what do you think?

1394
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:01,724
Bring it, honey.

1395
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,506
I always did like happy endings.

1396
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:08,303
