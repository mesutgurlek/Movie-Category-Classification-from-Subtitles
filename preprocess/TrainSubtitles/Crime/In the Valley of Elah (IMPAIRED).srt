EXAMINER: Working backwards,
carbon patterns show the body...

357
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,723
...was dismembered
before it was burned.

358
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:42,293
It appears a large knife or tool
was used, but the blade was dull...

359
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,463
...which is why the bones are
shattered rather than severed.

360
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,366
Burn patterns show us
the dismembered parts were stacked...

361
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:52,003
...and doused with an accelerant in
an attempt to incinerate the body.

You'd need an oven
to approach an effective temperature...

363

...which means most tissue
would've been left intact.

364
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,713
So the damage is largely the result
of scavengers stripping the bones.

by customs or by the military?

of his credit-card charges.

he bought tube socks--
