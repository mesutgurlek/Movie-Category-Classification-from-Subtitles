00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:43,948
JAX: Weeks after Little Paul was
killed, SAMTAZ passed a crank vote.

304
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:47,161
That have anything to do
with why you patched out?

305
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:52,979
CLAY: Hey, Tig, you in
the mood for some stew?

306
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:56,585
TIG: Yeah, yeah.

307
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:05,976
Mmm, hasenpfeffer, man.

308
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:08,255
REGGIE: All right.

309
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:10,384
JAX: Why'd you quit?

310
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:12,260
(Reggie sighs)

311
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:17,209
REGGIE: Huff found out I was
banging Little Paul's old lady.

312
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,678
TIG: Ellen?

313
00:22:18,806 --> 00:22:20,209
Jesus, man.

314
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,644
CLAY: So what happened?

315
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,911
REGGIE: Huff kept it quiet, said he
didn't want to ruin Paul's marriage.

316
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,852
CLAY: Saving it for leverage.

317
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:32,472
REGGIE: Little Paul and I got word there
was a cookhouse out on Copperhead.

318
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,731
Shook down the skinheads who
were running it, found out Huff

319
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,626
and Benny had set it up.

320
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,428
Used the club's weight to get it
done and nobody at the table had

321
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,388
any idea that it was happening.

322
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,875
Then we get a call from Huff and
Benny saying Little Paul had

323
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:47,459
been gunned down by
Mexican bangers.

324
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,839
No other witnesses.

325
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,896
JAX: And when you threatened to out
him, Huff played the leverage.

326
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:53,689
REGGIE: Yeah.

327
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:55,586
Huff said he was gonna tell the
gang that I was banging Ellen.

328
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:59,019
I'd be drummed out, Ellen'd get
shunned-- no compensation,

329
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,030
nobody to look out after her.

330
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,330
I didn't want it to
ruin her life, too.

331
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:06,959
I walked away.

332
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:11,264
BOBBY: Yeah, well, once you and Little
Paul were gone, Huff voted it in legit.

333
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:12,130
(phone rings)

334
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,761
REGGIE: Look, I don't want
this getting back to the club.

335
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,557
CLAY: I can't make that promise.

336
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:20,319
I can promise you we'll
take care of Ellen.

337
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,854
JUICE: Yo, Luis called.

338
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,573
Romeo wants to meet.

339
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,922
CLAY: Uh, get a 20 on those
skinheads, will you?

340
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,376
TIG: Yeah.

341
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,810
TARA: Piney.

342
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:47,289
You okay?

343
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:50,145
PINEY: Yeah, I just-- sorry,
I, I just let myself in.

344
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,305
TARA: It's okay.

345
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:54,007
What's, uh, what's going on?

346
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:59,669
PINEY: Uh, you remember those
questions you were asking me a

347
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,452
few months back about John?

348
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:05,661
Then you said you
read something.

349
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,791
TARA: Yeah.

350
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:10,950
PINEY: What was it?

351
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:13,271
TARA: Well, you shut me down
when I tried to tell you.

352
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:15,690
Why do you want to know now?

353
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,320
PINEY: Because the club is
headed into troubled waters and

354
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:24,806
maybe there's something in
whatever you read, helps me to

355
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:28,992
keep the boat from, you
know, rocking too much.

356
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:32,133
TARA (chuckles): Those are some
really vague metaphors for

357
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,339
a guy as direct as you.

358
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,108
PINEY: I want to
read whatever it is.

359
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:41,018
John was my friend.
I have a right.

360
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:43,846
TARA: Bullshit.

361
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,053
What do you need it for?

362
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:49,557
PINEY: I can't tell you.

363
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,798
TARA: Hmm, then neither can I.

364
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,050
PINEY: Hey.

365
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:55,271
I need some goddamn leverage.

366
00:24:55,952 --> 00:25:01,113
- And that pointed history you
read may be... GEMMA: - Oh, sorry.

367
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,592
TARA (groans): You know, most civil
people would knock before entering.

368
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:06,868
GEMMA: I'm not most people.

369
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,537
CHUCK: And she's
definitely not civil.

370
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:11,150
GEMMA: What are we,
George and Gracie now?

371
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:12,763
Sorry to interrupt.

372
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:14,571
PINEY: That's okay, we're done.

373
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:15,981
TARA: No, no, no, no.

374
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,712
We should finish.
I'll be right back.

375
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:23,912
What do you need?

376
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,400
GEMMA: I wanna sign you up for a
committee-- Charming Central Gardens.

377
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:29,140
Need to raise money to save it.

378
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,812
TARA: I can't. I'm already
on three committees here.

379
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:32,958
GEMMA: I just need your name.

380
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,012
It means a lot to get
a doctor involved.

381
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,681
- Attracts donors.
TARA: - Gemma, I can't.

382
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,720
GEMMA: It's a chance
to help this town.

383
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:43,721
TARA: What's your angle on this?

384
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:46,246
Why do you give a shit
about an overgrown park?

385
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:52,365
GEMMA: Nate taught me how to plant
seed in that overgrown park.

386
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,136
I am not gonna let 'em gut it
and put up a goddamn Starbucks.

387
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:57,432
CHUCKY: Tara, it's Piney.
S... Something wrong!

388

Harassing one of our

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,704
We got it handled.

ROMEO: Good.

395
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:18,813
JAX: From now on, we'll just be sending
four guys down with the truck.

Lower profile.

397
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,736
Our Tucson charter will run
protection once we're here.

398
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,168
ROMEO: Have we heard from
our friends in Belfast?

399
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:26,535
CLAY: I talked to the Kings.

400
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,735
They're working on that
big ticket order for you.

401
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:34,433
They're gonna want a face-to-
face before that sale can happen.

457
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:14,430
(groans)

458
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,616
CLAY: You having
trouble with the grip?

459
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:21,204
(Huff groans)

460
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,070
JAX: Handle your business.

461
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:26,906
We'll be at the truck stop.

462
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,137
(Huff groaning)

463
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,386
(monitor beeping)

464
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,425
PINEY (sighs): Can I
get out of here now?

465
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:44,924
TARA: Dr. Geller wants to
keep you in for 24 hours.

466
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:45,699
(Piney groans)

467
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,926
Just observation.

468
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:50,452
PINEY: It's my oxygen levels.

469
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:51,745
It happens once in a while.

470
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:54,043
TARA: The alcohol isn't helping.

471
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:56,008
PINEY: Yeah, I know.

472
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:02,360
I'm-I'm sorry I was so
hard on you before.

473
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:04,241
TARA: Mm, it's okay.

474
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:14,297
Tell me about John Teller.

475
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:18,555
What was he like?

476
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,412
PINEY: He was a complicated guy.

477
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:32,724
Angry, impulsive...
(chuckles) Just righteous as hell.

478
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,261
Hated being wrong.

479
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:38,051
Not much of an education.
Book smart, though.

480
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:43,760
He used to, um...
devour three and four of 'em at a time.

481
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:45,857
He was loyal.

482
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,422
Too loyal.

483
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,743
TARA: That sounds familiar.

484
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:54,100
PINEY: Yeah, they're cut
from the same cloth.

485
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,630
You know what I want to know?

486
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:04,401
Why my best friend was
afraid when he died.

487
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:16,846
TARA: I found some
of JT's old letters.

488
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:22,425
He was trying to get the club
out of the gun business.

489
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:24,896
He knew it was a risk.

490
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:27,810
Clay and the others
were invested.

491
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,333
PINEY: Trying to
get them out how?

492
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:34,383
TARA: From what I read, he had
set up a meeting in Belfast

493
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:37,805
with some IRA members
and a priest.

494
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,239
PINEY: - Kellan Ashby.
TARA: - Yes.

495
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:43,204
John wanted to end the
relationship with the Irish,

496
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,442
stop the club from selling guns.

497
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:51,233
He was killed before
that meeting happened.

498
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:59,048
GEMMA: Hey, how we doing?

499
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:00,497
TARA: Okay.

500
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:02,809
We're gonna run some more tests.

501
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:04,446
Make sure he's stable.

502
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:08,743
GEMMA: Just give him some
tequila, that'll do it.

503
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,613
TARA: I'll check
in on you later.

504
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,294
(sighs)

505
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:33,846
GEMMA: What you doing, old man?

506
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,997
What do you want with Tara?

507
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:41,260
PINEY: She's just, uh, helping
me grow old gracefully.

508
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,923
GEMMA: I know you're
bumping up against Clay.

509
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,316
That bullshit you fed
me the other day.

510
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,873
PINEY: It wasn't bullshit,
it was the truth.

511
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:54,857
You all just refuse
to look at it.

512
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:59,390
GEMMA: Well, whatever truth
you think Tara can tell you,

513
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,521
it's only going to
make things worse.

514
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:06,050
PINEY: - It can't get any worse.
GEMMA: - Back off it, Piney.

515
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,828
Leave it alone...
before it kills you.

516
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,578
PINEY: That's half the
reason I'm doing it.

517
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:28,211
(Huff and Benny groaning)

518
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:40,853
JAX: Sorry, man.

519
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,503
ARMANDO: Lost a third
of my goddamn club.

520
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:46,601
BOBBY: Take another
vote on the crank?

521
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:47,844
ARMANDO: Yeah.

522
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,952
It passed. Sorry.

523
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,327
CLAY: Are you shitting me?

524
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:54,389
ARMANDO: Guys got a taste
of the money, Clay.

525
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,124
It was unanimous.

526
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,638
We'll arrange another
depot to land the truck.

527
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:01,187
And I'll make damn sure the
crank don't get in the way.

528
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,777
You got my word.

529
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:07,453
CLAY: Shit.

530
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:10,125
JAX: We better get moving.

531
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,496
ARMANDO: Come on.

532
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:17,002
CLAY: Not a goddamn word.

533
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:34,916
GEMMA: Sorry. I, uh, I just wanted
to stop by and give you this.

534
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,707
Gold circle club.

535
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:41,815
Five grand.

536
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:45,777
RITA: In 20s?

537
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:48,311
GEMMA: Is that a problem?

538
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,600
RITA: No.

539
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:54,356
Come on in.
I'll get your information.

540
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:55,971
GEMMA: Oh, no, no,
it's not for me.

541
00:34:56,122 --> 00:35:00,048
Dr. Tara Knowles wants
to be on your committee.

542
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,792
Here's all her info.

543
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,679
Future daughter-in-law.

544
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:13,245
RITA: Lucky you.

545
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:15,662
GEMMA: Yeah-- lucky me.

546
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,717
My dead bulbs.

547
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,425
RITA: (chuckles)

548
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:25,557
GEMMA: Have a good night.

549
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:56,614
(traditional Mexican tune plays)

550
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,647
CLAY: That's some
well-guarded salsa, man.

551
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,236
ROMEO: Wait till you taste it.

552
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,535
CLAY: Chibs, come on, Chibs.

553
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:24,228
(door creaks)

554
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,241
POTTER: I'm good.

555
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:32,665
Sorry to interrupt your
solitude, Mr. Delaney.

556
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:37,435
Deputy Sheriff Gabe Marcel, San
Joaquin Sheriff's Department.

557
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:40,530
Just, uh, need a few
minutes of your time.

558
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:46,418
It's regarding the murder of
your wife, Luann Delaney.

559
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:52,624
Sanwa Sheriffs recently took
over jurisdiction of Charming.

560
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:57,019
All of Charming P.D's unresolved
cases became our responsibility.

561
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,541
I'm following up.

562
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:06,328
According to the autopsy report,
traces of semen were found in

563
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,505
your wife's undergarments.

564
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,853
The county was finally
able to run the analysis.

565
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:12,948
Got a match from the system.

566
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:15,846
A, uh...

567
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,627
Robert Munson.

568
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,462
Known as Bobby Elvis.

569
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,738
A member of your
motorcycle club.

570
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,933
Can you tell me anything
about their relationship?

571
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:36,613
And I ask, because in most
cases, 87.9% actually, the

572
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:44,299
person having sex with the
victim is the perpetrator.

573
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:50,270
And... It was...

574
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:01,858
It was a gruesome assault.

575
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:14,503
I understand you've been going
through some emotional issues.

576
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,303
Doesn't seem right you're
locked up in this box.

577
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,489
I'm going to look into that.

578
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:26,221
I'll come back a little later when
you feel a bit more... settled.

579
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,472
Have a good night.

580
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:43,416
(jail doors clanging)

581
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:36,365
CLAY: You always travel this thick, or
you expecting heat from the competition?

582
00:39:36,905 --> 00:39:38,893
ROMEO: It's just a precaution.

583
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:40,652
JAX: Should we be
taking that precaution?

584
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,960
ROMEO: Lobo Sonora doesn't
know about our deal.

585
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:47,019
If they did, they would never
risk reprisal up north.

586
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,646
LUIS: They hit us down
here, and we're prepared.

587
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,760
CLAY: That you are.

588
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,404
ROMEO: 700,000.

589
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,736
The balance for this order.

590
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,501
Half down for the next.

591
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:07,926
ROMEO (whistles): Fredo!

592
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:16,909
<i>Ábrelo.</i>

593
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,284
<i>30 kilos of uncut
Colombian cocaine.</i>

594
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,843
<i>LUIS: Give it a safe
ride, gentlemen.</i>

595
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:48,016
<i>ROMEO: We'll be up in a few days
to check on the operation.</i>

596
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,154
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:04,903
