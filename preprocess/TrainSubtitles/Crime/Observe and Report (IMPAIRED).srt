And everyone starts screaming
and clawing their eyes...

755
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,244
...and pulling at their hair,
and saying, "Help! What do we do?"

the whole world gathers below me...

1231
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:08,221
...because I don't need that shit to know
who the fuck I am.

1232
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:09,887
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1233
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,862
Fuck every one of you.

1234
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,763
I win.

1235
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,943
Way to go, Ronnie.

1236
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:45,232
I'm here with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
mall security here at the Forest Ridge Mall.

1237
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,995
Ronnie is the man who brought
the Forest Ridge Mall flasher to justice.

1238
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:52,299
We caught the flasher. Yes!

1239
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:53,998
All is back to normal?

1240
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,668
I'd say better than normal, actually.
Personal life is going fantastic.

1241
01:21:57,846 --> 01:21:59,837
I met a girl, right over there.

1242
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:03,348
She has made a promise to God
that she won't have sex before marriage...

1243
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:06,487
...but that's a promise
I intend on making her break.

1244
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,589
Gather around me, guys.
