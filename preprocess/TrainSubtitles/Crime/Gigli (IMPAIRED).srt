1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.0

2
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,360
{y:i}You see, after all is said and done...

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,720
{y:i}the only thing you can be really sure of...

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,160
{y:i}the only thing
{y:i}you can really count on in this world...

5
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,600
{y:i}is that you just never fucking know.

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,480
{y:i}I bet the last thing
{y:i}you were thinking about...

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
{y:i}when you were tying your shoelaces
{y:i}this morning...

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,720
{y:i}was that there was a chance...

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,480
{y:i}that by the end of the day, this day...

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,600
{y:i}those same shoelaces
{y:i}were going to be untied...

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,120
{y:i}by somebody working
{y:i}for the coroner's office.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,200
Am I right?

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm right, right?

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,720
Hey! Get the fuck out of here!

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,120
What, you wanna know about this?
Get out of here!

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
Take that shit to the dry cleaners.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,560
Now!

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,240
Sorry. Long day. Where was I?

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,440
You know, the human body is,
like, 80% moisture, right?

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,160
How much do you weigh? 165? 170?

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,640
Now, I figure
if you could somehow extract 80% of that...

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,800
you'd have, give me a second...

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,720
thirty-four pounds...

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
of, like, solid...

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,440
not meat...

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,800
It'd be more like beef jerky, you know?

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,200
But with hair and bones and teeth...

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,760
shriveled-up tattoos and whatnot.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,720
Probably be like this big.

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,920
In any event,
you're starting to follow my drift here, "papi"?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Because somebody has some money
that belongs to Louis.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,680
Is it you, perchance?

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,520
Is it you that has some money
that belongs to Louis?

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
No.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
- No? Sure?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm gonna start this thing and leave.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,560
What do you think?
Permanent press or delicate?

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,880
Wouldn't be appropriate if I asked you
if you had change for a dollar.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,760
I got it.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,720
Calm down. I just need four quarters.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,160
No. I got Louis' money.

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,720
You got it.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah, I do.

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,560
I got some of it, anyways.

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,120
No, this isn't what we talked about.
Now, this is... It was fucking simple.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
- You been breaking the contract.
- Right.

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
It's simple. I give you, you give me.

48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,840
You don't give me. It's a breach of contract.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,840
You're fucking up.
What do you think I'm out here for?

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm asking you a question.
What do you think I'm here for?

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,360
- Louis, I'm scared now.
- You're scared now? I don't give a fuck.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
I told you not to let this get out of control.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,080
What'd I tell you? I told you that, right?

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,160
Listen, here's what you're gonna do for me:

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,680
You're gonna come see me tomorrow
and you're going to bring me something.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,040
Okay, you hear me?

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
- Yes, I do.
- Something to scale, all right?

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Otherwise I can't talk to you no more.
All right?

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm gonna have to send Gigli over.
He's gonna have to settle up with you.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
You come to me tomorrow
or he goes to you. Very simple.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,520
- I'll be here tomorrow.
- That's good.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
- I'm not kidding.
- Get the fuck out of here.

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,120
- Okay.
- Get the fuck... Go, you fucking...

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,160
Fucking roach.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Fucking class of people.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,920
- I'm in Siberia around here.
- I know.

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,040
Fuck this city.
I don't know how you guys cut it out here.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,240
It's Gigli, by the way.

69
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
- What?
- My name is...

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,840
pronounced Gigli. It rhymes with really.

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
- Is that right? Is that so?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,720
All right.
I'll remember that for the next time, then.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,120
Meanwhile, you got something
for me, Gigli? Rhymes with really.

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,520
It's about half.

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
- Half?
- Half for today.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,640
Believe me, that's all the guy had.
It's better than nothing.

77
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,040
How about it's not better than nothing,
you fucking idiot?

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,040
Better is fuck the money
then you hurt him as to spread the word.

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,600
Since when are you authorized
to make policy decisions?

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm sorry, Louis. I didn't know.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,200
Are you all they got to offer around here?

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,720
You're supposed to be
this vicious, fucking mad dog.

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,240
Walk with me.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
There is a certain individual...

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
who is creating very substantial difficulties
for a dear friend of mine in New York.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,200
Now, this certain party...

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,960
is very bullheaded
and seems to be removed...

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,800
from what I would like to call
my sphere of influence.

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,040
- All right, how can I help?
- The plot needs a twist.

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,760
The individual needs to be touched
in some manner as to...

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,520
convince him of the error of his ways
before he can hurt other people...

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,760
- particularly my friend from New York.
- Right.

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,680
Now, this certain individual, he's got...

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
a beloved relative
with certain psychological defects.

96
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,280
I want the relative gotten, all right?

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,280
And I want him, for the time being,
held on to.

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,640
Perhaps then reason can prevail.

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,520
- You're following all this?
- Yeah, all of it.

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Got it.

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,280
All right. Wait.

102
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,200
- Where is he?
- Over there.

103
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Right there? That's him?

104
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,720
All right. Thanks.

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm all right. You can go outside.
I'm okay. Thanks.

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you Brian?

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,760
I know you're Brian.
Your friend ratted you out back there.

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Hello?

109
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
What are you eating there?
What do you got?

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,160
- What are those, polly seeds?
- They're not. You're stupid.

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm stupid.

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,440
- They look like polly seeds to me.
- They're sunflower seeds.

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
That's the same thing.

114
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
We called them polly seeds
when I was a kid.

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,920
You must be the stupidest person,
you piss-head, pisser-fucker.

116
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,360
Me and you, we're supposed
to go for a quick walk. You ready?

117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,000
We'll take a walk around the block.
What do you say?

118
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,880
I won't give anybody my seeds.

119
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Barry always asks
why I don't give anybody any.

120
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,920
Don't worry about it. Keep those.
That's for you, okay?

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
Let's go. We're gonna take a walk. Come on.

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,720
What did that?

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
He's kidding.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,320
Sorry about that. All right, look...

125
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,280
it's real simple.

126
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,760
You and I are gonna go outside
and take a little walk.

127
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,360
I won't grab you again, okay?

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,040
I have to go to the Baywatch.

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm sorry, what?

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
I have to go to the Baywatch.
I was gonna go.

131
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
You wanna watch "Baywatch"?

132
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
Roll by my apartment,
we'll turn on "Baywatch".

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,080
You're the stupidest person.

134
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Not television. The Baywatch.

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,560
The Baywatch?

136
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,600
- Yeah, the Baywatch.
- Okay.

137
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
Can I go?

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,160
- You wanna go now?
- To the Baywatch.

139
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Yeah. I'm going there. I was on my way.

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
- Yes, I would.
- All right.

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
Let's go.

142
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
Come on, let's go.

143
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Okay, I gotta get my radio.

144
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,040
- The music's gonna be good there.
- Okay, good.

145
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
Baywatch!

146
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Here we come.

147
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Wait a minute.
You hear that, now? What is that?

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,880
- You hear that?
- No.

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,160
Yep, it's my walkie-talkie calling.

150
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah, hello?

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,000
I told you, don't ever bother me again
when I'm taking trips with my friends.

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,280
What? No, we're going to the Baywatch.

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
Yep, that's right, the Baywatch.

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
No. Holy mackerel.

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,280
Would you know
when they'll be open again?

156
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
We'll call you tomorrow for the update.

157
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,800
How do you like that?
Baywatch is closed today.

158
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,880
- No.
- Tomorrow we'll go.

159
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
I can't believe it.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
This always happens like that, right?
When you plan a big trip.

161
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Hello there. P.O.B.

162
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,640
What does that mean?

163
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,400
P.O.B. Limo drivers say that.

164
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,880
That's good. What does it mean?

165
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
P.O.B. Passenger On Board.

166
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
- Already?
{y:i}- Yeah, already.

167
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
That's good.
You headed back to your place?

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,480
- I am.
{y:i}- Good.

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,920
{y:i}- We'll talk later.
- Yeah, we'll talk later.

170
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on in. It's all right. I don't bite.

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
You hungry? I got food.

172
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
You thirsty?

173
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
I want a soda.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
You want a soda? I'm out of soda.
Want a water?

175
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,600
You want a water? I'll get you a water.

176
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,520
All right. How is that? Good?

177
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,520
- I wanna go home.
- All right, you got to stay here for a little bit.

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
No, I wanna go home.

179
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,560
No, we got to stay here.
Can't do it right now.

180
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,080
So maybe you wanna watch TV or cartoons?

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,480
I wanna go home.

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,760
- We got to stay here.
- No.

183
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,160
Brian, what are you doing?

184
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,800
- Take me home now.
- Stop.

185
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,040
- Fuck all of you! You stupid soup-fucker!
- What?

186
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
- Don't do that, motherfucker!
- What's wrong with you? Cut that out.

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,640
- Cut it out! Stop! Be quiet!
- I'm going to the Baywatch.

188
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
All right.

189
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,680
Where are my seeds?

190
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,280
They're sunflower seeds, idiot.

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,560
They're right there.

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,880
- They're sunflower seeds.
- Behind you. Right there.

193
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,160
Stay here.

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,560
Everything's fine. Just kidding around.

195
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
- Hello.
- Hi.

196
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,240
May I be of some assistance?

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,680
Well, that remains to be seen.

198
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,800
Look, I'm sorry to bother you. It's just...

199
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,360
I was wondering if it wouldn't be
too much trouble if I could use your phone.

200
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,120
- That's...
- Right.

201
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,280
I just took a one-bedroom in the front...

202
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,680
and I've been waiting all day for
the phone company to come hook me up.

203
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,120
- You know...
- Yeah, it's just kind of a bad...

204
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,440
It'll only take a second, I promise.
You know, it's probably a local call.

205
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
I can't. I'm sorry.

206
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,480
I'll be in and out before you know it.
I promise.

207
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
Just leave a faint scent.

208
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,720
Yeah, all right. Come on in.

209
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,040
- Thank you.
- Sure.

210
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,760
The phone's right there.

211
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,800
- I promise it'll only take a minute.
- All right.

212
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Hello.

213
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,040
What are you doing?
Go sit down in the kitchen.

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,160
These computer answering things,
they drive me nuts.

215
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,720
- You're making a telephone call.
- Right, she's making a telephone call.

216
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Don't call Baywatch
because they're closed today.

217
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
I wouldn't think of it.

218
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm sorry, I got to ask.
Do we know each other?

219
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Not yet.

220
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm Ricki.

221
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,400
Larry Gigli, right?

222
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,720
- I saw it on the mailbox.
- Yeah, it's pronounced Gigli.

223
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Rhymes with really.

224
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,720
- It's nice to meet you, Larry Gigli.
- Nice to meet you, Larry.

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,320
What's your name?

226
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,680
Bob.

227
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,280
- You're stupid. That's not my name.
- That's not your name?

228
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,920
- What is your name, sweetie?
- That's it. His name's Bob.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,160
- His name's not Bob.
- Your name is Bob.

230
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,280
Whatever your name is...

231
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
has anyone ever told you
you're a very handsome young man?

232
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

233
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,720
Sure.

234
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,800
In private.

235
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,040
I can't fucking believe this.

236
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
It's an unexpected bonus. Who'd have
thought you were a babe magnet?

237
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,360
- You're better than a dog.
- You're a dog, you dog-head piss-fart!

238
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,560
Whatever.

239
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,040
You know,
I heard you were a bit of a fuckup.

240
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,040
But I gotta tell you, I'm frankly amazed
at how much of a fuckup you actually are.

241
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,160
- Am I missing something here?
- It would seem so.

242
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,520
Why don't you call Louis
and he'll explain everything to you.

243
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know that I know any Louis.

244
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,200
Then I guess he hasn't called you
to tell you he doesn't trust you...

245
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,000
with a task of this magnitude.

246
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,080
That he feels the stakes are too high.

247
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,160
- Nope.
- "Nope."

248
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,160
I guess he also probably
hasn't called to tell you...

249
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,080
that he'd feel more comfortable if there were
two independent, unacquainted...

250
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,960
perhaps even mutually hostile
contractors working on this...

251
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,720
so they could keep an eye on one another.

252
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,360
Nope. There's no reason
for you to take my word...

253
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,000
for precisely
how second-rate he considers you.

254
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,240
It'd probably make both our lives a lot easier
if you just heard it directly from him.

255
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,200
That's good stuff. I had that today.

256
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,480
- Excuse me one minute.
- Sure.

257
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,440
Louis, you there?

258
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,160
I'm here. What do you want?

259
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,080
Yeah, there's this...

260
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,960
young lady here trying to tell me that...

261
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,600
All right, this thing is monumental.

262
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,840
Certainly too big for a jerk-off like yourself,
but I had no choice.

263
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,080
{y:i}This thing represents my ass and my future.

264
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,040
I want you to work with her and I want you
to watch her as she will be watching you.

265
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,920
I want you to know...

266
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,440
that I will personally excoriate
anyone responsible...

267
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,600
for the tiniest fuckup in this action.

268
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,280
{y:i}- And I want you to understand that.
- Yes, Louis.

269
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,840
"Yes, Louis"?

270
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
Do you happen to know
what "excoriate" means?

271
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,200
It's not coming to me at the moment.

272
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,600
It means "to strip or wear off the skin of...

273
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,880
"to flay."

274
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,280
{y:i}I'm learning a word a day. And it's critical
{y:i}to use these words in conversation...

275
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,760
but that's not why I used it
in this conversation.

276
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,120
{y:i}In this conversation
{y:i}I used it because I meant it.

277
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,120
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be going now.

278
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,080
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, don't worry about it.

279
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,080
Now don't get yourself all tied in a knot.

280
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,600
Okay? I don't know this guy,
and he doesn't know me.

281
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,880
But my reputation apparently is pretty solid.

282
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,200
So why don't you just get yourself straight...

283
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
and we can put this whole thing behind us.

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,440
And if you have
any decaffeinated or herbal tea...

285
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,320
I would really be most appreciative.

286
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
- I want tea.
- Two teas.

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,920
Let me tell you something, okay?

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,880
I don't know who the fuck you think you are,
but I don't work like this.

289
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
You got that?

290
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,440
If you wanna talk about reputations...

291
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,280
and if by some fucking miracle long shot
you haven't heard of my reputation...

292
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,160
let me tell you who the fuck I am.

293
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,800
I am the fucking Sultan of Slick, Sadie.
I am the Rule of fucking Cool.

294
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,360
You wanna be a gangster?
You wanna be a thug?

295
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,360
You sit at my fucking feet. Gather the pearls
that emanate forth from me.

296
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,800
Because I'm the fucking original,
straight-first-foremost, pimp-mack...

297
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,320
fucking hustler,
original gangster's gangster.

298
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,640
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I'm gonna get my stuff.

299
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,440
And don't you worry your little
gangster's gangster head about it...

300
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
I can manage.

301
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,200
How many cups of your own spit
you think you swallow every day, Larry?

302
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,720
I think about 35 cups.

303
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,520
- Would you just shut the fuck up.
- You're an idiot!

304
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,680
- What is it with you?
- No, you.

305
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,200
- What, you just go in and out?
- You're an idiot.

306
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You're the fuck, you stupid duck-fuck.

307
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,960
Do me a favor
and just act fucking normal for a minute.

308
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,600
- Looks like...
- Just for a minute.

309
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,720
You'll end up with Elliot over there.

310
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,720
I know you understand
what I'm talking about. Fucking be normal.

311
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,760
- I'm telling you...
- Not fucking crazy! Normal!

312
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,040
How about if I smack you
in the fucking head?

313
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Leave him alone. We're supposed
to watch him, not slap him around.

314
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,160
Don't tell me what we're supposed to do.

315
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
How about this?
You leave him alone or I'll kill you.

316
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,640
You'll kill me? Fuck you! Go ahead.

317
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,880
I'll kill you.

318
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,640
You don't tell me what to do. Okay?

319
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't tell me what we might do.
Don't tell me what we're supposed to do.

320
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,800
Don't tell me what we maybe should do.
Don't ever tell me nothing!

321
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,920
I'll tell you this,
you leave him alone or I'll kill you.

322
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm gonna say 35 cups.
I'm gonna say 35 cups of spit.

323
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm a genius. I'm a genius, man.

324
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,440
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

325
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,480
Look, why don't we try
and make this pleasant.

326
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,480
Nice.

327
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Easy.

328
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,320
So, what do you normally hire out for?

329
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
I do jobs of various types.

330
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,920
- How about yourself?
- Me, too.

331
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,400
I do various types of jobs of various kinds.

332
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,160
There you have it.

333
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,680
How come I never seen you around before?

334
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm from another place.

335
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,520
Where would that be, Ricki?

336
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
Somewhere else, Larry.

337
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,800
Okay. I see.

338
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,160
- And my name's not really Ricki.
- And what would it be, then?

339
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,520
Then how about I keep calling you Ricki
just to piss you off?

340
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,200
- Lf it'll make you happy.
- Yeah, it will.

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
- This isn't very good food.
- Too bad. That's your dinner. Eat it.

342
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
- I'm hungry.
- Fuck.

343
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,560
- He said he's hungry.
- So? Let him eat his food.

344
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,120
- I don't like this food.
- Too bad! Eat your food, stupid!

345
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,520
Back off! God! It's not his fault.

346
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,960
Yeah, it's not my fault I'm brain-damaged.

347
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,400
Beautiful. What are you, his shop steward?

348
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,320
Listen, you fucking retard, eat your...

349
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
- Enough! Easy already.
- Not enough.

350
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,840
- What is your...
- Let me tell you something.

351
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,840
In every relationship
there's a bull and a cow.

352
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,240
It so happens that in this relationship
right here with me and you...

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,880
I'm the bull, you're the cow.

354
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,840
All right? Bull. Cow.

355
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,880
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got it. Bull, cow.

356
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
You make him something else to eat.
Otherwise, mind your business.

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,480
I wanna go home.

358
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,160
You can't go home.

359
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,720
- I wanna go home.
- You can't go home right now!

360
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,360
- Eat your food!
- Piss you! I want to go home!

361
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,480
How you gonna go
to the Baywatch tomorrow if you go home?

362
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,080
This is your spot. Yeah?

363
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,840
It's nice. Come on. Lie down.

364
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,400
This is a couch.

365
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,280
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It's a good sleeping place. Lie down.

366
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,120
Larry, read to me.

367
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,080
- What?
- Read to me, Larry.

368
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,560
Read to him, Larry.

369
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I don't wanna read to him.
What do I got to read to him for?

370
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
Read to me, Larry.

371
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
- What for?
- It soothes me down.

372
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,280
- It soothes you down?
- Come on, Larry, read to him.

373
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
- What am I gonna read? I got nothing here.
- Read him a book.

374
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,840
You don't have a book?

375
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,280
- I got a phone book.
- There you go.

376
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,960
- Read to me, Larry.
- All right, fine.

377
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Here you go.

378
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,160
"Since 1868.

379
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,040
"For well over a century,
the adventurous flavor of Tabasco sauce...

380
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,720
"has fired up generations of thrill-seekers."

381
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
- Okay?
- That was good.

382
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Read to me more.

383
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,920
"Lts all-natural ingredients and
unique aging process in white oak barrels...

384
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,000
"keeps Tabasco
on the culinary cutting edge.

385
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,640
"Try it on eggs, pizza, salads,

386
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,160
"for a burst of flavor
that will tantalize your taste buds." That's it.

387
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,400
- Read to me more.
- That's it.

388
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm not reading the ingredients. I'm done.

389
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,200
- Okay, thank you, Larry.
- Sure.

390
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
Tell you what, no offense...

391
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,240
you don't look like any contractor
I ever met.

392
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Apparently, there's a need for all types.

393
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,520
So listen.

394
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,960
You know, I was thinking
about what you said before...

395
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,560
about us being stuck in this situation.
There's nothing we can do.

396
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,440
I think you're right.
We might as well make the best of it.

397
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
I think so.

398
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,880
So, you know, look,
don't take this the wrong way, believe me.

399
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,960
But I just... This is, you know...

400
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,800
I hate to see you sleep on the floor like that.
I mean, come on.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,400
So if you want to,
you can go ahead and just, you know...

402
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
just take half of my bed.

403
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
'Cause we're working together.
We're grownups, right?

404
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,840
You know, we're partners. We'll just...

405
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,520
do the whole thing professionally.

406
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,840
That's very kind of you. Thank you.
I mean, I'd love to.

407
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,880
You know, professionally.

408
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,920
Please.

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,560
How's that professionally? You like that?

410
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
That's professional. Right here.

411
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,360
Bull. Cow. That's how that works.

412
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,680
There's your bull right there!
There's your bull.

413
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,640
There's the horn.

414
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,880
You fuck with the bull, you get the horn.

415
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,200
That's professional.

416
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,040
Fucking professional.

417
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
Look at that.

418
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,720
That's the bull. Right.

419
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,240
Get the bull by the horn.
You know what I'm talking about?

420
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,160
I'll give you the horn. Want to see the horn?

421
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,680
You know...

422
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,640
you're actually a very attractive woman.

423
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,400
Thank you.

424
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,040
You're welcome.

425
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,760
You know, this may be a good time
to suggest...

426
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,440
that you not allow the seeds of cruel hope
to sprout in your soul.

427
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,920
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds beautiful.

428
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,800
It means you're not my type.

429
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,560
Is that right?

430
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,000
What about me is not your type?

431
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,520
Your penis.

432
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
What does that mean?

433
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,520
It means I'm gay.

434
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
It means I'm a lesbian.

435
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,000
But I got to tell you, if I wasn't...

436
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,280
I mean, after a first date like this,
I'd find it really hard...

437
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,720
not to just get under the covers
and do you bigtime right now.

438
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Good night.

439
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,240
"Good night"?

440
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,920
{y:i}Whoa, Step-papa.
{y:i}With that sassy new look...

441
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,000
{y:i}sheep's all that and a bag of chips.

442
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,760
{y:i}Melbourne's forecast. ;
{y:i}The chance of a brief shower tomorrow...

443
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,720
{y:i}but we're expecting a mostly fine day with
{y:i}a light-to-moderate southwestwardly wind.

444
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,360
Who the fuck are you talking to?

445
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,280
{y:i}Sydney also fine and 18.
{y:i}Brisbane, showers...

446
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,360
Give me that back, please.

447
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,920
{y:i}- Sunny, 32.
- Give me that.

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
{y:i}Adelaide and Hobart both
{y:i}mainly fine days tomorrow. Around our...

449
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,280
You know how much this shit costs?

450
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,560
- It's $5.
- No, it's not $5.

451
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
- It's $10.
- No, it's...

452
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,080
Why am I even talking to you for?

453
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,360
- It's $10.
- Yeah, it's $10. All right.

454
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,920
Just wanted to tell you, you know,
just get straight about that thing last night.

455
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
You know, no hard feelings.

456
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
You know what I mean?
I don't want you to get upset or nothing.

457
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,440
That's it. Don't be coming back, though.
I mean, it's a one-time offer.

458
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,160
One shot with me. I'm out.

459
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
Are you expecting somebody?

460
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
Come on!

461
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
- Larry!
- Shit!

462
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,560
- It's your mother.
- Fuck! It's a cop.

463
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,840
Open the door!

464
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,840
- I was watching that.
- Be quiet.

465
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,600
Go in this room. Go. I want you to stay here.

466
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,360
- Don't come out. Don't say anything.
- We're going to Baywatch?

467
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,360
- Yeah. Soon. Stay here. Be quiet.
- Okay.

468
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,640
- Come on, I'm dying here!
- Coming!

469
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,000
- Larry, I have a chicken.
- Don't say anything.

470
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,040
What?

471
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,440
Your door's not thick enough to pretend
you're not home when you're home.

472
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,240
- What's up?
- I was in the neighborhood.

473
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,600
- How are you today?
- Just fine. Yourself?

474
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,240
Just fine.

475
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,280
I'm searching for news on the underground.

476
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,760
Might you know what it is I'm getting at?

477
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,880
- No.
- No. Well...

478
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,680
This is one of those mysterious cases.

479
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,040
Unsolvable. Probably turn out
to be an alien abduction, but you know...

480
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,800
we're obligated to at least create
the appearance of due diligence.

481
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,960
- What?
- I didn't say nothing.

482
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,760
You know, your friend Louis...

483
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,120
his supervisor back in the home office
is about to fold his napkin, right?

484
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,240
- Sorry?
- Starkman, in New York.

485
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
He's through.

486
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,800
Looking at huge federal time.
Big, ugly, dark dungeon underground.

487
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,960
No chance of parole, never ever. Time.

488
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,880
Yep. I'm sorry to say.

489
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,920
I hear he's a good guy, but, you know...

490
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
In any event, here's my problem...

491
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,240
and if you know any of this,
feel free, jump in, shut me up.

492
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,800
This federal prosecutor out here...

493
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,000
the one with Starkman's testicular matter
clutched in his fist...

494
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,960
this very federal prosecutor's
little brother...

495
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,720
Any of this sound familiar?

496
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,040
To me? No.

497
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,120
No. Well...

498
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,520
This very federal prosecutor's little brother,
a bit dopey from what I gather...

499
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,320
may have been absconded with...

500
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,120
which, as you can imagine,
would be to the dismay of our prosecutor.

501
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,120
I think...

502
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,560
But I could be wrong about this because
it's almost too stupid for a mind to grasp.

503
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,520
But I think maybe someone...

504
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,800
in your professional community...

505
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,000
might be participating
in these shenanigans...

506
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,480
to, I don't know...

507
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,040
help squeeze a little friendship...

508
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,440
altruism, whatever,
out of this particular federal official.

509
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,200
Maybe in the hopes that Starkman...

510
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,920
will wake up one morning...

511
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,240
And wake up one morning
to find all charges mysteriously dropped.

512
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,880
The school of thought of my colleagues
is that this kid is already way out of town.

513
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,560
I alone am of the opposite school.
I think he's still here. That's what I think.

514
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,720
But what's important is what you think.
What do you think?

515
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,120
As a friend who's got his ear to the street.
Seriously.

516
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
- I never... You know...
- I know.

517
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,480
You don't know nothing.

518
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
I can tell just by looking at you.

519
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,760
The whole thing's probably
alien abduction, like I said before.

520
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,040
Man, you know what I'd love to do...

521
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
right now?

522
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,040
Go down to Marie Callender's...

523
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,720
get me a big bowl, pie, some ice cream on it.

524
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,240
Good.

525
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,480
Put some on your head...

526
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,200
your tongue would slap your brains out
trying to get to it.

527
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,800
Interested?

528
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,120
Sure?

529
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,120
Yeah, I'm trying to get in shape, you know.

530
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,880
Say no more.

531
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Thanks for the hospitality.

532
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,240
It can't be the most pleasant thing
to have your privacy be intruded on.

533
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,680
Maybe if you hear anything,
you'll let me know?

534
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah, you know, if I hear anything.

535
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,120
Yeah, I'll let you know.

536
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,240
All right.

537
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
A federal fucking prosecutor!

538
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,880
- Fuck!
- Larry?

539
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,720
- I'll come back now, okay?
- What are you doing? I told you to...

540
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,080
- I'm hungry.
- We got nothing to eat.

541
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,760
- I'm hungry, though.
- A federal fucking prosecutor.

542
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,280
- My brother's a federal fucking "prostitutor."
- You don't say.

543
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,080
Put this on.

544
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,840
- Did you know about all that stuff?
- No, not all of it.

545
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,160
- Maybe we should check into a hotel.
- Fuck that.

546
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,480
I live here. This is my place.

547
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,120
No one's getting me out of my place.
Put this on, too.

548
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
- I'm hungry. I wanna eat.
- I heard you the first fucking five times.

549
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on.

550
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,920
Fucking around.

551
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,320
When are we getting to the Baywatch?

552
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,520
- What? What's that? You hear that?
- No.

553
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,160
What is that? It's the walkie-talkie again.

554
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,920
Hello? What?

555
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,680
You got to be kidding me. Again?
What's the deal with these guys?

556
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,480
How long? Maybe tomorrow? Okay.

557
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Kick those guys in the ass for me, will you?

558
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Those fucking guys. All right.

559
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,120
Talk to you later. Give us a call back.

560
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,920
Unbelievable.

561
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,080
You believe that?
The Baywatch is closed today. Again.

562
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,040
- They're closed?
- Yeah, I talked to them.

563
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,800
They said they're working on the problem,
but, you know...

564
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,400
they don't know how long it's gonna be.

565
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
What is the Baywatch?

566
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,880
It's where all the beautiful girls are.
They swim.

567
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,520
They swim there.

568
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,000
- You're talking about the TV show?
- No, you... Not TV. That's TV.

569
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,840
The Baywatch is where they really are.
They're really there.

570
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,760
I think you could be friends there.

571
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,120
I think that's where the sex is. I think so.

572
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,320
- Hey, you wanna turn that down?
- You fucking turn it down.

573
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,840
I don't think this is the best time
to be drawing attention to ourselves.

574
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,680
- Hey, Beavis, turn the fucking radio off.
- What the fuck is your problem, bitch?

575
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,760
"Bitch"?

576
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,920
You know what, creating a scene right now
would be a bad thing.

577
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,240
Yeah, that's right. Why don't you come here
so we can kick your ass.

578
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,560
What happened?

579
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
Let me. Okay?

580
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Go ahead.

581
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,360
You know, what you boys need
is to develop better people skills.

582
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,120
However, in the meantime...

583
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,000
Excuse me.

584
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,320
You ever heard of Tai Moi Chai?

585
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,560
No. Okay.

586
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,400
In traditional Tai Moi Chai,
there are five levels of digital orb extrusion.

587
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,720
That's the gouging out
of your opponent's eyeball...

588
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
with one's finger.

589
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,920
The highest and most difficult to master
is my personal favorite:

590
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,240
"Kai Toi Mai".

591
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,720
Loosely translated,
that's "the rip that takes the past."

592
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,960
Now, once the thumb liquefies the eye...

593
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,200
it is deftly and immediately replaced
by the forefinger.

594
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,320
Deep thrust, hooking around
and securing the ocular nerve...

595
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,640
and then removing it with such force...

596
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,400
as to bring with it, by suction,
a vital portion of the visual cortex.

597
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,080
The part of the brain, as I'm sure
you may know, that stores visual memory.

598
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,440
The extraordinary element of this move...

599
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,040
the genius of it...

600
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,320
the absolute poetry of it...

601
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
is that, aside from the obvious wound...

602
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,520
one's opponent is left with no memory
of anything he has ever seen.

603
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,040
Family, friends, nothing.

604
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,960
Hence, "Kai Toi Mai":

605
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,920
"The rip that takes the past."

606
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
As you can imagine, very difficult
to practice in the United States...

607
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,840
but I felt well worth the trips
to the Chang Rai Province.

608
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,040
People skills.

609
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,760
See, knowing
how to properly judge character...

610
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,400
knowing how and when to make a move...

611
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,960
in short,
knowing who to and who not to fuck with.

612
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,960
These are things you boys are gonna
wanna work on in the future. Okay?

613
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,560
And one more thing:

614
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,960
Sports are all well and good,
but very hard to earn a living at.

615
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,800
So I want you guys to study hard
and keep your grades up, all right?

616
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,280
- Okay? Everyone, yes?
- Yes.

617
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay. Good.

618
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
Brian, let's go.

619
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
Nice computer.

620
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,440
Here's suck-my-dick. Com.

621
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,480
So can you really do all that kung fu shit...

622
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,000
you said back there with the eye and that?

623
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,560
No.

624
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,760
That was all bullshit?

625
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,120
Sun Tzu said that in a war...

626
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,400
the best victory
is that which requires no battle.

627
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,120
- Is this some more bullshit now I'm getting?
- No.

628
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,720
Who's Sun Tzu?

629
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,080
A Chinese military theoretician
who pointed out...

630
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,360
that in a conflict, getting angry,
which you seem to do a lot of...

631
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,280
is a tactically and strategically stupid move.

632
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,880
It clouds your ability to reason.
It gives your adversary the upper hand.

633
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,240
You wanna cloud
your adversary's ability to reason...

634
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,800
thus gaining the upper hand yourself.

635
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,560
Whatever.

636
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,400
You know,
given how unhappy you seem to be...

637
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,400
I can see how that wouldn't be
the easiest thing for you to do.

638
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,560
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Just that.

639
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,960
I mean...

640
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,200
when men are boys, they're encouraged
not to cry, not to show their sadness...

641
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,320
so they're forced to find other ways to let
those feelings out. As I'm sure you know...

642
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,560
fighting and getting angry
are much more acceptable male behaviors.

643
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,160
So when these boys grow up, guess what
outlet they use to express their sadness.

644
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,560
A guy who's miserable at work
or depressed about his life...

645
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,560
comes home at night, what does he do?

646
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,080
He doesn't usually cry
in front of the wife and kids.

647
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,320
He usually yells at them.

648
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,600
So, Larry...

649
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,800
What?

650
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,240
What is it exactly you're so sad about?

651
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,120
No, I'm serious.

652
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,680
Yeah. What about your friend?

653
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,720
Mrs. Leonard. Whatever her name is.

654
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,800
Look, I can't right now, I'm sorry.
It's not a good time.

655
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,560
It's not a good time, Ma, that's why.

656
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,480
No.

657
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,360
Okay. All right!

658
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,160
What do you want, blood?
I said okay. I'm coming over, all right?

659
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,600
I'll be right over there.

660
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,720
I got to make a quick detour.
You can stay in the car.

661
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,440
Easy. A little lower.

662
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
- Right here?
- A little bit higher.

663
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,440
- A little lower.
- Ma.

664
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,120
All right, right there. God.

665
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,520
Look, Ma, if Mrs. Leonard isn't around,
you'll have to call a doctor sometimes.

666
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,720
I can't just drop everything
and show up here all the time, okay?

667
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,160
What, and I didn't drop everything for you?

668
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,520
"I'm so sorry, Larry,
I can't change your diaper now.

669
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,240
"You're gonna have to call Mrs. Leonard."

670
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,440
- Let me just...
- Let me. Hold on.

671
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,680
- What?
- He's got to pee.

672
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,240
I got to pee, Larry.

673
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,360
I thought I told you to wait in the car.

674
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,840
I thought you'd prefer it if we came in
rather than take the car somewhere.

675
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,440
Wouldn't want you to think
we lammed out on you.

676
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,720
Besides, I want to meet your mother.

677
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,360
- No.
- Larry, are those friends of yours?

678
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,800
- Yeah, close, personal.
- Well, invite them in.

679
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,880
I got to pee, Larry.

680
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,680
- Larry, invite them in!
- I am, Ma, all right?

681
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,120
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

682
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,080
My God.

683
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,880
- What a beauty.
- Ma.

684
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,920
What? I'm just saying.

685
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,480
You should see some of the pigs
he's brought by.

686
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,440
I mean, not that they were pigs, per se.

687
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,160
It's just that, by and large, they were
what I would call insignificant women.

688
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,560
You, I could tell right off the bat,
you seem to be of some substance.

689
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,440
- Excuse me, miss, where's the men's room?
- Right this way, darling.

690
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,880
Larry, she's gorgeous.
Don't you fuck this one up.

691
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,080
- So, what is your story, honey?
- I'm Larry's friend.

692
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,720
- Don't pay no attention to her.
- She thinks I'm beautiful.

693
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,200
Yeah. She's blind in one eye, though.

694
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,680
Open the door.

695
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,800
You all right in there?

696
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,480
So this is where you grew up?

697
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,280
Are you writing a book?

698
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,040
- Ma.
- Shut up. I didn't say anything.

699
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,360
I think you two
make a very cute couple, though.

700
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,840
- Ma.
- What?

701
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,800
What's with the "Ma"?

702
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,320
Stop already with the "Ma."

703
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,560
So, tell me...

704
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,920
are you and Larry sweethearts?

705
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,960
Before you answer,
let me say up front that I hope so.

706
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,720
What? Yes, I hope so.

707
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,920
What's so terrible about "I hope so"?

708
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,840
- Yeah? Guess what.
- What?

709
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,240
She's a lesbian.

710
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,800
Never mind.

711
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,640
She's been with fellas before.
Am I right, darling?

712
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,880
You're right.

713
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,000
But sometimes they have their limitations.
Am I right?

714
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,800
What are you two talking about?

715
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,520
Never mind.
We know what we're talking about.

716
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,400
- Am I right, sweetheart?
- You're right.

717
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,280
You know,
I wasn't always just Larry's mother.

718
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,400
I used to be...

719
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,960
quite experimental.

720
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,000
- Jesus Christ!
- Look at him!

721
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,240
Look who's not up-to-the-minute now.

722
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,080
- Big boy.
- That's it. We're going.

723
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,520
Brian, come on. We're going. That's it.
Ma, what...

724
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,080
All right. Just remember, you two,
life's not just black-and-white.

725
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,280
All right, we'll remember that.
Brian, let's go. We're going now.

726
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,840
- Let's go.
- Come here, you big lug, give me a kiss.

727
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,400
- I love you.
- Yeah.

728
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
- I washed my hands.
- Congratulations. Let's go.

729
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
- Goodbye.
- Come here, darling.

730
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,760
I feel like I know you already.

731
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,640
- Very nice meeting you.
- It's my pleasure.

732
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,240
All right, we're going. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go, Brian.

733
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,440
Just remember, you two, keep an open mind
because you never know.

734
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,920
- We will.
- Bye!

735
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
- I like her, she's very nice.
- Man.

736
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,280
{y:i}On the satellite map,
{y:i}the cloud over Queensland...

737
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,320
{y:i}and New South Wales is bringing showers...

738
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,240
{y:i}and there's very little activity
{y:i}over the rest of the continent.

739
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,000
{y:i}But there is some low-level cloud
{y:i}over Southern Victoria...

740
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,920
{y:i}which will bring isolated showers
{y:i}mainly to the coastal areas.

741
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
{y:i}Another chilly night in Melbourne's suburbs
{y:i}with the mercury...

742
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,040
- What are you doing now?
{y:i}...and Avalon falling as low...

743
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,760
- Brian, I told you, this is very expensive.
- It's not expensive.

744
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,880
Don't argue with me.

745
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,760
Why are you doing this? What do you care
about the weather in fucking England for?

746
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,840
- Australia.
- Whatever.

747
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,400
It's not England.

748
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,400
Whatever, Brian.
Why do you keep calling there?

749
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,080
I really like her voice.

750
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,120
Okay. Try to keep it under control, though.

751
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,480
- All right?
- Okay, Larry, I'll try.

752
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

753
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,960
So I'm not your type?

754
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,560
How did we get back there all of a sudden?

755
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,360
Relax.

756
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,200
You're more woman
than I know what to do with.

757
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,880
I don't need to be dipping
into the sisterhood.

758
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,760
But I'm just curious
because all of a sudden now...

759
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,360
you say you've been with guys.

760
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,840
I have.

761
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,080
But they have their shortcomings?

762
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,960
Besides the fact that they give terrible head.

763
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,400
See, right there, that tells me something.

764
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,600
I know the guys you've been with
obviously didn't know...

765
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,800
how to bring home the pearls
when they were diving for oysters.

766
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,600
I was actually just joking.

767
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,840
Well, since we're letting it all hang out now,
let me tell you something else.

768
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,200
Okay, when it comes to pleasing a woman,
your girlfriends, they're just...

769
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,120
they're at a natural disadvantage.

770
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,440
It's like they might try hard,
but they're just not backed up...

771
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,240
with millions of years of
genetic engineering, programming, instinct.

772
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,840
Nature has evolved man for that purpose.

773
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,920
Satisfy.

774
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,200
Lead the pack.

775
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,520
That's why lesbians are always buying,
spending their dough on, you know...

776
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,240
sexual appliances, erotic monkey wrenches
and shit, trying to compensate...

777
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,280
for what they don't have.
What they're not getting.

778
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,880
The penis. That's right.

779
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,800
Its very design
tells you everything you need to know.

780
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,560
Forward motion. With advancements.

781
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,120
Fucking progress into the dark, deep...

782
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,840
mysterious unknown.

783
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,880
It's like adventure-seeking...

784
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,960
frontier-conquering...

785
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,440
obstacle-eradicating.

786
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,440
And you tried to create the impression
you didn't read books.

787
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,880
You're settling for second best.
That's all I'm saying.

788
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,400
So, in review...

789
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,520
you're saying...

790
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,720
that it's men
that are at the top of the must-fuck pyramid?

791
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,520
That's all I'm telling you.

792
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,080
Loving, caring...

793
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,920
- sensitive, giving men.
- That's right.

794
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,840
You're entitled to your opinion.

795
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,080
But let us reconsider women for a minute.

796
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,960
- Shall we?
- Sure.

797
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,160
Their form:

798
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,200
Neck. Shoulders.

799
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,360
Legs.

800
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,560
Hips.

801
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,960
I think pretty cool.

802
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,440
Now, as far as your famous...

803
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,720
penis goes...

804
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,680
The penis is like some sort of...

805
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,480
bizarre sea slug...

806
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,360
or like a really long toe.

807
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,800
I mean, it's handy, important even.
But the pinnacle of sexual design?

808
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,880
The top of the list of erotic destinations?
I don't think so.

809
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,320
One's first impulse is to kiss what?

810
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,040
To kiss the lips.

811
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
Firm...

812
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,640
delicious lips. Sweet lips.

813
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,120
Surrounding a warm, moist...

814
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,760
dizzyingly scented mouth.

815
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,440
That's what everyone wants to kiss.

816
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,800
Not a toe. Not a sea slug.

817
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,240
A mouth.

818
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,920
And why do you think that is, stupid?

819
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,320
Because the mouth is the twin sister...

820
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,240
the almost exact look-alike of the what?

821
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,520
Not the toe.

822
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,400
The mouth is the twin sister...

823
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,720
of the vagina.

824
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,440
And all creatures big and small
seek the orifice.

825
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,160
The opening. To be taken in, engulfed.

826
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,480
To be squeezed and lovingly crushed
by what is truly...

827
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,880
the all-powerful, all-encompassing.

828
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,160
Now, if it's design you're concerned with...

829
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
hidden meanings, symbolism and power...

830
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,720
forget the top of Mount Everest.

831
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,040
Forget the bottom of the sea,
the moon, the stars.

832
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,760
There is no place, nowhere,
that has been the object...

833
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,400
of more ambitions, more battles
than the sweet, sacred mystery...

834
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,400
between a woman's legs
that I am proud to call...

835
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,200
my pussy.

836
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,840
So I guess this is just my roundabout way
of saying...

837
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,520
that it is women who are,
in fact, the most desirable form.

838
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,920
Wouldn't you agree?

839
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,400
I agree.

840
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,720
And so do I.

841
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,960
{y:i}Hello?

842
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,240
{y:i}- Is somebody there?
- Yes.

843
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,640
Who's this?

844
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,600
I don't find this funny.

845
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,600
Is this the retard?

846
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,840
Brian, what are you doing now?
Give me the fucking phone.

847
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,760
Hello?

848
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,240
Who the fuck is this?

849
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,360
What the fuck is going on over there?

850
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,240
Nothing. Sorry, Louis.

851
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,400
{y:i}We're not getting the desired movement.

852
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,960
{y:i}We're stepping up the operation.

853
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,400
First thing in the morning, send his thumb
to James Dorf... Are you listening?

854
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,720
- Yeah.
{y:i}- Good.

855
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,080
{y:i}To James Dorf
{y:i}at the U.S. Courthouse on Spring Street.

856
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,800
Hold on one second. Go in the other room.

857
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,160
Go in the other room in the back.
Go in the back.

858
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm talking on the phone. Go in the back.

859
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,720
What do you mean?
How do I send his thumb?

860
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,480
You cut it the fuck off.
You take it to Boxes 'R' Us...

861
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,400
{y:i}or whatever it is.
{y:i}You put the appropriate postage on it...

862
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,840
and that's how you send it.
Send it express next-day delivery.

863
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,040
Make sure you kindly refrain from providing
a return address, you fucking dummy.

864
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,320
I mean...

865
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,160
You want me to cut his thumb off?

866
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,640
It's enough already. Put the clam-licker on.

867
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,760
Hold on. Wait a minute.
What about, like, the bleeding and the...

868
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,240
I can't believe I'm talking to a professional.

869
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,000
I'll send people to help you,
they'll take your thumb, too.

870
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,040
- I'm not saying that.
{y:i}- I don't like the habit of hiring you...

871
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,320
and then having to hire someone
to make sure you do your job right.

872
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,040
{y:i}Do your fucking job right, you hear me?

873
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,600
I'm getting tired of this.

874
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,720
- Larry.
- What?

875
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,360
Can I stay here with you?

876
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,160
No.

877
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,480
- Time for you to go to bed anyways.
- I don't want to go to bed.

878
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,920
- Lf I tell you to go to bed, go to bed.
- I don't want to go to bed, though.

879
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,120
"New. Our best Charmin ever.

880
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,760
"Charmin Ultra Double Roll.

881
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,200
"Twice as many sheets
as regular Charmin Ultra.

882
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,680
"Unscented bathroom tissue.

883

"4.5 inches by 4.0 inches."

884
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,340
And they got it in centimeters or whatever.

885
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,740
It's the same shit on the back. All right?

886
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,500
- Good night.
- Good night, Larry.

887
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,140
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

888
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,460
What are your friends like?

889
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,460
- I don't really have friends.
- Who do you hang out with?

890
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,580
Nobody.

891
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,380
Why do I think you're not exaggerating?

892
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,660
I just keep to myself.

893
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,540
I go about my business, you know.
Do my work.

894
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,740
A charming, loveable guy like yourself?
You should get out more.

895
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,340
I'm sure there's a ton of straight women
who you could make very happy.

896
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,180
Louis wants us to cut the kid's thumb off.

897
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,300
I'd like to give shouts to all my homies.

898
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,100
Mrs. Friedman. Lily.

899
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,020
Mr. Mossman
and the man he plays cards with.

900
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,820
Forgot his name.

901
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,860
And all my peeps at Wilshire Adult Care.

902
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,340
Everybody in the cafeteria. Big ups!

903
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,580
What's up to my man Larry. And Ricki.

904
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,580
Yo, yo, yo. Peace, G.

905
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,500
And the rec room.

906
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,020
I got neighbors, you know.

907
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,220
{y:i}Dgame sabrosa.

908
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,420
- What's that?
- It's "espaol".

909
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,580
What does it mean?

910
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,060
I don't know.

911
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,140
See that?

912
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,140
Don't be a playa hater, G.

913
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,460
- Yeah?
- Who the fuck are you?

914
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,740
Who the fuck are you?

915
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,140
Excuse me.

916
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,100
What a shithole!

917
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,580
- Lady, I think you're in the wrong place.
- You are in the wrong place.

918
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,020
All right? You're in the wrong place.
You have no idea.

919
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,060
And who the fuck are you?

920
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,580
- You're the fuck are you.
- What?

921
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,060
What are you doing here?

922
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,220
- I'm stalking you.
- Wait, you know her?

923
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,860
First of all,
do not say my name in this room. All right?

924
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,660
Second of all, you're out of line.

925
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,900
This is a professional situation
and you have no right to intrude.

926
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,300
What kind of professional situation?
I can't believe this.

927
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,260
A fucking man?

928
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,140
Okay. I really thought
this was all about Sharon.

929
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,980
- Are you telling people where we are?
- Mind your own business.

930
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,660
- Shut the fuck up.
- Blow me.

931
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,180
Listen, both of you shut up.

932
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,940
Look, I haven't told anybody where we are.
And, Robin...

933
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,940
this is a professional situation.

934
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,380
Our problems
have nothing to do with Sharon...

935
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,340
and they have nothing to do with him.

936
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,860
- I want you to leave right now! Please.
- No!

937
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,940
I'm not leaving, he's leaving.

938
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,420
What? Who the fuck do you think you are?

939
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,260
- I fucking live here. I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah?

940
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,980
Neither am I. Going to be all there is to that.

941
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,220
- Why are you doing this?
- What if I throw you out?

942
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,540
What if I roundhouse you upside
your fat head and collapse your skull.

943
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,260
- I don't know. Give it a shot.
- Don't. She knows how to do that stuff.

944
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,180
- Don't be macho.
- I don't give a fuck.

945
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,180
This isn't lesbian talk-circle time.
We got something to do.

946
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,740
- You're getting the fuck out. Got it?
- I mean, this? You need this?

947
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,700
You need a little freedom or something?
You want to dabble? We can all fuck.

948
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,980
We can all have sex together, that's fine.

949
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,740
What do you say, Hot Rocks?

950
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,700
- Would you like it?
- You're out of your mind.

951
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,860
- You know you want it.
- Our situation has nothing to do with him.

952
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,060
It's over.

953
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,860
- It's not him. It's us, honey.
- Right, it's not you, it's her. Get the...

954
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,460
Just shut up for one second! God! Fuck!

955
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,580
This has nothing to do with him.

956
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,140
- It's just, we're over.
- No, we're not over.

957
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,860
We'll set up together, the three of us,
till you get this out of your system.

958
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,700
- Baby, you're not hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you. Okay?

959
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,940
God damn it!

960
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,020
See, I'm going to kill myself right now
and you care...

961
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,620
- That's a nice girl.
- Shut the fuck up, all right!

962
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,100
- What the fuck is that?
- What did you...

963
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,340
No.

964
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
- What did you do?
- Is this hot enough for you?

965
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,740
- Get away.
- You want some?

966
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,140
Get away. What's wrong with you?

967
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,780
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is this?

968
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,500
Lady, you need some Band-Aids.

969
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,740
This must be Mental-fucking-lllness Week.

970
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,740
That woman is fucking beautiful.

971
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,460
Yes.

972
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,340
She's like the ones at the Baywatch.

973
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,020
They make my penis sneeze.

974
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,260
You got a good sense of humor,
you know that?

975
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,900
God bless you.

976
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,900
- Thank you.
- No, not you, stupid.

977
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,020
When my penis sneezes,
I say, "God bless you.

978
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,860
"God bless you, penis."

979
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,420
She's going to be okay.

980
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,660
What a relief.

981
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,780
Brian, would you excuse us?
I want to talk to Larry for a minute. Okay?

982
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,780
- You'll be all right in the car?
- Yeah.

983
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,140
Okay, good.

984
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,900
I just...

985
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,220
I got to tell you,
I'm not up for this thumb deal.

986
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,020
I say we don't do it.

987
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,700
You trying to test me?

988
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,860
Is that it? You wanna see
if I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do?

989
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:12,900
No.

990
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,460
So, what are you,
a contractor with a conscience?

991
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,500
Look, I've done some bad things...

992
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,900
but I didn't sign on to this
to be a brutal street thug.

993
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,620
Because, as far as I'm concerned,
that's not the job I took.

994
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,300
How would you get around it?

995
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,820
I'd work it out.

996
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,340
But first I got to know, are you with me?

997
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,860
Sure.

998
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,060
Sure or yes?

999
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,740
- That's the same thing.
- No, it's not the same thing.

1000
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,740
See, if I were to ask you to move my couch
for me you'd probably say, "Sure."

1001
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,980
But if I were to ask you
to look deep into my eyes...

1002
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,220
and tell me from the bottom of your heart...

1003
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,940
if it would give you great pleasure
if I were to suck your cock for 12 hours...

1004
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:13,140
if I may be presumptuous,
you'd probably say, "Yes."

1005
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,020
See, it just implies
a different level of commitment.

1006
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,580
Ask me the question again.

1007
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,540
Okay. Are you with me?

1008
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,700
Yes.

1009
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,820
Yeah? Good.

1010
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,020
Isn't this B level?

1011
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,980
Isn't this B level?

1012
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,780
This is D level. You shouldn't be here.

1013
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,140
I'm looking for B level.

1014
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,700
This is a D level and no one is allowed here.
You need to go back to B level.

1015
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,500
Hold on.
Because you're confusing me, okay?

1016
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,660
You're confusing me.

1017
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,220
Let's just start from the beginning.
If this isn't B...

1018
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,860
Oh, my God.

1019
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,540
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

1020
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,540
Just soak that in cold water
and it'll come right out, okay?

1021
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,980
I promise you. Yes. No, it will.

1022
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,220
The thing is, the reason I'm here
is they told me to go around the corner...

1023
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,820
- Close your eyes.
- What?

1024
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,860
Close your eyes. Follow me.
Just walk in. Don't look.

1025
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,620
Come on. Go. You're fine.

1026
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,140
- Can I open them?
- No. Stand right here.

1027
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,100
- It's cold in here.
- Don't look at nothing. All right?

1028
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,340
- Can I open them?
- No.

1029
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,580
Stay turned around.

1030
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,260
Smells like my grandmother's.

1031
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,660
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

1032
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,500
{y:i}I like big butts and I cannot lie

1033
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:25,540
{y:i}The other brothers can't deny

1034
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,900
{y:i}When the girls walk in
{y:i}with an itty-bitty waist

1035
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,220
{y:i}And round things in your face
{y:i}You get sprung, wanna pull up tough

1036
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,820
{y:i}'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed

1037
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,540
{y:i}'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

1038
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,180
{y:i}And I'm down to get the friction on

1039
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,940
{y:i}So, ladies, yeah

1040
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,140
{y:i}Ladies, yeah

1041
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,620
{y:i}If you wanna roll in my Mercedes
{y:i}Yeah

1042
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,860
{y:i}So turn around! Stick it out!
{y:i}Even white boys got to shout

1043
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,100
{y:i}Baby got back!

1044
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,140
{y:i}Baby got back!

1045
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,020
That's an old-school song.

1046
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,020
You're old-school, too, Larry.

1047
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,020
We got an item that we want
to package ourselves and, you know...

1048
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,100
- Mail out.
- Okay.

1049
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,300
Could we just get an envelope from you?

1050
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,060
What size would you like?

1051
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,220
- Just the top, right...
- 6 by 9.

1052
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,420
So all right.

1053
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,100
We're done, right?

1054
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,660
That's it.

1055
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,340
Thanks.

1056
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,540
Would you like your parcel insured?

1057
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,020
No, that's all right.

1058
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,380
I'll be right back.

1059
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,460
Friend of yours?

1060
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,660
Close, personal.

1061
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,420
You know something?
You're right. It is sadness.

1062
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,580
I'm fucking sad. You got me.
You're a genius.

1063
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,220
You know why I'm fucking sad?
Because I got this fucking...

1064
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,420
beautiful, sexy, gorgeous...

1065
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,860
heartthrob-o-rama,
fucking smart, amazing bombshell...

1066
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,820
17-on-a-fucking-10-scale girl...

1067
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,980
sleeping in a bed, right next to me.

1068
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,980
And you know what?

1069
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,420
She's a stone-cold dyke.

1070
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,180
A fucking untouchable...

1071
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,180
unhaveable, unattainable brick wall...

1072
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,220
fucking Dykeasaurus Rexi.

1073
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,940
So it's sad, okay?
What do you want me to do?

1074
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,700
I feel fucking sadness about that.

1075
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,540
There's nothing I can fucking do.

1076
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,540
And not only is she a major babe...

1077
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,220
but I really like this girl a lot.

1078
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,220
A lot.

1079
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,620
She's not like anybody else
I ever knew before...

1080
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,220
and that's a completely fucking new one
on me.

1081
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,180
I don't even know her real fucking name.
So there you go.

1082
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,140
And in case you're interested, my life sucks.

1083
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,300
All right? Stick a fork in me, I'm done.

1084
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,180
{y:i}Clean the bar all you like.
{y:i}I'm just going to puke on it again.

1085
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,620
{y:i}- Oh, you got me.
{y:i}- Oh! I got you!

1086
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,540
Do you think your fingernails
need trimming?

1087
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,380
They're fine.

1088
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,220
What? You don't like my fingernails now?

1089
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,500
Look, I have no idea if this is true or not,
but I've heard it said...

1090
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:01,140
that those who are balanced
more toward the masculine of either sex...

1091
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,220
check their fingernails this way.

1092
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,220
And those balanced more toward
the feminine check them that way.

1093
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,820
I had a feeling that even though
you have this tough guy thing going on...

1094
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,260
that you are wrestling
with some very strong feminine leanings.

1095
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,460
That's fucking bullshit.

1096
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:22,100
I can't see. I'm farsighted.
Nearsighted, whatever it is.

1097
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,780
So I hold them out here
but I can't see them up close.

1098
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,980
To find out how somebody's
balanced toward a masculine, look at me.

1099
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,700
I can't see. That's why I hold them far away.

1100
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,180
- All right.
- Yeah, it is all right.

1101
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,340
No, all right.

1102
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,300
I was gonna do this. That's what I wanna do.

1103
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,220
But I know I can't see
so I hold them out there to look at them.

1104
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,260
All right.

1105
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:56,220
Don't give me that look.
I see you looking at me.

1106
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,380
- Are you gay?
- What the fuck.

1107
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,660
No. I'm not gay!

1108
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,900
Why do you look at me and think I'm gay?

1109
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,380
I'm not fucking gay!

1110
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,140
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fucking sure.

1111
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,580
You know what, I bet you're right.

1112
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,260
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

1113
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,260
Ricki, whatever your real name is,
all right, this is my eyes.

1114
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,860
Look how I'm acting.
You're driving me crazy.

1115
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,540
You give me a fucking headache.

1116
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:37,180
I don't even know why I had a crush on you,
back a long time ago when I first met you...

1117
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,620
that you really cured me of.

1118
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,980
I don't know.

1119
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,980
Maybe it's because you know
I can kick your ass.

1120
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,380
Maybe that turns you on.

1121
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,460
You cannot kick my ass.

1122
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,460
What?

1123
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,260
You need a woman.

1124
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,060
I got one.

1125
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,180
Stop.

1126
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,500
Kiss me again.

1127
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,540
I thought you wanted to be my bitch.

1128
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,100
This is so fucked up.

1129
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,900
- Where you going?
- It's turkey time.

1130
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,740
Gobble, gobble.

1131
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,260
What?

1132
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,300
Now, you talk the talk...

1133
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,900
you know I'm expecting
you to walk the walk. Come on.

1134
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,780
Show me what I've been missing
my whole life.

1135
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,940
Lay some of that sweet "heterolingus"
on me.

1136
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,220
I think...

1137
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,620
to be serious...

1138
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,260
I just... You know, I think...

1139
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,540
I was thinking, you know,
and you were right...

1140
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,380
when you said probably,
actually a woman might know more...

1141
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,220
about what feels better to another woman.
She's a woman herself.

1142
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:47,100
A guy might be at a certain disadvantage.
You know, like...

1143
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:52,100
It's like, you need a handicap.
You know, like golf.

1144
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,900
Shut up and get over here.

1145
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,020
God bless you, penis.

1146
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:47,340
What'd you say?

1147
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,820
Nothing.

1148
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,780
Every relationship has a bull and a cow?

1149
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,580
That's right.

1150
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,820
Just to be up front about all this...

1151
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,940
when this gig is over...

1152
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,340
I want you to know
that I'm going to be leaving.

1153
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,620
{y:i}Listen...

1154
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,580
you and Trixie over there,
meet me at Beverly and Lomitas.

1155
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,500
Louis, what's going on?

1156
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,620
And don't bring the thing.

1157
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,580
- The what?
{y:i}- The thing. Don't bring it.

1158
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,700
What thing?

1159
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,540
The thing. Don't bring... Don't bring it.

1160
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,780
- You mean the...
{y:i}- Yeah. Don't bring it.

1161
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,220
{y:i}You leave it somewhere safe
{y:i}for the time being.

1162
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,940
- All right.
- You understand?

1163
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,460
{y:i}- Yeah, I understand.
- And hurry up, jackass.

1164
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,340
What?

1165
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,300
It's Louis. Fucking pissed.

1166
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,620
See this? Some cookies in there.

1167
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,860
Be back.

1168
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:26,380
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

1169
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:30,140
- Just relax, eat your breakfast. Okay?
- I'm not hungry, though.

1170
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:33,820
Well, you can't skip breakfast.
It's a very important meal. All right?

1171
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,420
Don't go nowhere. Don't touch nothing.

1172
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,740
- Don't make phone calls. I'm not kidding.
- All right, Larry.

1173
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,460
All right. See you later.

1174
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,500
- Bye, Ricki.
- Bye, Brian.

1175
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,780
- What?
- Nothing.

1176
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,500
You know, I got this fantasy.

1177
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:09,980
About making it with a guy?

1178
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
No.

1179
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,140
That's not it.

1180
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:23,020
Going somewhere, you know,
like, somewhere really...

1181
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,100
clean.

1182
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,060
- Clean?
- Yeah.

1183
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,300
No scumbags telling you what to do.
Nobody yelling at you all the time.

1184
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,300
Someplace you could just be.

1185
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,340
Be yourself.

1186
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,060
No bad stuff.

1187
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,340
That sounds good.

1188
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:14,140
- What's up?
- We have a visitor from New York.

1189
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,340
Follow me.

1190
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,780
Hello.

1191
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,700
- Welcome. Nice to meet you.
- Hello, sir.

1192
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,580
Finally. Nice to meet you, too.

1193
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,940
Come. Look at you. Beautiful.

1194
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,700
Come on in. Here. Grab a couch.

1195
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:42,300
Sit, sit.

1196
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,300
I say everything twice. In, in. Sit, sit.

1197
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,380
I'm so glad you could come...

1198
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:52,660
on such a short notice, too.
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

1199
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,820
I really... I thank you.
I appreciate it. Here, I've got some stuff.

1200
01:24:57,140 --> 01:25:01,420
I'm sorry if I'm a bit of a mess,
but I just got in a few hours ago.

1201
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,940
I'm sure Louis told you,
you know, I'm having...

1202
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,300
some little legal problems
out here right now.

1203
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,740
What are you gonna do? It's a nuisance,
but what are you going to do?

1204
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,940
I got to fight it, right?

1205
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:21,340
I mean, I can't go to jail.
That just can't happen.

1206
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,100
I'm used to the finer things.

1207
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,620
- Louis, am I right?
- You are right.

1208
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,060
It can't be. So I think we can say...

1209
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,260
beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that it's not gonna happen.

1210
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,140
Somewhere a mistake has been made.

1211
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,660
Did you know...

1212
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,140
that apparently some people...

1213
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,740
do not regard the thumb,
technically, to be a finger?

1214
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:01,220
Curious for myself, I turned to Louis here...

1215
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,580
who with his newfound dictionary skills
looked it up for me.

1216
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,340
- You know what it said?
- No.

1217
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,020
Tell him what it said, Louis.

1218
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,420
It said, quote:

1219
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,900
"The short, thick, inner digit of the hand
next to the forefinger." Unquote.

1220
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,660
Now it said, "digit," not "finger."

1221
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:25,380
So I still don't really know, technically,
if it's considered a finger or not.

1222
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,340
- Right?
- Right.

1223
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,380
Right. Look at him. I love him.

1224
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,540
I love this guy. He eats no matter what.
I love you, Louis.

1225
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,300
What's this?

1226
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,900
What is this? Louis.

1227
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,020
I've been subpoenaed.

1228
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,020
I can't be consorting with armed felons.

1229
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,500
A little consideration, please.

1230
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:55,740
Besides, you think something like this
is necessary...

1231
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,860
anyway, to intimidate people?

1232
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,420
I say intimidation comes from within.

1233
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,740
There are a multitude of qualities
an individual can possess...

1234
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,780
that make them intimidating.

1235
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,420
Not only this, this is the outside.
Then there's the inside.

1236
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,300
But you know
what's the most intimidating quality?

1237
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,220
Not that you asked.

1238
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,540
But the absolutely most intimidating
in my opinion?

1239
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,700
When an individual just doesn't give a shit.

1240
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:29,020
- Louis, you want to go to medical school?
- Medical school?

1241
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,620
Yes!

1242
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:39,540
Students there
can always use something to learn on.

1243
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,820
I feel like I'm floating.

1244
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,020
I feel...

1245
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:52,820
released.

1246
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,300
I don't give a shit.

1247
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,820
I don't.

1248
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:13,380
I have no compunctions...

1249
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,940
none whatsoever.

1250
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,820
And I am very concerned...

1251
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,580
about the way things have turned out here.

1252
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,340
How was the bleeding?

1253
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,940
The bleeding?

1254
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,500
No, not him.

1255
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,660
The retard, when you cut his thumb off.

1256
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:53,700
Louis told me you were concerned.

1257
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,980
Bleeding was fine.

1258
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,020
Fine?

1259
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,540
It was all right.

1260
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:11,580
Okay. Good.

1261
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,820
I didn't need your help, you know.
I could have beaten these charges.

1262
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,780
What were you thinking?

1263
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,180
You were gonna extort a federal prosecutor.

1264
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,500
You thought you could say:

1265
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:39,780
"Kidnapped your little brother,
drop all charges," and the guy'd roll over?

1266
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,140
You didn't think
all hell wouldn't break loose?

1267
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,700
You didn't think every fucking fed...

1268
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,780
wouldn't drop what they were doing...

1269
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:56,100
and dive in to protect one of their own?

1270
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:00,420
What do you morons think...

1271
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,100
this is Little Italy?

1272
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,060
Wake up!

1273
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:09,620
This is the twenty-fucking-first century!

1274
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,660
So now...

1275
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,740
things are bad.

1276
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,860
And whether you wanna call a thumb...

1277
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,660
a finger or a digit...

1278
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,980
for the sake of this discussion,
it doesn't really matter.

1279
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:43,820
You know why?

1280
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,660
Because whatever you choose to call it...

1281
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,300
a thumb...

1282
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,780
has a fingerprint...

1283
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,340
and the one you sent...

1284
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:00,340
had the wrong fucking one.

1285
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,780
- Mr. Starkman...
- I know my fucking name...

1286
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,100
you piece of shit!

1287
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,820
You don't try to extort...

1288
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:20,260
a federal fucking prosecutor!

1289
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,500
And if you do...

1290
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,940
you don't fuck around!

1291
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,860
Fuck this.

1292
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,020
Cutting off his thumb was a stupid order.

1293
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:42,900
We would have been derelict
in our responsibilities if we had followed it.

1294
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,620
Hello.

1295
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,580
How long could we have kept below radar...

1296
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,860
with a thumbless, bleeding half-wit?

1297
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,740
You see, sometimes...

1298
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,980
one has to use
their professional prerogative...

1299
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,980
to override a dumb request.

1300
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,660
With all due respect...

1301
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,700
even at this point if you were to ask us...

1302
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:10,380
to pursue a course of action that would be...

1303
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,140
let's say, contrary to your best interests...

1304
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:17,220
then as awkward as it might be...

1305
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,100
we would have to take exception.

1306
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,860
Aside from those of us in this room...

1307
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,380
there's only one person, really,
that can link you to this fuckup.

1308
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,060
And I feel that we should...

1309
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:40,260
rectify that problem as soon as we can.

1310
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,100
I think I'd much prefer just to...

1311
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:48,940
you know...

1312
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,020
end it right here.

1313
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,460
And that would be
your professional prerogative.

1314
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,220
If you think that having
that kid picked up by the authorities...

1315
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:06,460
and telling them all about being kidnapped
in an attempt to save your ass makes sense.

1316
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,740
If you think that's the best tactic
to keep you out of jail.

1317
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,340
If you think that's any less dumb
than asking to have his finger cut off...

1318
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,420
well, then that would be
the thing that you should do.

1319
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,540
But if you don't...

1320
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,740
then let us take the thorn out of your side.

1321
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:32,700
Let us make sure that kid will never be
able to testify against anybody.

1322
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,300
And if after that you're still not happy...

1323
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,580
then we can all talk again.

1324
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,300
- You were kidding, right?
- What do you think?

1325
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,900
We'll take Brian back
to where you found him and get out of here.

1326
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,940
Are we going to the Baywatch now?

1327
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:02,580
No, we can't go to the Baywatch now.
Take you later.

1328
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,820
Maybe this is it. Maybe this is the thing.

1329
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,740
Maybe this is a sign coming from nowhere,
from out of the blue...

1330
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:17,020
just telling me it's time. It's time to get out.
It's time to do it.

1331
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,660
{y:i}When I'm alone in my room
{y:i}Sometimes I stare at the wall

1332
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,500
{y:i}and in the back of my mind
{y:i}I hear my conscience call

1333
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:33,340
{y:i}telling me I need a girl
{y:i}who's as sweet as a dove

1334
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,580
{y:i}For the first time in my life I see
{y:i}I need love

1335
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,900
{y:i}So if you know who you are
{y:i}why don't you make yourself seen

1336
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:43,260
{y:i}take a chance with my love
{y:i}you'll find out what I mean

1337
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,820
{y:i}I need love

1338
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,780
{y:i}I need love

1339
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,740
Let me ask you something.
You got a girlfriend?

1340
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,380
No, I don't.

1341
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:01,860
Let me do something for you.

1342
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,660
You know, make up for all the problems
I caused you.

1343
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:10,220
Because I see you're a little nervous
around women. Right?

1344
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,340
Let me tell you something. You got
no reason to be shy. There's no magic to it.

1345
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:19,180
Let me tell you this thing that I heard,
and I'm starting to believe that it's true.

1346
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,620
You know?

1347
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:24,140
It's that the thing
you're most afraid of in life...

1348
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:28,580
if you do it, if you step up,
good things will happen.

1349
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,340
You see a girl that you like
that you're scared to talk to...

1350
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,060
bro, step up.

1351
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,740
Go up to her and say:

1352
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:40,340
"Hi, how are you today?
Nice weather we're having."

1353
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,700
Take it from there,
wherever the conversation goes. You try it.

1354
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,180
Try it with me. Practice. Go ahead.

1355
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,860
Hello, how are you today?

1356
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:51,060
Try it with me. Go ahead. Just say it.

1357
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:54,140
Hello, how are you today?

1358
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,980
Come on, Brian. Hello.

1359
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,100
How are you today?

1360
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,100
"How are you today?"

1361
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,420
Nice weather we're having.

1362
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,260
"Nice weather we're having."

1363
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:17,180
There you go. You see how he did it?
It's because you stepped up, Brian.

1364
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,940
If you're afraid, step up and good things
start to happen. Am I right?

1365
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:25,060
- I stepped up.
- Step it up, pimp.

1366
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,980
That's how you move. Step it up.

1367
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:42,420
So, now that we're partners in crime...

1368
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,420
how about telling me your real name.

1369
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,940
The reason that I ask that...

1370
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:52,340
is because I don't know
if you gave it any thought since last night...

1371
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,860
but I've been thinking about it.

1372
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:58,460
And seeing... You know, looks like
now we're both going to be leaving.

1373
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:01,700
So I thought, you know...

1374
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,580
All right, look.

1375
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,380
I'm gonna lay it all out there for you
right now.

1376
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:10,340
I'm just gonna say it,
because, you know, here I am.

1377
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,980
- I think...
- Larry.

1378
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,940
You know I haven't done
this kind of thing hardly ever.

1379
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,460
The whole man thing...

1380
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:22,660
doesn't really
hold that much for me, usually.

1381
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,580
I know.

1382
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,540
But somehow you got through.

1383
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,460
Somehow.

1384
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,260
But in the end...

1385
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,820
I don't think
I could ever be what you really want.

1386
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,500
- So where do you think you'll go?
- I don't know.

1387
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,500
Somewhere clean.

1388
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,980
You know, Northern California...

1389
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,500
Oregon maybe.

1390
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:18,300
You could just drop me off
near the Pacific Coast Highway...

1391
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:21,180
- and I'll figure it out from there.
- Okay.

1392
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:26,980
After that, Brian,
I think it's gonna be time to go home.

1393
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,180
We just left there a little while ago, though.

1394
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:35,460
I don't mean my apartment.
I mean, you know, the place where you live.

1395
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:37,060
Where I got you.

1396
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,540
What, you mean to stay?

1397
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,980
Yeah, buddy. To stay.

1398
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,260
Oh, my God.

1399
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,980
- It's open. Oh, my God.
- What are you doing? Sit down.

1400
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,340
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna go.
- Brian, what?

1401
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,140
- What's he talking about?
- They're open.

1402
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:02,620
They're open. Oh, my God. The Baywatch.

1403
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:04,380
They're open!

1404
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:07,620
- Cowabunga!
- Oh, my God.

1405
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,980
That's the Baywatch?

1406
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,020
It's open. It's the Baywatch.

1407
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,460
Hello there!

1408
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:17,420
I can't believe this.

1409
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,500
- I can't believe. Stop.
- We can't stop now.

1410
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,060
No, we have to stop!

1411
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:26,540
No, Larry, no! They're here. We're here.

1412
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:30,580
I know. We can't, though. I'm sorry.
We can't stop.

1413
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,340
- We're here. Come on.
- We're here.

1414
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:33,820
- We're right here.
- Brian.

1415
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,220
Wait. That's it. We're right here.

1416
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:44,020
Wait a second.
Wait. So turn around now, okay?

1417
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,380
All right.

1418
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,980
What do you think?

1419
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:13,140
- Can I go down there?
- Brian, you can't go down there, no.

1420
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,620
I mean, we're not allowed down there.

1421
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,300
Plus, we got to go soon.

1422
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,500
Please? Please, can I go down there?

1423
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:27,660
You know, Brian, I don't even think...

1424
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:33,100
This might not even be the Baywatch.
I think this is probably something else.

1425
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,340
Larry, you promised me.

1426
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:42,540
You promised me.

1427
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,740
- It's right there.
- I know.

1428
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,740
Just for five minutes?

1429
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,820
Brian, what's your brother's name?

1430
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:08,180
My brother's name is stinky Jimmy Dorf.
Want to know why?

1431
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,860
Yeah, some other time, I do.

1432
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,860
Yeah, Los Angeles. The U.S. Courthouse.
The office of a James Dorf.

1433
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,860
- Because... Do you want to know why?
- Yeah.

1434
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:22,860
Because sometimes he smells like fish.

1435
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:24,700
No, I don't think so.

1436
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:28,580
Yeah, I'll give you my name.
Give me a minute. Hold on. I forgot it.

1437
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,700
Brian, look at me.

1438
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:49,340
I think your brother and his friends
are gonna be here soon to pick you up.

1439
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,340
Okay?

1440
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,020
I want you to know something.

1441
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,380
You're a good kid.

1442
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,460
I'm sorry about all the...

1443
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,620
I'm sorry for being...

1444
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,740
I'm sorry.

1445
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,580
I think you're wrong.

1446
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,580
I think that is the Baywatch right there.

1447
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,020
Who knows. Maybe it is.

1448
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,020
I'm a genius, man. I knew it.

1449
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:47,060
You take good care of yourself, Brian.

1450
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,740
You take good care of yourself, Larry.

1451
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,660
I'll do that.

1452
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:11,340
Brian, let me ask you something.
How do your fingernails look?

1453
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:15,580
- My fingernails?
- Your fingernails, how are they looking?

1454
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,500
- Don't say nothing.
- They look very good.

1455
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,180
I got A-plus nails.

1456
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:28,940
- I give an A-plus for fingernails.
- Never mind. Okay. Good.

1457
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,380
Go ahead.

1458
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:42,140
Go on.

1459
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:52,060
I don't know how you're thinking
about getting out of here or whatever...

1460
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,940
what your plans are...

1461
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:59,220
but I think you should take my car.

1462
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:02,740
Go ahead, take it. Take it.

1463
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,780
I couldn't do that, Larry.

1464
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:14,820
I'd rather...
You know, I'd prefer if you had it.

1465
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:18,660
It's a good car,
and I want you to be all right.

1466
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,060
And I know that
it'll get you wherever you need to go.

1467
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,140
So just, you know, take it.

1468
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,580
I was thinking
about getting rid of it anyway.

1469
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,860
I'm trying to change my image.

1470
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,980
Go ahead, take it.

1471
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,620
Please.

1472
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,060
Okay.

1473
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,820
- I will, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1474
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,380
Just do me one favor, though.

1475
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,300
Name it.

1476
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:06,820
As far as the lesbian thing goes...

1477
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,820
Yeah?

1478
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:13,700
...if you do ever think
about hopping the fence...

1479
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,660
promise you'll give me a call first.

1480
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,020
{y:i}Okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.

1481
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:14,060
{y:i}Camera is ready and picture is up.

1482
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:17,620
{y:i}I need all dancers to first position
{y:i}as soon as possible.

1483
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:21,100
{y:i}All dancers to first position
{y:i}as soon as possible. Let's go.

1484
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:03,140
{y:i}Okay, listen up, guys.
{y:i}Can we please finish pairing up, everyone?

1485
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,100
{y:i}Come on, guys,
{y:i}it's not like you're mating for life.

1486
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,820
{y:i}As the old song goes. ;
{y:i}"just love the one you're with."

1487
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,700
{y:i}Find someone to love.

1488
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,180
Come on, Brian. Dance with someone.

1489
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,380
Nice weather we're having.

1490
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,940
Yes, it's very nice.

1491
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,180
It is?

1492
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,100
Yes. But the weather's always very nice
around here, isn't it?

1493
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,140
Yes.

1494
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:13,460
And a 10% chance of precipitation
for low-lying coastal regions...

1495
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:16,300
extending from New South Wales to Victoria.

1496
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,060
{y:i}And playback.

1497
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,380
{y:i}And action.

1498
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,980
Rochelle.

1499
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:58,580
What?

1500
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:02,300
Rochelle. That's my real name.

1501
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,220
So, Rochelle...

1502
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,180
does this mean
you decided to hop the fence?

1503
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,260
I wouldn't go that far.

1504
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,620
But I figured
since I helped get you into all this...

1505
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,900
the least I could do
is offer you a ride out of town.

1506
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,140
Fair enough.

1507
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,180
What?

1508
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:54,540
You know,
I bet you'd look awesome in some mascara.

1509
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:02,380
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- It's a compliment.

1510
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,100
Yeah?

1511
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:08,340
Like your mother said,
life's not always black-and-white.

1512
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,300
Sometimes you just never know.

1513
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,100
Are you driving or bullshitting?

1514
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:17,460
I'm driving.

1515
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:31,300
{y:i}I like big butts and I cannot lie

1516
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:33,620
{y:i}The other brothers can't deny

1517
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,900
{y:i}When the girls walk in
{y:i}with an itty-bitty waist

1518
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:39,980
{y:i}And round things in your face
{y:i}You get sprung, wanna pull up tough

1519
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,100
{y:i}'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed

1520
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:44,420
{y:i}'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

1521
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,100
{y:i}And I'm down to get the friction on

1522
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,740
{y:i}So, ladies, yeah

1523
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:48,780
{y:i}Ladies, yeah

1524
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:51,700
{y:i}If you wanna roll in my Mercedes
{y:i}Yeah

1525
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:55,780
{y:i}So turn around! Stick it out!
{y:i}Even white boys got to shout

1526
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,820
{y:i}Baby got back!

1527
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:00,060
{y:i}Baby got back!
