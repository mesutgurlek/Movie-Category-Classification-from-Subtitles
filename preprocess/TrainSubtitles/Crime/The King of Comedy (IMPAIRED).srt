162
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,331
It looks so simple
to the viewer at home--

163
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:23,341
those things that come
so easily that are so relaxed...

164
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,344
and look like it's a matter
of just taking another breath.

165
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,846
It takes years
and years and years...

166
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,849
of honing that and working it.

167
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,851
I don't mean to interrupt you...

168
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,319
but there's a little problem.
I'm 34 years old.

169
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,822
That's why I'm asking
you to just listen--

170
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,258
To listen to my act and tell me
what you think about it.

171
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,261
Why don't you
call my office--

172
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,921
All right, O.K. I could?

173
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:47,432
You ask for Cathy Long.
She's my secretary.

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,469
And we'll make time to listen
to what you're talking about.

175
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,470
You don't know
how many times...

176
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,473
I've had this conversation
in my head. This is beautiful.

177
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,805
- Did it always end this way?
- Yeah, it did.

178
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,471
I really believe this.

179
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,481
Once you get over
the initial shyness, you'll be O.K.

180
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,914
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,353
Hope it works
out for you, Rupert.

182
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,013
Thanks,Jerry.
Thanks a lot.

183
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,023
It's a pleasure
meeting you,Jerry.

184
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,525
Jerry. I'm a little short on cash...

185
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,028
but if you don't
mind just appetizers...

186
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,530
I'd love to take you
to dinner sometime.

187
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,067
I don't know my schedule.
Maybe we can.

188
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,568
O.K. Thanks,Jerry.
Thanks.

189
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,969
Jerry. Let me show you
a picture of my pride and joy.

190
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,742
That's good.

191
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,506
- Good, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

192
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,547
Hey,Jerry, take it.

193
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,981
Take it.
Go ahead, take it.

194
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,951
Consider it a gift.
It'll work for you.

195
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,049
I will.

196
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,317
Not that you
need the help.Jerry!

197
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,053
Seriously.
You ever want lunch--my treat.

198
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,062
Call my office.

199
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,256
O.K., O.K., O.K.

200
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,324
O.K.Jerry,you're a prince.!

201
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,849
Hey, Rupe,
before I forget...

202
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,385
I really appreciate you
meeting me for lunch.

203
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:16,320
I know how busy you are
and how tired you are.

204
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,058
What are friends for,Jerry?

205
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,390
Talking about schedule,
you're the one who looks tired.

206
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, I know.
It's the show.

207
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,062
The pressure, the ratings.

208
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,868
The same guests,
the same questions.

209
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,473
I'm just not
enjoying it anymore.

210
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:41,172
That's...the worst.

211
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,885
Listen, I...I really wish you
would think about it again.

212
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,718
Wait a minute.
You--you're starting again.

213
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,724
You're starting up again.

214
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,885
It's not that big a deal to think.

215
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,553
I'm asking you to think.

216
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,291
I'm thinking.
All I do is think day and night.

217
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,801
How can I not think about it?
We're here at lunch together...

218
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,303
which I knew is why
you invited me...

219
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,238
and I'm here eating
to get guilty with you, right?

220
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,242
I'm asking you to take
over the show for six weeks.

221
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,834
What's six weeks?

222
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,348
I'll give you anything,
but don't ask me to do six weeks.

223
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,010
I can't take over
the show for six weeks.

224
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,020
I can't even take over
my own life for six weeks.

225
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,522
You're asking for something
that's impossible! It's impossible!

226
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,955
- [Woman] Rupert.!
- Don't you understand--

227
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,049
What?

228
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,560
What are you doing
down there so late?

229
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,063
It's impossible!
I'm trying to tell you that.

230
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,292
What, you want me to cry?

231
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:38,133
There must be a way to work it out.
It's just six weeks.

232
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:41,230
Ex$cuse me. Um, Mr. Pupkin?
You think you could--

233
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:44,538
Yeah. Sure.
What's your name, dear?

234
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,046
- Dolores.
- Dolores? That was my father's name.

235
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,582
""To Dolores...

236
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,447
who sensed greatness.''

237
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,088
There you go, sweetheart.

238
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,091
- Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
- Don't mention it.

239
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,329
[Woman] Rupert.!
Rupert, who you talking to?

240
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:06,763
- Mom!
- What is it?

241
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,825
Please stop calling me!

242
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,867
It's terrific.
It's great.

243
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,535
There's only one problem, though.

244
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,239
He made--he made
you bigger.

245
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,713
Would you answer me?

246
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,216
All right!
You've got the six weeks!

247
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,878
Don't bother me!
I'll give you the six weeks!

248
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,751
What can I say?
You happy now?

249
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,346
You're a tough man, Rupe.

250
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:34,154
You got to be in this business.

251
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,353
Ha ha ha ha!

252
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

253
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,360
Ha ha ha ha ha!

254
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,515
[Telephone Rings]

255
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,690
[Ring]

256
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:14,694
[Ring]

257
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,861
Hello.

258
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,199
Hello. It's Masha,Jerry.

259
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,035
- Who?
- Did you get my note?

260
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:22,199
Who's this?

261
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,209
Masha.
Didn't you get the note?

262
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,211
I left it on the back seat...

263
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,713
before they dragged me
out of the car.

264
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:31,215
You know, those guys
really hurt me,Jerry.

265
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,218
How did you get this number?

266
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,220
Don't be angry with me,Jerry.

267
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,222
How did you get this number?

268
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,225
I don't know what else to do.
I've been calling your--

269
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,122
How've you been, Rita?

270
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,704
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

271
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,269
Rupert.

272
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,611
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

273
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,018
I brought you a little present.

274
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,049
Oh, yeah. I remember.

275
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,353
- Mr. Romance.
- Heh.

276
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,756
Put an aspirin in that.
It'll last longer.

277
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:55,400
So what are you
up to these days?

278
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,631
You're looking
as beautiful as ever, Rita.

279
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,639
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

280
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,901
You know...

281
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,909
it's funny, but I...I, uh...

282
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:08,174
- I voted for you ""most beautiful.''
- Did you? That's sweet.

283
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,239
I didn't have the nerve
to tell you then, but--

284
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,343
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's O.K. We're both adults.

285
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,854
Isn't that funny?
You know, when you're younger...

286
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,857
you're afraid to say those things,
but when you get older...

287
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,361
you can say those things
that you should've said
1 5, 20 years ago.

288
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,058
Isn't that the final irony of life?

289
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,395
Isn't it?

290
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,957
I guess.

291
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:36,040
Are you happy
in this place, Rita?

292
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,377
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

293
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,879
Oh, really? Like what?

294
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,881
Well...what are you
doing tonight?

295
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,883
What am I doing tonight?

296
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,317
- Ha ha!
- Yeah. What's so funny?

297
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:52,517
Isn't it just a little late asking me
for a date after 1 5 years?

298
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,221
Ha ha ha ha!
Really? Ha ha! Well...

299
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:01,062
Waiter?
Can I have a fresh one?

300
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,067
- Rita.
- Hmm?

301
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,262
Who is your favorite
movie star?

302
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,704
What is this,
some kind of a game?

303
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,571
You going to tell me
something about my character...

304
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,077
- my future?
- You'll see. Tell me.

305
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,114
Everybody has
a favorite movie star.

306
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,278
I better think of somebody,
or we'll never get out of here, right?

307
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,786
That's a little test.

308
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,914
Oh, let's see.
Marilyn Monroe.

309
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,454
Perfect.

310
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,636
""Talent Register,'' huh?

311
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,271
That's her name.

312
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,278
She signed this in New York...

313
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,280
during her publicity tour
for The Misfits.

314
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,612
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,618
She wasn't a great actress...

316
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,280
but she did have
a real gift for comedy.

317
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,414
You know,
she died tragically alone...

318
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:01,392
like many of the world's
most beautiful women.

319
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,190
I don't want to see
that happening to you.

320
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,092
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

321
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,402
- This?
- Mel Brooks. He's what
you call ""on funny.''

322
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,840
Others are just regular.

323
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,878
Oh, that's Sid Caesar.
He's remarkable.

324
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,879
I really like him.
He's great.

325
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,575
Woody Allen. Nice guy.
Personal friend of mine.

326
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,912
Of course he is.

327
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,078
Ha ha! No, he is.

328
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,315
Oh, that's Ernie Kovacs.

329
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:34,553
He was wonderful.
He was a...great comedian,
great innovator.

330
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,595
That was a great, great loss.

331
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,926
I bet some of these
are worth money.

332
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,990
Oh, yeah.
Especially this one.Just hold it.

333
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,443
- Who's this?
- Well,just take a guess.

334
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,105
- Huh. Looks like ""retard.''
- Ha ha!

335
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,877
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

336
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,779
That might be true,
Rupert, but who is it?

337
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,378
""R'' is the first letter.

338
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,822
Come on, Rupert,
who is it? I'm tired.

339
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,688
I'll give you a little hint.

340
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:11,863
- Oooo--
- Robert Redford.

341
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,866
Ha ha. No.
Ha ha ha ha.

342
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:19,234
No, no.
That's ""Rupert Pupkin.''

343
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,874
Rupert Pupkin.

344
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,946
I surprised you, didn't I?

345
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,414
Take this as a gift.

346
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:40,517
Take good care of that.
Soon everyone's going to want one.

347
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,185
Rupert, you have not changed.

348
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:46,197
Just a couple of hours ago,
you know who I was talking to?

349
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:49,200
- Guess!
- Your shrink?

350
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,860
Ha ha!
That's very funny.

351
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:54,497
No.Jerry Langford.
That's right. TheJerry Langford.

352
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,064
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.
Would you believe it?

353
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,804
And you know what?
Don't tell anyone yet...

354
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,905
but you're looking
at the new king of comedy.

355
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,644
- Ha ha ha ha.
- Why not me?

356
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,312
Why not? A guy can get
anything he wants...

357
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,218
as long as he pays the price.

358
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,123
What's so funny about that?
I mean, crazier things have happened.

359
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,957
You don't understand
what a shot on Langford means.

360
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,623
That's coast-to-coast national TV,
a bigger audience...

361
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:23,156
than the greatest comedians
used to play to in a whole lifetime.

362
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:27,171
A shot at a free ticket
on the comedy circuit.
My own comedy show--

363
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,173
The Rupert Pupkin Show.
Everything!

364
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,404
And all that leads
in one direction, Rita--Hollywood.

365
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,673
A beach house in Malibu
on the ocean.

366
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:37,181
And we'll keep a suite
at the Sherry.

367
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,683
Everybody stays there
when they make it big.

368
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,687
Up top so we can shout down,
""Hey, tough luck, suckers.

369
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,690
Better luck next time.''
Come on. What do you say?

370
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:48,693
It sounds wonderful, Rupert.
I wish you the best of luck.

371
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,628
But it's getting late,
and I'm a working girl.

372
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:54,962
- I got to go home.
- I--I don't get you!

373
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,468
Here I am,
offering you a way out.

374
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,471
Rita. Every king
needs a queen.

375
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,473
I want you to be mine.

376
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,213
This is a nice street.
Nice building.

377
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,943
- Thanks for your jacket, Rupert.
- Oh.

378
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,888
I guess you're entitled to come up
and have some coffee.

379
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,550
I wouldn't want
to impose, really.

380
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,150
- I know I can--
- What do you want?

381
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,819
What?

382
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,226
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

383
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,235
Rita, you still don't understand?

384
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:34,067
I love you. I want to
help change your life...

385
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,573
if you'll just
give me a chance.

386
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:42,511
What if I set something up
between me, you, and Jerry?

387
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,072
What if we went out
to dinner one night?

388
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,845
You know what's even better?

389
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,080
A summer house for a weekend.

390
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,985
He wouldn't want to meet me.

391
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,581
That's not true.

392
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,593
Jerry is a very nice guy.

393
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,595
He's a very, very nice guy...

394
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,597
and we had
a terrific meeting.

395
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,599
And you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

396
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,000
You have too little faith,
and you're a wonderful person.

397
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:10,033
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest?

398
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,168
O.K.?

399
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,075
O.K.

400
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,083
- Good night.
- Good night.

401
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,977
Go to sleep right away.

402
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,384
[Baby Crying]

403
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,122
I'll tell you, boy.

404
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,732
Hiya, Liza.
Good seeing you.

405
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,830
Jerola. Good seeing you.
Jerry. Don't get up.

406
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,602
Ahh, boy, I'll tell ya...

407
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:48,112
every time you come back
from a tour...

408
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,411
something must be in the air.
The tour really becomes you.

409
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,418
It's like you
become rejuvenated.
I don't know what it is.

410
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,919
Isn't that so, everybody?

411
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:58,422
Isn't that so?
Hey, hey, there.

412
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,482
Well, that is amazing.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

413
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,994
And I know.
You look wonderful, too,Jerry.

414
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,054
I wasn't leaving you out.

415
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:11,302
Bro? Yeah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

416
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,804
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha!

417
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,542
Oh,Jerry!
I love this guy!

418
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,044
Always coming up
with these great lines.

419
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,547
I love 'em. I love 'em.
You're wonderful.

420
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,049
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

421
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:29,053
Rupert.! The bus is here.!
It's early.!

422
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:32,056
Try to be on time for once.!

423
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,557
I can't believe this.

424
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,560
I got to go.
I got to catch a bus.

425
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,220
Jerry.
Take care of yourself.

426
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,891
Baby, be good.
Good luck in Rio.

427
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,266
Good morning, Rupert.

428
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,604
- Good morning.
- How are you?

429
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,940
- This is for you.
- Work.

430
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,081
- What time is it?
- It's 1 0:00.

431
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,210
1 0:00? Could I use the phone
for one second?

432
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:02,310
Is it local?

433
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,753
Sure.Just dial 9 first.
Make it short.

434
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,863
Hello.Jerry Langford, please.

435
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,196
Rupert Pupkin.

436
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:19,935
Thank you.

437
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,874
Yes. Uh, is Jerry there, please?

438
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,536
Rupert Pupkin. Yes.

439
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,880
Just tell him
it's Rupert calling.

440
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,540
He'll know what it's about.

441
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,219
Oh. Oh, he is?

442
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:37,721
Well, that's O.K.
I'm in a meeting myself.

443
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,191
Um,just tell him I called, O.K.?
Thank you very much.

444
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,387
And I'll call later.
Thanks. Bye.

445
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,158
Is that the Jerry Langford?

446
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,664
I'll see you, Roberta.

447
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,530
Yeah. Bye.

448
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:55,129
Hello.Jerry Langford, please.
Rupert Pupkin.

449
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:58,142
Yes. Rupert Pupkin calling
Jerry Langford, please.

450
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,145
Which? The first name
or the second name?

451
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,576
P-u-p-k-i-n.

452
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,514
It's often mispronounced
and misspelled...

453
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,017
so that's why--yes.

454
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,019
Yes,Jerry knows I'm calling.

455
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,021
He knows what it's about.

456
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,249
Oh, sure. Sure.

457
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,020
I see. I see.

458
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,721
I see.
Yes,you can call me.

459
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:21,027
I'll be here for
the next hour and a half.

460
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:26,765
I'm at my office,
and the number is J L5-43 21 .

461
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:30,534
Yo. Come on, man.

462
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,042
If you don't mind...

463
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,044
I am waiting
for a phone call.

464
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:36,546
It will only take a few minutes.

465
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,810
All of these phones don't work.

466
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,818
I am not making a phone call.

467
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,820
I am ex$pecting a phone call.

468
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,516
I'll show you how
to make a phone call.

469
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:49,220
Wait. Let me just slide
in here and make a call.

470
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,852
Let me just make a call!

471
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,658
Uh, it's important.

472
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,164
This phone don't work either.

Hold on a second.
Yes, sir?

00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,035
Yes.Jerry Langford, please.

Your name, please?

Pupkin. P-u-p-k-i-n.

People often misspell it
and mispronounce it.

482
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:49,053
There's a man here by the name
of Rupert Pumpkin.

He wants to see
Mr. Langford.

484
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:57,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Pumpkin...

485
00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:01,065
but Mr. Langford's secretary has
no record of your appointment.

486
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,329
Pardon me?

487
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:07,031
We have no record
of your appointment.

488
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,439
I don't have an official
appointment with Jerry...

489
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,000
but he did ask me
to call him personally.

490
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:16,514
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd just stop up.

491
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:19,015
I had trouble calling
for some reason.

492
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,574
The lines seemed to be busy.

He has no appointment.

494

Mr. Langford's secretary
wants to know...

495
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,191
what this is in reference to.

Mr. Gangetti, go right in.

Hello? Yes.Jerry and I...

on the show last night.

He told me to call. Yes.

00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:38,391

Is that cork?

00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:21,841
I don't know what it is.

504
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,312
Is it dripping on you?

505
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,317
No. I was looking
at the patterns.

506
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:29,684
You know,
cork is good for sound.

Sorry. I'm Cathy Long.

Sorry. I've already spoken
toJerry directly...

about my being on the show.

517
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:59,049
He said to talk to him
personally.

518
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,551
What is it exactly that you do?

00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:07,991
As soon as you
start working again...

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,496
call, and we'll send someone down
to check out your act.

523
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,655
Thanks for stopping by.

524
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:15,666
Jerry and I went over
all this last night.

525
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,167
Does Jerry know your work?

526
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:19,169
Yes. I don't think he does.

527
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:22,001
You have a tape
I could listen you?

528
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:24,668
A tape? Oh, naturally.
Whatever you'd like. Sure.

529
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:25,835
Drop by a tape.

530
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,847
I will. I can see
whyJerry would need that.

531

Nice meeting you.

Nice talking to you.

We've got to talk.

539
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,374
What happened last night?
Did Jerry say anything?

540
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,876
- Nothing happened.
- Did he talk about me?

541
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,378
No. He talked about me.

542
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,880
He must have said
something about me.

543
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,382
Nothing.
What could he say...

544
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,010
after what you did
in the car last night?

545
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,781
You must be really loving this.

546
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,790
Yeah. You were schmucko
supremo last night.

547
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,793
I'm the schmuck? Me?
You're wrong, buddy!

548
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,295
If I hadn't gotten
in that car last night...

549
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,297
you wouldn't
have had the chance...

550
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,334
to talk toJerry.
Keep that in mind.

551
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,562
Not to be cruel,
but we're nearJerry's building.

552
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:28,037
God forbid he
should see me with you...

553
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:31,405
becauseJerry and I have a real
relationship, no fantasy world.

554
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,410
After what you did last night...

555
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,912
I don't want
to see you anymore.

556
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,073
Fine! If that's what you want!

557
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,980
Yes. That's what I want.

558
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,483
Just get it to him!

559
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,077
I'm not giving him anything.
No way,Jose.

560
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,589
You're so friendly.
You give it to him.

561
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,090
We're having
a communication problem.

562
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,592
That's what you call it?

563
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,595
You're always bragging about
how you broke bread with Jerry.

564
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,755
Give it to him.

565
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:56,767
Just do this for me!
I've done things for you!

566
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,268
What have you done for me?

567
00:30:58,336 --> 00:30:59,928
What are you talking about?

568
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,097
How about Howard Johnson's?

569
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,336
I bought you food and coffee
night after night!

570
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,536
You're crazy.
You didn't get me anything.

571
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,704
- I bought my coffee.
- You never bought anything!

572
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,045
I did things for you
that no money can buy.

573
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,551
How about when
I gave you my spot?

574
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,554
I let you get
right next toJerry!

575
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,385
I waited for eight hours.

576
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,893
You were crying because
you wanted next toJerry.

577
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,053
You got next to him!

578
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,563
What about giving
you my last album...

579
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,064
of The Best ofJerry.!

580
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,567
I didn't even
ask you for money...

581
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:33,069
and I can't even pay my rent!

582
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:36,574
I live in a hovel.
You live in a townhouse!

583
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:40,577
O.K., you want to do that?
I got money for you!

584
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:43,580
I can't believe how long
I've hung out with you...

585
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,809
and listened to your tired,
stale, boring jokes.

586
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:48,114
- Here's $900. No! No!
- Be quiet.

587
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,381
Take this and give it toJerry!

588
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:53,754
This is the last time.
This is the last time.

589
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,383
When will he get it?

590
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,586
Because you're a wacko.

591
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,094
I'll know if you don't.!

592
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:00,757
I know where you
and Jerry are.!

00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,426

Remember that!

What are you looking at?
Beat it.!

595
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:07,803
You scum.!
You're street trash.!

596
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,519
First of all, Miss Long...

597
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,078
thank you very much
for your help at the office...

598
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,386
and for passing this
ontoJerry.

599
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,825
I appreciate it
more than you know.

600
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,054
Jerry, before I begin...

601
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,563
thank you for listening
to this material...

602
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,066
and for the opportunity
you've given me.

603
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:39,069
Lots of people think
that people who've made it...

604
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:42,573
lose their feeling for
struggling young talent,
such as myself.

605
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,074
Now I know from experience...

606
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,076
that those people
are just cynics...

607
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,078
embittered by their own failure.

608
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,411
I know,Jerry, that you are
as human as the rest of us...

609
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,246
if not more so.

610
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:55,582
There's no point
in going on about it.

611
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:58,418
You know how I feel,
so let's get on with the show--

00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,389
Jerry, I've sketched out
this little outline...

614
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,258
to save you time.

615
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,524
It's a little introduction.

616
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:09,032
So close your eyes,
imagine it's exactly 6:00.

617
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,533
You're standing in the wings...

618
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,036
and we hear Lou Brown
and the orchestra...

619
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:16,267

-Are you crazy?
-Say hello...

632
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,332
What's wrong with you?

- People are sleeping.!
-Aw, Mom.!

Mom!

Take it easy.
Lower it.

638

I'm not going to lower it!

I have to do this now!

I don't mind you playing it...

641

but lower it.!

Now, you come on,Jerry,

this is how
I see you introducing me.

645

You could say
something like this.

Mr. Pipkin...

661

Pupkin. You'll get it
right one of these days.

I'll bet you have a tape.

We'll listen and get
it back to you soon.

Thanks. When Jerry
finds a moment. Good.

667

When will that be?

668

Uh...Actually,

- Otherwise, Monday.
- Monday? Hmm.

671
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,609
What I might do
is just wait here awhile.

672
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,119
MaybeJerry will find a minute.

673
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,122
You're really
just wasting your time.

674

We won't know anything
till tomorrow at the earliest.

675

I don't mind.
I'm not wasting my time.

I'm glad to do it.
It's important to me.

- Monday?

At least once in his life,
every man is a genius.

I'll tell you something, Rupe...

692
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,978
it will be more than once
in your life for you...

693
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,137
because you've got it.

694
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:45,148
From what I've heard here,
yeah, you've got it...

695
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:46,649
and you're stuck with it.

696
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:49,482
If you wanted to get rid of it,
you couldn't.

697
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,885
It's always going to be there.

698
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:54,118
I know there's
no formula for it.

699
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:56,387
I just don't know
how you do it...

700
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,395
and I'm not curious, mind you...

701
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:00,522
because I want to use
the material.

702
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:04,034
I'm curious because
I don't know how you do it.

703
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:05,967
I really have to ask you that.

704
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,095
How do you do it?

705
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:10,607
I think it's that
I look at my whole life...

706
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:13,109
and I see the awful things
in my life...

707
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,611
and turn it
into something funny.

708
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,113
It just happens...

709
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,615
but what about
the first few one-liners?

710
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,515
Were they strong enough?

711
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,521
If they were any stronger,
you'd hurt yourself.

712
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,022
They're marvelous,
you daffy bastard.

They're beautiful.

Listen to me.

Listen to me.

A man said something
very profound some years ago...

717
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,889
which I later originated.

If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

I know it's so good?

- Yes.
- 'Cause I envy you.

721
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:46,009
I hate you, but I envy you...

722
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:49,513
because it's purity, it's marvelous,
it's humor based on you.

723
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:51,947
No one else
could do it, but you.

724
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:53,176
I wouldn't lie.

how you do it.

this is the mystery guest?

He's an enemy.

I'll explain company policy
to you on the way, O.K.?

918
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:12,965
I'm pretty sure
you understand...

919
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:15,471
that we have
certain rules here...

920
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,635
that are essential to
the smooth functioning
of our operation, right?

921
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,972
Right.

922
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:22,979
Right. Good.
I can just say--

923

Just listen, please.

924
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,978
And that without these rules...

925
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,486
we really wouldn't be able
to function at our best.

00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:39,995

You do not
have an appointment.

935
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,001
Now, company policy is that
only authorized personnel...

936
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,506
and those persons with official
business with our organization...

937
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,507
are permitted on our premises.

938
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:55,602
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

939
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:22,638
Well, did you get it to him?

940
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,401
What?

941
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,943
Did you get my letter to him?

942
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:28,774
He's not in there, O.K.?

943
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:32,509
Now that you're in with him,
you can't do me a favor?

944
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,983
Don't bother.
Just give me the letter.

945
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,520
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in.

946
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:39,886
- Who?
-Jerry.

947
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,652
He's up there.
Want to see him?

948
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:45,821
That's impossible, because
they assured me that he was out.

949
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,329
And you believed them?

950
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:50,299
You're so naive.
I would expect that from you.

951
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,699
You're so inexperienced.
You're such a chump.

952
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,670
He went up there just now?

953
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:56,330
Of course. Go back up.

954
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:57,738
Assert yourself a little bit.

955
00:49:57,808 --> 00:49:59,207
He's up there right now.

956
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,422
Would you tellJerry
I'm here to see him, please?

957
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:15,890
I'm sorry. He's not in.

958
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,859
I happen to know that he is.

959
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:19,327
I'm sorry. He's not in.

960
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:22,365
O.K., you're putting your job
on the line, lady.

961
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,129
Security...

962
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,669
You, too.

963
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,139
[Telephone Rings]

964
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:51,924
Mr. Pupkin,
what are you doing here?

965
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,121
Mr. Pupkin.

966
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:55,493
Mr. Pupkin.

967
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,057
Shelly, get security
on the telephone.

968
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,441
There he goes.

969
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:10,212
Aah! Hold on, right.

970
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,807
Grab his other arm.
Hold on to him, right.

971
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:15,818
All right.
Right out the door.

972
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:16,978
Come on.

973
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,749
You wouldn't listen, eh?

974
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,813
Jerry,Jerry!

975
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:22,415
Nobody's going to help you.

976
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:25,462
You're going to have a lot
of explaining to do, Mr. Wirtz.

977
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:26,996
You had your warning, Krupkin.

978
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:29,157
My lawyer will be calling you.

979
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:32,066
Make sure
he gets my name right.

980
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,468
Say goodbye to our guest,
Miss Long.

981
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,403
Wait tillJerry hears about this.

982
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:39,340
Don't worry. I will mention
your name toJerry.

983
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,902
Now listen good, because
if we see your face again...

984
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,174
I--I understand.

985
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:46,182
We're going to call the police.

986
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,239
Thank you.

987
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,877
Thank you very much. Ha ha.

988
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,887
- Terrific.
- Thank you.

989
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,150
I suppose you got
the letter to him.

990
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:55,589
No. I'll get it later.

991
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,991
When?
You just got thrown out.

992
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,825
I didn't get thrown out
of the building.

993
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:04,299
Excuse me. I wasn't getting
thrown out of the building.

994
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,892
You're a constant embarrassment.

995
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:08,233
They walked me outside.
Just a moment.

996
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,239
You can't handle
the simplest thing.

997
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:11,774
I'll tell you something else.

998
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,902
I'm going toJerry's for the weekend.
He invited me.

999
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:16,411
That's how much you know.

1000
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,448
Do I look O.K.?

1001
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:20,483
You look wonderful.

1002
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,018
Does this look all right?

1003
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:23,450
That, I'm not sure about...

1004
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,919
but you look wonderful.

1005
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:26,216
What do you mean?

1006
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,655
What's wrong with it?

1007
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,988
I don't think you need it.
That's all.

1008
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,994
You don't think it looks nice?

1009
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:33,529
No. It looks wonderful.

1010
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:51,739
Hello.

1011
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:53,146
Hello. You must beJonno.

1012
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,309
Yes.

1013
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:57,182
My name is Rupert Pupkin.
This is Rita Keene.

1014
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,119
LetJerry know
that we're here.

1015
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,180
Mr. Langford ask you to come?

1016
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:05,854
Oh, no. We just thought we'd
drop in uninvited for the weekend.

1017
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:07,396
Oh, what a view.

1018
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:08,863
The blue bag is mine.

1019
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:10,729
But Mr. Langford's not here.

1020
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,530
Where is he?
Out playing golf?

1021
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:13,831
Yes.

1022
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:15,997
I hope he's finally
going to break 1 00.

1023
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:17,267
1 00?

1024
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:19,468
Perhaps better you come back.

1025
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,771
We'll just wait.

1026
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:23,472
But Mr. Langford's not here.

1027
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:25,811
No. That's O.K.
We'll just wait.

1028
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:28,010
It's O.K.
We don't mind waiting.

1029
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:29,382
Is this lovely?

1030
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:36,025
The table's only set for one.

1031
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:43,599
How you like it?

1032
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,100
I could live here.

1033
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:48,069
Mr. Langford,
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

1034
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:49,901
Uh, what's wrong?
Everything's wrong.

1035
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:51,804
There a couple over here.

1036
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,400
His name is,
uh, uh, Pumpkin.

1037
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,447
Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

1038
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:03,181
So, didn't you tell him
what time we'd be getting here?

1039
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:06,188
We didn't have time
to iron out the details.

1040
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:09,157
Yeah, but that butler
wasn't even expecting us.

1041
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:12,127
Jerry has more important
things to think about...

1042
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:14,595
than what he's going to
tell his houseboy.

1043
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,633
Oh, really?
Well, excuse me.

1044
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:22,429
He knows everything.

1045
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,974
He knows you're playing golf
and everything.

1046
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:27,840
He want to spend
a weekend over here.

1047
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,402
Yes, and you better come back.

1048
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,879
He's, uh,
he's touching everything.

1049
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:33,280
He's ruining the house.

1050
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,818
Hey, I'm getting
a heart attack already.

1051
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:37,285
Here's a famous one...

1052
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:40,187
with the youngest clown
in the world--Zippo.

1053
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:43,886
Remember this one with
Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

1054
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,191
- That's famous.
- I know.

1055
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:49,494
Here's a famous one when
he was a kid, 1 2 years old.

1056
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:50,965
Someone sent this in.

1057
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:54,094
It was part of the show--
""I knew you when'' section.

1058
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:56,639
Someone sent that in as a joke.

1059
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:59,676
Jerry shows it
to everyone on the show.

1060
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:04,339
If I should take a notion...

1061
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:07,281
Let's get a little life
in this place.

1062
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:08,841
It's like a funeral parlor.

1063
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,251
Rita, you should
really turn that off.

1064
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:14,256
You shouldn't put that on now.
It's not polite.

1065
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:16,053
How about a spin, handsome?

1066
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:18,560
I can't really dance
in the house.

1067
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:20,460
A little fun
never hurt anybody.

1068
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,963
What ifJerry walks in?

1069
00:55:22,032 --> 00:55:25,593
He'll be happy to see us
having a good time.

1070
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:28,661
You're his friend.
He won't mind.

1071
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,403
Ain't nobody's business
if I do

1072
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:36,543
Oh, one day...

1073
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,480
Wonder what the rest
of this place is like.

1074
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:42,245
Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

1075
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,152
Oh, that--no, Rita.
I wouldn't go up there.

1076
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:49,784
Rita, Rita, Rita,
I don't think it's a good idea.

1077
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,986
Rita.

1078
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,028
They're watching us.

1079
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:54,655
You don't have the right
to go upstairs.

1080
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,255
Rita, please don't go.

1081
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,269
[Doorbell Chimes]

1082
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:07,773
You going to open
the goddamn door?

1083
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:08,833
Mr. Langford.

1084
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,345
Standing out there eight minutes.

1085
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,678
What was with the door?
Jesus.

1086
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:14,046
Where are they?

1087
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,585
I was going to call the police.

1088
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:19,747
Hi,Jerry. Hi,Jerry.
How are you?

1089
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:21,757
We were just
freshening up upstairs.

1090
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:24,760
Rita, I want you to meet
the Jerry Langford.

1091
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:27,695
Jerry, I want you
to meet the Rita Keene.

1092
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:28,788
Come on down.

1093
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:31,629
That a girl.
Come on down.

1094
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:33,533
What's your pleasure,Jerry?

1095
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:38,373
It's kind of hot out there.

1096
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,239
I want something nice to drink.

1097
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,301
Jerry, what would you like?

1098
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:46,112
Jerry.

1099
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:49,516
Excuse us for taking the liberty,
but it's not every day...

1100
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:53,044
that a girl like Rita
meets a man like you.

1101
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:56,092
This is part of your success.
What can you do?

1102
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,626
How was your golf game?

1103
00:56:57,694 --> 00:56:59,127
Did you finally break 1 00?

1104
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,323
[Jonno] I told them
you were not here.

1105
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:02,626
[Rita] That's right. He did.

1106
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:05,167
They did,Jerry.
They were very helpful.

1107
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:08,864
We took an earlier train
because there wasn't
anything until after 1 :00.

1108
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:12,102
Anyway, I brought the work.
It's right here...

1109
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,439
all ready and set to go.

1110
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:15,978
So...

1111

1112
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,383
What everybody?

1113
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,885
What everybody?
The guests,Jer.

1114
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,355
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

1115
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,824

have you arrested?

He could have us arrested.

1117
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:37,199
Of course. There's no way that
we can prove that we belong here.

1118

When he comes up with an idea,
he's terrific.

1119
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,270
Really?
I never thought of that.

1120
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:43,772
You should have.

1121
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,740
We could set up a story...

1122
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,801
where you invite your friends
out for the weekend...

1123
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:52,280
and you throw them all in jail.
Ha ha ha.

1124

That's terrific.
That's terrific.

What's the matter?
Lighten up.

Let's work on that
after we work on this.

Walked in the door.
What do you mean?

1129

What's the matter with you?

I think you're upset.

1132
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,625
I'm going to leave
my material here.

1133

We'll talk later.

You've got more important
things to worry about.

We'll take a stroll
until lunchtime.

Did anyone ever tell you
you're a moron?

You know,Jerry,
I want to tell you something.

1138
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:24,913
Ordinarily,
I wouldn't allow anyone...

No. He's not saying that.

you're not saying that.

Where you going, Rita?

There'll be a cab here
in 1 0 minutes.

I'd appreciate if you'd use it.

You are.

1153

Did I say something wrong?

1154
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:55,875
'Cause if I did...

1155
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:58,380
could we chalk it up
to inexperience.

1156

I have my stuff right here.

We could do it
in a half an hour at the most.

01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:37,315
by the very latest,
1 2:00, 1 2:30.

1270
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:40,885
Oh, maybe 1 :00.
1 :1 5 the very latest.

1271
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,933
What I want you to do
is call your producer.

1272
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,160
Call what?

1273
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:48,170
Bert Thomas.
I want you to call him.

1274
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:50,172
I'll give you the phone now.

1275
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,707
Get him on the phone...

1276
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:55,210
and I'll tell you
exactly what to say, O.K.?

1277
01:03:56,646 --> 01:03:58,580
Now, if you don't do it...

1278
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,809
I don't know what to say.

1279
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:02,818
There could be a problem.

1280
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,619
Now watch your eyes,Jerry.

1281
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:08,179
I'm going to take these off now.

1282
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:10,726
It's a little
bright in here, O.K.?

1283
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:26,401
O.K.

1284
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:32,780
Are these yours?

1285
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:35,549
Jerry, these are yours?

1286
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:36,710
Yeah.

1287
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:39,186
Do you mind if I have one?

1288
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:42,418
- I don't mind.
- Thank you.

1289
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:44,619
- Masha, do you want one?
- Save it for me.

1290
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:46,127
You want one?

1291
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:49,188
Yeah, I'd love one,
but will you save it?

1292
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:51,699
It's a little inconvenient
at the moment.

1293
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,167
Do you want one?

1294
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:54,396
No.

1295
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:57,200
I'll just take one
for later, then.

1296
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:01,701
You know, there's no reason
to get mad about it.

1297
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:04,144
I'm just trying
to ease the tension.

1298
01:05:04,214 --> 01:05:06,580
Even though this is
a strange situation...

1299
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,082
there are moments
of friendship...

1300
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:10,676
and moments of sharing,
or whatever.

1301
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:12,152
O.K., let's go.

1302
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:18,217
Jerry, I mean business.

1303
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,455
Get on the phone.
Let's go.

1304
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,259
The fun is over.

1305
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,296
Let's go. Come on.

1306
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,850
Bert Thomas, please.
Jerry Langford.

1307
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,657
What happened?

1308
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,059
They hung up.

1309
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:57,992
Call them again.

1310
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,694
Why did they hang up?

1311
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:01,669
Probably thought it was a gag.

1312
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,706
We get that all the time.

1313
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:05,206
Well, I find that strange...

1314
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:06,936
but it's typical...

1315
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,911
'cause that's the way
they treat even you...

1316
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:12,914
'cause I'll let you in
on a little secret.

1317
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:16,076
That's the way
they treated me...

1318
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:18,450
and now look where we are.

1319
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:22,882
Bert Thomas.

1320
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:24,358
Audrey, this is Jerry Langford.

1321
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:26,554
Get Bert Thomas
on the phone quickly.

1322
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:29,655
I'm too busy for fun
and games today. Goodbye.

1323
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:31,632
Did you hear what I said?

1324
01:06:31,701 --> 01:06:33,168
This is Jerry Langford.

1325
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,966
Get Bert Thomas.
This is serious. Now move it.

1326
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:40,741
Why don't we have
somebody else?

1327
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,799
Like what?

1328
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:44,244
It's Mr. Langford.
He says it's urgent.

1329
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:47,750
Tell him I'll call him back.
I'm busy.

1330
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:49,648
It's that Martino kid
the impressionist.

1331
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:50,845
O.K.

1332
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,945
Will you do what I tell you?

1333
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:54,148
Do it quick.

1334
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:56,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas.

1335
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:58,560
He absolutely insists
on talking to you.

1336
01:06:58,628 --> 01:07:00,061
O.K., I'll take it.

1337
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,325
Martino,
you know better than--

1338
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,266
Bert, I said this is Jerry.

1339
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:10,363
Jerry Langford,
and I'm in deep trouble.

1340
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,465
Now, you'd best pay attention.

1341
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,271
Yeah. I am listening.

1342
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,148
Would you give me that again?

1343
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:25,016
Now, wait a minute.

1344
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:27,181
Um, I want to
ask you something.

1345
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:31,056
What do we call our
second camera man?

1346
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:34,858
We call our second camera man
Helen Keller.

1347
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,067
His favorite color is plaid.

1348
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,968
Helen Keller, plaid?
What is that?

1349
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:44,438
When someone imitates me
on the phone...

1350
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:48,443
the only way they know
it's me is by that clue.

1351
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:52,072
And if I didn't know
the name we call him--

1352
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:53,615
Say no more.
I understand.

1353
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:57,312
Now, listen, Bert.
Listen carefully.

1354
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:00,612
""I have a gun...''

1355
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:04,751
""at my head.''

1356
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:11,024
""If a man who identifies himself as...''

1357
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:17,939
""the king...''

1358
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:23,976
The card's upside down.

1359
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:27,210
Sorry.

1360
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:32,551
""Is not allowed to be
the first guest on...''

1361
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:40,328
You got a blank card there.

1362
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:41,988
Hold on, Bert.

1363
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:44,862
I'm reading from cue cards.

1364
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,507
"Tonight's show... '

1365
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,577
"you'll never see me... '

1366
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:01,845
Go back.

1367
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:05,046
"Alive again. '

1368
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:08,650
It--it's not
grammatically correct...

1369
01:09:08,724 --> 01:09:11,693
but I think you have the idea.

1370
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,730
It's clear, but let me
break in for a minute.

1371
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:16,264
Don't you do anything silly.

1372
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:18,823
O.K., I'm O.K.

1373
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:21,893
I'm O.K., Bert.
Just get it done.

1374
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,808
He wants you to call at 5:00.

1375
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:28,844
I'll give you
the private number...

1376
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:30,811
and they'll do
whatever you want.

1377
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,848
O.K., that was very good,Jerry.

1378
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:35,179
Turn around
and see how it looks.

1379
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:37,481
Oh, I love it.

1380
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:39,885
I'm sorry. The sleeves
aren't quite right.

1381
01:09:39,956 --> 01:09:41,890
Do you like it on him?

1382
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,516
What do you think?

1383
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:45,959
I think it looks pretty good.

1384
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:48,519
To guess on it,
have it turn out like this.

1385
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:49,895
I'm very pleased with it.

1386
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:51,194
The color's great.

1387
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:55,101
I like to see him
a little more casual for a change.

1388
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:58,538
This is a look
I like to see on him.

1389
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:00,007
Not so uptight.
Not so...

1390
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,010
I got to get started here.

1391
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:03,272
It's wonderful.
It's very good.

1392
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:05,837
- Be honest with me.
- I'm being honest.

1393
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,246
Would you wear it?

1394
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:10,410
I like it. I'm so glad
I went with red.

1395
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,420
It looks so good on him.

1396
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:14,388
It looks good,Jerry.

1397
01:10:14,457 --> 01:10:16,925
- Come on.
- What?

1398
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:18,722
Take it off and let's go.

1399
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:19,726
Oh, O.K., fine.

1400
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:22,127
You want me to take it off?

1401
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:23,256
Yeah.

1402
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:25,596
Can't he wear it
for a little while?

1403
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:27,602
Will you take it off,
please?

1404
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,467
I know he's in a meeting.

1405
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:33,441
This is an emergency,
and I've got to talk to him.

1406
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:37,377
You'll interrupt him or I'll come
busting into that meeting.

1407
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,506
No. Forget calling me back.
I'm on my way.

1408
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,711
Why didn't you
just listen to the tape?

1409
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,219
It wasn't that hard...

1410
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:48,280
a few minutes of your time
to listen to something...

1411
01:10:48,357 --> 01:10:50,791
that I worked
on my whole life.

1412
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,293
Let's go to my office...

1413
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:55,296
and we'll play
the tape right now.

1414
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:58,390
Do you know what would
happen if I went there?

1415
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,900
You know, I'm not stupid.

1416
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,402
Nobody's calling you stupid.

1417
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,802
You pulled this off.
That makes you smart.

1418
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:07,274
You know,Jerry,
I'm going to tell you something.

1419
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:09,277
Friendship is a two-way street.

1420
01:11:09,345 --> 01:11:12,610
Do you know that?

1421
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,116
And you couldn't
care less about me.

1422
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:16,617
Am I holding this
till next Shavuot?

1423
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:18,620
You going to make
some decisions?

1424
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:21,953
You going to knock off the talking
for two minutes?

1425
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:23,958
You put the sweater on him.

1426
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:25,584
Yeah. It took one minute.

1427
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,095
- You have a long night
ahead of you.
- I have something to say.

1428
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:29,597
You've got enough to say.

1429
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:31,098
- You're driving me nuts.
-Just a minute.

1430
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,601
Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute...

1431
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:36,729
and let me rest
with this gun?

1432
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:38,740
You're driving me crazy!

1433
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:41,242
You haven't shut up
since we've walked in.

1434
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,108
This is my house.
This is my domain.

1435
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,671
Jerry is my guest,
and you're my guest.

1436
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:48,182
And you're lucky to be here.

1437
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,683
You change in my house.

1438
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:53,188
You get to get your head together
for the show tonight.

1439
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:54,654
Give me a little break.

1440
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:57,158
-Shut up.
- Why don't you shut up?

1441
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,524
I listened to you
talk about that sweater.

1442
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:01,426
Worrying about the sleeves,
the color.

1443
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:02,930
Did I say anything?

1444
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,432
I made it forJerry...

1445
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,661
and it looks
fabulous on him.

1446
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:08,169
Whose idea was this anyway?

1447
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:11,673
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't even be here.

1448
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:15,199
Why didn't you just listen
to the tape when I asked?

1449
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,074
I'm sure you can understand.

1450
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:20,582
Doing the kind of show I'm doing,
it's mind-boggling.

1451
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,084
There's so much stuff
that comes down...

1452
01:12:23,152 --> 01:12:25,848
you can't keep
your head clear.

1453
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,355
And if that's the case,
I'm wrong.

1454
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:29,789
You're right.
I'm wrong.

1455
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,292
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

1456
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,294
I'm just a human being...

1457
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:36,798
with all of the foibles
and all of the traps...

1458
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,299
the show,
the pressure...

1459
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,800
the groupies,
the autograph hounds...

1460
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:41,302
the crew,
the incompetence...

1461
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,305
those behind-the-scenes
you think are your friends.

1462
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:46,807
You're not sure if you'll
be there tomorrow...

1463
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:48,309
because of their incompetence.

1464
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:50,311
There are wonderful pressures
that make every day...

1465
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:52,939
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

1466
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,573
It's terrific.

1467
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,517
O.K., if all of
that means nothing...

1468
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,020
if I'm wrong,
in spite of all that...

1469
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,488
then I apologize.

1470
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:02,649
I'm sorry.

1471
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:05,216
If you accept my apology...

1472
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:07,159
I think we should shake hands.

1473
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,662
We'll forget the whole thing.

1474
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,164
I won't press charges.

1475
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:12,166
You could be
in deep trouble...

1476
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:16,534
but I will not
press charges.

1477
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:18,732
That's easy for you to say.

1478
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:20,241
But I mean it.

1479
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:21,742
I'll go to the office...

1480
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:24,245
and tell them all it's a gag.

1481
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:25,746
They'll understand that.

1482
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:27,510
If I tell them, they'll buy it.

1483
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,448
Then we'll put the tape on.

1484
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:32,214
Sit down.
I said, ""sit down.''

1485
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:33,619
You heard what he said.

1486
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:36,783
With a gun on him,
he wants to be friends.

1487
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:39,293
What happens
when he walks out the door?

1488
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,556
What happens then,Jerry?

1489
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,860
You get to his office,
and they jump you.

1490
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:45,400
Is that what happens,Jerry?

1491
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:47,902
Not if I tell them not to.

1492
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,904
No one's going to jump you.

1493
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,532
If I tell them to,
they do it.

1494
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:54,542
No one's going to jump you.

1495
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:57,807
Now, that's the truth.
Take my word for it.

1496
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,815
If you think
I'm not telling you the truth...

1497
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:02,316
then don't respond.

1498
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:05,615
If I'm telling the truth,
let me out of here.

1499
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:07,656
He gives me his word.

1500
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:08,815
And what else?

1501
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:10,552
And what else,Jerry?

1502
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:16,394
There is nothing else,
just my word.

1503
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,831
Now, isn't my word
good enough?

1504
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:23,537
I'm sorry,Jerry.

1505
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:42,555
Suppose we tape him,
he doesn't talk...

1506
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,490
it gets to be 1 1 :30...

1507
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,994
do we put him on
no matter what?

1508
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:48,495
Go ahead and tape him.

1509
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:49,997
It won't hurt anything.

1510
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:51,293
You can always erase it.

1511
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,301
We may learn
something from it...

1512
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,098
and it'll also buy us time.

1513
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:56,604
But under no circumstances...

1514
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,970
will we put this man
on the air.

1515
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,508
This lunatic
is threatening Jerry.

1516
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:02,669
You're not putting him
on the air?

1517
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:04,474
Gentlemen,
let's not get excited.

1518
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:05,912
I don't think you understand.

1519
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:07,414
We'll tape at 7:00.

1520
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:09,417
We won't have
to make a decision...

1521
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:11,783
about putting him
on the air till 1 1 :30.

1522
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:14,288
This gives us
four hours to move in.

1523
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:15,789
Hopefully, by that time...

1524
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:18,326
we'll have your
Mr. Langford back safely.

1525
01:15:18,394 --> 01:15:19,884
Harry, that's it.
We're suing.

1526
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:21,862
We're going to sue everybody.

1527
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,489
Who is this man?

1528
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:25,056
Jerry's lawyer.
That's who he is.

1529
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,601
Who am I?

1530
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:28,864
I'm the one who's suing.
I'm the lawyer.

1531
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:29,870
Jay.

1532
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:31,406
Don'tJay me, please.

1533
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,907
Jay, who are you
going to sue?

1534
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,409
We're suing you personally.

1535
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:36,910
Who else are you're suing?

1536
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:38,139
The FBI.

1537
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:39,647
We have a serious situation.

1538
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:41,615
I want it dealt with rationally.

1539
01:15:41,684 --> 01:15:43,117
Unless we start talking politely...

1540
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,278
there's going to be
serious consequences.

1541
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,652
There's nothing polite
about kidnapping.

1542
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:50,658
It's one of the most
stupid offenses ever created.

1543
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:52,159
Where's the defense
of kidnapping?

1544
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:54,696
How can you say,
""I was crazy,''

1545
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:57,197
""I didn't know
what I was doing,''

1546
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,734
- "I did on the spur
of the moment'?
- Who cares? Who cares?

1547
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:01,667
Only an idiot kidnaps...

1548
01:16:01,737 --> 01:16:03,967
and decides to do
what you're doing.

1549
01:16:13,616 --> 01:16:15,880
Jerry, I'm going to go now.

1550
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:18,385
Pretty soon,
you'll be able to go...

1551
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:19,887
about 1 2:00 as I said.

1552
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:22,150
Have a good time.

1553
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:24,556
I know you will.

1554
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:25,855
Bye.

1555
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:32,200
First of all,
we don't know...

1556
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:34,236
whether we're dealing
with kidnappers or terrorists.

1557
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:35,463
Terrorists?
Terrorists?

1558
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:38,005
You might have this man
go on the air...

1559
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:39,472
deliver a coded message...

1560
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,475
and very possibly 50 people...

1561
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:43,875
around the country
would lose their lives.

1562
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:45,914
You're out of your mind.

1563
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:47,414
I'm not out of my mind.

1564
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:48,916
That guy will be taped.

1565
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,918
We'll listen to what he says.

1566
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,420
And unless something horrendous
is on that tape...

1567
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:55,719
we'll put that tape
on the air.

1568
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,225
Because all we're dealing
with is 1 0 minutes...

1569
01:16:58,294 --> 01:17:00,728
of talk show time
against a man's life.

1570
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:03,230
And I don't see that
as any argument.

1571
01:17:03,299 --> 01:17:06,291
Hello. How are you today?

1572
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:07,630
Well, I'm calling--

1573
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:11,298
Mr. King calling collect
long-distance for Mr. Thomas.

1574
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:14,570
Mr. Thomas,
there's a long-distance call.

1575
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:17,111
Let's go.
This is it.

1576
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,272
Remember.
Keep him talking.

1577
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,873
Uh, hi there.
Who is this?

1578
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:23,316
This is Mr. King.

1579
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:24,818
I'm calling for Mr. King.

1580
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,821
Well, you're right on time.

1581
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,322
Yes. Of course.

1582
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,823
We're always punctual.

1583
01:17:29,892 --> 01:17:31,189
We're fine. Thank you.

1584
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,194
I want to make it brief--

1585
01:17:33,262 --> 01:17:35,287
Could I break in and ask...

1586
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,127
could I speak toJerry?

1587
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,632
Jerry's not with us now.

1588
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:40,134
We're at a pay phone.

1589
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:42,534
So, don't try
and have the call traced...

1590
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:44,037
which I noticed you did.

1591
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:46,540
It's kind of important,
you know...

1592
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,668
so that we know that
he's in your care.

1593
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:52,179
We're bringing along
an article of clothing...

1594
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:53,544
that I know you'll recognize.

1595
01:17:53,615 --> 01:17:55,549
It will be satisfactory
to everyone.

1596
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:58,051
It's not as easy as you think...

1597
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,145
just to walk in the studio--

1598
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,656
No, Bert,
if I could call you--

1599
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:06,092
Well, if I could just say,
there is no problem.

1600
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:07,651
The material is clean material.

1601
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,664
Do you know
standards and practices?

1602
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,791
No. But that can be discussed.

1603
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,301
Now, all I can say is...

1604
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,803
don't have any press leaks.

1605
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:19,739
You must keep the audience
there until 1 1 :45 or 1 2:00...

1606
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:21,639
after it has been
aired nationally.

1607
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,736
Thank you.
We'll discuss the other things.

1608
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,246
Nice talking to you.

1609
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:27,407
One--

1610
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:31,652
Boy, he's shrewd.

1611
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,211
He just, uh,
wouldn't buy anything.

1612
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:34,440
I feel completely
impulsive tonight.

1613
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:36,643
Anything could happen.

1614
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,152
I have so much to tell you.

1615
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,155
I don't know
where to start.

1616
01:19:41,223 --> 01:19:43,657
I want to tell you
everything about myself...

1617
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:46,956
everything you don't know.

1618
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:49,725
Do you like these glasses?

1619
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:50,992
Crystal. Beautiful.

1620
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:53,000
I bought them just for you.

1621
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:54,501
There's something about them...

1622
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,003
the simplicity of them.

1623
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,504
If you don't like them...

1624
01:19:57,573 --> 01:20:00,542
if there's a doubt
in your mind...

1625
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,042
[Glass Shatters]

1626
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:08,382
You know,
sometimes during the day...

1627
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,883
I'll do the simplest things.

1628
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:13,388
I'll be taking a bath
and I say to myself...

1629
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:16,390
""I wonder ifJerry's
taking a bath right now?''

1630
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,891
And I just hope...

1631
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,894
that you're not drowning
or something.

1632
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,896
I get really worried about you...

1633
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:24,524
like something terrible
is going to happen.

1634
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,033
I have these daydreams...

1635
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:28,194
like I'm with you
at the golf course...

1636
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,703
driving your cart...

1637
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:32,968
just driving around.

1638
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,805
Need a putter,Jer,
you know?

1639
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,311
Need an iron?

1640
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,847
I don't even know
how to play golf.

1641
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,849
I played with my parents once...

1642
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:45,614
but, uh, but I love you.

1643
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:53,260
I never told my parents
that I love them.

1644
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:56,263
They never told me
that they loved me either...

1645
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:57,764
which was fine with me.

1646
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,358
But I love you.

1647
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:04,166
You want some wine?
No, O.K.

1648
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,106
I'm not in the mood to drink
either, though.

1649
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:10,111
I'm in the mood to
be alone with you.

1650
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:16,415
Why don't we just
clear off the table?

1651
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:18,043
I was thinking...

1652
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,553
why don't we go upstairs?

1653
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,555
But that's so predictable.

1654
01:21:21,623 --> 01:21:24,057
Let's just take
everything off the table...

1655
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:25,684
and do it right here.

1656
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,194
That would blow your mind.

1657
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,695
It would blow my mind.

1658
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,698
I've never done
anything like that.

1659
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:33,200
I never even had anybody
over for dinner.

1660
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,463
Let alone,
made love on the table.

1661
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:36,970
I want to do that.

1662
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:38,472
I just want to dance.

1663
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,008
I want to, like,
put on some Shirelles.

1664
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:44,011
I want to be black.

1665
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:47,242
Wouldn't that be insane?

1666
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,944
God,you know
who I wish was tonight?

1667
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,679
I wish I was Tina Turner...

1668
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:54,017
just dancing
through the room.

1669
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:55,920
Ooh ooh

1670
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,361
Thank you. Thank you.

1671
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,830
Please have
your tickets ready.

1672
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,536
Good evening, Officer.

1673
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:11,038
My name is Clarence McCabe.

1674
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,539
Are these people with you?

1675
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,041
Yes. This is my wife.

1676
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:16,043
And these are her parents...

1677
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:18,136
the Saunders
from Cleveland, Ohio.

1678
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,976
I'll check your name, sir.

1679
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:22,107
I'm going to be on third.

1680
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:24,812
I'll check your name, sir.

1681
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:26,319
I'm sorry, sir.

1682
01:22:26,388 --> 01:22:28,117
I don't see your name, sir.

1683
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:30,158
You just went pass the N's.

1684
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:31,783
I'll go back again, sir.

1685
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,623
Here it is again, sir.

1686
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:35,128
Let me just check.

1687
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:37,495
No. This is impossible.

1688
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:39,966
Did Miss Long call you at all?

1689
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:41,525
No, sir, she didn't.

1690
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:44,265
She didn't tell you
about my book?

1691
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:45,829
Listen, I follow this list.

1692
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:48,398
She told me
to present myself at 5:45.

1693
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:49,944
It's now 5:50.

1694
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,707
I've only got 1 0 minutes.

1695
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,714
Only authorized personnel
allowed in here.

1696
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:55,215
That's the rules
and regulations.

1697
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:57,411
You never heard
of the book?

1698
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,922
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

1699
01:23:00,989 --> 01:23:01,978
Well, can I call Miss Long?

1700
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:03,991
You cannot call
Miss Long at all, sir.

1701
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,492
Can you call Miss Long?

1702
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,425
Your name isn't on the list.

1703
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:08,929
I cannot let you in.

1704
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:11,090
That's the rules of the place.

1705
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,758
I'm going to try to get her.

1706
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:14,028
Stop him.

1707
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:15,831
Miss Long.

1708
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:17,030
Hold on.

1709
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:18,538
Let go of me.

1710
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:21,303
Let go of me.

1711
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:43,996
What is this Clarence McCabe?

1712
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,499
That's who I am.

1713
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,000
Is that your real name?

1714
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,833
Well, technically,
it's my real name.

1715
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:52,135
No, it's a pseudonym,
an alias.

1716
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,141
Why did you use
the pseudonym?

1717
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:55,801
I'm an author.
That's my business.

1718
01:23:55,877 --> 01:23:57,310
Author of what?

1719
01:23:57,379 --> 01:24:00,507
I wrote a book called
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

1720
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,516
I spent two years in Russia...

1721
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,018
two years in China
researching that thing.

1722
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,054
Russia? China?

1723
01:24:06,121 --> 01:24:07,782
Does that make me
a Communist?

1724
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:19,193
Up in control, we have
one more light to pre-set.

1725
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,497
Hello. I'm the king.

1726
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,764
What?

1727
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,305
The king.

1728
01:24:24,373 --> 01:24:26,807
What can I do
for Your Highness?

1729
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,672
Really. I'm the king.

1730
01:24:28,744 --> 01:24:31,235
Oh, yes, sir.
You're dressing room is backstage.

1731
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:33,781
Your throne is in there also.

1732
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:34,838
Very funny.

1733
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,680
Is there someone in charge?

1734
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:38,811
Mr. Ding.

1735
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:42,448
He's a little fellow
with an ice cream cone.

1736
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:44,458
- Miss Long.
- Mr. Pipkin?

1737
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:46,517
No, it's Mr. Pupkin.

1738
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:49,063
How are you?

1739
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:52,157
What are you doing here,
Mr. Pupkin?

1740
01:24:52,234 --> 01:24:54,759
I'm the king.

1741
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:56,929
I think you're expecting me.

1742
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,939
- Yeah.

There are reasons

No. It's all right. Really.

Yeah. It's a wholesome monologue.

you have the right
to remain silent...

1805
01:28:19,107 --> 01:28:23,134
'cause anything you say
from here on out might be used...

1806
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:25,736
- against you later on
in a court of law.
- I'm aware of that.

1807
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:27,247
Say you understand.

1808
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,748
I understand that.

1809
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:32,548

1810

Yes, I did.
I abducted him.

1811

You abducted him?

1812

Yes.

Do you know where
Mr. Langford is right now?

1814

Will you lead us
to Mr. Langford?

No, I won't.

Well, at this time,
Mr. Pupkin...

I should get made up.

01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:01,388
You know what time it is?

1903
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:03,390
Yes, it's 5 minutes to 1 1 :00.

1904
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,891
I think we'd better go.

1905
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:07,325
I don't like
to say it like this...

1906
01:33:07,395 --> 01:33:09,158
butJerry's going to be
unavailable.

1907
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:10,663
You'll understand when we go.

1908
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:12,165
I'll understand?
Why will I understand?

1909
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:13,723
Where are we going?

1910
01:33:14,969 --> 01:33:16,402
That's part of the bargain.

1911
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,405
I want to see it
somewhere else--

1912
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:19,906
Part of what bargain?

1913
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:21,407
Well, that's my understanding.

1914
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,411
I just want to see it
in this other place.

1915
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,414
Once I see it,
I'll give you Langford.

1916
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:28,915
You don't understand
my position.

1917
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:30,416
I have you right now.

1918
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:33,420
Having you,
I have a shot at Langford.

1919
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:34,921
But you don't haveJerry.

1920
01:33:34,989 --> 01:33:36,479
I understand that.

1921
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:39,526
I'm doing this as fast as I can.

1922
01:33:39,594 --> 01:33:40,686
Good, Masha.

1923
01:33:40,762 --> 01:33:41,854
Yeah?

1924
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:43,022
Good.

1925
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:44,530
You all right?

1926
01:33:44,599 --> 01:33:45,691
I'm fine.

1927
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:48,668
I know you are.

1928
01:33:48,736 --> 01:33:50,169
All right. Come on.

1929
01:33:55,877 --> 01:33:56,969
Let's go.

1930
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:58,478
Oh, one more thing.

1931
01:33:58,546 --> 01:34:00,980
I can't walk in here with you.

1932
01:34:01,049 --> 01:34:02,482
If you just wait here...

1933
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,984
and let me walk in by myself.

1934
01:34:05,053 --> 01:34:08,420
I'll break your ankles
if you make a wrong move.

1935
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:09,922
O.K., I promise, O.K.?

1936
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:12,425
Make believe
you don't know me, too.

1937
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:13,892
Go ahead.

1938
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,323
O.K. Here you go.

What do you want now?

01:35:20,395 --> 01:35:21,828
What are you doing?

1952
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:23,830
I'm watching that.
It's almost over.

Just a minute.
Just a minute.

It's theJerry Langford Show.!

and his special guests
Shelley Winters...

What's going on here?

1958
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:37,577
Do you know him?

1959
01:35:37,645 --> 01:35:38,737
Unfortunately, yes.

1960
01:35:38,813 --> 01:35:40,747
Well,just sit tight. Relax.

1961
01:35:40,815 --> 01:35:42,248
Everything will be O.K.

[Audience Laughs]

01:35:43,484 --> 01:35:45,509
My first guest...

1964
01:35:45,586 --> 01:35:47,019
you'll agree with me that...

1965
01:35:47,088 --> 01:35:48,521
he's destined for greatness.!

1966
01:35:48,589 --> 01:35:50,523
In one way or another.

1967
01:35:50,591 --> 01:35:53,526
So will you please give
your warmest greetings...

1968
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:55,323
to the newest
king of comedy--

1969
01:35:55,396 --> 01:35:57,557
Rupert Pupkin.!

1970
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:10,810
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1971
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:12,311
Let me introduce myself.

1972
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,813
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1973
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:18,181
I was born
in Clifton, NewJersey...

1974
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,311
which was not at that time
a federal offense.

1975
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:21,480
[Laughter]

1976
01:36:21,556 --> 01:36:23,990
Is there anyone here
from Clifton?

1977
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:25,150
[No Response]

1978
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:28,161
Oh, good.
We can all relax$ now.

1979
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:30,163
I'd like to begin by saying...

1980
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:33,667
my parents were too poor
to afford me a childhood.

1981
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:35,167
But the fact is that...

1982
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:38,672
no one is allowed to be
too poor in Clifton.

1983
01:36:38,739 --> 01:36:41,173
Once you fall
below a certain level...

1984
01:36:41,242 --> 01:36:43,176
they ex$ile you to Passaic.

1985
01:36:43,244 --> 01:36:44,677
[Laughter And Applause]

1986
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:48,014
My parents did put...

1987
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,516
the first two down payments
on my childhood.

1988
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:53,520
Don't get me wrong,
but they did also...

1989
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:56,523
return me to the hospital
as defective.

1990
01:36:58,593 --> 01:37:00,026
But, like everyone else...

1991
01:37:00,094 --> 01:37:04,030
I grew up in large part
thanks to my mother.

1992
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:05,963
If she were only here today...

1993
01:37:06,033 --> 01:37:08,968
I'd say, "Hey, ma,
what are you doing here?

1994
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:11,470
You've been dead
for nine years.!'

1995
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:15,975
But seriously,
you should've seen my mother.

1996
01:37:16,043 --> 01:37:17,476
She was wonderful.

1997
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:21,481
Blonde, beautiful,
intelligent, alcoholic.

1998
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:24,484
We used to drink milk
together after school.

1999
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:27,146
Mine was homogenized.
Hers was loaded.

2000
01:37:28,556 --> 01:37:30,990
Once they picked her up
for speeding.

2001
01:37:31,058 --> 01:37:32,491
They clocked her doing 50.

2002
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,994
All right,
but in our garage?

2003
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:36,654
[Applause]

2004
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:41,500
And when they tested her...

2005
01:37:41,569 --> 01:37:44,504
they found out that
her alcohol had 2% blood.

2006
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:52,512
Ah, but we used tojoke together,
mom and me...

2007
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:55,515
until the tears
would stroll down her face..

2008
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:57,517
and she would throw up.!

2009
01:37:57,585 --> 01:37:59,519
Yeah, and who would
clean it up?

2010
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:03,023
Not dad. He was too busy
down at O'Grady's...

2011
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,024
throwing up on his own.

2012
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:06,116
Yeah.

2013
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:08,128
In fact, until I was 1 6...

2014
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:11,632
I thought throwing up
was a sign of maturity.

2015
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,132
While the other kids...

2016
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:16,136
were off in the woods
sneaking cigarettes...

2017
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:18,138
I was hiding
behind the house...

2018
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:20,640
with my fingers
down my throat.

2019
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:26,479
The only problem was
I never got anywhere...

2020
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:29,482
until one day
my father caught me.

2021
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,984
Just as he was giving me...

2022
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:34,988
a final kick in the stomach
for luck...

2023
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:38,492
I managed to heave
all over his new shoes.!

2024
01:38:38,559 --> 01:38:39,992
"That's it, 'I thought.

2025
01:38:40,061 --> 01:38:42,996
"I've made it.
I'm finally a man.!'

2026
01:38:43,064 --> 01:38:44,497
[Audience Applauds Wildly]

2027
01:38:50,571 --> 01:38:53,506
But as it turned out,
I was wrong.

2028
01:38:53,574 --> 01:38:57,010
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

2029
01:38:57,078 --> 01:38:59,512
Yeah, he was usually too busy...

2030
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,516
out in the park playing ball
with my sister Rose.

2031
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:05,449
But today, I must say...

2032
01:39:05,519 --> 01:39:07,953
thanks to those many hours
of practice...

2033
01:39:08,022 --> 01:39:11,014
my sister Rose has grown
into a fine man.

2034
01:39:16,497 --> 01:39:19,125
Me, I wasn't especially
interested in athletics.

2035
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,134
The only ex$ercise I ever got...

2036
01:39:21,202 --> 01:39:23,136
was when the other kids
picked on me.

2037
01:39:23,204 --> 01:39:25,138
Yeah, they used to
beat me up once a week...

2038
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:26,298
usually Tuesday.

2039
01:39:26,374 --> 01:39:28,308
And after a while...

2040
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:30,810
the school worked it
into the curriculum.

2041
01:39:30,878 --> 01:39:34,974
And if you knocked me out,
you got ex$tra credit.

2042
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:38,984
There was this one kid,
poor kid...

2043
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:40,486
he was afraid of me.

2044
01:39:40,554 --> 01:39:41,987
I used to tell him...

2045
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:44,217
"Hit me, hit me.
What's the matter with you?

2046
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:46,988
Don't you want to graduate?'

2047
01:39:50,564 --> 01:39:52,998
Hey, I was the youngest kid...

2048
01:39:53,067 --> 01:39:55,001
in the history of the school...

2049
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:56,502
to graduate in traction.

2050
01:39:58,572 --> 01:40:01,006
But,you know,
my only real interest...

2051
01:40:01,075 --> 01:40:03,509
right from the beginning,
was show business.

2052
01:40:03,577 --> 01:40:07,513
Even as a young man,
I began at the very top--

2053
01:40:07,581 --> 01:40:09,014
collecting autographs.

2054
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:15,522
Now, a lot of you
are probably wondering...

2055
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:18,023
whyJerry isn't with us tonight.

2056
01:40:18,092 --> 01:40:19,525
Well, I'll tell you.

2057
01:40:19,593 --> 01:40:21,527
The fact is he's tied up.

2058
01:40:21,595 --> 01:40:24,029
I'm the one who tied him.

2059
01:40:24,098 --> 01:40:27,033
Well, I know you think
I'm joking...

2060
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,535
but, believe me,
that's the only way...

2061
01:40:29,603 --> 01:40:32,037
I could break
into show business--

2062
01:40:32,106 --> 01:40:33,539
by hijacking Jerry Langford.

2063
01:40:33,607 --> 01:40:36,542
Right now,
Jerry is strapped to a chair...

2064
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:39,545
somewhere in the middle
of the city.

Go ahead, laugh.

Thank you.
I appreciate it.

But the fact is, I'm here.

2068
01:40:48,122 --> 01:40:50,556
Now, tomorrow you'll know
I wasn't kidding...

2069
01:40:50,624 --> 01:40:52,558
and you'll think I was crazy.

2070
01:40:52,626 --> 01:40:55,060
But, look,
I figure it this way.

2071
01:40:55,129 --> 01:40:57,563
Better to be king for a night...

2072
01:40:57,631 --> 01:40:59,565
than schmuck for a lifetime.

Take care of yourself, Rupert.

That's the same guy who
was just now on television.

No. No.

I'm looking for the guy
that wrote the material.

I'll pick him up
and take him along with you.

I wrote the material.
I disagree with you.

I thought they were
very good jokes.

If you wrote that material...

2101

I got one piece
of advice for you.

2102

Throw yourself on your knees
in front of the judge...

01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:40,699
and beg for mercy.
