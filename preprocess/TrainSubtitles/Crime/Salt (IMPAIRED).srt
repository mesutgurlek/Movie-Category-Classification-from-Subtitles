the child was back
in the same hospital,

161
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,327
sick with fever.

162
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,249
And within days after that,

163
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,002
the child suddenly was dead.

164
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,050
Yes, a child Was dead.

And, yes, a child was buried.

166

But the Chenkov baby Was alive

167
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,736
and became the property
of another man.

168
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,283
A master spy Who had
devised the greatest plan

169
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,787
a Russian patriot
could ever invent.

170
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,292
A plan to destroy America.

171
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,919
It had all started

172
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,048
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

173
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,344
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

174
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,431
Three years later, he returned home.

175
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,392
But the man
who came back to America

176
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,023
was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.

177
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,943
On November 22nd, 1963,

178
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,656
Alek became the first success
of the neW program

179
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,327
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

180
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,622
The spymaster Was now
given the go-ahead

181
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,625
to create many more like Alek.

182
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,253
Scores of agents,
males and females,

183
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,048
to be substituted for Americans.

CH I LDREN:
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

185

At an abandoned monastery,

186
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,141
Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English

187
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,852
Iong before they learned Russian.

188

And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,

192
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,494
the spymaster
made warriors of iron.

It's a story without hope.

200
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:34,064
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

201
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,818
There was an accident.
The family died.

202
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,904
Chenkov was sent to America

203
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,491
to live a complete lie

204
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,537

to attack from within.

Day X.

206

The long-awaited mission is here.

207
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,089
Chenkov will travel
to New York City

208
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,385
to kill the president of Russia

209

at the funeral of
the American vice president.
