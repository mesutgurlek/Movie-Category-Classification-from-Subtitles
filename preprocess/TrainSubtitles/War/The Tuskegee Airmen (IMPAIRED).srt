Well, while you're cleaning up,
add this to your discussion.

that I commissioned
by the anthropology department

of one of our most prestigious universities.

are as unimpeachable as its conclusions.

And down here.

"translates to restricted blood supply
and problems in severe maneuvers."

Be seated.

762
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,632
Colonel, you are aware of the accusations,

763
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:04,396
such as malaise and fatigue
in the face of little enemy contact?

764
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:11,275
We've been in continuous combat for months
with no replacements, sir. My men are tired.

765
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,038
Other units get four fresh bodies a month,

766
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,795
but something always seems to go wrong
with our paperwork or movement orders.

767
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,871
How many missions
have your men flown, Colonel?

768
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,958
Most have flown well over 50,

769
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,873
which is the standard cut-off point
in which white pilots are sent home.

770
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,557
- And your men are still flying?
- They don't know what else to do with us, sir.

771
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,155
White pilots rotate back to the States
as instructors,

772
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,959
but since the Army won't allow colored pilots

773
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,238
- to train white cadets...
- Nine months of training,

774
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,197
countless missions in Africa,

775
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:52,515
- and not one air-to-air kill, isn't that right?
- We can't fight what we don't see.

776
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,795
We've been stationed so far
from frontline action,

777
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,351

let alone the opportunity to engage one.

You recently lost a pilot
who cut and ran from,

779
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,238
what, an imaginary Messerschmitt?

780
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,672
Those men understand
Lieutenant Cappy's action was a mistake.

781
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,311
Mistakes are all we see, young man.
Late for mission briefings,

782
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,991
piss-poor discipline and leadership,
and nothing but excuses.

783
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,992
What I see is a unit
that's an embarrassment to the Air Corps,

784
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,832
to the American people and to themselves.

785
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,119
Might I remind you, gentlemen,
that this war is by no means won,

786
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,399

is a drain and a hindrance to that effort.

787
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,315

and move the agenda.

We thought we had that chance.

791

But you invite us to a poker game,
hand us a fixed deck,

792
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,072
and then wonder why we can't win?

are unacceptably high.

910
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,229
Yesterday's run into Germany
cost them 65 of 200 bombers.

911
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,475
That's one in three, gentlemen.

912
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,228
Six hundred men killed or missing.

913
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,949
You want to make your mark,
here's your chance.

914
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,310
HANNIBAL: How do you like this, girls?
All dressed up and no dates.

915
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,029
BILLY: Yeah, I think we've been stood up.
Not a B-17 in sight.

916
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,156
This is the rendezvous point.

917
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,915
They must have been grounded
by bad weather.

918
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,070
BUTLER ON RADIO:
He's coming back around!

919
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,072
Hey, Iowa. Turn to channel 8.

920
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,593
BUTLER: All right, Medina, come on,
let's get him! Pick him off!

921
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:01,514
- Sounds like one of ours.
- Must be stragglers.

922
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,719
- Let's go give them a hand.
- BILLY: Roger that.

923

GUNNER: Hey, he's coming up on top!

925
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,274
He's coming in again!

926
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,675
BUTLER: Hang on.

927
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,879
WESLEY: He's above us. (SIGHS)

928
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:36,348
BILLY: Here we go, fellows. Here we go.
Hang on, Hannibal, I got him, I got him!

929
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,110
The Train is always on time. That's one.
Let's clean them up now.

930
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,394
Let's clean them up.

931
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,475
- What the hell? Did you see that?
- Yeah! Who is that?

932
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,316
- BILLY: Get the other one, Hannibal.
- Whoa! Hold on a second.

933
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,960
- We got another one coming in high.
- Come on, Medina, come on!

934
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,077
HANNIBAL: Keep your shirt on.
I got him. I got him.

935
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,272
Moment of truth, Jerry. We live in the air.

936
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,712
We die by fire.

937
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,436
Yes!

938
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,834
Say good-bye, Mr. Kraut.
Give my regards to the Fhrer.

939
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,912
BUTLER: Going back home.
Red tail Mustang, starboard side.

940
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,437
- Come on, Vance. Who are they?
- I don't know.

941
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,832
WESLEY: Red tail 51, this is Fortress 320.
Come in. Over.

942
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,239
Nothing.

943
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,232
I can't raise them. They must be
on a separate frequency or something.

944
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,790
- You get any kind of ID?
- Nothing I recognize.

945
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,111
I tell you, we need to find out
who those boys are.

946
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,274
- Red tails, huh?
- Yeah.

947
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,113
No fighter group I know
carries those markings.

948
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,713
Well, I gotta find them.

949
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,509
I got a bottle of whiskey for both of them
for saving our asses.

950
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,074
Hey, you might try Ramitelli.
We're getting new escort assignments.

951
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,958
- They might be one of them.
- All right, I'll check it out.

952
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,874
Poor slob did everything
but pull the trigger for me.

953
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,158
On that last kill, I took that son of a bitch out
from 1,000 yards.

954
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,879
Hey, sir, what'd you use to get them off?
Use Split-S, climbing turns?

955
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,633
No, no, no, Walter Peoples' special.
You make it up as you go along.

956
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,959
Hey, how you guys doing?

957
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,389
Listen, we're a B-17 bomb group
based at Foggia,

958
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,950
and we're looking for the pilots
who were up at Pleven yesterday.

959
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,951
We want to say thanks.
A couple of those guys saved our asses.

960
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,670
- Don't mention it.
- So, where are they?

961
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,030
- Where's who?
- The pilots, boy.

962
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,510
- We came up here to see the pilots.
- You're looking at them.

963
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,397
- Lieutenant Lee. Lieutenant Roberts.
- How are you?

964
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,596
- We appreciate your thanks.
- This whole base is colored?

965
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,592
Colored, yes. Lock, stock and pilot.

966
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,437
Let's get out of here, Lieutenant.

967
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,116
- What?
- This isn't right, let's get out of here.

968
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,998
- What's not right? He just said...
- I don't give a shit what he said.

969
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,914
Them pilots was niggers.
Niggers weren't flying them planes today.

970
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,709
- Let's move it out.
- Yes, sir.

971
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,912
You saved their asses,
and they got the nerve to be insulted?

972
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,355
Makes you want to hurt somebody.

973
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,316
- What are you writing?
- My folks.

974
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,910
This boy mails a letter to his folks every night.

975
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,911
I'm not mailing this one, Train, you are.

976
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:57,950
Oh, no, no, no. I am not mailing that letter.
If you die, you mail it yourself.

977
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,076
You'll mail it just like I'll mail yours.

978
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,833
Well, you won't have to worry
about me asking.

979
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,957
Writing them one of those letters
is like expecting to die.

980
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,439
No one expects to die.

981
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,670
My father had a friend,
he fought in the First World War.

982
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,718
He was one of the first colored soldiers
in France.

983
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,518
This man had so many medals,

984
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,956
he came home decorated
like a Christmas tree.

985
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,231
He disappeared one night.

986
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,309
They found him in Georgia,
lynched in his uniform.

987
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,989
(EXHALES)

988
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,357
Why would you want to fly for a country
that thanks you by lynching you?

01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,519
(SIGHS)

990
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:00,237
I like the feeling of respect that we get,

991
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,030
especially from colored folks.

992
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,398
Like me and Cappy came upon them fellows
in the chain gang

993
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,789
back at training in Tuskegee.

994
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,190
I even got some satisfaction out of the look
on those white fellows' faces today

995
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,316
when they found out
it was us that saved their tails.

996
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,758
MAN: You're not getting a full 360,
understand?

997
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,752
Captain, that colored outfit, the 332nd,

998
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,230
HQ confirmed they were the boys
that helped us at Pleven,

999
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,756
and we weren't even their assignment.

1000
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,195
Lieutenant, let me give you
a little sociology lesson.

1001
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,949
I think, being from California and all,
you might be a little bit confused.

1002
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,591
Now, I'm a Texas boy.

1003
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,114
I grew up with niggers.
I was around them every day.

1004
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,431
Hell, in Lubbock,
you can't throw a rock without hitting one.

1005
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,353
Now, I know how they think,
and I know how they live,

1006
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:05,037
and I can tell you with complete certainty
what they are and are not capable of.

1007
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,268
And you don't think
they can fly them planes, sir?

1008
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,830
Vance, if they was flying them planes,
and that is one hell of a big "if,"

1009
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,879
then what happened up there was a fluke.
So forget about it.

1010
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,395
HANNIBAL: Train, I'm getting tired
of these long missions

1011
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,596
where we get stuck out here by our lonesome.

1012
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,399
BILLY: I'm low on fuel.
I say we should head back.

1013
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,952
Wait a second. What is that?

1014
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,558
- Where?
- Down below. Looks like a German destroyer.

1015
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,518
Ain't one of ours.

1016
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,112

1017
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,117
Always.

1018
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,633
Straighten up.

1019
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,119

You sunk a damn destroyer.

or anybody else on this base a medal
for doing anything right?

1034
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:14,508
Okay, all right, so you won't get a medal.
The bottom line is, we know what you did.

1035
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,638
