Housecarl 1: My lord, this man
says he has a message for you

37
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:46,422

What's the message?

40
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:59,401
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.

41
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:09,111
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.

42
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,780
Well, he is a descendant
of Odin.

(Laughter stops)

45
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,789
Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,493
then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.

47
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,861
There would be greater shame

48
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,498
in accepting a challenge
from a criminal.

49
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,266
That would suggest
that I take him seriously;

50
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,369
That I see him as an equal.

51
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,206
The challenge is declined.

Does he desire to be Earl?

If he kills you,
would it not be so?

58
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,835
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.

What are you frightened of?

69
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,917
You can't fight.

70
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,653
You're still too weak.

71
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,858
Perhaps that makes us equal.

72
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:10,299
Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.

73
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,335
That is our way.

Ragnar: Who sets the odds?

00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,483
Our fates are already decided.

(Breathing heavily)

77
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,060
Lagertha: You don't believe
that and neither do I.

78
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,898
Ragnar: You are wrong:

79
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,503
I do believe it.

80
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:57,346
<i>(Howling in the distance)</i>

81
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,220
Siggy: (Quietly) Come to bed.

82
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,022
You need to rest, to sleep.

83
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,458
Earl Haraldson: Yes, I will.

84
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,129
There's always time to sleep.

85
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,067
I was thinking about our boys,

86
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,170
what they would look like now.

87
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,910
Don't...
Don't think about them.

88
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,012
Think about tomorrow.

89
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,115
When I must kill a man

90
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,618
for whom I have
the utmost respect.

91
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,223
<i>Siggy: Respect?</i>

92
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,360
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?

93
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,162
Why not?

94
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,264
He is what I used to be...

95
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,033
restless, ambitious.

96
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,472
And he was right about
the Western lands.

97
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,442
But I always knew that
in my heart.

98
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:07,115
<i>Siggy: Then why
didn't you tell him?</i>

99
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,850
Because the moment
that I reached out

100
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,851
to Ragnar Lothbrok,

101
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,187
was the moment
that all my friends,

102
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,222
all my supporters
would have deserted me

103
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,824
and joined him.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,428
It was impossible to do it.

105
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,464
But it's true,

106
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:25,500
our fates have
brought us together.

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,106
And maybe he's opened
the Western lands for me.

108
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,548
That is my hope,
after I kill him.

109
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,388
The seer promised
you would kill him?

110
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,624
Yes.

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,893
Good.

112
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:03,205
(Earl Bjarni shouts out
in pleasure)

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,144
Earl Bjarni: I'm sure
that's our first child.

114
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,379
(Panting)

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,980
Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.

116
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm starving.

117
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,385
I don't like the smell of them
in the bed.

118
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,786
Your clothes are smelly enough
as it is.

119
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,122
Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?

120
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,090
I thought a wife wasn't supposed
to nag her husband

121
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,860
until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?

122
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,429
If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings

123
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,830
I will beat you.

124
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,166
Perhaps that will make you
show a little life

125
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,834
when we have sex, in any case!

126

Thyri: Very well.

127
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,804

(Flames crackle)

501
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:30,662
<i>At last,</i>
<i>Fenrir will swallow the sun.</i>

502
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:34,299
<i>Nooooooooo!</i>

503
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,673
(Birds chirp)

504
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:49,314
(Water churns)

505
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:01,326
(Water churns as they row)

506
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,140
(Bird caws)

507
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,877
King Aelle: So where did
these Northmen come ashore?

508
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:19,911
Messenger: They didn't.

509
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:21,947
What do you mean, they didn't?

510
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:23,782
<i>Messenger:</i>
<i>They came in three ships,</i>

511
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:28,120
and those ships
are now sailing up the tyne.

512
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,060
They have ships
that can cross oceans

513
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,162
but also sail up rivers?

514
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,465
What manner of men are these?

515
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,033
If they are sailing up
the tyne,

516
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:45,470
then, sire,
we shall soon find out.

517
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:46,671
Ah yes, my lord Wigea,

518
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:49,741
of course you know
all about them.

519
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:53,078
You accused them
of having supernatural powers,

520
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:57,048
which is why a small force
of them defeated you.

521
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,451
Lord Wigea: I merely said
they fought like demons,

522
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:03,288
like men possessed,
with no fear of death.

523
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:06,958
Unlike you, my lord?

524
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,828
I fear death
as much as the next man,

525
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:12,764
but I have no fear
that afterwards

526
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:15,634
God will raise me up again.

527
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:18,069
Oh, well said. (Claps)

528
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:21,273
Come, all of you!

529
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:25,544
I have something new
to show you.

530
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,081
(Chains clank, flaps creak)

531
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,587
<i>Let the serpents bite</i>
<i>these devils.</i>

532
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:37,689
Let them also bite
those too weak

533
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,724
and afraid to fight
to the death

534
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,160
for their king and master.

535
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:43,562
My lord! No! No!

536
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:47,098
You look terrified,
my lord Wigea.

537
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,568
<i>Have you lost your faith?</i>

538
00:42:49,669 --> 00:42:51,069
Are you not certain anymore

539
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,804
that God will raise you up
from the grave?

540
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:54,539
Lord Wigea: Have mercy!

541
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,541
Personally, I hope he does not.

542
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,477
I hope he leaves you there
to rot.

543
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,112
Nooooooo!

544
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:03,181
Ungh!

545
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:05,283
(Hissing)

546
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:08,520
No! Christ!

547
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,123
God!

548
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:14,726
Nooooo!

549
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:16,862
(Yells out in pain
as a snake bites him)

550
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:22,500
Now let us prepare
to defend ourselves

551
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:25,737
against these heathens
and barbarians.

552
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:31,192
