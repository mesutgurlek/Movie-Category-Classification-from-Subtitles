00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,085
Why not have a go at Hitler as well?

171
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,200
He is only 300 kilometers down the road
in a small village called Berlin.

172
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,323
So we inform London that you are
refusing to cooperate with our mission.

173
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,890
How dare you question us?

174
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,641
How dare you question us?

175
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,001
You know what we have
sacrificed for the cause here?

176
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,406
What you have sacrificed?

177
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,686
What has Czechoslovakia sacrificed?

178
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,969
You have no idea what we've sacrificed!

179
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,684
Sit down. Please.

180
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,522
You kill Heydrich and Hitler
will tear Prague apart.

181
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,485
I take it you have family
in Czechoslovakia?

182
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,763
Father? Mother?

183
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,083
You kill Heydrich, then you can consider them
and everyone that ever knew you dead.

184
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,731
All Czech patriots should be
ready to die for their country.

185
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,961
That includes my family.

186
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,246
VANEK: Well, I'm not.

187
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,049
I want to carry on fighting.

188
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,851
We don't have that many left
that are willing to do that.

189
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,321
We are what's left
of the Czech resistance.

190
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
I suggest a lesser rank
should be assassinated.

191
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,526
Perhaps a few of them.

192
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,840
Heydrich is the head of the secret police.

193
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,049
Only Hitler and Himmler are
above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

194
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,281
VANEK: Exactly my point.

195
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,721
You really think you'll ever get close
enough to assassinate Heydrich?

196
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,401
Our orders have come direct
from the Czech government in London.

197
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,244
So this is about the Czech government
in London trying to impress the allies?

198
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,208
It was the allies that gave us
to the Germans in the first place.

199
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,362
Munich was a betrayal,

200
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,205
but it is also now history.

201
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,210
I think what the Czech government
in London is asking is this.

202
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,964
Is Czechoslovakia

203
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,886
still ready and willing
to resist Nazi Germany?

but if you do, never walk together.

an excuse for why you're not at work.

There is a fire escape to the left.

has something to do with this question?

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,765
She is very young,

332
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,130
she still has romantic ideas
about the war.

333
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,966
And you?

334
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,124
War is not romantic.

335
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,044
We cross here.

336
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,611
After our last date, I thought you
might both show wearing potato sacks.

337
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,727
(CHUCKLES)

338
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,882
I don't know what I'm doing.

339
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,089
You are doing fine.

340
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,008
Take a seat here. Order a drink.

341
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,846
We won't be long.

(JOSEF CHUCKLES)

344
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,526
- VALČÍK: Jan.
- JOSEF: Opálka.

345
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,489
JAN: Valčík.

346
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,524
VANEK: I see you are no strangers to one
another, but we don't have much time.

347
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,523
We all trained special
operations together.

348
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,682
Valčík here was even on the same drop.

349
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,969
Yes, dropped 10 minutes later
and 30 miles off course.

350
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,883
VANEK:
Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A,

351
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,850
we have finally re-established
communications with London.

352
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,128
I have orders to send and receive any
communications between you and London.

353
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,531
You have your own decoder book, right?

354
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,601
Yes.

355
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,326
Second Lieutenant Opálka
and Warrant Officer Curda

356
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,891
have completed Operation Out Distance,
so both are now available to assist you.

357
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,801
Second Lieutenant Opálka
is the senior officer here.

358
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,770
Yes, this is true, but your mission
objective supersedes my rank.

359
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,928
We had word from London. Anthropoid.

360
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,445
Utmost priority.

361
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,648
We assist with everything possible.

362
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,721
So...

363
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,847
This is your show, bratři.

364
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,202
So, we know that Heydrich
returns to his family

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,363
every day at Panenské Břežany.

366
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,161
But, both his chateau and the castle
are both heavily guarded.

367
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,766
They are not feasible targets.

368
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,080
But once a month,

369
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,369
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

370
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,930
And we can predict this

371
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,846
because his personal carriages
are prepared several days in advance.

372
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,167
But, again, the station and the train
are both heavily guarded.

373
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,687
What about derailing
the train outside of Prague?

374
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,731
We can derail the train, but that is
no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

375
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,645
I have made contact
with an ex-pupil of mine

376
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,167
who works as a repair man
inside the castle.

377
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,049
He's willing to help,

378
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,124
but he only knows when Heydrich
arrives in the morning

379
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,725
and when he leaves.

380
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,164
What good is that?

381
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,206
You can build a picture

382
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,805
of his routine.

383
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,010
Sometimes he travels with an armed
escort and sometimes he does not.

384
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,844
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

385
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,886
There is a safe house near the castle.

386
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,282
The repairman could drop off
the timetable every day before work.

387
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,327
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

388
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,606
Good.

389
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,807
And Jan and I will follow the route
from the chateau to the castle.

390
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,009
UNCLE HAJSKY: Gentlemen, this operation

391
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,408
will involve almost everyone
we have left in the resistance.

392
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,767
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

393
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,288
If you are arrested,
you will face some harsh facts.

394
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,522
There will be no escape.

395
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,570
You'll be tortured until you reveal
everything you know,

396
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,250
and then you will be executed.

397
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,327
You must protect your fellow comrades

398
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,528

any links you have to them.

399

Thirty seconds, 30 seconds.

If we can use a rope
or a steel cable to stop the Mercedes,

then 30 seconds...

Then 30 seconds would be all we need.

423

Even if a rope can stop the car,

424

we still need more than 30 seconds
to escape from here.

And we'd have to face the

is to succeed. Yes?

you don't ask too many questions.

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,530
Just tell me we are doing the right thing.

495
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,484
I think it is my turn to apologize
to you about the other morning.

496
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,090
You were right to be angry.

497
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,371
We should have told you what was at risk.

498
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,771
Given you the choice to walk away.

499
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,326
My father was a captain in the army.

500
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,528
Wanted sons, got three daughters.

501
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,283
He and many others were arrested in '39

502
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,409
when Germany took control
over Czechoslovakia.

503
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,611
And when Heydrich took
over here last September,

504
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,610
his first order was to
execute all the prisoners.

505
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,810
My father was among 5,000 shot
in the first week by Heydrich.

506
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,283
For me there's no walking away.

507
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,249
Heydrich is worth the risk.

508
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,131
We have checked the route.

Ladislav Vanek.

He is the one who's most opposed
to what we have to do.

to really slow down to take that corner.

Yes, he slows to about 10 miles per hour.

We've averaged out
his morning arrival times.

We can expect him
at approximately 9:30 a.m.

OPÁLKA: And the weapons?

530
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,285
At that range the Sten gun should hit
everything within the car.

531

And the armed escort?

we stand down and await the next day.

We should get London to rethink
our position here in Prague.

We have our orders, Curda.
And nothing has changed.
