00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,413
If we take a position
that creates the right angle

502
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:22,449
for the five-inch, Nathan James
can take out the east flank.

503
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:24,685
Once they lock onto our coordinates,

504
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,620
we'll have plenty of time to scram.

Got it!

506
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:31,224
Nathan James, request
you target our location

507
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:33,293
and prepare to fire the five-inch.

508
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:34,761

You need to clear south-southwest.

520
00:32:58,721 --> 00:32:59,653
Do you copy?

521
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:01,254
That way. That way.

522
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,323

526
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:14,267
If they can hold steady,
I can find a target

527
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:16,136
and they can get out of the way.

528
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:18,205
I can't lock on. The
shift is too strong.

529
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,408
Nomad, we can not lock target.

530
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,081
If you bank hard from a hover,

531
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,918
how far can you get in 6.4 seconds?

532
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,688

At the last point of contact,
Nathan James was here.

why we might not have heard from them.

Lieutenant, where are we?

601
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,274
Based on the trajectory of
the missile before it hit the UAV,

602
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,110
we believe the Chinese
ship is loitering here...

Not until we're out
