Come again?

137

our minds yet.

Just the way I felt
after my third deployment

149

and hey, look at me now.

150
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,122
How about this, Corporal?

151
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,083
You're taking over
the squad. That's a fact.

152

But, if and when you wanna
walk away from this,

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,048
there's no reason you shouldn't
walk away as a sergeant.

Yes, sir.

156
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,369
All right. You're dismissed.

00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,500
You have a shower, some
grub, grab some sack time.

00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,503
You leave on mission in the morning.
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,256
Corporal?
Sir?

160
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,095
Keep the faith. <i>Semper Fi.</i>

ALLEN: No, no, no.

165
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,387
I'm out. I'm out.

166
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,518
(MEN SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY)

167
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,068
You don't feel like
staying out there?

168
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,570
No.

169
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,843
Grass skirts and desert camos
aren't really my look.

170
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,428
I don't know.

171
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,388
The right set of shoes, I
think you could pull it off.

172
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,748
(CHUCKLES) Ha.

173
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,504
Times like this, there's
only one place I wanna be.

174
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,925
Go call her.

175
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,403
Have fun.

176
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,930
Wish me luck.

177
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,946
Ain't happening, Soto. Keep your
dick away from me. Shut it, Li.

Hi, baby. How you doing?

doing some laundry.</i>

<i>I didn't expect you to call.</i>

183
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,670
No, I know.
I just wanted to say hi.

184
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,941
<i>Hi. Everything okay?</i>

185
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,135
Yeah. I just really
wanted to hear your voice.

186

you're not re-enlisting?</i>

Mmm-mmm.

Not yet. Don't worry, baby.
I'll do it. I love you.

Yeah, we're getting
a new sergeant?

Yup.

203
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,787
Word is Davidson from over
at Fox Trot's coming over.

No, that's not happening.

00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,205
Can you tell us who it is?

206

Yeah, who's the FNG?

207
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,877
Fucking new guy, buddy.

208
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:20,422
Seriously, the last thing we
need is some uptight asshole.

209
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,383
Okay, come on.
Tell us who it is.

210
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,886
It's me.

Say what?
What?

212
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,474
No way.
You? Get outta here.

213

I'm sorry, man.

214
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,063
Hey, if it wasn't me,
it was you.

215
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,191
So you down for being
my alpha team leader?

216
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:44,988
Hell yeah. A-slash gets the
girls, shoots the bad guys.

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,425

Nothing changes, guys.

224

Everything changes, man.

225
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,645
I can't give you shit anymore.

still give me shit.

your ass for it now.

SOTO: That's cute.

231
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,555
Well, we said we didn't want
an uptight asshole.

232
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,099
Yeah, at least he's not uptight.

233
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,244
Very funny. No, you guys
should really laugh it up.

234
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,329
Because once I get my stripes,

235

you guys are just
pushing all day long.

marksmanship training.

actually have a penis?

All the way down.

Easy on the ammo, Danni.
Just in case.

245
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,070
Just in case what?

246
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,763
Just in case
you animals piss me off.

I'm a gear queer.
What can I say?

You're a toolbox.
That's what I can say.

Yeah, but I look good.

You're all right.

Good afternoon, sirs!
All right, listen up!

252
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:08,363
Stand easy.

253
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,342
You'll be transporting
supplies to Forward

254
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,203
Ops Base Ouellette in
the Garmsir District.

255
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:18,306
Those poor people have been
taking beaucoup casualties.

256
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,642
They need to get
resupplied ASAP.

257
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,170
Now this is definitely
outside the Green Zone.

258
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,314
So watch your corners,
keep your head on a swivel.

LEDs, HMEs, ambushes, whatever.

260
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:31,803
Questions?

261
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,431
Are we taking route 605, sir?

262
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,242
Affirmative. It's a
straight shot 75 clicks,

263
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,352
then a hard
right under Route Red.

264
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:40,886
(SOFTLY) We're totally fucked.

265
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:46,126
Son. This is Private
Khalid Hassan Abu Faisal.

266
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:50,005
He's with the Afghan National Army.
He's joining the squad.

267
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,464
KETTNER: Muji motherfucker.

268
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,034
You got a problem with that,
Corporal Kettner?

269
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,120
No, sir!
That's good.

270
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,915
This is part of
the drawdown handoff.

271
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:04,227
Private Faisal has received the same
training as every one of you has,

272
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:08,106
so he deserves your
cooperation and your respect.

273
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,549
Would you agree
with that, Corporal?

274
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,611
Yes, sir!
That's fine.

275
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,513
All right, Marines, you stay
safe, get the job done.

276
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:18,350
They're all yours,
squadron leader.

277
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:19,851
Thank you, sir.

278
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,519
Oorah, sir.

279
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,023
All right, Marines, top up your ammo.
Let's get ready to roll.

280
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,734
Faisal. Corporal Merrimette.

281
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,712
Thank you. You'll be riding
with Corporal Kettner.

282
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:34,299
You ride in the back.
Go ahead, man.

283
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:35,909
Go ahead. Go.
You speak English?

284
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:37,744
Easy, Kett.

285
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,555
Let's go. Show time.

286
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,833
All right, Li. You look stupid.
Thanks.

287
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,085
(GRUNTING)

288
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,796
Corporal!

289
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,423
What's up, A-slash?

290
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,568
You really gonna
let him have a gun?

291
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:55,011
They let you have one, don't they?

292
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,181
You really want him to be armed?

293
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,143
I don't know.
Let's find out.

294
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,980
Private Faisal?
What are you doin', man?

295
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,649
Can I have a minute
of your time, please?

296
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,084
Yes, sir.

297
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,295
Uh, Private, uh,
Corporal Kettner here

298
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,423
is concerned that you may
be a terrorist in disguise

299
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,759
and you're planning
on killing all of us.

300
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,120
Now, do you have
any plans like that?

301
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,166
I have no plans to harm
anyone in this unit, sir.

302
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,130
Thank you, Private.
Carry on. Sir.

303
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,193
You happy now?

304
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,469
Do I look happy?

305
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,139
You never look happy.
Come on, let's roll.

306
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:42,017
(EXHALES) This is some bullshit.
Hey, Corporal.

307
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:43,827
MERRIMETTE: Hey, Lance Corporal.

308
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:44,953
Now that you're a top dog,

309
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:47,038
can you put in for
a new transport vehicle?

310
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,857
Yeah, man, we're tired of
getting army hand-me-downs.

311
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:50,458
Look... (TAPS VEHICLE)

312
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:53,295
This has got up-armor,
a 10-foot whip.

313
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,130
Hmm. I love it
when you talk dirty.

314
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,156
I know you do.

315
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,452
If only I weren't married. And you

What the fuck is
goin' on, A-slash?

477
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:22,697
This is just a car radio.

478
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:24,056
Maybe it'll play the Beach Boys.

it's just a car stereo.

Come on, man.

482
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:40,239
You tell him to get
away from that thing.

(EXHALING)

484
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,344
The radio was just
a decoy device.

485

Leave it alone. Let's go.

486
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:50,249
It's a HME, maybe 40 pounds

Yeah. It looks like

So what exactly am I lookin' at?

You're lookin' at the most

with the toughest enemy

There's a reason why
they've never lost a war.

Now, look at your 10.

00:47:07,064 --> 00:47:10,067
There's a village called Minar.
It's about 20 clicks away.

And there's a captain there,
he's a pretty good guy.

by this afternoon,

That's too far.

With the heat we got on us, we'll
never make it back in time.

And you can trust
this police captain?

If you're lookin' for guarantees in this
country, you're in the wrong place.

That doesn't matter. What
matters is she gets back alive.

To punish me.

835

To punish my family for
violating Sharia law.

836

forbids women to have an education.

00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,019
May I ask the same of you?

956
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,688
I was trained by the U.S.
military as a translator.

957
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,590
In Lexington, Virginia.
KETTNER: Whoa.

958
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:45,403
You learned how to speak
English in Virginia?

959
00:58:45,428 --> 00:58:48,306
With the help of my iPad
and Rosetta Stone.

960
00:58:49,265 --> 00:58:50,934
I'm not buyin' it.

961
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:52,977
I'm not selling it.

962
00:58:53,686 --> 00:58:55,939
Brunswick stew, thick or thin?

963
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:59,943
Well, if it is thin, it isn't
Brunswick stew. It is soup.

964
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,611
Right, Corporal?

965
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:20,338
What's up?

966
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:22,423
Opium poppies.

967
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:26,444
They're in harvest.

968
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,655
Yeah, and where there's opium
farmers, there's Taliban.

969
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,989
You got it.

970

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

971
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:35,703
Move, Marines! Move! Move!

972
00:59:35,728 --> 00:59:38,982
Marines, 100 meters, follow me!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

973
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,278

Watch your six!

979
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,333
Shit.

980
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:43,213
Ah!

981
01:00:51,054 --> 01:00:52,055
Ah!

982
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:09,906
Chief!

(COUGHS)

985
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:21,167
Hey. Hey, hey. I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

986
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,862
Get me a poppy. A poppy.

987
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:34,572
Kettner, go grab a poppy.

988
01:01:34,597 --> 01:01:35,907
Listen.

989
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:40,828
You gotta get to the village and
talk to the police captain.

990
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:42,914
You hear me?
I will. Yes.

991
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:44,107
Okay.

992
01:01:45,275 --> 01:01:46,693
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

993
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:52,323
Okay.

994
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:57,845
Now listen to me,
you gotta get her out.

995
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,430
You have 24 hours.

996
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:01,207
Chief, we're truck drivers.

997
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,459
You're a marine!

998
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:06,271
And this country needs her.

999
01:02:06,296 --> 01:02:08,423
You wanna risk the lives of
my men for some symbol?

1000
01:02:09,632 --> 01:02:11,426
What do you think this is?

1001
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:16,472
FOX: Bring me Anoosh.

1002
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,945
These men are gonna get you out.

1003
01:02:34,574 --> 01:02:35,783
What is your name?

1004
01:02:37,994 --> 01:02:39,370
It's John.

1005

Thank you, John.

1006
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,005
Okay.

1007
01:02:49,547 --> 01:02:51,007
Give me your hands.

1008
01:02:58,514 --> 01:02:59,682
Merrimette,

1009
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:02,018
no easy day, huh?

1010
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:50,525
What are we gonna do now, man?
We gotta get outta here.

1011
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:57,865
You're in charge, Corporal.
Your orders.

1012
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:00,535
Call it.

1013
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:02,578
Just...

1014
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:04,622
Just gimme a minute.

1015
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,421
Come here.

1016
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:13,089
MERRIMETTE: Come with me.

1017
01:04:17,427 --> 01:04:18,678
Who the hell are you?

1018
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:22,265
I'm not unlike you.

1019
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,353
I am fighting for the
rights for my people,

1020
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:30,940
and your government
is supportive of my cause.

1021
01:04:31,524 --> 01:04:34,777
A lot of good men have died for
you, so I hope you're worth it.

1022
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:36,529
So do I.

1023
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:43,453
We need to get to that village.

1024
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,221
I think we should
talk about this.

1025
01:04:45,246 --> 01:04:47,515
Nothin' to talk about. It's
my squad, makes it my call.

1026
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,834
I don't mean to question you.
Then don't.

1027
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,087
All due respect,
Corporal, this...

1028
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,339
ALLEN: She's not our mission.

1029
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:58,509
She is now.

1030
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,189
Get ready to move out.

1031
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:15,418
Standard diamond formation.

1032
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:17,028
Package in the middle.

1033
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:19,489
Let's go.

1034

Stay sharp, Marines.

1039
01:07:21,152 --> 01:07:22,445
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1040
01:07:24,113 --> 01:07:25,114
Jeez, kid.

1041
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:28,009
Beat it, kid. I'm not in the mood.
All right.

1042
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:29,927
Get the fuck outta here.

1043
01:07:29,952 --> 01:07:32,221
Hey, I got somebody with a
video camera at the window.

1044
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:33,331
Is he armed?

1045
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:34,599
I can't tell.

1046
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:35,791
Keep an eye on him.

1047
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:38,502
Hey, put the camera down.

1048
01:07:39,337 --> 01:07:41,005
Put the video camera down.

1049
01:07:41,464 --> 01:07:44,008
Put the camera down.

Hey, hey!
KETTNER: Gun!

1052
01:07:48,262 --> 01:07:49,989
Drop the weapon!

1053
01:07:50,014 --> 01:07:52,033
Khalid, tell him to drop
his fucking weapon.

He's invited us to
come inside and talk.

Tell him Senior Chief Fox
sent us.

It looks like everyone's
clearing out, Corporal.

1071
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:06,065
It looks good.

1072
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,342
Still got that video camera
in that window though.

Yeah?

Roger that.

About to be on the

Well, just stay
on him, all right?

Let me know if anything changes.

Hey, Corporal?
What's up?

1079
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:24,859
Can I get one of those chais?

Yeah?

Ever have a camel milk
chai latte?

1083

He says he is sorry to hear about Fox and
that he was a true friend to the village.

1084
01:09:37,913 --> 01:09:41,041
And that he will help us
contact our base. How soon?

(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

1088
01:09:48,215 --> 01:09:52,428
He is curious about the package and
wondering if she is our prisoner.

1089
01:09:53,554 --> 01:09:54,680
No.

1090
01:09:58,601 --> 01:10:00,603
FAISAL: She is
Afghani national, yes?

1091
01:10:00,936 --> 01:10:02,188
Yeah.

1092
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,783
FAISAL: Then why does
she travel with us?

1093
01:10:14,408 --> 01:10:17,219
That question's
above my pay grade.

1094
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:19,580
I just need to get her out
of here and back to base.

1095
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:21,974
He is saying she is safe here.

1096
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:24,084
Tell him I have my orders.

1097
01:10:27,922 --> 01:10:31,050
FAISAL: He has his also. What the
hell's that supposed to mean?

1098
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,282
FAISAL: Because she is Afghani
national and not our prisoner,

1099
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:40,451
he must seek permission
from the provincial commander

1100
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:43,329
before he can allow us
to leave with her.

1101
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:46,482
All right. Let him know that
we're running out of time.

1102
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:49,668
Time. We need to
get this done now.

1103
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:53,547
I don't understand. We got
goddamned satellites up there

1104
01:10:53,572 --> 01:10:55,466
that can see everything,
they can see up your asshole.

1105
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:57,051
You know that, don't you?
JONES: Yes, sir.

1106
01:10:57,076 --> 01:10:58,327
See into your bedroom.

1107
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:00,429
All this goddamned technology,

1108
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:03,624
all this manpower,
we cannot locate five marines?

1109
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,310
Perfect storm of bad
stuff happening, sir.

1110
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:10,731
They got ambushed, marine comms go
down, sandstorm between them and us.

1111
01:11:10,756 --> 01:11:12,733
Well, what about
the air on station?

1112
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,235
Do we have any direct support?

1113
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,511
Still grounded, sir.

1114
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,279
Son of a bitch!

1115
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:20,157
I got a Humvee column rollin'
outta FOB Keenan now, sir.

1116
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:22,910
Keenan?
That's Royal Irish Regiment?

1117
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:24,078
Imjin Company Second Battal...

1118
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:26,539
We goddamned better hope for a
little luck of the Irish here.

1119
01:11:26,564 --> 01:11:29,044
They're on the other side of the
sandstorm and they got access.

1120
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:32,086
Now you're telling me that this
is our best worst option, right?

1121
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:33,838
I'm afraid so.

1122
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:37,258
I do have some actual intel on who's the
package that they're traveling with.

1123
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:38,509
Talk to me.

1124
01:11:38,534 --> 01:11:40,177
Her name is Anoosh Hassan.

1125
01:11:40,202 --> 01:11:42,888
Anoosh Hassan?
I know the name. Who is she?

1126
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:44,056
It's a women's rights' activist.

1127
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:45,474
She's a real hero to the
people in the provinces.

1128
01:11:45,499 --> 01:11:46,642
She's a beacon of hope.

1129
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,310
The Taliban wants her dead, sir.

1130
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:49,895
And Washington wants her alive.

1131
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,647
Yup. She's good PR.

1132
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:55,676
She's good PR. You know
what's bad PR in my book?

1133

Dead marines are bad PR.

1134
01:11:58,762 --> 01:12:00,573
She's a keynote speaker
at the United Nations

1135
01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:02,449
International Summit
on Human Rights.

1136
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:04,768
She's scheduled to be
in New York in 36 hours.

1137
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:07,788
That's direct from Washington. She's
the president's guest of honor.

1138
01:12:07,813 --> 01:12:11,317
And she's with our marines?
Yes, sir.

<i>A man has a lot of choices,</i>

1329

<i>and these choices made in life
are rarely perfect.</i>

1330
01:35:24,959 --> 01:35:27,420
<i>So he decides to sign a contract</i>

1331
01:35:27,795 --> 01:35:29,772
<i>because he wants to
make a difference.</i>

<i>He wants to save this world,
make it a better place.</i>

<i>The consequences are punishing,</i>

<i>unforgiving,</i>

1335

<i>and he questions why
he ever signed that contract.</i>

1336
01:35:43,477 --> 01:35:45,688
<i>So what's the fucking point?</i>

1337
01:35:46,272 --> 01:35:49,191
<i>I guess the point is
responsibility of duty.</i>

<i>A marine fights for the person
