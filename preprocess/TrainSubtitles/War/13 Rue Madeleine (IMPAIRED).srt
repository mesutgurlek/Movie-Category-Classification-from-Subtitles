00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:22,257
[Man Narrating]
"What is past is prologue."

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:26,269
Yes, here at the National Archives
in Washington D. C...

3
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,396
past is prologue...

4
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:32,431
for this is the final resting place
of the histories and records...

5
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,071
of tens of thousands
of illustrious Americans.

6
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:39,309
World War II has come
to a victorious conclusion...

7
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:43,820
and now new names and new records
are being added to the list...

8
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,483
for the nation and the world are
for the first time learning...

9
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,959
of silent and significant deeds
performed in foreign lands...

10
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:56,933
by a legion of anonymous men and women...
the Army of Secret Intelligence.

11
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:03,039
When Washington, recovering from
the staggering blow of Pearl Harbor...

12
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,837
realized how effective had been
the long-established...

13
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,744
espionage machines
of Germany and Japan...

14
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:13,010
from the White House came orders
that the United States, too...

15
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,678
must have eyes and ears
within enemy countries.

16
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:20,850
Immediately, the nation commenced...
for the first time in its history...

17
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,588
to recruit a Secret
Intelligence Corps.

18
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:29,031
As the man best capable of organizing
the secret activities...

19
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,034
of the new United States
Intelligence Corps...

20
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:36,732
the president chose a Saint Louis
attorney, Charles Stevenson Gibson...

21
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:39,776
whose background in international
affairs had been gained...

22
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:44,439
from ten years'special service
in the American Embassy in Berlin.

23
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,449
As director of
Secret Intelligence...

24
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:51,352
Gibson reported only to the president
and theJoint Chiefs of Staff.

25
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:57,520
Among the top-level executives
of United States Secret Intelligence...

26
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:01,292
was a widely traveled scholar
and soldier of fortune...

27
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:05,597
Robert Emmet Sharkey
of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

28
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,571
Master of five languages and one
of America's foremost athletes...

29
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,134
Bob Sharkey was twice captured
by the Germans in World War I...

30
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:19,877
and both times escaped
with a brilliant record of
achievement behind enemy lines.

31
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:27,823
To Washington, in the weeks and months
that followed Pearl Harbor...

32
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,349
had come 76 carefully selected
groups of candidates...

33
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:36,024
for training and assignment
to secret operations overseas.

34
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,035
At the Union Station
one morning in 1944...

35
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:43,802
among thejostling thousands,
came the 77th group of candidates...

36
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,843
each unknown to the other.

37
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:53,543
The Washington headquarters of Secret
Intelligence was under tight security...

38
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:58,054
its address and telephone unlisted
in any governmental directory.

39
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,420
Few even knew of its existence.

40
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,784
The story of Operation 77
is typical of the activities...

41
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:09,424
of any of the 76 groups
which preceded it.

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,025
Each candidate's qualifications
and background...

43
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:16,038
had been checked and rechecked
before he was called to Washington.

44
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:21,271
Every member of O77 had volunteered
without reservation...

45
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:24,712
for hazardous duty
behind enemy lines.

46
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:29,481
Among those assigned to O77
were men like Pappy Simpson...

47
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:32,249
a British intelligence officer
in the First World War...

48
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,758
and, until early 1942,
a professor of English literature...

49
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:39,262
at Dartmouth College
at Hanover, New Hampshire.

50
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,321
Suzanne de Beaumont,
a French citizen...

51
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,859
had found herself stranded in the
United States when France fell in 1940.

52
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:52,068
Ofher husband, a captain
of artillery in the French army,
nothing had been heard.

53
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:56,306
Jeff Lassiter, son of a former
American consul at Bern, Switzerland...

54
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,814
was educated at Geneva
and Oxford.

55
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:03,876
Lassiter was recruited from the
Officers Training School at U.C.L. A...

56
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:07,754
partly because ofhis
superior knowledge of French.

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,805
Bill O'Connell,
a Rutgers graduate...

58
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,136
Bill O'Connell,
a Rutgers graduate...

59
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:15,165
had been employed in the Foreign
Department of the Chase National Bank.

60
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:18,144
He spent two years in the bank's
European branches...

61
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:20,147
then Hitler went on the march...

62
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:23,150
and O'Connell returned
to New York.

63
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:29,023
- Say, do you remember the maiden
name of your grandmother?
- Sure.

64
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,025
She was quite a dame.

65
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:33,027
I wish mine had been.

66
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:39,392
[Narrator] Far away from the eyes of
inquisitive, gossipy Washington...

67
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:43,131
in secluded, country estates
requisitioned by the government...

68
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:47,767
O77 candidates entered
phase one of training.

69
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,713
Oh, is this bunk taken?

70
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,715
- Not yet.
- You bought a roommate.

71
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,947
I don't know. A guy that can't remember
the maiden name of his grandmother...

72
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,954
- She's got one now.
- [Knocking]

73
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,956
- [Both] Come in.
- Sorry for intruding, gentlemen.

74
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,618
I'm your conducting officer.
The name is Simpson.

75
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,958
- Bill O'Connell.
- Lassiter. Jeff Lassiter.

76
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,963
- Quarters all right?
- Great. Fine.

77
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:14,263
The library, the lounge, the pool...
all the facilities of the club
are for your convenience.

78
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:16,998
We'll be here two weeks.
I hope you'll be comfortable.

79
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:20,166
- Are we going to start training?
- No. This is assessment school.

80
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,176
You'll be given tests
to determine your mental...

81
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,337
and physical qualifications
for training.

82
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,346
To see if we can make the grade,
is that it?

83
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:30,145
Well, everyone isn't temperamentally
equipped for every job, you know.

84
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:32,152
We lose a few of you.

85

If you're thirsty, you'll find plenty
of beer in the icebox all the time.

86
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:39,218
Just help yourselves. Oh, uh,
supper in the main dining room, 6:30.

00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,559
Dress optional.
Carry on.

Even a housemother.
Rugged duty.

- This is gonna go all right.

- Play backgammon?
- Yeah.

- Let's have a game after dinner.
- With ya.

94
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,967
This is your group, Bob.
You're in charge.

95
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:23,835
Three months of indoctrination school,
two weeks of practical exercises...

96
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,839
and they've got to be
in shape to go.

97
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,375
- Is that my assignment?
- That's one of them.

98
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,879
22 potential agents.

99
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:35,439
Most of them have a foreign background.
All can speak French.

100
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:39,044
- One of them can speak German.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,214
You've got to find out
who that is.

102
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,281
All right.

103
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,759
That's not as easy
as it sounds.

104
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:51,424
- Why?
- Because one of the students in
that group is a German agent.

105
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,703
A German agent?

106
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,084
- You know?
- Yeah.

107
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,622
Man or woman?

108
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,124
When you find out,
let me know.

109
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,131
Mm-hmm. All right.

110
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,213

¶¶[Stops]

112
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:47,680
I've got a couple of things
to say to you before you begin
the next phase of your training.

113
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,350
Your instructors are all
experts in their jobs.

114
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:54,691
They're going to cram their years
of experience into your heads.

115
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:58,358
It shouldn't be necessary,
but I'm going to remind you of security.

116
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,368
Everything you learn,
everything you do, is secret.

117
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:05,236
Even your closest relatives can't know
you're an agent in O77.

118
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:08,743
Maybe nobody will ever know.
That's not important.

119
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,438
But keeping your mouth shut is.

120
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,640
Now, you're gonna have
a lot to remember...

121
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:18,845
and a couple of things
to forget.

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,254
Now, the average American is
a good sport. Plays by the rules.

123
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:28,160
But this war is no game, and no
secret agent is a hero or a good sport...

124
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:32,962
that is, no living agent.

125
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:36,697
You're going to be taught to kill,
to cheat, to rob, to lie.

126
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,366
Everything you learn is moving you
toward one objective...

127
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:44,435
just one, that's all...
the success of your mission.

128
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:48,107
Fair play? That's out.

129
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:50,617
Years of decency
and honest living?

130
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:54,382
Forget all about them,
or turn in your suits...

131
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,391
because the enemy can forget...

132
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,528
and has.

133
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:07,125
Well, work hard. I'll be with you
every inch of the way. All the way.

134
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:10,228

for area "B" this afternoon.

137
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,948

Don't forget the slap.
It'll break the force of your fall.

a grim reminder of the power of
destruction of a ruthless enemy.

Here were concentrated
the multiple activities

But top-secret groups like O77...

Bill, uh, how well
do you know Holland?

- I've lived there many years.
- But how well do you know it?

I don't mean just Amsterdam.

You read the papers.
Full of talk about a second front.

- You think Holland?

That's somebody else's job.

one ton of explosives.

but that's just expediency.

than we can knock them out.

- No, not yet.

there's going to be an invasion.
He doesn't know where or when.

406

He does know that the invasion
base is in Southampton...

407
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:11,446
and he's building up
a tremendous supply of these rockets.

When he launches his attack, it's going
to be a sustained barrage on this area.

- When do you think it'll start?
- When Eisenhower makes his move.

The most closely guarded area
in all of France is right here.

Every civilian in this area
is virtually a prisoner.

A main assembly and supply depot
feeds rockets to all these
launching platforms.

The depot's location
is about... here.

425
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:17,580
To destroy this target we have to know
every detail of its construction.

426
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:22,920
Even the French Resistance...
the Maquis... have been unable
to get this information.

427
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:25,825
All of the workmen...
forced labor, of course...

have been liquidated soon
as they finish their jobs.

429
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:32,761
Up to this point we've been stymied...
thoroughly stymied...

Monsieur Duclois.
A very important man to the Germans.

Burn that face, that picture,
into your memory...

435
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,621
because the success of your mission,
and subsequently...

436
00:33:57,693 --> 00:34:00,719
the destruction of the target,
is linked to that man.

of your mission?
- Of course not.

- No, I don't understand.

Your chum O'Connell...
is an agent of the Nazi government.

- His name is Kuncel.

He's a clever, thoroughly
trained German secret agent.

Oh... Oh, you're kidding.

- No, I'm not kidding.
- But that's silly.
I was with him all through school.

- Don't feel badly. He fooled me too.
- I can't believe it.

503
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:46,545
It was hard. Harder to find him...

504
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,741
although I'd been told there
was a German agent in the school.

That's why he's still in the group.

your disarming naiveté came in...

508
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,258

we knew anything about him.

Ajob that you can't do
without knowing.

O'Connell has been assigned
a mission in Holland.

to all the misinformation
we have allowed him to obtain.

- The invasion of Holland.
That's the lie we're trying to sell...

to the German High Command, and Kuncel...
O'Connell... is the salesman.

- That's where you come in.
- What could I do?

We're going to send you with him.

Still your mission as planned.
You'll proceed to Le Havre.

- You'll be dropped near Rotterdam.

by the name Wolfert Bockman
at the Department of Public Works.

Suzanne get through to France.
- S-Suzanne?

She'll be briefed for the Holland
mission with you and O'Connell.

524
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,583
The briefing will be short
and, of course, a phony.

You'll be on your way
within 48 hours.

Now comes the rugged part.

- We think O'Connell is sold.

528

If we're right, he'll make his break
and you'll never see him again.

529
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,561
Could he know anything
about Duclois?

530
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,605
- Not unless he gets it from you.
- He won't.

he's ruthless,
lets nothing interfere.

- His way? What's that?

536
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:42,217

and should in any way suspect
that you're on a double mission...

537
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,356
if he doesn't make his break
and tries to follow you...

538
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:47,366
you're going to shoot him.

539
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:51,427

- And make sure it's for keeps.

00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,485
Yeah, I can do it.

00:47:05,675 --> 00:47:08,610
- You don't owe me anything.
- Running in.

599
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:15,245
One... Go!

600
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:22,414
Two...

601
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:24,426
Go.!

602
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:31,531
Three...

603
00:47:57,193 --> 00:48:01,755
"Lassiter killed in jump. Stop.
O'Connell fired at reception
committee. Stop.

604
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:06,768
"Disappeared. Stop. O'Connell
in possession of all Henri Masson
documents. Stop.

605
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:11,773
Proceeding mission area as planned.
Stop. Suzanne."

606
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:28,051
- Which one of you girls received
this message from de Beaumont?
- I did, sir.

607
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,558
- You sure it's her transmission?
- Positive.

608
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,594
Killed in the jump.
What a break.

609
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,600
Yes, it is.

610
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:10,398
Well, right now we're batting
zero-zero-zero.

611
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:12,400
- [Knocking]
- Come in.

612
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:22,305
This just came in, sir,
from the operator on the plane.

613
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:31,486
Lassiter's static cord
was deliberately cut.

614
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:35,888
- What!
- His chute never opened.
He was murdered.

615
00:49:38,094 --> 00:49:40,619
What a way to die.

616
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:42,631
What did Kuncel know?

617
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:46,226
- Could he have known anything
about Lassiter's mission?
- No.

618
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:49,601
- He knew he had Vichy credentials.
- He knew more than that.

619
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:53,073
He also knew the Holland invasion
was a phony.

620
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:57,272
Yeah. Or else he wouldn't
have killed Lassiter.

621
00:49:57,347 --> 00:50:01,943
Well, Sharkey, you've done a great job.
Where do you go now?

622
00:50:02,018 --> 00:50:05,852
- Back to Minnesota
to sit on a draft board.
- What's that?

623
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:09,858
I've made the only mistake
you're allowed to make in this outfit.

624
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:13,692
Yeah, they might send you on
a rest cure for that one, except...

625
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,924
There are no "excepts,"
and they're right.

626
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:19,162
- It'd look good to me.
I might do it again.
- So might I.

627
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:21,601
The one thing we can hope
for is another chance, unless...

628
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:24,765
- Unless what?
- Unless you want to concede the victory.

629
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:30,074
- Ah, not from you, Gib.
Keep your punches up, eh?
- I said, "unless you want to."

630
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:33,809
I concede nothing... until
they throw dirt in my face.

631
00:50:33,883 --> 00:50:38,752
- That's better. Now, who have you
got to send to France?
- Only one man to send.

632
00:50:38,821 --> 00:50:41,813
Too short a time to get Duclois
and blast that target. Who?

633
00:50:41,891 --> 00:50:43,825
- Me.
- No.

634
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:47,727
An agent who wasn't familiar
with the mission wouldn't have a chance.

635
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:52,063
We haven't time to bring one up to date.
We need the time on the other end.

636
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:53,957
- You know I can't send you.
- Why not? I'm familiar
with every detail. I planned it.

637
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:56,721
- You know I can't send you.
- Why not? I'm familiar
with every detail. I planned it.

638
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:58,727
I could leave immediately.
Give me one reason.

639
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:02,458
- You know the date and place
of the invasion.
- I've forgotten.

640
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:07,469
- Do you realize what would happen
to you if you were captured?
- Torture? Certainly.

641
00:51:07,537 --> 00:51:11,667
Every agent carries an L-tablet.
And dead one minute after you bite one.

642
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:14,904
- And Kuncel's probably waiting for you.
- I'd like that.

643
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:18,778
- We're 100% failure
unless we get Duclois.
- Right.

644
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:22,284
There's a man loose who knows
every one of our 15 agents.

645
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:26,288
- We took that chance
when we left Kuncel in.
- I trained that group.

646
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:30,019
Every one of their lives is in
jeopardy while Kuncel's around.

647
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:34,757
- We're losing time.
I'll need these minutes.
- I don't want to send you.

648
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:37,459
I've been working hard.
I need the change.

649
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:41,469
You won't come back.

650
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:44,370
- I've just discovered
something about you.
- What?

651
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,374
You're a worrier.

652
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,316
Running in.

653
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,997
Go!

654
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:47,469
Giselle, show him the way.

655
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,278
You can go in now.

656
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:33,577
- Are you sure that's the right house?
- Oh, yes.

657
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:35,583
[Kisses]

658
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:07,812
I am very grateful
for your hospitality.

659
00:54:07,884 --> 00:54:10,580
You are welcome to spend the night.

660
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:15,082
- Tomorrow I could not have taken you in.
- Oh?

661
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:19,288
Today two German officers arrived.
More Germans are moving into this area.

662
00:54:19,362 --> 00:54:23,594
They need this house. They will be
back tomorrow. They take the best.

663
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,726
- I must leave tomorrow.
- That is well.

664
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:31,297
Has, um... Has anyone else arrived?
Not the Germans?

665
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:34,673
- Many people have arrived here.
- But I mean today, tonight.

666
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,440
I'm expecting to meet someone,
a young lady.

667
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:40,971
During the war,
I have been left alone. You arrive.

668
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,213
I do not ask whom you are
or where you come from.

669
00:54:44,287 --> 00:54:48,314
I understand. But if someone should
arrive and ask for Gabriel Chavat...

670
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:54,091
- It's very important.
- Food... what we have... at least
it will be warm... is waiting.

671
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:59,100
- That's very nice, but...
- I will show you to the kitchen.
This way, please.

672
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:04,034
Now I will retire.

673
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:09,677
You are leaving early.
Good-bye.

674
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:11,679
Good-bye.

675
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:36,586
- Was it difficult?
- Not too difficult.

676
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:38,595
- A fine woman.
- I know.

677
00:55:38,663 --> 00:55:42,394
I was here when
the German officers arrived.

678
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,265
- When are we leaving?
- As soon as it's daylight.

679
00:55:45,337 --> 00:55:48,204
- Where are we going?
- Pont-I'Eveque, near Le Havre.

680
00:55:48,273 --> 00:55:51,800
Good. I know a safe place
for our transmission.

681
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:54,812
- Same mission?
- Duclois.

682
00:56:01,052 --> 00:56:04,317
The unfortunate death of
my friend will force their hand.

683
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:08,849
- They may already have sent
an agent to take his place.
- Yes, it's possible.

684
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:10,861
And that's the man
we must find.

685
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:14,695
- That man will give us the answer
to your question. Karl...
- Yes?

686
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:20,068
Tighten every security check in
the costal area. Forget the name
"Masson." They'll change it.

687
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:22,470
I will be at Abwehr headquarters
in Le Havre.

688
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:26,102
- Report any discrepancies
in any civilian's behavior.
- Yes.

689
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:29,113
Hold for questioning any civilian
carrying Vichy credentials.

690
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:31,376
Yes.

691
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,053
They will send another man.

692
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:40,057
He'll need papers of authority
to allow him to perform his mission.

693
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:43,288
We will find that man,
and you shall know the mission.

694
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:30,440
- Good morning, monsieur.
- Good morning.

695
00:57:33,545 --> 00:57:35,479
Merci, monsieur.

696
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,756
Fill in this form, please.

697
00:57:48,827 --> 00:57:51,455
[Clerk]
How long do you wish to stay?

698
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:54,123
[Sharkey]
Long enough to accomplish my business.

699
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:58,192
- How long will that be, monsieur?
- Two or three days.

700
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,209
Very good, monsieur.

701
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:06,242
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

702
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:08,805
- I must trouble you to see your papers.
- But why?

703
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,817
I'm sorry, but I must trouble you.

704
00:58:10,885 --> 00:58:13,149
By what authority?

705
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:23,225
Oh, all this red tape,
all this interference holds up business.

706
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,031
There was an insurance adjustor
here a week ago.

707
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:38,510
- And two days later
you had another air raid.
- Not from German planes.

708
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,571
From British and American.
They bomb their friends.

709
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:43,708
[Chuckles]
Friends.

710
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:46,048
[Bell Dings]

711
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:50,557
Room 14.

712
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:06,200
Just a minute!
Where was your grandfather buried?

713
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:10,074
- Which one?
- Well, on your father's side?

714
00:59:10,144 --> 00:59:13,636
- In the St. Maurice Cemetery at Toulon.
- Oh, I see.

715
00:59:29,363 --> 00:59:31,797
Yes, Chavat.

716
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:35,927
C-H-A-V-A-T.
Chavat. Yeah.

717
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:38,733
St. Maurice Cemetery, Toulon.

718
00:59:39,874 --> 00:59:41,808
Mm-hmm.

719
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:44,811
[Footsteps Approaching]

720
00:59:54,322 --> 00:59:57,416
May I present my letter
of commission?

721
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:59,425
Department of Compulsory Labor.

722
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:04,653
- You represent the government at Vichy?
- Of course.

723
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:17,074
The nature of your business?

724
01:00:17,144 --> 01:00:20,636
My government and yours is not satisfied
with this town's labor record.

725
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:25,015
I cannot understand that.
We have tried to cooperate.

726
01:00:25,086 --> 01:00:27,850
That is precisely what you have
not done. You have not cooperated.

727
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:31,483
- This is a very small town.
- France is full of small towns...

728
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,584
only this happens to be
a very important one.

729
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:37,290
You know as well as I the kind
of work that's going on here...
a most important project.

730
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:39,299
And one that requires
the utmost secrecy.

731
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:42,564
I only know we have turned over
every available young man...

732
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:44,605
for German labor battalions.

733
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:49,473
You forget I have the facts.
The government has sent me to
investigate a serious protest.

734
01:00:49,543 --> 01:00:51,477
Protest?

735
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:56,713
I don't understand.
From whom?

736
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,718
A cooperative Frenchman...

737
01:00:58,786 --> 01:01:02,688
a man who realizes full well
where the future of France
lies... Monsieur Duclois.

738
01:01:04,525 --> 01:01:07,085
Has your town been molested
by our protectors? No.

739
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:11,689
Haven't your people been allowed
to enjoy the peace they had
before the Germans came?

740
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:14,963
No. Things are not the same.

741
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:20,136
They can never be the same when
we must give over the young men.

742
01:01:20,207 --> 01:01:24,405
You know what will happen, of course,
if you don't give them over.

743
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:29,140
Yes, I realize.
The Germans will take them.

744
01:01:29,216 --> 01:01:31,650
Exactly. That's why I'm here...
