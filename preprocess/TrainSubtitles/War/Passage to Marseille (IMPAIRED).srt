5 minutes to target area.

Here's another load,
you...

7
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,269
bombs all away, sir.

8
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,067
Good work, men.
Let's get out of here.

9
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,949
Hey, Matrac...

10
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,532
we are approaching
the town of Romilly.

11
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,787
Thank you.

12
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,681
Mama.

13
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,883
Yes, darling?

14
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,389
Is it dad?

15
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,767
[Whispering] I'm not sure.
You be quiet, darling.

16
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,065
Mother will be
right back.

17
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,232
All right.

Oh, jean, darling...

20
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,405
until we meet again.

21
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,874
You were to have gone with the
wing commander, Mr. Manning,

22
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,586
But I happen to be rejoining my outfit
not far from your own destination,

23
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,388
So they asked me to bring
you down from London.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,590
And what is my destin...
Your what, sir?

25
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,393
Oh, nothing. I was about to
ask what is my destination.

26
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,970
A military secret,
no doubt.

27
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,145
Sorry, sir.

28
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,196
I'm lost,
and I admit it.

29
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,198
Haven't the slightest
idea where we are.

30
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,404
Not a signpost,
not a marked road.

31
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,207
Somewhere near the channel,
unless I miss my guess.

32
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,001
Even for
a war correspondent,

33
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,828
This is pretty darn
mysterious.

34
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,003
Interesting, though.

35
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,133
Here we are, sir.

36
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,463
Really?
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,806
We're at an airdrome?

38
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,351
<i>Yes, sir. The base of the
famous squad Victoire.

39
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,849
I can't believe it.
Where are the barracks,

40
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,100
The wind sleeves,
the tarmac runs?

41
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,932
How do they operate here?

42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,939
Surprising, isn't it? The
French make out quite nicely.

43
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,022
They're an intensely
practical people, sir.

44
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,424
Will you get out, sir? Right.

45
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,502
This is headquarters.
I'll stow your bag, sir.

46
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,883
Thank you. You mind
if I take a look?

47
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,430
Not at all, sir.

48
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,052
Well. I must say,
I'm surprised.

49
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,184
This is something new in my
experience of military airdromes.

50
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,186
To think that all these
incredible bombings

51
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,609
Come from a quiet
place like this.

52
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,607
I suppose those cows
are squadron mascots.

53
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,189
Yes, sir. They've brought
us any amount of luck.

54
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,820
They're English, of course,
merely on loan to the Frenchmen,

55
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,824
As they couldn't very well bring
their own cows with them.

56
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,827
Jerseys, sir. The milk is
excellent, if you care for milk.

57
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,033
Seems a strange environment for one of
the deadliest squadrons in the service.

58
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,413
The quiet, you mean?

59
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,416
Yeah. Well, the
French don't mind it.

60
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,418
As a matter of fact,
they rather enjoy it.

61
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,420
It has a way of
livening up a bit

62
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,467
From time to time. And
now, if I may, sir,

63
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,636
I'll take you
to the liaison officer

64
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,713
Between the free French squadron
and our own... Captain Fresene.

65
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,515
[Knock on door]

66
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,841
Come in.

67
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,602
Glad to see you,
Hastings.

68
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,359
I've brought Mr. Manning. Mr.
Manning, captain Fresene.

69
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,984
You're very welcome,
Mr. Manning.

70
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,111
Thank you.

71
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,532
Well, I... I'll leave you in
each other's good hands.

72
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,955
But you must stay to dinner.
There's a place laid for you.

73
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,907
Sorry, sir. Have to push on.
Orders.

74
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,289
Well, good-Bye, sir. I'll have
your bag put in your bunk.

75
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,915
Thank you.
Good night.

76
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,962
Thank you,
Hastings.

77
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,960
<i>Au revoir, captain.

78
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,542
Good luck to you. Would you
like to take your coat off?

79
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,922
I would. Thanks.

80
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,758
Aperitifs will be in.

81
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,136
Or would you
prefer a cocktail?

82
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,559
Oh, no. That's
all right. Thanks.

83
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,510
Sit down.

84
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,971
Thank you.

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,146
Captain Fresene, the
purpose of my visit here...

86
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,566
Oh, I know the purpose
of your visit.

87
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,985
Word came this afternoon
from the air ministry.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,155
You've come to see some French traitors,
as monsieur Laval would call us.

89
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,574
No, captain. I've come to
see some free Frenchmen,

90
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,778
To get to know them and to write
about them for my news syndicate.

91
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,954
I think we can do with all the
understanding we can scrape together

92
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,327
In these touchy times.

93
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,829
Well, you can see
a few of us here.

94
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,286
There's certainly
more of them.

95
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,746
Thank you.

96
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,210
Do you think
that marshal Petain

97
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,466
Considers you as traitors
as well as Pierre Laval?

98
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,172
Evidently.

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,599
And yet I try
to be charitable

100
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,392
In my judgments,
Mr. Manning.

101
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,595
I try to remember that marshal
Petain's an old man now

102
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,146
And in the hands
of barbarians.

103
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,393
<i>Votre Sante.

104
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,687
You've seen him
these late years?

105
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,899
No, but I did once... Years ago
during the battle of Verdun.

106
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,610
He visited our squadron, which was
then at the foot of the Argonne.

107
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,536
You were flying
in the last war?

108
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,739
Yes. I was a pilot in the
escadrille Lafayette.

109
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,324
Ah, the escadrille
Lafayette!

110
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,206
You must have done your
training with us, Mr. Manning!

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,627
Why, we're
old comrades.

112
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,580
Here. Come and
have some dinner.

113
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,382
<i>I, too, was
a pilote de chasse

114
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,425
In squad 26
of the second group.

115
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,722
Many times did I see the Indian head
insignia of your squadron on patrol.

116
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,595
Now we meet
for the first time.

117
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,847
<i>Had I known you were an old
pilote of our service,

118
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,644
We would've messed
with the squadron.

119
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, that's all right. Perhaps
I can see them later.

120
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,854
Why, of course.
They're in that room.

121
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,857
Have you noticed?
Not a sound from them.

122
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,438
Remember the old days?

123
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,444
The laughter, the gay
talk in every mess,

124
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,446
Phonograph going full tilt?
Now, poor devils...

125
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,247
well, we're all right, we free Frenchmen,
but we find it hard to be merry.

126
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,073
I understand
they're bombers.

127
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,079
American flying
fortresses.

128
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,253
Though we did begin here 3 years
ago with a few of our own.

129
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,081
They crossed the channel as a unit
the day the armistice was signed.

130
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,916
And you came
with them?

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,923
My dear Mr. Manning,
you flatter me.

132
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,471
I'm getting along, and
I'm blind in one eye.

133
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,469
No, no, I'm nothing
but a liaison officer,

134
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,300
And I reached England
by another route.

135
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,602

out now,

Just to remind the
borsch of our existence.

142

Soon as we've finished, I'll take you
down to the hangars, if you like.

00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,292
Thanks. I'd like to
very much.

144

Mind the step.

145
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,896
Just over the rise
and you can see them.

146
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,448
Great heavens.
What is this?

147
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,954
Planes being pulled
out of barns?

148

A haystack
for a control tower?

149
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,538
Is this the same place
I saw when I came in?

150
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,960
Do you doubt it?

151
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,959
The hedges are gone,
the trees are gone,

152
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,506
And the fields
have become runways.

153
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,299
I don't doubt that. That's simple.
It's just magic.

154
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,218
But there's one thing I can't understand.
What's that?

155
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,545
Where are the cows?

156
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,176
They've taken them
in the hangars.

157
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,382
They lead the cows in and
lead the planes out. Come on.

158
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,042
They're going as the spearhead
of the attack tonight.

159
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,041
They're going to light up
a target for the others.

160
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,043
Do they know it,
that they'll take

161
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,544
The murderous part
of the pounding?

162
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,965
They'll give some
in their turn.

163
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,464
When I think of what they have to meet
in the air and from the ground...

164
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,463
we can be glad we were
flying 20-Odd years ago.

165
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,548
Yeah.

166
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,193
Will you excuse me
a moment, please?

167
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,369
Of course.

168
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,160
Again?

169
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,246
Yes. Tonight's
a special occasion,

170
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,047
Sort of
an anniversary.

171
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,875
I understand.

172
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,676
You have
my permission.

173
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,672
Good luck.

174
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,220
Thank you, sir.

175
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,082
P.A.: All aircraft,
proceed to takeoff positions.

176
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,665
All aircraft, proceed
to takeoff positions.

177
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,749
Over.

178
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,987
"V" for victor. "V."

179
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,565
You may take off.

180
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,743
"V" for victor. "V."
You may take off.

181
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,515
"N" for Norman.
Take off. Good hunting.

182
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,118
There. Now we can breathe
easy for a few hours,

183
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Have a smoke.
As for them...

184
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,710
what's the destination tonight,
or is that a military secret?

185
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,167
Now they're in the air, it's not.
Berlin again.

186
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,752
Good. How many?

187
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,553
Over 2,000 bombers over
the target tonight.

188
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,972
2,000.
Great heavens.

189
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,719
Matrac
will like that.

190
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,194
I've been thinking
about those men,

191
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,571
Those grim, determined faces...
especially that gunner,

192
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,994
The man you spoke to
just before the takeoff.

193
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,992
I can't get him
out of my mind.

194
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,119
I feel I've seen him
somewhere before.

195
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,950
Matrac.
He impressed you.

196
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,833
I've never seen a stronger
face or a stranger one.

197
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,834
Not a fellow to take liberties
with, I should say.

198
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,712
No. I could tell you a story about
him I've never told anyone.

199
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,543
Would you care
to hear it?

200
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,718
By all means,
captain.

201
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,887
For the moment,
I'll have to ask you

202
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,886
To keep it off the record,
as you journalists say.

203
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,468
It's for your private ear. Later,
I think, it might be told.

204
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,601
This is the story of a little
group of whom Matrac was one.

205
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,024
For many years, they suffered
every pain, humiliation,

206
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,103
And indignity that men can
have heaped upon him.

207
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,029
I chanced to meet these...

208
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,231
Well, we'll let that
come in its place.

209
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,035
To begin, I'll have to take
you far away from here.

210
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,034
The outbreak of the war brought
orders for my return to France

211
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,582
From service
in new Caledonia.

212
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,036
I was forced to take passage
on the Ville de Nancy,

213
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,918
Bound for Marseille with
a cargo of nickel ore.

214
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,672
<i>The Ville de Nancy was one
of those venerable tramps

215
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,004
Which wallow across the
backwaters of the world

216
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,634
Year after year.

217
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,888
She wore the customary coat
of rust-Streaked black paint.

218
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,641
We had a good Breton
skipper... Captain Marlowe...

219
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,064
<i>Who knew his way
around the 7 seas

220
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,642
As a blind man knows
his own room.

221
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,444
Also 2 decent mates
who idolized their captain.

222
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,235
The companionship
of such men

223
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,571
Did much to keep the tedium
of the long, slow voyage

224
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,031
From being too oppressive.

225
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,836
And sometimes, there were songs
of home from the forecastle.

226
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,720
Our crew was made up of
hard-Bitten, salty old-Timers,

227
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,093
Who may have been
no better than they should be,

228
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,970
But were French
to a man.

229
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,767
For stokers
and coal passers,

230
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,096
We had the scum
of the earth...

231
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,681
Mongrel dregs from every
port in the tropics,

232
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,268
Dominated by a chief engineer
cut to the same pattern.

233
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,199
As there were
but 3 cabin passengers,

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,869
We all messed
at the captain's table.

235
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,197
The seat of honor
was filled... very amply...

236
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,703
by a major Duval
of the infantrie coloniale.

237
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,706
He was a dominating,
narrow-Minded martinet,

238
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,129
Who had proved his courage
in the last war

239
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,752
And had learned
nothing since.

240
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,176
With him was his aide,
lieutenant Lenois.

241
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,595
He hung on Duval's
every word,

242
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,342
A typical yes-Man.

243
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,719
These...

244
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,266
The first and second mates

245
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,265
And the chief engineer...
Made up our official family.

246
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,143
Oh, yes.
There was one other...

247
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,725
A treacherous youth,
Jordan by name,

248
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,561
Who proved to be
the wireless officer.

249
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,363
Latest bulletin, sir.

250
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,568
"A day of comparative quiet was
enjoyed on the Maginot line.

251
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,028
"From the German fortification
across the river,

252
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,955
"The Nazi radio broadcast an
appeal to the French soldiers

253
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,830
"To lay down their arms
and refuse to spill their blood

254
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,753
"In a useless fight
for the decadent democracies.

255
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,877
"Some martial music was also
broadcast by the Nazis,

256
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,549
"And the loyal
French soldiers

257
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,127
Are understood
to have booed. "

258
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,133
What kind of a war
is this?

259
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,715
Soldiers say "boo"?
Soldiers of France?

260
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,721
I'm a soldier. I fight.
Do I say "boo"?

261
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,723
I can... Listening to music.
Is this war?

262
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,725
I can... Or is it a band concert?

263
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,306
Kindly allow the
commandant to speak.

264
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,857
I beg
your pardon.

265
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,731
I can tell you
what kind of a war.

266
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,982
The Germans are afraid. They're
afraid of our Maginot line.

267
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,487
<i>Brilliant, mon commandant. The
whole truth in a nutshell.

268
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,694
That's right. They know that no power
on earth can break through it.

269
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,451
What are we going to do,
sit there indefinitely?

270
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,032
Yes. We'll sit there
indefinitely,

271
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,241
And even longer, if
that is necessary.

272
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,043
That is what soldiers are
for... To hold the line.

273
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,041
I say the Maginot
line is invincible.

274
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,373
I say the Ziegfried
line is invincible.

275
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,130
And what is that but stalemate?
Where does it get us?

276
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,302
Fresene, I think
I'm going to like you.

277
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
Victory comes with endurance.
It came the last time,

278
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,431
And it'll come again to the army
that outlasts its opponent,

279
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,013
To the army that holds its
lines 5 minutes longer.

280
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,848
And that army will
be the French army

281
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,024
Because its officers
will make it hold,

282
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,023
Because they'll hold
their men in place

283
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,524
By means of
cast-Iron discipline.

284
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,856
And what if the Maginot
line is outflanked?

285
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,034
Forgive me, sir, but I've always
understood that in a democracy,

286
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,362
Even a soldier has
the right to think.

287
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,243
Discipline is more essential than
thought to a combat officer.

288
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,824
An army's not
a debating society.

289
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,455
Thinking is done
for them by experts.

290
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,038
I trust the captain does
not believe himself wiser

291
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,839
Than marshal Petain and
the general staff.

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,666
The British have
a general staff,

293
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,717
And it seems
to feel as I do.

294
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,012
Our allies have no such blind
faith in the Maginot line.

295
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,135
That is because
they did not build it.

296
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,807
They're jealous
of French genius.

297
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,384
A nation
of shopkeepers.

298
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,139
They wanted
to sell us the cement.

299
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,972
<i>Very well said,
mon commandant.

300
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,399
Do not mention the British.
The word offends me.

301
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,816
The British
will fight.

302
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,566
Oh, yes, to the last
drop of French blood.

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,319
Only last week, the commandant
said exactly the same thing.

304
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,321
Only last month the same
words were invented

305
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,744
In the office of Herr dr.
Goebbels in Berlin.

306
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,322
Are you accusing me
of disloyalty?

307
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,747
Or is it me
you accuse, sir?

308
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,575
Please. Let's not
accuse anyone...

309
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,000
neither
our traveling companions

310
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,794
Nor our allies.

311
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,293
Very well. I accept
your apology.

312
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,295
If you ask for my opinion,
just mark my words.

313
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,297
Time always
proves I'm right.

314
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
Fresene:
this was the atmosphere

315
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,725
In which I was destined to make a
voyage halfway around the globe.

316
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,302
By the time
we'd reached panama,

317
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,308
The world we'd known
was falling apart.

318
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,389
The Maginot line
was outflanked.

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,317
The invincible French army
was on the run.

320
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,895
Events were happening
with alarming swiftness.

321
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,980
"Maginot line
flanked. "

322
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,736
It's the fault of our allies!
British civilians.

323
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,533
What did I tell you?

324
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,111
They let our line
get flanked.

325
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,912
France can curse
the day

326
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,615
She let herself get mixed
up with foreign alliances.

327
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,699
Sir?

328
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,784
No!

329
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705

the panama canal,

set her helm for Marseille.

2 days out of colon, the
wireless buzzed continuously.

332
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,967
The air was full of the news of
torpedoings and hostile raiders.

333
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,237
Ahoy! The bridge!

334
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,563
Submarine!

335
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,024
Where away?

336
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,485
20 degrees
starboard, sir!

337
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,035
Sound the alarm.

[Bell rings]

339
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,958
What do you see?

340
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,587
Some sort of suspicious craft.
Can't be sure.

341
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,509
Man the guns.
Aye, aye, sir.

342
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,548
Hold the fire.
Aye, sir.

343
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,973
They'll have a torpedo
in our belly any minute!

344
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,676
Hold
your fire!

345
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,227
Hold your fire!

346
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,189
Well?

347
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,821
It's no sub.

348
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,570
Well, it's a craft of some
sort, isn't it? A boat?

349
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,196
Or a canoe.

350
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,823
See there!

351
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,620
That's a man.

352
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,286
He's alive.

353
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,959
Probably survivors
from some torpedoed ship.

354
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,836
Hard starboard.

355
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,832
Hard starboard.

356
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,163
Man:
hard starboard.

357
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,424
Steady.

358
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,180
Stop.

359
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,476
Lower a boat.

360
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,060
Lower away!

361
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,126
Faster! Faster!

362
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,088
Lower away.

363
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,255
Ho.

364
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,263
Easy with them, men!

365
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,237
Pretty far gone.

366
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,386
<i>God bless you.
Merci.

367
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,960
I needed that.

368
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,336
We've been without food
for 20 days.

369
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,594
Without water for 5.

370
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,092
Then I won't plague you
with questions right now.

371
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,851
Put these men
in the aft house.

372
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,554
Set up
the extra cots.

373
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,479
Aye, sir.

374
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,976
Hurry.
Right away.

375
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,433
Open up
that door.

376
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,436
Come on.

377
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,563
Easy,
now.

378
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,190
Tell them to
bring them some broth.

379
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,987
Then let them sleep. And
you might ask the men

380
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,405
If they can spare them
some clothes.

381
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,608
Aye, sir.

382
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,863
Come on.

[Bell clangs twice]

384
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,013
Captain Marlowe, what is your
opinion of these fellows?

385
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,012
Are they French?

386
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,470
One of them is at least, but what would
they be doing in an Indian canoe?

387
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,894
They are not seamen.
That's plain.

388
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,598
If we were off
the African coast,

389
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,399
I'd wager 10 to 1 that
they were deserters

390
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,146
From one of our
disciplinary battalions.

391
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,978
Don't you say so,
major?

392
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,563
No, I do not. Since we are
not off the African coast,

393
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,944
You're reasoning lacks
something of being brilliant.

394
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,900
Learn to examine the facts,
man. Use your eyes.

395
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,703
Captain Fresene, perhaps
you can do better.

396
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,873
If you want the facts, you'd better
let the men explain for themselves.

397
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,292
I will and hear
a pack of lies.

398
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,371
Condemn them without a hearing.
Isn't that unfair?

399
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,672
No, it is not unfair because
I know who they are.

400
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,465
You mean,
you've seen them before?

401
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,589
No, I never saw them
before this morning,

402
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,546
But that is immaterial since I have
certain modest deductive powers.

403
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,176
Lenois was
on the right track,

404
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,758
Though he lacked the
logic to carry through.

405
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,468
These fellows have the
convict look about them.

406
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,678
Some of them may have served in
the disciplinary battalions,

407
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,058
But not recently.

408
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,516
Gentlemen, beyond
a shadow of a doubt,

409
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,145
They are fugitives
from devil's island.

410
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,351
From cayenne?

411
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,652
Impossible.

412
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,322
We are at least
1,500 miles from cayenne.

413
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,865
You mean to tell me they
have made such a voyage

414
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,533
In that small open canoe?

415
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,407
You don't know these fellows,
Marlowe... The type, I mean.

416
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,784
I was stationed in cayenne
a dozen years ago.

417
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,707
I learned the smell
of the convict.

418
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,580
A more depraved and
desperate set of scoundrels

419
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,751
Cannot be found.

420
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,374
No matter what your opinion,

421
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,332
I suggest we hear what they
have to say for themselves.

422
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,087
As you wish.

423
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,215
I shall be amused at their
lies and by exposing them.

424
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,295
We'll see, gentlemen.

425
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,470
Thank you.

426
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,599
Good evening.

427
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,271
Good evening, sir.

428
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,973
Come to attention,
you men.

429
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,410
You, too.

430
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,204
Haven't you been taught to stand
in the presence of officials?

431
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,365
No.

432
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,828
Never mind. This is a free ship
and not an armed compound.

433
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,583
I think we can all be seated.

434
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,337
Thank you, sir.

435
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,635
Well, you men seem to be
a long way from home.

436
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:39,927
<i>Oui, mon capitaine.

437
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,388
You're French,
the lot of you?

438
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,438
Yes, sir.

439
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,391
What's your name?

440
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,855
Renault.

441
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,607
Perhaps these men
will now tell us

442
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,687
Who they are and
where they come from.

443
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,777
Willingly, sir.

444
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,579
They are gold miners
from Venezuela.

445
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,781
3 of us that were
born in France

446
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,367
Are naturalized
Venezuelans.

447
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,954
The other two were born in
Venezuela of French parentage.

448
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,789
I see. Where?

449
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,126
Well, we were working
a placer claim,

450
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,508
300 miles up a branch
of the Orinoco.

451
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,806
Doubtless you've never
been there, sir.

452
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,132
It's deep
in the jungle.

453
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,016
You reach it
only by canoe.

454
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,972
We heard of the war
only 2 months ago.

455
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,682
Must be a wilderness that place.

456
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,267
Oh, yes, sir.
It's terrible.

457
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,149
There's no, uh, no
radio, no settlement,

458
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,606
No civilization
within 100 miles.

459
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,282
How did the news
reach you?

460
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,359
Just by chance, captain.

461
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,571
You see, there are Indian rubber
gatherers in that region.

462
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,907
Well, 3 of them just
coming in from the coast

463
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,789
Stopped at our camp.
Remember?

464
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,336
Uh-Huh.

465
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,210
Well, so, uh, we bought a
few supplies from them,

466
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,668
Among other things an ax wrapped
in a Caracas newspaper.

467
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,876
Oh, many months old.

468
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:55,802
What paper was that?

469
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,756
<i>The Caracas diario.

470
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,764
I even remember the
date, November 3rd.

471
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,266
The first news

Told us of a raid from the
Maginot line in Alsace.

473
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,356
And you were interested.

474
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,191
Naturally, sir. We are Frenchmen
just like yourselves.

475
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,867
We wanted to go home
and fight.

476
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:23,538
Likely. You,
what's your name?

477
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,207
Matrac.

478
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,660
Obviously, you are the leader.
Suppose you tell us.

479
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,584
I'll speak
for my friend.

480
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,085
Speak when you're spoken to.

481
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,883
Huh? Sit down. Sit down.

482
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,926
Well, go on.

483
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:41,132
We have no leader, we're all equal.
We're a group of free men.

484
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,560
You. You wish
to speak to us now.

485
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,434
Thank you, sir.

486
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,106
You were incredulous over our
attempt to return to France,

487
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,184
And I don't wonder.

488
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,190
Because it was an adventure

489
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,113
That only the deepest feelings
of patriotism could inspire.

490
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,067
All we had, sir,
was our little canoe.

491
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,994
Together with 200 ounces
of gold dust.

492
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,539
Our plan was
to sail westward

493
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,412
To where we could
catch a boat for panama

494
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,334
And from there
to France,

495
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,913
But, uh, we were upset
by a huge swell.

496
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:18,878
And the iron box that contained the
gold and our passports were lost.

497
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,054
We righted the boat
and went on nevertheless.

498
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,098
And from then on,
we were lost.

499
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,427
Helpless.

500
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,560
<i>Mon commandant,
my word of honor,

501
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,108
All this happened 3 weeks
before you sighted us.

502
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,527
You're one of the
naturalized Venezuelans?

503
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,523
Yes, sir.

504
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,321
Where was
your home there?

505
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,774
Silla Bolivar.

506
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,858
You, at the back there.

507
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,489
<i>Como se llama usted?

508
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,821
<i>Jorge Gerou,
a sus ordenes.

509
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,829
So, you didn't catch him.
His accent is perfect.

510
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,080
And you have no papers
of any sort.

511
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,332
No proof of identity.

512
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,882
No, sir. As Marias
so truthfully told,

513
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,584
They're all at the
bottom of the Orinoco.

514
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,090
I see. All at the bottom
of the Orinoco river.

515
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,090
Yes.

516
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,172
Very good.
Very convenient.

517
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,600
Or is it?
We shall see.

518
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,802
Do you have any further
questions, captain Marlowe?

519
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,731
No, commandant. You've asked quite
enough questions for all of us.

520
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,899
Yes, I think
I've been thorough.

521
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,153
Have everything
you need here?

522
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,609
Thank you, captain.

523
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,946
Yes. Captain. You've been
more than good to us.

524
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,155
Fine.

525
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,039
Well, commandant, I'm afraid
they spoiled your evening.

526
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,715
Their stories seem
perfectly plausible

527
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,883
And straightforward
to me.

528
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,054
Plausible, sir? It was a structure
of transparent falsehoods.

529
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,427
I always trust my instincts,
sir, never what men tell me.

530
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,928
Especially convicts.

531
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,601
All convicts are liars.

532
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
The commandant
has said it.

533
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,183
I don't believe a word
of their story.

534
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,684
[Chuckles]

535
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,163
[Whistles]

536
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,088
Captain Marlowe, I've come to a
decision regarding those rogues.

537
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,635
You have?

538
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,212
Yes. In the first place,
you allow too much freedom.

539
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,672
What do you propose
I should do?

540
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,006
Turn them over
to the police, of course,

541
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,058
The moment we arrive
in Marseille.

542
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,761
If they're honest men, as you so naively
suppose, they have nothing to fear.

543
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,471
Anything else?

544
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,306
In the meantime, they are to
be locked up in the brig.

545
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,188
Captain Marlowe
as the ranking representative

546
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,813
Of the army of France,
I demand it.

547
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,567
I'm glad you remember
to call me captain.

548
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,320
No one will be locked up on
my ship while I command.

549
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,532
The man's becoming
insufferable.

550
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,204
Fortunately, his word
will not be the final one

551
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,530
When we get to Marseille.

552
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,537
<i>You're absolutely right,
mon commandant.

553
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,209
The man is insufferable.

554
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,583
What's our speed?

555
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,132
101/2 knots,
180 revolutions, sir.

556
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,426
Full speed and
195 revolutions.

557
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,878
Aye, aye, sir.

558
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,259
I want to reach the
danger zone by nightfall.

559
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,467
Full speed,
195 revolutions.

560
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,541
Good evening.

561
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,538
Good evening.

562
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,666
Very fine day.

563
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,248
Any day that takes us closer
to France is a fine day.

564
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,086
I wonder... on your
account, I mean.

565
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,092
I was coming here
to tell you...

566
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,218
to warn you men
of something.

567
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,766
Commandant Duval
is of the opinion

568
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,264
That you and your friends
have escaped from cayenne.

569
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,264
Some of the others,
too.

570
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,724
I wouldn't be fair
if I didn't tell you

571
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,310
That I've come to the
same conclusion myself.

572
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,200
Will you wait here
a moment, please?

573
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,506
Will you come in,
please?

574
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,692
Sit down.

575
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,117
Thank you.

576
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,917
Captain, Renault's
told us what you said,

577
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,464
And we've been talking
here together.

578
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,339
There's nothing to do.
It's true.

579
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,294
We're convicts
escaped from cayenne.

580
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,347
Uh, we're Frenchmen. Convicts
or not, we can kill Germans.

581
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,514
What is more important
than that?

582
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,467
Shut up. What do
you know about it?

583
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,350
We're as good Frenchmen as a lot who
have never been sent to cayenne?

584
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,975
We are not soft,
us convicts.

585
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,602
We can kill Germans.

586
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,526
Keep out of this, petit.

587
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,229
Why have you told us this,
captain?

588
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,110
To put you
on your guard.

589
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,691
You're for us, then.

590
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,493
Yes.
France needs men.

591
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,038
You see, I told you
he would be for us.

592
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,615
Even if we are
convicts?

593
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,915
What does that matter?

594
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,417
I guess it's time
you heard our story.

595
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,044
Tell him, Renault.

596
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,002
Yes, but what
shall I begin with?

597
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,133
With whom
shall I begin?

598
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,466
Now, petit,
he is from Provence.

599
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,052
What caused him
to become a convict?

600
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,683
It was the love of a
farmer for his land.

601
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,264
You are right.

602
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,349
I farmed the land
my father farmed

603
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,435
And his father
before him.

604
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,522
My wife and I planted
as the seasons went by.

605
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,153
And then the government came
and they built a dam.

606
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,906
They flooded all my land.

607
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,828
I guess I went
kind of crazy.

608
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,828
He ran to the control station and
attempted to smash the machinery.

609
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,079
When the employees
tried to seize him,

610
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:27,128
He... He maimed several
and killed one.

611
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,672
The government
let me off easy.

612
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,127
Instead of being guillotined, I was
transported for life to Guyana.

613
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,837
Do you know
French Guyana?

614
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,016
It's the most corrupt and
neglected of all our colonies.

615
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,639
There in the steamy
equatorial climate,

616
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,313
There are 5 or 6,000 men
just like us,

617
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,641
Struggling against
the heavy undergrowth

618
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,647
In the very depths
of the jungle.

619
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,479
Slaves, half-Naked
in the forest.

620
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,405
Tortured by heat
and humidity,

621
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,530
Mosquitoes, fever,
rotten food.

622
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,580
Men die,
or else go insane.

623
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,382
Here you might have found petit
laboring to build a road.

624
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,889
I will tell you
about this road.

625
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,270
The convicts call it
"road zero"

626
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,694
Because it will
never exist.

627
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,146
Already it has been
under construction

628
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,072
For more than
half a century.

629
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,993
And for that, there is
exactly 16 miles to show.

630
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:44,573
And for those 16 miles, there's
one dead convict for every yard.

631
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,580
Not far from where
petit worked,

632
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,536
You might have
run across Gerou.

633
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,748
Working in
a mahogany camp.

634
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,051
Formerly a mechanic and a
professional racer of motor cars,

635
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,051
He had killed his sweetheart
during a lovers' quarrel.

636
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,053
In certain circles, it was
considered crude of him

637
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,431
To accomplish
this end with an ax.

638
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,743
[Gunshot]

639
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,059
Well, of course, since
then Gerou has reformed.

640
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,267
He's learned discipline.
Haven't you?

641
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,603
Cayenne is a very
good school for that.

642
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,438
And now, as a
pleasant diversion,

643
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,115
May I please
introduce myself.

644
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,444
<i>As you may have already
discovered, mon capitaine,

645
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,325
I'm a very clever
man and sensitive.

646
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,031
Sensitive down
to my fingertips.

647
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,413
In fact, these fingers made me
the best safecracker in Paris

648
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,087
And a virtuoso
among the pickpockets.

649
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,255
Oh, they had such
a delicate touch,

650
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,458
And from the purses of the
rich they brought forth

651
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,590
Brilliant symphonies
as from a piano.

652
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,546
Your story is a delightful
diversion, my friend.

653
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,052
<i>Mon capitaine?

654
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,430
But one doesn't tell a glib
story with a dry tongue.

655
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,808
You'll find a bottle
of cognac in my cabin.

656
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,312
Thank you. Uh, what
else might I find?

657
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,482
I'll take a chance.

658
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,685
<i>Adieu.

659
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,622
Now, tell me
about yourself.

660
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:55,162
I'm a deserter
of the army of France.

661
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,465
In the last war, at the
age of 16, I enlisted.

662
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,839
3 months later,
I ran away.

663
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,217
I discovered a terrible
thing about myself.

664
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,549
I was a coward.

665
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,351
Later, I went to morocco to
enlist in the foreign legion

666
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:15,022
In an effort to redeem
myself, but I got arrested.

667
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,444
You see, even a deserter and convict
can love his country, captain.

668
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,070
Can you imagine then
my feelings

669
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,776
When during the long years
of my imprisonment,

670
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,613
I had to watch every morning
the tricolor being raised.

671
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:33,826
[Bugle call]

672
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,087
Soon I discovered
that there was another

673
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,548
Who every morning
looked at the flag,

674
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,724
The sight of which
seemed to him like...

675
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,973
Like a benediction,
like a sacrament.

676
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,899
I came to feel a strange
kinship with this man.

677
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:03,356
Because every morning, we did the
same thing at the same time.

678
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,409
The convicts,
we called him Grand-Pere.

679
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,985
<i>He was a libere',
a free man.

680
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,992
That is, he had served
his sentence,

681
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,494
But was not permitted
to leave the colony.

682
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,209
Since cayenne offers
no employment for free men,

683
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,087
The lot of these liberes
was hopeless.

684
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,301
But Grand-Pere was more
resourceful than most.

685
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,598
He became a catcher
of butterflies,

686
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,971
For which the Guyanese
are famous.

687
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,271
The goods he made from these,
he sold to the tourists,

688
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,894
And the butterflies
themselves to collectors.

689
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,235
<i>Thus, franc by franc,
and sous by sous,

690
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,196
Grand-Pere was able to put
together a little sum

691
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,204
For grand-Pere to plan
and to hope.

692
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,287
The same plan and hope
of all of us...

693
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,917
escape.

694
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,464
Hold it, you.

695
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,511
This is a closed road.

696
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,385
We're not guarding
butterflies.

697
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,342
I heard there was a
special big kind up here.

698
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,223
I forgot it was
a toll road.

699
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,521
Hey, these are
cheap cigarettes.

700
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,850
They won't be when you
sell them to the convicts.

701
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,947
Another!

702
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,070
<i>Hi, Grand-Pere.

703
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,321
<i>Bon jour.

704
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,994
How is it with you
and your butterflies?

705
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,162
How is it with you
and your mosquitoes?

706
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,785
I wish they were
pigs of Germans.

707
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,244
What did you say?

708
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,704
Just what I said.

709
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,085
The old man asked you a
civil question, petit.

710
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,172
I said I wish
I was in France

711
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,550
Killing pigs of Germans
instead of mosquitoes.

712
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,974
You mean that you'd fight for
our country if you were free?

713
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,552
Sooner than most,
I swear it.

714
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,559
Not sooner than me.
There is only one thing

715
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,061
I hate more than a guard,
and that's a Nazi.

716
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,233
How about you?

717
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,810
What are you,
a recruiting officer?

718
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,645
Or is this
a cross-Examination?

719
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,653
I'm just asking him.
Well?

720
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,531
I'm a patriot, to
answer your question.

721
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,831
And my friend over there,
Marias, he's a patriot, too.

722
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,953
You see over there
by the guard.

723
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,380
He is very clever. Everything
there is to know about bribery,

724
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,127
Marias knows.

725
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,959
He would be a very useful man
if one were planning an escape.

726
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,547
Maybe.

727
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,410
There is no escape.
Don't talk about it.

728
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,409
It's silly
if you even listen.

729
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,537
The old man just played games
with our mind, that's all.

730
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,869
But I have heard he has money.
Lots of it.

731
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,123
Huh?

732
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,875
Well, that's different.

733
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,797
That's something else again,
eh, Marias?

734
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,375
That would be
different.

735
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,757
You there.

736
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,464
This fellow got lost
in the swamp.

737
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,766
I told him he could spend
the night with you.

738
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,468
Oh, welcome
to this hotel.

739
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,428
We're crowded
already.

740
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,772
Thank you. Thank
you, my friends.

741
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,024
What are you doing here?

742
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,699
I paid the sergeant
for your company,

743
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,322
And I brought you
a present.

744
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,745
What is all this talk
about being lost?

745
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,619
There had to be
an excuse.

746
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,745
You said you would
fight for France,

747
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,001
So she must mean
something to you

748
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,425
In spite of your
being here.

749
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:56,505
I thought it would be nice to drink
together and talk about home.

750
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,305
Oh, that's a crazy idea.

751
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,055
I think about my
home all the time.

752
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,932
My farm
and my old woman.

753
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,184
Yes, a farm is good.

754
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,142
There is nothing better
than the good French soil.

755
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,569
Oh, I'd take Paris
any day.

756
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,066
Montmartre
to Moulin Rouge,

757
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,739
And the women.

758
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,941
The women.

759
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,527
Paris isn't France.

760
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,658
I like
the open country.

761
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,160
Long, wide roads
and green trees.

762
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:29,371
The most beautiful place
in the world.

763
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,672
For me, France will always
be the great tradition.

764
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,001
Versailles,
Joan of Arc,

765
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,507
Statues and
monuments,

766
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,511
Napoleon sleeping in
greatness in the invalides,

767
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,265
Place Vendome.

768
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,345
A tradition that was too
big for a boy of 16

769
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,477
And was ashamed to
find himself a coward.

770
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,651
If it were to cost
my life,

771
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,355
It would be a small price
to pay to redeem myself.

772
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,066
I would fight and die
gladly to make France free.

773
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,400
Who wouldn't?

774
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,953
I'm past 65,

775
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,125
But if I can make sure that
there are 4 Frenchmen at least

776
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,498
Who feel as I do
about our country,

777
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:15,254
Who, if they had the chance,
would fight for France,

778
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,211
If I can convince myself
to believe you, I might...

779
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,420
You might what?

780
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,051
I might, even though
I'm an old man,

781
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,351
Still find a way
to serve my country.

782
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,304
But tell me again,
if you were in France...

783
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,388
We would fight.

784
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,146
But what kind of talk
is this?

785
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,478
We're not in France.
We're in this stinking hole.

786
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,312
What do we do,
grow wings to fly with,

787
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,942
Or do we walk across
the Atlantic?

788
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,615
A canoe might be bought.

789
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,410
A canoe might float down
the river to the sea.

790
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,908
A ship might be boarded...

791
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,364
Listen, old man,
if you're joking with us...

792
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,199
I'm not joking.

793
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,209
I want to be sure
that you're the men.

794
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,087
How many have you
talked to before?

795
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,885
Can I take a chance
on you?

796
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,010
Are you lying to me?

797
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,933
Have you the courage to
beat the river and the sea?

798
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,137
Well, if we haven't,
I know one who has.

799
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,313
And if he would be
with us... You know him.

800
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,982
His name is Matrac.

801
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,354
Can he get us
through the swamp?

802
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,650
That is
the main thing.

803
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,945
I know the swamp
like my own hand,

804
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,522
But the river
and the sea?

805
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,528
Matrac knows the ocean.

806
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,281
He escaped once
in a canoe to Venezuela,

807
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,953
But they sent him back.

808
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,155
But is this man
a patriot?

809
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,991
Yes, he is a patriot.

810
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,294
A greater patriot than any
of us can ever hope to be.

811
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:37,419
I swear it. He fought the Nazis
long before there was a war.

812
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:42,550
It was in 1938, during
the Munich crisis.

813
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,597
Daladier has just returned
by plane from Munich

814
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,971
Where he, a Frenchman,
betrayed France to the enemy.

815
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,677
That's fantastic enough
in all conscience,

816
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,182
But an even more
fantastic thing

817
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,434
Has just happened right
here at the airport.

818
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,605
You getting that?

819
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,149
Go ahead.

820
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,568
Instead of being torn to
pieces by an outraged mob,

821
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,736
The mob welcomed him
home a hero.

822
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,406
It's unbelievable.
From where I'm phoning,

823
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,233
I can see the litter
of flowers on the runway

824
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,910
Where the crowd
pelted him.

825
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,078
Not with stones, mind
you, but with flowers.

826
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,826
It's incredible,
unbelievable.

828

829
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,806
Jean, please get out!

830
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,020

831
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,607
Jean, it's no use!

832
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,166
Everything I worked for,
smashed to bits.

833
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,216
Did you see them,
the police?

834
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,714
The dirty fascist flunkies.

835
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,762
Oh, jean, it may be
hard right now,

836
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,761
But you must remember that
there are still Frenchmen

837
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,137
Who believe in the
things we believe in.

838
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,935
They stood there,
just stood there, watching.

839
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,763
Just to make sure
a good job was done.

840
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,600
Darling, you've been
driving yourself too hard.

841
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,731
You need some rest.

842
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,063
I know... Romilly.

843
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,524
You said you wanted to
go back there someday.

844
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,527
Romilly?

845
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,279
Yes, remember?

846
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,882
Remember where it
was we first met?

847
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,882
Mm-Hmm. Right over there,

848
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,100
Here's the very spot.

849
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,975
You were wearing one of those
big, floppy yellow hats

850
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,350
And a basket on your arm.

851
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,274
Is that all? Must
have been a warm day.

852
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,772
How long has
it been, jean?

853
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,149
Well, when I think
of what's happened,

854
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,026
It seems like a century.

855

Well, don't think
about it.

856

about getting married?

860

Oh, I've thought of it,
jean, very often.

861
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,335
But I had a rival.

pay for riots and killing

You are under

For the crime of
inciting a riot

And for complicity
in the events

998

Well, there
was a letter

999
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,570
From someone very
dear to him at home.

1000
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,948
One of the guards
made a dirty joke

And dropped the letter
in the mud...

1002
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,326

The man I had sworn
was a patriot.

1022

Because of his intense
and fiery nature,

1023
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,637
Imprisonment was
especially bitter to Matrac.

01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,346
I know what the rest
of you are thinking...

1105
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,638
I am the heaviest.

1106
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,557
That's right. Well,
it's hard luck, petit,

1107
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,351
But you're elected.
Isn't he, Matrac?

1108
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,430
What? Leave petit, when we are
going home to kill Germans?

1109
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,560
<i>What do you say
to that, grand-Pere?

1110
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,982
Whoever stays,
it can't be him.

1111
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,685
But he weighs more
than any of us.

1112
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,236
So he does.

1113
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,279
Speak up, grand-Pere.
It's your canoe.

1114
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,357
That's right. If it
wasn't for grand-Pere,

1115
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:18,691
None of us
would be going.

1116
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,947
And who did he
speak to first?

1117
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,368
Not to you. You
weren't even there.

1118
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:22,786
What's that got
to do with it?

1119
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,330
I'm smaller
than any of you.

1120
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,749
Even Gerou weighs a good
10 pounds more than I do.

1121
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,792
You weigh enough to lighten
the canoe all that's needed.

1122
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,461
Yeah? And who got
the word to Matrac?

1123
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,532
Shut up,
the bunch of you.

1124

of you with him.

What's the idea?

1132
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:51,775
Well, you see, lads,
it's this way.

1133
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:57,356
For 35 years, I've thought that the
one hope of my life was to escape.

1134
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,191
Yeah, that's
what I've thought.

1135
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,404
And when this came,
it looked like my last chance.

1136
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,785
I'd never have another.

1137
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,208
But when it gets
right down to it,

1138
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,457
I suddenly find that
I am afraid of the sea.

1139
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:16,508
Yeah, I'm scared.
That's the plain truth.

1140
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,802
I thought I'd have enough
courage to make this voyage,

1141
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,721
But... I see now,
I haven't.

grand-Pere.

You, a coward?

1144
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,518
I would swap my guts
for yours any day.

1145
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:30,221
All right, maybe I
could stand the voyage,

1146
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,648
If it came
right down to it,

1147
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,819
But the fact is...
I've changed my mind.

1148
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,440
I don't want to go.

1149
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,148
This place is kind
of a home to me now.

1150
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,232
I'd miss it.

goes and me that stays.

I'm past 65.
I'm too old to fight.

That was the idea of
getting away, wasn't it?

Or was it?

1161

I've got your promise
on that.

1162

I think I'd like to have
it again, kind of formal.

But words like you would
speak in church maybe.

You want us to
say our beads?

What words?

I don't exactly know,
when it comes down to it.

1169

I'll have to make them up

us turn back now...

01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:41,986
To a man, I think.

1260
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,617
To a man, except Matrac,

1261
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:47,245
And where he leads,
they follow.

1262
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,201
Did you see him
when we got the news?

1263
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,208
I'm not too sure of him.

1264
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,834
I'd stake my life
on him.

1265
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,882
I don't know why, but
I feel I know my men.

1266
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,302
At heart, he's a Frenchman...
more than any of them,

1267
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,880
More than any of us
perhaps.

1268
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,841
I'll have to take
your word for it.

1269
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,346
I think you can.

1270
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,233
Captain Fresene.

1271
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:29,250
Can I ask you
something, sir?

1272
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,872
What is it?

1273
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,874
Can you persuade
captain Marlowe

1274
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,876
To reach Marseille
at night?

1275
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,047
Marseille?
Why do you ask?

1276
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,670
So I can swim ashore.

1277
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,469
I don't trust
this major Duval.

1278
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,296
Yes? Why not?

1279
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,926
He'll radio the police.

1280
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,883
I've been fighting his kind
all my life.

1281
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,513
I know what to expect.

1282
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,311
There are many ways to serve
your country, Matrac.

1283
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,684
What if you didn't
reach Marseille?

1284
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,266
I've got to reach Marseille.

1285
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,602
I don't care
about my country.

1286
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,278
The France you and I loved
is dead, captain.

1287
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,947
She's been dying
for a long time.

1288
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,491
I saw her die in the
Rhineland and in Munich.

1289
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:03,908
Now that her death
is complete,

1290
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,282
I can stop lying
and tell the truth.

1291
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,285
I'm trying to
get back to a woman.

1292
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,786
I never intended to fight.

1293
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:13,290
I know about Paula and all
that you've suffered,

1294
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:16,794
But the France that you and
I love, Matrac, is at war.

1295
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:20,126
If you won't fight, why
should we help you escape?

1296
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,713
I'll leave that
to your conscience.

1297
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:27,676
Your wife is waiting for
the man who went away,

1298
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,885
The man who
loved his country...

1299
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,347
the patriot.

1300
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,648
Would you betray
such a woman?

1301
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,271
I leave that
to your conscience.

1302
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,530
Fresene: imperceptibly,
we swung northward,

1303
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,332
<i>Marking a course that would take
the Ville de Nancy to England.

1304
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,377
But could
the secret be kept?

1305
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,454
On the morning
of June the 26th,

1306
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,461
I was awakened
by the profound silence

1307
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,918
Which had settled
over the ship.

1308
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,220
I attributed this to the
old cause: engine trouble,

1309
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,175
And thought no more about it except to
wonder how long we'd be adrift this time.

1310
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,975
Fortunately,
the sea was calm.

1311
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,769
I rang for the mess boy.

1312
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,974
As yet, I had no suspicion
that anything was wrong.

1313
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,980
Then I noticed my pistol was
missing from its holster.

1314
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,416
<i>Restez I.

1315
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,462

Who locked my door?

1321
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,633
I did, sir.

1322
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:51,683
For what reason?

1323
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,010
Commandant Duval's
orders.

1324

You're to come with me.

1325

Where's
captain Marlowe?

1326
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,515
You'll see him, sir.

1327
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,613
Go on.

1328
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,507
Get them down below.

On deck.

1330

Come on!

1331

What the devil
is the meaning of this?

1332
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,180
Captain Marlowe, I understand
our course has been changed.

1333
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,802
Have you received
new orders?

1334
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:13,928
That's my business, sir.

1335
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:14,858
I've studied your chart.

1336
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,344
We're no longer heading
for Marseille.

1337
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,553
Correct, sir.

1338
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,434
For what reason?
On our present course,

1339
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,481
We run the greatest risk of being
picked up by a British destroyer.

1340
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,525
You consider that
such a calamity?

1341
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,102
I will consider it a great
misfortune, certainly.

1342
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,312
France has no ships
to spare for England.

1343
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,273
You would prefer the Germans
to have it perhaps?

1344
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,949
I prefer to be a realist.

1345
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,072
We've argued these matters
before, captain Marlowe.

1346
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:36,531
Now we will settle them with the only
argument that means anything: force!

1347
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:39,708
Take him down
with the rest.

1348
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:54,261
Men, a new order
has been born in Europe.

1349
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,512
France has been
given the privilege

1350
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,139
Of becoming
a part of it.

1351
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,846
The watchword of this
new order is discipline.

1352
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,523
From now on, you will navigate
this ship under my command

1353
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,146
Until we
reach Marseille.

1354
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,522
This is piracy,
Duval.

1355
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,149
Your action is treason.

1356
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,696
I'm willing to let both
questions be decided

1357
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,193
By the authorities
at home,

1358
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,820
But I'm
a reasonable man.

1359
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,527
If I give you
your liberty,

1360
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,078
Will you give me
your word of honor

1361
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,200
To take this ship
back to Marseille?

1362
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,530
Certainly not!

1363
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:19,740
You may control the ship,

1364
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,666
But you'll never
bring her into port.

1365
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,665
No decent seaman
would serve you.

1366
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,792
The men will
do well to consider.

1367
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:28,840
Those who cooperate will be
given rewards and security

1368
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,133
In the new France.

1369

I speak especially
to you convicts.

To every man who helps bring
this ship to Marseille,

1371
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,216

favor of the Vichy government.
