I would ask him why Tenorio
was alive instead of Narciso?

Why he had allowed evil
to happen?

Why it went unpunished?

attended more than just the body.

And no road was too long for her

understand what they are,

1132
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,038
so we call 'em evil.

1133
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,702
Like, when Lucas, he...
He got sick,

1134
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:59,178
and we were all afraid.

1135
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,811
But Ultima, she wasn't afraid,

1136
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,441
she understood what was wrong.

1137
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,845
But, I took the Holy Communion

1138
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,252
because I wanted to understand.

1139
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:11,616
Understanding doesn't
come that easy, Tony.

1140
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,558
Doesn't God give understanding?

1141
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:18,428
(SIGHING)

1142
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,126
Understanding comes with life.

1143
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:27,941
As a man grows,
he sees life and death.

1144
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,873
He's happy, he's sad, he works,

1145
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:33,743
he plays, he meets people.

1146
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,780
Sometimes it takes a whole
lifetime to acquire understanding.

1147
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:46,125
But, mijo, in the end,

1148
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:53,161
understanding simply means to have
sympathy, sympathy for people, yeah?

1149
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:54,695
And Ultima...

1150
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,229
Ultima has sympathy for people.

1151
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,171
But with her, mijo,

1152
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:04,735
with her it's so complete that she
can touch their souls and cure them.

1153
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:09,249
That's her magic?
(AGREES IN SPANISH)

1154
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,781
And in all this world

1155
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,416
no greater magic can exist.

1156
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:18,987
(CHUCKLES)

1157
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,958
ADULT ANTONIO: All summer
I worked alongside my uncles.

1158
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:33,363
I watched the care and the respect
they showed the earth and the plants.

1159
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:38,342
Only Ultima showed such reverence
for the land and its offerings.

1160
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,342
I learned that the phases of the
moon not only ruled the planting,

1161
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:46,213
but almost every part
of their lives.

1162
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,351
That's why they were Lunas.

1163
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:55,258
They would not gather plants or save next
year's seeds until the moon said so.

1164
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,365
I thought of my father too.

1165
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,936
His wild and restless spirit,

1166
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,133
that forever
reached out somewhere.

1167
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,275
I didn't know if his or my mother's
blood would claim me in the end.

1168
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:17,247
But the bad dreams that had
plagued me, did not come.

1169
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:39,463
Antonio! A letter
from your mother!

1170
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:53,145
They'll come for you
in a few days.

1171
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:55,417
School starts early this year.

1172
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,424
It comes early every year.

1173
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,061
Your mother says
you do well in school.

1174
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,691
You like school?
Yes, I like it.

1175
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:07,464
Well, that's good.

1176
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:09,901
A man of learning can go
far in this world, Antonio.

1177
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,468
It makes us all very proud.

1178
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,641
It's been a long time since
there was an educated Luna.

1179
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,437
I'm Marez.

1180
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,577
(CHUCKLING) That's right.

1181
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,077
You're a Marez first,
and then Luna.

1182
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,347
But I just wanted
to say that, ah,

1183
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,942
that we're very pleased
with your work.

1184
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,585
We know that you must choose
what you'll do as a man,

1185
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,051
but if you ever decide
to become a farmer,

1186
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:35,152
you'll be welcome here.

1187
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,628
This earth that was your
mother's will be yours.

1188
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,792
MAN: Pedro, can I
see you a minute?

1189
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:46,265
There's trouble in town.

Something's come up, so we'll drive
you home today after supper!

1193
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,211
There's only a few hours
of work left to do,

1194
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,551
so, go to your grandfather's
house and pack your clothes.

1195
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,791
Hey, if anyone asks
why you're back early,

1196
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:07,054
tell 'em you got time off for
being such a good worker.

1197
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,555
Okay, tío.

Eso vieja bruja has killed
another of my daughters!

1202
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:06,784
I'll avenge her death tonight!

1203
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,448
Do you hear me?

1204
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,990
Don't you crawl about!

1205
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:18,095
The coyotes will have sport
when they devour you tonight!

You, hijo de la bruja!

1207
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,871
ADULT ANTONIO: My uncles
had betrayed Ultima before,

1208
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:29,167
so I ran to save her myself.

1209
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:36,380
I ran to save the spirit

1210
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:40,284
that protected us from the evil
that men brought to our hills.

1211
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:44,419
That had been there when the
heavens looked on in silence.

1212
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:49,287
I ran from the river
and took to the llano.

It's dead.

1232

Not dead.

When I was a child,

1236

a wise old man gave me the owl

1237

as a... As a bond
to the time

and harmony of the universe.

it passes away.

1243

into the hills,

1247
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,484
and bury it at a...

1248

ADULT ANTONIO: My father
built a fine pine coffin,

1260
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:30,669
and people came from miles
around to mourn La Grande,

1261
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:33,738
her cures and her magic.

1262
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:38,138
But, I knew to look
beyond their sadness.

1263
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:43,009
Ultima taught us how to make
strength from our experiences.

1264
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,176
To hold wonder in our lives.

1265
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:50,551
She taught us that the eternal
soul expands by embracing life,

1266
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:54,116
and all that happens,
both good and evil.

No, I did not cry.

Her voice is everywhere.
