1
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,957
<i>My name is Quintus Dias.</i>

2
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,877
<i>I'm a soldier of Rome.</i>

3
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,072
<i>And this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>

4
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,191
<i>Two years on the frontier.</i>

5
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,070
<i>This place is the arsehole of the world.</i>

6
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,031
<i>Even the land wants us dead.</i>

7
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,594
Centurion Dias, it's too damn cold
to be standing watch.

8
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,190
It's not my watch.
I'm just wondering what's out there.

9
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,199
The patrol returns at dawn.
You should get some sleep.

10
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,472
<i>The longer we stay, the deeper the cold
and damp soaks into our bones.</i>

11
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,559
<i>And the rain makes way only
for the stinging bite of the north wind.</i>

12
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
<i>While we lose brave men
to foot rot and frostbite,</i>

13
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,999
<i>the Pict king Gorlacon</i>

14
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,953
<i>sends his war parties
to raid along the frontier at will.</i>

15
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,559
- Gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

16
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,591
A cold night on the front.

17
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,160
<i>My father believed
that to truly defeat an enemy,</i>

18
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,316
<i>you must know him better than yourself.</i>

19
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,271
<i>I know this enemy well.</i>

20
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,279
<i>They play only to their strengths,
and will not be drawn into open combat.</i>

21
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,834
<i>Instead, they pick at the scab
until we bleed,</i>

22
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,757
<i>hiding in the shadows like animals,</i>

23
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,759
<i>striking hard and fast
then falling back into the night.</i>

24
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,835
<i>Come the dawn, we count our losses
and so the earth with our dead.</i>

25
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,920
<i>This is a new kind of war,
a war without honour, without end.</i>

26
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,792
{Urine trickles}

27
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,474
- {Bell rings}
- {Man} Come on! Come on!

28
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,556
{Shouting}

29
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,837
Marcus, ride to Agricola!

30
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,191
Gate. Move!

31
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,876
Move, soldier!

32
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,313
- Gratus.
- Save yourself.

33
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,633
{Roars}

34
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,915
{in Peckish}

35
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,235
{Crowd} Virilus! Virilus!

36
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,311
{Chanting continues}

37
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,071
{Cheering}

38
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,114
The winner.

39
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,232
- That's the way!
- Yes!

40
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,915
Again!

41
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,592
Enough!

42
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,393
You put up a good fight,
now you drink with me.

43
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,397
Septus, more ale.

44
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,076
Again, Virilus.

45
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,395
You're a drunk. An ugly drunk.

46
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,397
{Laughter}

47
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,077
And not too bright.

48
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,428
Isn't ten times enough
to know when you're beaten?

49
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,437
Damn you! Again!

50
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,350
Once more!

51
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,234
Septus, your ruling.
And watch my flank.

52
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,758
Come on!

53
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,711
Come on!

54
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,833
- {Chanting} Virilus! Virilus! Virilus!
- You beat him.

55
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,552
Virilus. Virilus.

56
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,399
Sore loser.

57
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,517
Septus?

58
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,437
What are you waiting for, an order?

59
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,278
Get stuck in there!

60
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,231
Damn, that'll sober a man up quick!

61
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,873
When will people learn
not to fuck with the Ninth?

62
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,309
Some say it's irregular for you to be
seen drinking with the men of the Legion.

63
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,238
Septus, my old friend, they forget.
I am a man of the Legion.

64
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,310
- Soldier, have you been fighting?
- Fighting is my job.

65
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,078
I have a message for your general.

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,317
Now, point me in his direction
before I have you flogged.

67
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,668
Who are you?

68
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,314
I'm the personal envoy
of Governor Agricola.

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,119
I suggest you get down off that horse
and give me your message

70
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,673
before I have you flogged!

71
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,917
General, sir!
It would be my pleasure.

72
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,399
All leave is cancelled.

73
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,830
Agricola is mobilising the Ninth.
We're going to war, Septus.

74
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,191
Alert the senior legates to break camp
and prepare the men.

75
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,589
- Sorry, General, sir...
- Return to Agricola at once.

76
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,075
- Tell him we rode out within the hour.
- Yes, General.

77
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,876
{Shouting and jeering}

78
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,235
Bastard!

79
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,591
Aeron. {Speaks Peckish}

80
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,679
<i>{Quintus} Gorlacon. He was a farmer
until his wife was killed.</i>

81
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,792
<i>Then he put down the plough
and took up the sword.</i>

82
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,950
<i>He changed the way the Picts fought.
It worked.</i>

83
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,038
<i>He turned the tide,
so they made him king.</i>

84
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,431
{Jeering}

85
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,830
What does Agricola intend
for my people?

86
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,111
- Damn you, Pict!
- When will he send his armies north?

87
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,038
I am a soldier of Rome! I will not yield!

88
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,511
{Gorlacon speaks Peckish}

89
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,391
Rome will make you bleed for this.

90
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,397
You first, Centurion.

91
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,112
{Groans}

92
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,751
{Door slams}

93
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,470
I don't care how you do it
but wipe them out.

94
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,318
And bring Gorlacon before me in chains.

95
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,115
Governor, you're the politician,
I'm just a simple soldier.

96
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,310
But I'm not so simple that I can't see
you're looking for a way back to Rome.

97
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,877
My bones ache for Rome.
This place is the graveyard of ambition.

98
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,752
And men.

99
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,270
And I won't sacrifice mine
to be pawns in your game.

100
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,072
I see.

101
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,430
Let us be frank, General.

102
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,438
The conquest of Britain is a lost cause.

103
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,917
With one bold stroke,
we could change all that.

104
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,112
With the Ninth Legion at your command,
we can crush this enemy.

105
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,199
You and your men could retire
with wealth and honour.

106
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,993
My men have honour enough.

107
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,998
Enough to disobey a direct order?

108
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,074
Well...

109
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,799
To kill the snake,
you have to cut off its head.

110
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,831
I need to find Gorlacon.

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,148
For that, I have someone special in mind.

112
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,873
{Screams}

113
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,840
General Virilus, meet Etain,
my Brigantes tracker.

114
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,033
Can't speak a word, but she can hunt
anything over any terrain.

115
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,037
I swear she's part wolf.

116
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,948
I apologise for the theatrics,
but I wanted to prove a point.

117
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,152
Slaves cost nothing.
Trust is priceless.

118
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,271
I don't know whether to fight her or...

119
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,197
She's mute, not deaf!

120
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,314
- I have my own scouts.
- {Agricola} Not like her!

121
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,910
She knows the Picts. Knows their ways,
knows their hideaways.

122
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,996
She will guide you into the mountains.

123
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,997
{Wind howling}

124
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,751
{Distant shouts}

125
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,553
{Gasps}

126
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,390
{Thunder rumbles}

127
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,711
What's she sitting over there for?

128
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,400
- She's been looking at you all night.
- I've spotted it.

129
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,272
Can't take her eyes off you.

130
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,073
Come on, you.
{Kissing noises}

131
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,191
She's speechless, you daft bastard.

132
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,915
She's got no tongue in her head, you fool.
I wouldn't get too close.

133
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,913
No tongue, that's perfect,
she'll have... more room for this.

134
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,554
- {Septus} You be careful.
- Oh!

135
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,429
{Bathos} I think that's Pict for "fuck off".

136
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,790
She must be a good scout
if she can find your cock.

137
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,558
I think it's love.

138
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,951
I'll have a go with the mutt this time.

139
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,672
{Laughter}

140
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,072
{Whooping cries}

141
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,239
{Virilus} Report.

142
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,828
Three Pict riders and another,
a prisoner, on foot.

143
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,757
I think he might be Roman.

144
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,718
{Virilus} Centurion Remus,
take the column!

145
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,432
{Shouting in Peckish}

146
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,630
{Speaks in Peckish}

147
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,798
{Horse whinnies}

148
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,558
{Yells}

149
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,118
Stay down! Stay down!

150
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,958
Stay down!

151
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,911
We'll get nothing out of him.

152
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,077
We can't take prisoners on the march.
You know what to do.

153
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,952
Head or ship?

154
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,036
Head.

155
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,837
I win.

156
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,871
Sorry, mate. Orders are orders.

157
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,075
Hey?

158
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,791
Thank the gods you found me.

159
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,070
Not the gods you should thank. It's her.

160
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,033
Etain, our Pict scout. She found you.

161
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,997
What's your name, soldier?

162
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,837
I'm Quintus Dias.

163
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,430
Second in Command.
Inch-tuth-il frontier garrison.

164
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,835
Well, sorry we couldn't get here sooner.

165
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,956
- Are you the relief column?
- Not quite.

166
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,548
I'm Titus Flavius Virilus,
Commander of the Ninth Legion.

167
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,591
We've come here looking for a fight.

168
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,397
Then you'll get one.

169
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,709
- General.
- Centurion Dias.

170
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,799
Ha! Now you look like a Roman.
How do you feel?

171
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,434
Cuts and bruises, sir.
Nothing that won't heal in time.

172
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,348
Well, sometimes there are scars
that cannot be seen.

173
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,356
You escaped the clutches of Gorlacon,

174
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,192
but I must ask you to return with us
into the lion's den.

175
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,276
Best to get back into the fight, General.

176
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,960
- Spoken like a soldier.
- Gladiator.

177
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,557
My father was Scipio Dias.

178
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,752
I saw him win the fight
that earned him his freedom.

179
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,711
He was magnificent.

180
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,435
He taught me how to fight,
when to choose my battles.

181
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,313
Come meet the men.

182
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,793
- Septus.
- Sir?

183
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,629
Get this man a drink.
I think he deserves it.

184
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,750
Come and join us. Be warm.
Have a well-earned drink.

185
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,915
Thank you.

186
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,919
Tomorrow you ride by my side.

187
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,316
Perhaps you can teach me something
about Pict hospitality.

188
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,439
- Thax. Bathos.
- Sir.

189
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,199
- Septus, I'll be doing my rounds.
- Sir.

190
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,198
- Evening, General.
- I can't understand a word of these Picts.

191
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,550
- If they ever catch me, I'm fucked!
- {Laughter}

192
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,433
I've never seen a general
so beloved of his men.

193
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,269
Well, in training he is our scholar,
at the feast he is our father,

194
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,834
in the ranks he is our brother.

195
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,714
And in battle he is the god we pray
to save our souls.

196
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,435
- Where did you read that?
- It's written on the shithouse wall, sir.

197
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,075
- Probably wrote it himself.
- He's a ruthless, reckless bastard.

198
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,590
And I'd die for him without hesitation.

199
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,399
{Virilus} It's a trap!

200
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,513
{Septus} Column! Form up! Form up!

201
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,837
Quickly! Come on!

202
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,190
Dismount! Get the horses to the rear!

203
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,790
Tight! Quickly!

204
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,314
Steady, boys. Shields!

205
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,113
Watching!

206
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,912
{Horns blowing}

207
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,678
{War cries}

208
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,670
{Septus} Whatever comes out
of that mist, lads, you will hold the line.

209
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,397
{Horns blow}

210
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,317
Quintus, ride to the rear.

211
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,556
Tell Centurion Remus
to pull the column back.

212
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,911
- Make a hole.
- {Septus} Keep watching!

213
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,712
Get ready!

214
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,876
{Distant war cries}

215
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,115
Watching.

216
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,991
{Rumbling}

217
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,871
Hold the line!

218
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,351
{Screaming}

219
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,517
{War cries}

220
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,232
Stand tall!

221
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,231
- Quintus.
- Bathos.

222
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,000
- You made it.
- Yeah. This man saved my life.

223
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,712
Brick, here.

224
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,917
- The General?
- No.

225
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,837
We've got to move.

226
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,552
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

227
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,557
Come on.

228
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,591
Let's get moving.

229
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,512
<i>{Quintus} In the chaos of battle,</i>

230
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,553
<i>when the ground beneath your feet
is a slurry of blood, puke, piss,</i>

231
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,831
<i>and the entrails of friends
and enemies alike,</i>

232
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,952
<i>it's easy to turn to the gods for salvation.</i>

233
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,878
<i>But it's soldiers who do the fighting
and soldiers who do the dying.</i>

234
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,958
<i>And the gods never get their feet wet.</i>

235
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,028
{Twig snaps}

236
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,039
- Thax.
- Thank the gods some of us made it.

237
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,832
Only you?

238
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,591
Macros, second cohort.

239
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,950
Leonidas, junior scout and peltast.

240
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,712
- Are we all that's left?
- We were outsmarted.

241
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
That's all. Time to go home.

242
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,557
We need to find the General's body.
He deserves a nobler tomb than this.

243
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,511
The General's still alive.

244
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,835
- Are you sure?
- I saw them take him away in chains.

245
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,552
- Which way?
- North.

246
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,910
- Then we follow north.
- You would go after the Picts?

247
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,157
They'll have patrols sweeping
these forests for survivors.

248
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,750
- We might as well slit our throats.
- If the General's alive, it's our duty.

249
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,869
Yaargh!

250
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,158
- Where did you come from?
- From the kitchens.

251
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,437
Good work, soldier.

252
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,832
My name's Tarak.

253
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,712
I'm not a soldier, I'm a cook.

254
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,273
Not anymore.

255
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,755
Scavenge what you can,
food supplies, weapons.

256
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,757
Ditch your armour. We travel light.

257
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,796
Shit! That Macros can move.

258
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,036
{Tarak} He used to be a marathon runner
before he joined up.

259
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,232
- How do you know that?
- We make the food, we know everything.

260
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,069
Aargh!

261
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,877
{Horses whinny in distance}

262
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,911
Take cover.

263
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,269
Aargh!

264
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,432
{Screams}

265
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,313
Aargh!

266
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,631
{Metal clinks}

267
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,432
{Shouting in Peckish}

268
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,028
I knew we should never have trusted
that bitch.

269
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,796
I know where they've taken the General.

270
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,831
Move out.

271
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,837
This way. The cave.

272
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,598
Get up those mountains. Get up!

273
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,150
{Bathos} Here, some food.

274
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,759
No!

275
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,314
Death Caps. They can kill you in minutes.

276
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,156
To the untrained eye, they look similar
to these, which are delicious.

277
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,915
Thanks.

278
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,316
Tarak. It's Assyrian, right?

279
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,192
Yes.

280
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,595
But it's not my real name.
It was given to me.

281
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,109
- What's your real name?
- I doubt you could pronounce it.

282
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,959
It's from the mountains of
the Hindu Kush where I was born.

283
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,992
Leonidas, right?

284
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,793
- Greek father, sir.
- Move closer to the fire.

285
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,438
- Where are you from, Bathos?
- I'm from the army.

286
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,279
It's all I've ever known.

287
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,596
They picked me up from the street,
trained me, told me I could better myself.

288
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,639
So, tell me, Bathos.
Do you feel better or worse?

289
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,911
Macros?

290
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,555
I escaped with my life
by running from Numidia.

291
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,639
Didn't stop until I reached Greece.
Then I ran for sport.

292
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,955
Now I'm running for my life again.

293
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,991
We're all a long way from home.

294
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,194
- This was supposed to be my last tour.
- Still could be.

295
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,268
Had my eye on a farm in Tuscany,
where the sun warms the skin.

296
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,753
Brick...

297
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,870
What kind of name is that, anyway?

298
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,390
Short, sir... for Ubrickulius.

299
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,431
{Chuckling}

300
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,197
Your mother must have been... wise.

301
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,153
- She was a fucking comedian.
- {Laughter}

302
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,711
{Quintus} "Brick" it is, then.

303
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,036
Get some sleep. I'll stand first watch.

304
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,876
- General.
- Where are my men?

305
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,672
With your gods.

306
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,712
Traitor!

307
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,597
She would answer your charge
but she cannot speak. Do you know why?

308
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,474
She was a child
when she came to us seeking sanctuary.

309
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,673
Her own village had been slaughtered
as punishment for resisting Roman rule.

310
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,793
To set an example,
they burnt out her father's eyes.

311
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,151
They raped her mother
until she was begging to die.

312
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,350
Etain was forced to watch...

313
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,197
...before she too was raped.

314
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,949
And finally they cut out her tongue
that she may not speak ill

315
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,389
of the bloody Roman Empire.

316
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,832
She fled north
and came to us for shelter.

317
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,599
We raised her
and made her one of our own.

318
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,280
And when she came of age,
we sent her back to you,

319
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,155
to feign allegiance
and deliver you into our hands.

320
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,111
{Speaks Peckish}

321

{Grunts}

322
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,715
{Quintus} The army is still dispersed.

323
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,751
When it's dark, we go in.

324
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,111
{Muffled cry}

325
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,839
Come.

326
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,075
Urgh!

327
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,115
Come on.

328
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,796
Brick, Bathos, with me.
The rest of you, watch the perimeter.

329
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,753
General.

330
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,952
- The Legion?
- Only myself and a small cohort remain.

331
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,551
Oh, fuck.

332
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,913
{Straining}

333
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,589
Oh, shit.

334
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,958
- Come on.
- {Wood splinters}

335
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,752
Leave me.

336
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,956
{Muffled cry}

337
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,312
Shut up.

338
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,791
- {Bathos} We need an axe.
- Leave!

339
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,319
We will not abandon you, sir.

340
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,352
What's left of the Legion
is yours to command. Now go.

341
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,271
We have to leave.

342
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,872
Go now!

343
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,916
Get them home.

344
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,711
That's for the Ninth.

345
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,679
Where's Thax?

346
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,791
Had to take care of a small problem.

347
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,150
I've got the General's helmet.
Where is he?

348
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,191
We couldn't free him. Come on.

349
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,991
We came all this way for nothing!

350
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,119
Fuck.

351
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,957
See what you have done?

352
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,517
Before you die, know that the men
who did this will not live to tell your tale.

353
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,595
Well, let's get on with it, then.

354
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,950
Your Roman friends should have known
cold iron does not bend. It breaks.

355
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,990
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you fear me?

356
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,111
No man brave enough?

357
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,553
{Scoffs}

358
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,837
Let's see what you're made of...
she-wolf.

359
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,837
{Cheering}

360
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,230
{Roars}

361
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,316
{Cry echoes}

362
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,439
{Bathos} Go!

363
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,356
{Coughing}

364
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,318
{Quintus} Come on. We need to keep
moving while we have the lead.

365
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,557
- On foot, over this?
- Where they may hesitate, we must go.

366
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,276
We keep moving. North.

367
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,231
But our lines are to the south.

368
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,794
And that's where
they'll be looking for us.

369
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,108
Look... we can't outrun them.

370
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,754
So we have to outsmart them.

371
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,829
We head north, throw them off our trail,
then double back, west, then south.

372
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,475
It may take days, even weeks.

373
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,390
But we're so far behind enemy lines,
it's our only chance of getting home.

374
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,074
Come on!

375
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,990
You'll be needing this, then, Centurion.

376
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,073
{Shouting in Peckish}

377
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,072
<i>{Quintus} When the Picts
come after you, they never stop.</i>

378
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,751
<i>They can run for hours, ride for days.
They barely eat and rarely sleep.</i>

379
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,796
<i>Etain, like the wolf,
has learned to hunt from birth.</i>

380
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,751
<i>It is part sense, part instinct.</i>

381
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,713
<i>She can read the terrain,
search for signs of passing,</i>

382
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,877
<i>run her quarry to ground
and close in for the kill.</i>

383
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,711
<i>Now she hunts Romans.</i>

384
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,311
<i>Now we are the prey.</i>

385
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,437
{Quintus} Move! Keep moving!

386
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,638
{Groans} Stop!

387
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,789
- Leo, we've got to keep moving!
- No. We need to rest.

388
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,514
- I can't go on, I'm too cold.
- Come, take him.

389
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,598
Brick, find shelter,
anywhere out of this wind.

390
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,631
{Bathos} Enough. Help me.

391
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,789
He's slowing us down. Just say the word
and I'll take care of it.

392
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,677
We live united or die divided...
starting with you.

You can stick this out if you want,

00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,197
but first chance I get,
I'm taking care of myself.

in the blue woad,</i>

<i>To the Picts,
it means they'd sooner die than fail.</i>

there is no turning back.</i>

It's not magic, she's a tracker.
And she's downwind of us.

- What's happening?
- They're making camp across the valley.

- Bathos!
- They had the same idea as you.

475
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,918
They're not defending their lives
or their country any more.

476

They've sworn a blood vengeance
against us.

And they won't rest...

478

and beg?

00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,673
- I'm finished. It's hopeless.
- Hopeless?

481
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,155
Hopeless is what they sing songs about,
write poems about.

482
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,590
Hopeless is the stuff of legend, Bathos.
And being a legend will get you laid.

483
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,199
{Laughter}

484
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,679
What do I have to do?

485
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,189
Keep moving, while we still have
darkness on our side.

486
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,074
The gods have forsaken us.
We make our own chances now.

487
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,113
{Wolf howls}

488
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,671
{Panting}

489
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,950
{Wolves snarling}

490
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,951
{Wolves barking}

491
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,795
Aargh!

492
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,598
Macros. Macros.

493
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,951
I... I can't keep up.

494
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,031
I can't keep up.

495
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,711
{Screams}

496
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,868
Macros, at least this way,
one of us will make it.

497
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,798
- Bastard!
- Don't cry out, Macros.

498
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,990
They'll end it quicker
if you don't cry out.

499
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,197
Don't leave me! Thax!

500
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,878
Thax!

501
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,073
{Panting}

502
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,428
Come on!

503
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,196
We should give this place a wide berth.

504
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,077
We need food and a place to rest.

505
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,071
Where the hell are we now?

506
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,992
- I'll get some water. Stay alert.
- Yeah.

507
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,792
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa!

508
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,517
Brick, go back inside.

509
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,517
Go back inside now.

510
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,551
I'll leave you to it, then.

511
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,432
You speak my language.

512
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,432
Are you from the garrison?

513
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,120
I thought you'd stopped
coming up this far north.

514
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,071
Garrison? What garrison?

515
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,714
- Two days south of here.
- They come here?

516
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,831
How do you think I know your language?

517
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,440
I do what I can to discourage them.

518
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,120
They think I'm a necromancer...

519
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,837
...and they leave me alone.

520
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,110
It usually works on the others.

521
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,515
Why not you?

522
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,154
We're too tired to be afraid.

523
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,919
We were 3,000 and now we are three.

524
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,598
Here.

525
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,194
Brick, put the fucking knife down.

526
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,517
Bathos, there's a Roman garrison
two days from here.

527
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,154
It must be the Western Frontier Post
at Mentieth.

528
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,998
Two days?

529
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,191
Let's take a look at your friend.

530
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,833
Quintus, what's she doing?

531
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,837
She's a Pict and a woman...

532
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,520
Two good reasons not to trust her!

533
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,958
{Groans}

534
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,357
Right, that'll stop the bleeding.

535
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,397
{Whispers} Death caps?

536
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,712
Smells good.

537
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,077
Well, how's your leg?
Has our witch worked her magic?

538
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,236
{Whispers} Quintus, the mushrooms.

539
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,954
- What?
- She's trying to poison us.

540
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,311
Why heal your leg, only to kill you?

541
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,311
Death caps have white gills.

542
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,991
It pays to know your mushrooms.

543
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,673
Good.

544
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,071
It's really good.

545
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,309
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

546
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,117
{Owl hoots}

547
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,236
Your men are very nervous.

548
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,591
They ought to be.

549
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,950
A demon stalks us day and night.

550
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,195
A demon?

551
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,596
They call her Etain.

552
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,554
You know her?

553
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,071
If Etain is hunting you,
you might as well be dead already.

554
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,395
That's comforting.

555
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,670
Her soul is an empty vessel.

556
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,114
Only Roman blood can fill it.

557
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,317
{Shrieks}

558
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,831
Where's Arianne?

559
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,030
She went to fetch us some breakfast.

560
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,031
Are you OK?

561
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,311
{Urinates into stream}

562
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,991
Is that for bait?

563
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,635
Where I come from its considered rude
to interrupt a man midflow.

564
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,118
Where I come from its considered
only fair to warn a man

565
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,037
when he's pissing on his breakfast.

566
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,111
Good point.

567
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,071
Must've been a storm
in the hills last night.

568
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,758
{Wings flutter}

569
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,757
Come on!

570
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,477
- Trouble.
- Let's get out of here. Bathos.

571
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,034
- {Groans}
- Too late for that.

572
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,995
Hide in the grain store
and don't make a sound.

573
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,071
{Whinnying horses}

574
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,553
We put you in too much danger.
We'll leave.

575
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,195
Leave now and she'll have you gutted
and skinned before nightfall.

576
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,593
Stay until morning,
and your friend will be fit to travel.

577
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,791
These are your people.

578
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,591
They are not my people.

579
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,870
Not since Gorlacon accused me
of witchery and gave me this...

580
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,155
...to mark me as an outcast,

581
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,158
and banished me
to live out my days here, alone.

582
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,794
<i>{Quintus} What cruel devices
does fate yet have in store for us?</i>

583
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,952
<i>To find sanctuary
in the house of our enemy.</i>

584
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,551
<i>Is she angel...</i>

585
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,398
<i>... or devil?</i>

586
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,799
- Clear.
- All right.

587
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,831
Get some rest.

588
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,354
I'm a cantankerous old soldier...

589
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,511
...but not too stubborn
to admit when I'm wrong.

590
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,956
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

591
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,551
There it is.

592
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,397
{Groans}

593
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,514
- It's getting cold.
- Thank you.

594
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,750
You've given us the shelter of your home,
the warmth of your fire,

595
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,391
and risked your life for us.

596
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,033
Why?

597
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,636
I owe allegiance to no man,
but to whom I choose.

598
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,716
Here's some food for the journey.

599
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,313
Thank you.

600
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,671
Good luck, Roman.

601
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,838
Good luck, witch.

602
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,197
{Shrieking}

603
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,511
- {Groans}
- Bathos, get up. Come on.

604
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,392
My leg!

605
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,954
Look! Look! See, the fires burning.

606
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,632
Look, hot food and a dry bed.
Come on.

607
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,951
Agricola has fallen back.

608
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,511
Emperor Hadrian has given orders
to form a new defensive line to the south.

609
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,756
Giving up the ground we fought for.

610
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,156
- And where does that leave us?
- Fucked.

611
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,191
{Distant horses}

612
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,351
How does she do that?

613
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,232
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of running.

614
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,192
- This is all I could find.
- Make them count.

615
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,118
For Virilus.

616
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,832
For the Ninth.

617
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,033
{Brick} Bathos, they're flanking us.
West wall!

618
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,559
{Roars}

619
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,795
Brick!

620
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,709
Come on!

621
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,229
- How much further do you think?
- I don't know.

622
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,952
A day's ride. Maybe two.

623
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,148
{Twigs snap}

624
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,237
That's close enough, Thax.

625
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,793
Oh, shit!

626
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,271
I thought you were Picts.

627
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,039
{Bathos} We thought you were dead.

628
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,437
Where's Macros?

629
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,190
Wolves got him.

630
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,918
Is this it? Are we all that's left?

631
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,030
Hey, at least the three of us made it!

632
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,275
- We're not home yet.
- What are you talking about?

633
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,039
- We should be at the frontier by now.
- {Bathos} No.

634
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,720
Agricola's been given
his marching orders.

635
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,868
Ha! So, Rome's finally given up
on this shithole of a country, then?

636
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,551
Can't say that I'm sorry.

637
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,074
Then we fought for nothing.

638
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,716
{Groans}

639
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,676
Hup! Hup!

640
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,592
- What happened with the boy, Thax?
- I've no idea what you're talking about.

641
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,713
This is Hadrian's big, fucking plan?
A wall?

642
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,751
Hey, who cares? We made it.

643
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,075
- Let's go!
- Bathos, wait!

644
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,791
Slow down, Centurion.

645
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,671
Thax, what are you doing?

646
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,995
Just making sure
that we understand each other.

647
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,278
I understand that many good men died
because of what you did,

648
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,913
and you will answer for it.

649
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,508
Why did I just know
you were going to feel that way?

650
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,949
Hey!

651
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,431
Bathos!

652
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,757
{Agricola} This report
confirms our worst fears.

653
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,999
You fought your war, soldier,
and earned the gratitude of Rome.

654
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,795
This man will show you to my private
quarters, he will see you fed.

655
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,956
You look half starved.

656
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,788
We cannot return to Rome in disgrace.

657
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,434
Better that the fate of the Legion
remain a mystery

658
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,596
than the truth of their failure be known.

659
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,234
If word gets out, every tribe
and every nation will rise against us.

660
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,635
It's too great a risk.

661
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,955
Are we agreed, then?

662
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,152
The fate of the Ninth Legion
will be struck from the record.

663
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,032
Aye.

664
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,033
Aye.

665
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,151
I hope the food is to your liking.

666
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,671
I've brought you some wine.

667
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,755
It is the least we can do
for a hero of Rome.

668
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,232
Is this how Rome honours her heroes?

669
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,033
You want to bury the truth
and me along with it?

670
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,720
You are too much of a risk.

671
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,278
Where will you go?

672
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,231
Where I belong.

673
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,919
{Horse whinnies}

674
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,397
No!

675
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,640
It seems my life is
in your hands again, witch.

676
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,908
<i>My name is Quintus Dias.</i>

677
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,951
<i>I am a fugitive of Rome.</i>

678
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:24,156
<i>And this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>
