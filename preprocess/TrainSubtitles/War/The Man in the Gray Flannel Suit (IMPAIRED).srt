Couldn't be better.

Uh, look. Did you say something to me
the other day about wanting to make a change?

Oh, well, not exactly.

What I said was that I like it
at the Foundation okay...

making both ends meet.

I hear there's a spot opening up...

Oh, I don't know. Eight, 10,000, I guess.
Something like that.

Well, I could certainly do
with eight or 10,000...

You got a clean shirt.

have a real doctor take a look at him.

with the dead.

492

No, sirree, we ain't. We're gonna lay him
right down here by your side...

the best thing to do about it.

Will you do that for me, Captain?
That's a good captain.

I'll join you in five minutes.
- Of course, sir.

607

I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Rath.
It's just one of those things, you know?

608
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,553
It's quite all right, sir.

609
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,392
I'm sorry, dear.
How are you?

610
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,125
Can you come out today? I've got to talk
to you right away about Susan.

611
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,360
- What about her?
- Many things really.

612
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,597
But she's just informed me that she has
no intention of going to college...

613
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,834
and l-I just don't know
what to do about her anymore.

614

I'll be there this evening,
if that'll be convenient for you.

- Don't fail me, Ralph. Please.
- I won't, dear.

Don't worry too much.

Did you know that more hospital beds
are occupied by the mentally ill...

619
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:42,197
than all the cancer, heart and polio
cases put together?

620
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,170
No. I didn't know
it was that bad.

621
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,901
I never dreamed it was that bad
until I talked to those doctors.

622
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:52,141
That's a very good idea about
the research endowment. What else?

623
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,876
Well, what about backing
legislation...

624
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,784
to get more state and federal funds
for mental hospitals?

625
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:02,688
- Yes, that could be done too.
- And then on the local level...

626
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,922
you might look into the organization
of community clinics...

627
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,659
psychiatric clinics,
sort of preventive measures.

628
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,793
- How?
- "How" what?

629
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,862
How could we organize
community clinics?

I can't answer that
this minute.

You've got to remember I just
heard about this thing an hour ago.

632
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,109
But I'd certainly look into
the possibility of local clinics.

633
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:31,676
- I think we should too.
- Very good idea.

634
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,690
It's a little too early, actually,
to spell out any of these ideas in detail.

635

Oh, dear. I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you gentlemen to excuse me.

01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,657
I have a very important
engagement.

637

Mr. Rath, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your coming.

638
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,293
It's been a genuine pleasure,
as well as very useful indeed.

I hope we'll be able to see each other
again soon. Good-bye.

This wouldn't be a very high-paying job,
you understand?

644
01:02:35,616 --> 01:02:38,084
Well, what kind
would it be?

645
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:43,316
The figure we had in mind
was something around 7,000.

646
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:46,881
Well, that's no good.
That's what I'm getting now.

I know.
What did you have in mind?

648
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:54,363
The job, as I see it,
should be worth at least $10,000.

649
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:56,436
I'm afraid that's
out of the question.

650
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:59,664
So is 7,000,
as far as I'm concerned.

We don't like to quibble

Well, not that anything
can be decided now anyhow.

that was the right thing to do.
