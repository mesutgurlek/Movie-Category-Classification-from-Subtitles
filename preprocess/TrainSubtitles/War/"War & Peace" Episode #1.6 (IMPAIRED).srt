No, really, there's nothing to praise.

982
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,881
I blame myself for my reckless conduct
in the past and I deserve to pay for it.

983

are to suffer for it, too.

I thought
you'd let me sympathise with you.

986
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,042
And we seemed so close
when we were together in Voronezh.

987
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,966
But now something's gone wrong,
and I don't know why.

988
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,931
There are a thousand reasons why.
Our family has lost everything.

989

The war's over.
I have no profession.

990
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,529
My poor mother,
who has never wanted for anything,

991
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,171
now has to darn her own stockings.

992
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,971
She's so ashamed, she can't even
go out and face her friends.

993
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,807
My sister's life is over
before it's scarcely begun.

994

Then let me help you.

995

I've more money
than I know what to do with.

996
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,360
Don't you see?
How can I ask for your help?

997
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,807
People will say
that I'm a fortune hunter.

998
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,281
Nikolai, do you think I care
what people say?

999
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,326
Now, look.

1000

You might have changed your mind.

1001

But if you still feel

1002

what I think you felt
when we were together in Voronezh...

It's a great blow.

Can you imagine I knew
nothing about him surviving the battle?

So you were able
to see him before he died?

1041
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,210
Yeah, and he often spoke of you.

1042

And always very fondly, didn't he?

No. No.

No.

1057
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,163
You know, she wrote to me
asking to see me,

1058
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,368
but I, I never received her letter.

1059
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,728
We weren't on good terms.

1060

But such a death without friends,
without consolation,

1061

He was such an extraordinary little man.
He was just a peasant.

You know, but he seemed to
have grasped the secret of how to live.

1067

He never worried.

1068

and endured the bad things cheerfully.

he'd say,

"and she knows how to give it."

1073

What else can you ask?

1074

And he was right, I think.

is that ridiculous?
