1
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,217
Daddy!

2
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,103
Yes, Messaoud?

3
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,429
-The gendarmes!
-Where?

4
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,974
Oh, my God...

5
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,269
Said, stay close to me.

6
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:11,603
Good morning.

7
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,685
I have a court order.

8
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,942
This land belongs to Mr.
Guerini, your neighbour.

9
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,651
Mr Caid,

10
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:27,357
this earth, I inherited
it from my ancestors.

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,484
-Do you have a document of ownership?
-What document?

12
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,485
We've never had one.

13
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,317
-Without a document, there's nothing I can do.
You have to leave.

14
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,857
Impossible.

15
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:42,353
I was born on this land.

16
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:46,483
My father was born here.
My grandfather, my ancestors...

17
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:48,944
My children have grown up here!

18
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,562
You have three days to leave.

19
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,820
If I leave my land,

20
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,563
how should I feed my children?

21
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,900
-It's the law, I can't
do anything about it.

22
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,701
Have they gone mad?

23
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,908
We're chasing a
piece of paper.

24
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:15,449
I will die and be buried here!

25
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,819
It's not fair!

26
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,615
It's a sin, what you're doing.

27
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,322
God damn you!

28
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,078
-Do not cry Mama,
we will return.

29
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,490
It's nothing.

30
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,917
Go help your father, Said. Go.

31
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:12,545
-School is over.
-What?

32
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,794
Leave school?

33
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,251
I am among the best students.

34
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,285
This is not fair.
-How should I pay for it?

35
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:48,088
Remember that this land is ours.

36
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:50,997
It saw you being born and grow up.

37
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,123
Today,

38
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:55,843
we hunt.

39
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,839
May God punish them.

40
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,146
Free Algeria!

41
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,146
Equal rights!

42
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,767
Free Algeria!

43
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,523
Equal rights!

44
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,193
-Come on forward.
-I have my match.

45
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:16,189
-Germany has lost.
We will win our freedom.

46
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,158
-Me, I earn my living.
-Said!

47
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:21,404
Remove

48
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:22,940
the djellaba.

49
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:24,694
Come here, you.

50
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,575
Take good care,
and don't be afraid.

51
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,483
Listen carefully.

52
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:37,618
If you lose, you shall
not eat tonight.

53
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,324
Halim! Halim!

54
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,492
Equal Rights!

55
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,786
Dodge!

56
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:50,923
That gives!

57
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,209
Let go!

58
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,126
Take off your hand!

59
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,973
Don't do that! Stop!

60
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:34,565
Hide.

61
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,067
-Open, open!
The door!

62
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,897
Let me in.

63
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:07,898
Hide this.

64
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:35,775
Fire!

65
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:42,945
Now, go back home.

66
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,199
And most importantly,
hide.

67
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,698
Is that clear?
Don't go out.

68
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,073
Save yourself!

69
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,366
Wait.

70
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:54,901
Save yourself!

71
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,289
Hands up!

72
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,205
Get out. Go.

73
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,075
Go!

74
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,873
Come on!
-Faster.

75
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:36,956
Daddy!

76
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,449
Dad!

77
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,914
Dad? Dad?

78
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:42,795
Get up, Dad.

79
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:45,874
Dad.

80
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,912
No, Dad, don't die.

81
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:52,919
Dad...

82
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,013
They're dead.

83
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,796
May God rest their souls.

84
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:53,014
May he give me strength
and patience.

85
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:56,637
May he welcome them into
his vast paradise.

86
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:36,979
My dear Messaoud

87
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,062
I hope my letter

88
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:40,939
finds you alive.

89
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:46,473
I hope that this war in Indochina
will end soon.

90
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:51,353
Your brother Abdelkader
is in prison in France.

91
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:55,478
It has now been 8 years that
I haven't seen you.

92
00:14:55,693 --> 00:15:00,102
Fortunately your brother,
Said, is always by my side.

93
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:04,727
This morning, we prayed
at the tomb of your father

94
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:06,437
and your sisters.

95
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,189
What is it?

96
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,315
My mother.

97
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:19,109
May God bless you,
my very dear son.

98
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,410
Mr. Caid?

99
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,666
Mr. Caid.

100
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,583
What are you doing here?

101
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,582
I just came to say hello.

102
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,244
How did you get in?

103
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,076
I have a gift for you.

104
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,284
What's this gift?

105
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,295
Die!

106
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,704
I've come to avenge my father

107
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,789
and my entire family.

108
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,624
Filthy dog.

109
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,171
Die, you filthy dog.

110
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,253
For everything you did.

111
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,753
Pack your things.
-Why?

112
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:01,431
We're going to France.

113
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,010
-I don't want to.
-We're at war.

114
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,091
They will kill us.

115
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:10,592
-If you think I am alive,
you're wrong.

116
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,007
I'm already dead.

117
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,843
They've killed us.

118
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,428
Listen

119
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:20,763
Listen carefully.

120
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,341
Abdelkader is in jail.

121
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,385
He's alone in France.
He needs help.

122
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:30,762
-And Messaoud?
-He will join us,

123
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,596
he's a soldier.

124
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,933
-In France?
-Sure.

125
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:41,726
God willing, we will
all return here

126
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:43,391
to our land,

127
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:44,932
in our country.

128
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:47,972
But not to this foxhole.

129
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,770
I'll tell you...

130
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:55,689
when I'm sure to find my children,

131
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:58,470
I'll follow you anywhere.

132
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:00,392
God will hear you.

133
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:23,731
My brothers,

134
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,981
I bid you farewell.

135
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:28,147
They're taking me.

136
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,231
Greet Algeria.

137
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,523
Greet my country.

138
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,939
Long live Algeria!

139
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:55,231
Come on.

140
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,207
In the name of the
French Republic,

141
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,497
I command the execution.

142
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:25,045
- The Vietnamese people
broke the chains

143
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:27,924
that had weighed on them
for a century

144
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:30,917
for their country to
be independent.

145
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,542
Otmani...

146
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,668
Don't fall asleep.

147
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:36,965
Don't sleep.

148
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:40,506
-Colonial France
is not invincible.

149
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,792
Don't give in to any illusions.

150
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,297
It's over, for your friend.

151
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,544
- The members of the
oppressed nations

152
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:52,209
must mobilise all their forces,

153
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:56,008
and be willing to sacrifice their
lives and their property

154
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,923
to wrest from the
colonial forces

155
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:01,175
their right to be
independent.

156
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,836
You, from African colonies,

157
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,178
take for example the
successful fight

158
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:10,347
of the Vietnamese people.
Your brothers,

159
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:14,177
your wives, your children
deserve justice

160
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,715
and freedom!
Fighters, don't be slaves

161
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:21,139
sacrificed by the colonisers
anymore.

162
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:25,551
See our victory and
break your chain.

163
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:40,465
Here it is.

164
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:48,764
Come in.

165
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:53,268
Come on, Mum. Go in.

166
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,433
Thank you.

167
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,855
Listen, I have no
money for now...

168
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:17,188
As soon as I find work...

169
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:19,014
I'll pay you.

170
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:21,474
Take this watch as security.

171
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,972
It is expensive.

172
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:32,352
It's good, it'll do.

173
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,318
-Don't worry, mum,
it's temporary.

174
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:49,320
Thank God.

175
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:53,193
It's better than nothing.
At least we have a roof.

176
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:33,782
My brother...

177
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,329
Where are you going?

178
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:38,695
To work for Renault.

179
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,905
They're hiring.
What do you say?

180
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,153
Thanks.

181
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,042
Salaam aleikoum.

182
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,835
Salaam.

183
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,834
-May I sit down?
-Please.

184
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:51,539
-What can one buy with this?
-With that?

185
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,623
You can buy a house...

186
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,384
and get married.

187
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:59,917
It can even buy you money.

188
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,253
You're new here?

189
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:09,253
I'm from Setif.

190
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,504
-From Setif?
Welcome, my brother.

191
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:14,970
Watch your things.

192
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,257
Think about marriage.

193
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:22,586
Sir...

194
00:26:24,306 --> 00:26:25,550
Sir?

195
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,423
Hey, sir!

196
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,263
What's it like to live here?

197
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:32,840
You can be a slave for Renault.

198
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:35,090
-What do you do?
-Me?

199
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,761
I'm different.
-Teach me.

200
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:42,218
-For a guy like you
that's a long way.

201
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,975
Forget it.

202
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,808
Excuse me...

203
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:52,052
Nothing is too hard for me.

204
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,137
I can surprise you.

205
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:57,432
Surprise me?

206
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:01,931
Come on.

207
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:03,718
Go.

208
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:17,678
Mum!

209
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,852
Are you okay?

210
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,682
I thank God.

211
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,017
Did you eat well?

212
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,604
Looks like you got thinner.

213
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,513
Don't worry about me.

214
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,526
-Listen closely
to what I have to say.

215
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,233
You didn't steal.

216
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,435
You didn't kill.

217
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,733
You're not a criminal.

218
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:47,315
You're in jail for your ideas.

219
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:49,312
You are a man.

220
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,187
Everything has an end.

221
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,650
Soon, I will get out.

222
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,777
We'll be together.

223
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:59,027
If God wills it

224
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:01,146
before you die

225
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:04,156
and be buried by your side.

226
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,896
Fear not, my son.

227
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:10,025
Be a man.

228
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,527
Your son is a fighter.

229
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,699
Here comes the warden.

230
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,319
I'll leave you.

231
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,148
Remember what I said.

232
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:26,529
Be a man.

233
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,154
Abdelkader.

234
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,614
By taking care of you,
you are taking care of me.

235
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:39,529
May God be with you.

236
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,363
May God bless you.

237
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:42,948
God bless you.

238
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,036
-That's her?
-Yes. That's her.

239
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,454
-Have you talked to her?
-Yes.

240
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,659
What did you tell her?

241
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,417
Good.

242
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,577
We're there.

243
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,667
Is that right, Bigalle?

244
00:29:24,877 --> 00:29:27,449
-Pigalle.
Not with a B. With a P.

245
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,993
Otherwise, they'll laugh at you.

246
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,830
Come with me.

247
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,494
Sit down over there.
It will be your place.

248
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:43,162
Understood? And tomorrow, we
share the money.

249
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:45,875
Good...

250
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,417
Go. Thank you.

251
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:50,911
Thanks.

252
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,627
Wait. Listen carefully.

253
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,748
One whore, not bad.

254
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,044
Two whores...

255
00:29:58,258 --> 00:29:59,455
You're doing.

256
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,841
I'm hungry.

257
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,460
Yes, come on.

258
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,172
Good morning.

259
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,010
How did you do?

260
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:39,254
I will return the rest tonight.

261
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:40,587
Okay.

262
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,846
Take it, buy yourself some clothes.

263
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,102
-Even if I had to stay
naked all my life

264
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,759
I wouldn't want your money.

265
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,685
God is my witness.

266
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:17,972
Zohra...

267
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:25,221
It's for my mother.
Don't tell her it's from me.

268
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:30,601
Said?

269
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:33,517
Messaoud?

270
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:35,142
My brother?

271
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:37,099
Messaoud!

272
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,520
Messaoud, my brother!

273
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,940
Where have you been,
where were you?

274
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,857
You have become a man.

275
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,975
What else?

276
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,390
Come and see!

277
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:49,640
My son,

278
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:51,146
my treasure!

279
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,352
I missed you.

280
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:56,476
And you, my son!

281
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:58,484
You've become a man.

282
00:31:58,694 --> 00:31:59,892
You've lost weight.

283
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,642
He's a commander! Fantastic!

284
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:03,643
Your eyes...

285
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:07,104
-What's happened to them?
-That's war.

286
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,195
-Soon, Abdelkader will be
out of jail.

287
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,404
You are the eldest.

288
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:15,565
You have to take care
of the family.

289
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:19,730
I would have liked you to see
your Dad before he died.

290
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:23,812
There's a girl right here,
pleasant, intelligent.

291
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:27,149
If you like her, it relies on God.

292
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,567
Where's she from?

293
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,698
From our corner, just like us.

294
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,486
If God wills it.

295
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:45,278
If God wills it.

296
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:53,608
Abdelkader.

297
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:56,619
I have to talk to you.

298
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,612
You know, Ho Chi Minh...

299
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,405
won the war against France
thanks to two principles.

300
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:11,076
The first principle

301
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,454
is that oppression
always has its benefits

302
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:18,114
to the cause of the people who
want to liberate themselves.

303
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,706
The second principle,

304
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,746
is to never, ever abandon
a mission.

305
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,115
Nothing is insurmountable.

306
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,869
All Algerians, all of them

307
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:36,000
must pay their toll for revolution.

308
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:39,251
Within two days, you
will be free.

309
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:44,377
You must lead all
Algerians from the suburbs

310
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:47,502
and also here in Paris.
-How?

311
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:50,537
You convince anyone.

312
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:53,753
??Him entrane 3 which entranent 6.

313
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:56,120
??The six entranent in ten.

314
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,459
I'll give you an address.

315
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:01,504
And remember it well.

316
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,958
You'll deliver your
reports there

317
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:08,338
and receive orders.
Okay?

318
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:13,000
-Count on me.
I will not betray the Algerians.

319
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,878
Let me, ma'am.

320
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:24,883
Abdelkader!

321
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:30,337
My life, my treasure,
you're finally here!

322
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:32,460
I thank God.

323
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:37,968
Come my heart, let's go home.

324
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:42,049
-How are you, Mum?
-Good.

325
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,673
There it is.

326
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,627
Enjoy your meal.

327
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:46,961
And welcome.

328
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:50,547
This is the 1st time I'm
eating meat.

329
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,422
I swear.
-He's kidding.

330
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:00,390
Said, I'm your brothers witness.

331
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,135
The neighbours show me the finger.

332
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,755
They say you're a villain.

333
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:07,921
Listen!

334
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:13,969
Mum was right.

335
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:17,468
If you're a villain,
nobody respects you.

336
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:18,716
Bandit?

337
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:21,259
Who's the villain? Me?

338
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:25,970
In this country, either you have money,
or you are worth nothing.

339
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,012
Your brother is free.

340
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:31,021
-I'll be free when my
country will be.

341
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,853
We need to be free.

342
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,764
And everything needs to change.

343
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:38,644
What are you talking about?

344
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:40,681
With these workers?

345
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,011
Listen, now we're three.

346
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:47,313
Tomorrow we will rally
the entire slum.

347
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:48,768
He's right.

348
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,857
Think of the victory of
the Vietnamese.

349
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,728
They were more armed than them,
it was useless.

350
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,271
They could have stayed
15 or 20 years.

351
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,019
They would have won.

352
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,683
The revolution is on.

353
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,976
Nothing will stop it.

354
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:11,063
Listen

355
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,401
I have thought it through.

356
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:16,279
I know how to make money.

357
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,402
It's easy. Listen to me.

358
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:21,356
You've been to Indochina.

359
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,237
You know the weapons.

360
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:26,984
You were in prison,
you have become tough.

361
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:29,816
Three of us, we will
scare anyone.

362
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:32,069
We will not stay in
this misery

363
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,982
for all our lives.

364
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,780
We will make our law.

365
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,903
Juror.

366
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,823
He must choose.

367
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,609
Whose side are you on?

368
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,574
Your brothers' or
their enemy's?

369
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,236
My brothers?

370
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,153
That's you. Them, I don't know.

371
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,738
I'm not supporting the enemy.

372
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,653
Are you with me?

373
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,024
Messaoud?

374
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,442
Good luck.

375
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:17,870
I left the army.

376
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,073
I'm with you.

377
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:22,073
I'm with you.

378
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:23,948
Zohra, bring the cake.

379
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,747
Now, block them.

380
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,420
Stop, wait.

381
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,955
My brothers. Listen.

382
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:22,374
Between the fighting and
dying in this country.

383
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,873
You must join the FLN.

384
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,298
The FLN is for an armed struggle.

385
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,998
The FLN controls everything.

386
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:33,043
It hides in the underground.

387
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:35,091
The revolution, it's it.

388
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:38,508
The dialogue leads nowhere.

389
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,883
The French fake the elections.

390
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:45,003
No politics here.

391
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:47,261
Wake up.

392
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,675
Wake up, my brothers!

393
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:51,925
Remember! FLN!

394
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:53,417
-FLN!
-FLN!

395
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:56,174
The French fake the elections.

396
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:57,846
FLN!
-That's enough.

397
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:03,094
This morning, we were two.

398
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,546
And like this, we will always stay two.

399
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:08,550
Look at these pages,
they are empty.

400
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,223
We will get there.

401
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:14,337
Patience.

402
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,011
-What are you looking at?
-You.

403
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:58,229
Why did you switch it off?

404
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,850
I'm talking to you!

405
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:04,814
All of you

406
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,062
Listen to me.

407
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:08,562
We must bring the war here.

408
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,480
Join the party that promotes
armed struggle.

409
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:14,185
Listen, you.

410
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:17,892
The only legitimate party
is the MNA.

411
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,975
Got it?

412
00:40:20,194 --> 00:40:22,268
You're mistaken, my friend.

413
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,809
THE MNA will go nowhere.

414
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:28,062
The MNA has confidence
in elections.

415
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:30,643
The French give us one vote

416
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,025
against 10 for the settlers.

417
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:35,561
They tamper with elections.

418
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:38,572
It is through armed struggle

419
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:40,481
that we will win.

420
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:49,942
Abdelkader!

421
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,479
Out!

422
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,524
Put him there.

423
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:57,273
Let me go! Let me go!

424
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:58,984
Let me go!

425
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:03,071
So, you're FLN?

426
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:05,863
I want to hear you say:

427
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:07,190
Long live the MNA.

428
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,859
So, you're going to say:

429
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:13,070
Long live the MNA.
I want to hear it.

430
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:18,909
Teach him some manners.

431
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,155
Are you gonna say it or not?

432
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,611
??That way, you make the devil?

433
00:41:33,956 --> 00:41:35,497
I'll show you.

434
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:38,491
Look at me carefully.

435
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,532
Are you ready to die?

436
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,738
Nobody will help you.

437
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:45,119
Get up!

438
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,406
I'll tell you one thing.

439
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,244
Don't ever set your foot in
here again.

440
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:58,115
As long as I'm alive,
there will be no FLN.

441
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,077
The boss, that's me.

442
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:01,917
You're lucky.

443
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:03,999
Next time you're dead.

444
00:42:06,336 --> 00:42:07,995
Shut the door.

445
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:20,576
You have nothing?

446
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,412
No, okay. And you?

447
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:26,582
Okay.

448
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:28,172
They tapped you.

449
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,668
-It's okay.
It's nothing.

450
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:34,752
What are we gonna do?

451
00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:38,209
Hey, brothers?

452
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,580
What do you want?

453
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,751
I'm on your side.

454
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:44,835
The FLN is right.

455
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:48,838
I received a letter from
the government.

456
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:51,375
The FLN has gone underground.

457
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:55,968
I'm with you.

458
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,344
You know him?

459
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,293
No.

460
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:06,760
But we won one.

461
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:55,556
Hey.

462
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:58,094
You'll kill yourself with this.

463
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:24,813
Get out. Get out, sir.

464
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:28,232
You too, get out.
Quickly. You too.

465
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:38,191
Just like that,
you're back.

466
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:42,568
You're not scared, you.

467
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,527
-"The accused denies the
authority of the FLN,

468
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:55,905
-he publicly denies the necessity
for armed struggle.

469
00:44:56,114 --> 00:44:57,192
On behalf

470
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,688
of the revolution,

471
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,522
-the accused is sentenced
to death."

472
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:09,146
Sit down!

473
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,862
You've come in a great number.

474
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,859
Only, you wouldn't dare.

475
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,982
Go ahead.

476
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,531
Give me a and hold him.

477
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:24,649
Long live the MNA!

478
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:26,993
Cowards!

479
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:29,567
Son of a...

480
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:37,462
"The sentence was executed

481
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,340
today at 3 pm."

482
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,421
Who are you?

483
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,674
What are you doing here?

484
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:48,425
Colonel Faivre, DST.

485
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:50,723
This is my home here.

486
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,807
I make decisions.

487
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:54,969
The gooks will pay.

488
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:57,676
We'll go to the slum.

489
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,885
It's a battle

490
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:01,804
FLN - MNA.

491
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,554
You will get killed.

492
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:05,767
It should calm things down!

493
00:48:31,483 --> 00:48:33,640
Congratulations, my brother.

494
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:40,692
Come on, you too.

495
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:42,602
I embrace you.

496
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,267
All my wishes of happiness.

497
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:22,689
-Police!
-Police, open up!

498
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:27,397
Get everyone out.

499
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:46,278
Police! Come here!

500
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:54,365
Police!

501
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,290
Police!

502
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,284
Outside, go!

503
00:50:27,377 --> 00:50:28,455
My brother...

504
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:30,375
It's the police!

505
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:33,619
I have to go, sorry.

506
00:50:35,545 --> 00:50:37,702
The police. We must go.

507
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:39,325
Don't move! Stop!

508
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:42,874
Police!

509
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:44,913
Go, police.

510
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:46,914
Go, turn around.

511
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,500
-Lift your arms.
-This is marriage.

512
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:55,624
Go, go!

513
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:57,292
Turn around.

514
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:10,044
Hurry! ??It drags it!

515
00:51:18,552 --> 00:51:21,551
-I want ten.
-Turn around.

516
00:51:21,886 --> 00:51:23,296
Take them.

517
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:24,708
Come here!

518
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,463
Go ahead!

519
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,096
Where are you going, you?

520
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,757
Catch him!

521
00:51:42,848 --> 00:51:43,878
Quick!

522
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:45,633
Follow me! Come!

523
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,969
He must go! Hurry!

524
00:51:48,182 --> 00:51:49,972
Where did you learn to fight?

525
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:52,173
-A gift from God.
-Really?

526
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:53,967
You want to work?

527
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:56,589
It's your lucky day. Run.

528
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:11,306
Did you know they would come?

529
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:16,559
You knew. The leader of the MNA.

530
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:19,722
You had everything planned?

531
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,807
Come on.

532
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:32,195
-For how long will you
support this?

533
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,197
What do you expect?

534
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:37,195
That they'll burn your homes?

535
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:40,158
They don't respect anyone.

536
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,070
Neither your wives,
nor your children.

537
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,898
You can change that.

538
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:49,109
It's your move.

539
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:53,156
You must prepare against
these humiliations.

540
00:53:57,662 --> 00:53:59,285
Do you understand?

541
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:43,248
Tobacco and alcohol
are prohibited.

542
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:47,290
Paying taxes to France,
that's collaborating.

543
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:49,584
You, advance. Your name?

544
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:51,253
Ali Benjbour.

545
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,832
I swear to devote my
life to my country

546
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:56,535
from this moment and
until my death.

547
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,159
I congratulate you.

548
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,410
Advance.

549
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:03,338
Nordine-Salhi.

550
00:55:03,673 --> 00:55:07,714
I swear to devote my life to my
country until my death.

551
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:10,454
Thanks.

552
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,457
2000.

553
00:55:47,305 --> 00:55:48,549
We helped you.

554
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:51,631
You got your place with Pigalle.
-That is true.

555
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:54,336
-You are associated
in a cabaret.

556
00:55:54,556 --> 00:55:57,127
Everything has to
fund our cause.

557
00:55:57,931 --> 00:55:59,555
You've given your word.

558
00:55:59,765 --> 00:56:02,171
-I know.
I have not forgotten.

559
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:04,879
But you didn't speak
to the Corsicans.

560
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:08,596
They've given me only 5 %.
What can I do?

561
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:11,466
Hadn't you said 15 %?

562
00:56:12,684 --> 00:56:13,881
Listen,

563
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:17,722
it's not very complicated.

564
00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:20,506
I give you a part
of the cabaret.

565
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:25,178
I want half.

566
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,641
-Half?
-Yes.

567
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,850
-Which half?
-What?

568
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:34,395
-Are you really serious?
And how am I supposed to live?

569
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,558
Said?

570
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,971
There's no discussion.
I said half.

571
00:56:51,899 --> 00:56:53,308
You, advance.

572
00:56:57,316 --> 00:57:00,350
Mum, do me a favour.

573
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:03,649
Agree to see Said, he needs it.

574
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:06,526
-I don't want that.
-Don't be stubborn.

575
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:10,231
It's your son. He's changed.

576
00:57:10,443 --> 00:57:12,814
Take care of your wife instead.

577
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:15,065
She will give birth soon.

578
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:29,860
-It's Omar who stole
the contributions.

579
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,023
-He has children.
A warning...

580
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:34,613
No, no and no!

581
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,442
Discipline.
No warning!

582
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:43,190
-When i was a prisoner,
I thought

583
00:57:43,532 --> 00:57:45,855
that if I got out,

584
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,523
I would never kill again.

585
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:52,398
-It only takes one disobedience
or betrayal

586
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,486
I'm with you.

587
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:16,240
-I stole to buy a
refrigerator.

588
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:21,237
It's not for me.
It's for children.

589
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:23,245
I'll sell it.

590
00:58:23,997 --> 00:58:25,988
It's yours, take it.

591
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:29,204
It was me who wanted the fridge.

592
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,741
Forgive him.

593
00:58:31,957 --> 00:58:34,742
I'm begging you.
-Don't be afraid.

594
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:36,747
I won't do it again.

595
00:58:57,169 --> 00:58:59,741
Give me a second chance.

596
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:01,289
I have 3 children.

597
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,585
I won't do it again, I promise you.

598
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:46,299
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

599
00:59:47,594 --> 00:59:50,083
-Is everything okay?
-Are you alone?

600
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:51,844
-Yes.
-Come in.

601
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:01,628
Factories will explode
all over France

602
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:03,174
at the same time.

603
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:07,253
Without killing or injuring
a civilian.

604
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:08,634
Do you understand?

605
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,720
-We will fight France
on its territory.

606
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:15,088
He must find weapons

607
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:19,513
and teach your men to use them.

608
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:23,091
The French want control.
We have to be ready.

609
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:25,976
-Organising a zone,
that I can do.

610
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:28,969
But I don't know anything
about weapons.

611
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:33,641
-The factory, to you, is over.
And the slums too.

612
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:36,841
You go into hiding.

613
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:39,384
I will make you false papers.

614
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:40,681
Okay.

615
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,061
You can go.

616
01:01:15,817 --> 01:01:18,140
-Who's there?
-The white Algerian.

617
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:23,686
Come in.

618
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:28,599
Give me that.

619
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:36,982
That's 25 million.

620
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,112
Be careful.

621
01:01:43,488 --> 01:01:45,195
There. Hold.

622
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:47,527
I'll accompany you.
-Thanks.

623
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:50,986
-It that a French serving
the revolution?

624
01:01:51,198 --> 01:01:52,360
Go ahead.

625
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:56,354
-That she drinks anything.
-Close the door.

626
01:02:05,784 --> 01:02:06,981
Wait.

627
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:13,732
Go ahead.

628
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:33,074
It could be something else...

629
01:02:33,747 --> 01:02:37,955
-It's a matter of Algerians.
It's their revolution.

630
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:41,870
I want to be involved more.

631
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:47,621
We do what they ask us to do.

632
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:52,488
That was fast. The money goes to
Switzerland tonight.

633
01:03:23,463 --> 01:03:25,170
Messaoud, my brother!

634
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,577
Welcome.

635
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:30,333
So, are you all right?

636
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:31,957
-Yes, all right.
-Come on.

637
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:33,412
Make yourself comfortable.

638
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:44,256
-Request the envelope from Vincent.
-Yes.

639
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:47,792
So what do you say?

640
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:06,334
Account.

641
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,506
Okay.

642
01:04:12,221 --> 01:04:13,299
Listen...

643
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:16,711
I've called it "The Casbah".

644
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:23,424
It's not a place for you.

645
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:36,254
You want to see my real place?

646
01:04:40,226 --> 01:04:42,347
It's through there.
You'll see.

647
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,804
Welcome.

648
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:54,508
You have gained weight.
I don't recognise you anymore.

649
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,050
I took it out of the street.

650
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,638
Him

651
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:01,932
this is my future.

652
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,343
I found him in the slum.

653
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:05,840
One day this guy...

654
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:08,472
He will be champion. You'll see!

655
01:05:08,811 --> 01:05:10,636
What's his name?

656
01:05:10,977 --> 01:05:13,015
I don't know yet.

657
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:14,720
I haven't found out.

658
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:18,509
He's the first Algerian who will knock out

659
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,050
the whites and blacks.

660
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:22,591
If God wills it.

661
01:05:22,936 --> 01:05:25,010
If God wills it. What do you think?

662
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:27,637
It's Said.

663
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:29,394
I'm proud of you.

664
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:31,889
Messaoud

665
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:37,518
Forget the war.
Come work with me.

666
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:44,091
I must go.

667
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:48,091
Said?

668
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,270
No Smoking.

669
01:05:50,604 --> 01:05:51,766
You know it's

670
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:53,561
prohibited.

671
01:05:55,646 --> 01:05:56,724
Messaoud!

672
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,056
Where are you going with this war?

673
01:06:01,396 --> 01:06:04,560
What did you watch me? Boxing!

674
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:07,011
And you want my picture?

675
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,812
Boxing or leaving!

676
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:41,059
I leave you all l.

677
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:44,642
Here, the key.

678
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,683
You can come to the show
tonight or tomorrow.

679
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,268
All my time is taken.

680
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:56,264
You can leave.

681
01:06:57,023 --> 01:06:58,433
I'll come back.

682
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:27,023
<i>Returning to France and Paris</i>

683
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:29,638
<i>where there have been reported</i>

684
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:31,896
<i>a series of attacks.</i>

685
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:35,390
<i>These events are irrefutable
proof</i>

686
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:38,642
<i>the FLN was able to create in France</i>

687
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:43,315
<i>an organization to carry
out terrorist acts.</i>

688
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,056
<i>The FLN, with raging despair,</i>

689
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,606
<i>attempts to halt the
peace in Algeria.</i>

690
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:53,893
<i>The government must take
the measure of risk</i>

691
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,639
<i>that the fanatics pose</i>

692
01:07:56,984 --> 01:07:59,733
<i>to the French territory.</i>

693
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:04,144
<i>For Algiers, these attacks
are related to the referendum.</i>

694
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,689
<i>The spokesman Gal Salan</i>

695
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:08,188
<i>declared yesterday:</i>

696
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:11,150
<i>We can only hope</i>

697
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:16,308
<i>That the police have sufficient
resources to cope.</i>

698
01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:19,187
<i>And this, Mr. Papon</i>

699
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:21,890
<i>will report in</i>

700
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:24,688
<i>Paris is talking
about-, 19 h 15,</i>

701
01:08:25,027 --> 01:08:27,018
<i>and the log 20 h.</i>

702
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:41,688
-What do you know about
the attacks?

703
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,349
Eh?

704
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:46,145
Nothing, of course.

705
01:08:46,361 --> 01:08:48,186
The FLN, you know?

706
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:52,354
The poor workers like you

707
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,359
know anything.

708
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,561
Where's Mustapha?

709
01:09:03,862 --> 01:09:06,694
I want to speak with both of them.

710
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,688
Can you swim?

711
01:09:21,904 --> 01:09:23,397
Can you swim?

712
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:11,565
-The repression prevents
our operation.

713
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:17,356
The police will end up
in the organization.

714
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:20,103
We must react quickly.

715
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:22,942
Eliminate the cops who torture.

716
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:25,817
Maintain the initiative, strike

717
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:29,397
up what the enemy
is on the nerves.

718
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:33,191
For every blow received,
we will deliver ten.

719
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:35,113
Your men are ready?

720
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:38,479
Yes.

721
01:10:39,657 --> 01:10:43,900
If you kill police officers, the
repression will be terrible.

722
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,907
-Our violence will
be profitable.

723
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:51,271
We must infiltrate the police.

724
01:10:51,616 --> 01:10:55,527
Of Algerians with important
positions.

725
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,366
Look, here's a list of names.

726
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:07,821
I will travel.
Cairo, Tunis, Morocco.

727
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:09,865
You'll replace me.

728
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:12,814
You shall take

729
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:15,363
your orders in Germany.

730
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,407
You'll be the height.

731
01:11:17,617 --> 01:11:19,691
I will, inch'alla.

732
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:24,530
I know I will not see the
Independent Appraisal.

733
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:27,313
But I would sacrifice my life.

734
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:30,946
Salaam.

735
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:37,565
There he is.

736
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,940
Look.

737
01:11:41,951 --> 01:11:45,992
That's the commissioner, he kills
and tortures our activists.

738
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:51,325
It's impossible to kill
him in the street.

739
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,065
It's risky for civilians.

740
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:58,573
Must enter the office. How?

741
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:02,363
Look.

742
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:04,816
The Algerians.

743
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:08,324
Those who did the
war in Indochina.

744
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:12,157
Him, I knew well.

745
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,648
Otmani Yasser.

746
01:12:13,994 --> 01:12:15,570
We were prisoners

747
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:16,989
together.

748
01:12:17,203 --> 01:12:18,400
He owes me life.

749
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,483
Really?

750
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:23,077
We'll contact him.

751
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,325
Look Daddy, look.

752
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:48,993
Your name's Otmani-Yasser,
not Alain.

753
01:12:49,204 --> 01:12:50,578
You are Algerian.

754
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:53,157
You're a police officer.

755
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:56,867
-Where are you from?
What do you want?

756
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:01,324
Listen.

757
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:06,495
If the French arrest you, they'll
put you in jail.

758
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:08,742
They will kill you maybe.

759
01:13:10,747 --> 01:13:12,488
But not your wife

760
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:14,609
or your children.

761
01:13:23,372 --> 01:13:25,777
The revolution needs you.

762
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:28,568
You have always been a traitor.

763
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:33,242
Today, I have come to
give you a chance.

764
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:35,783
Think carefully.

765
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,867
Go on, push.

766
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,946
Courage, pray to God.

767
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,747
Go on, push.

768
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:01,993
Courage, fear not.

769
01:14:53,626 --> 01:14:54,869
What is it?

770
01:14:55,084 --> 01:14:56,162
A boy.

771
01:15:19,585 --> 01:15:21,825
I'm not going home.

772
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:24,081
I cannot see my wife.

773
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:27,250
I have no life.

774
01:15:28,002 --> 01:15:29,281
I'm lost.

775
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:33,083
I warned you: no family.

776
01:15:33,294 --> 01:15:35,249
You, you feel nothing.

777
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:37,074
Nothing.

778
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:40,166
You have no feeling.

779
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:44,159
Where is our conscience?

780
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:45,491
Our soul?

781
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:48,662
Abdelkader... Our soul.

782
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,085
Today is Said's fight.

783
01:16:00,712 --> 01:16:02,086
We gotta go.

784
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:04,037
I have to work.

785
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:05,367
You're coming.

786
01:16:36,088 --> 01:16:39,086
Why doesn't he leave the left side?

787
01:17:24,715 --> 01:17:26,505
You're the champion.

788
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,498
Scrap his mouth!

789
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,665
Who's the champion?

790
01:17:45,216 --> 01:17:46,756
Good!

791
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,497
Out!

792
01:18:34,468 --> 01:18:37,501
-It is the greatest
champion of all!

793
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:40,669
That's when your next game?

794
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:45,003
-The next fight, the
championship of France!

795
01:18:49,135 --> 01:18:51,422
The championship of France!

796
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:02,546
Said

797
01:19:04,802 --> 01:19:05,880
Your boxer

798
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:09,208
he will not make the
championship.

799
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:13,504
Is that a joke?

800
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:16,922
-He will not box
for the enemy.

801
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:20,876
-Are you crazy?
He lost his head or what?

802
01:19:21,095 --> 01:19:22,173
Wait.

803
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:25,503
First, we take care
of our revolution.

804
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,964
Boxing, afterwards.

805
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:29,714
The revolution, I serve too.

806
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:32,002
If he wins, then Algeria wins.

807
01:19:32,345 --> 01:19:35,094
Imagine, an Algerian
France champion!

808
01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:37,798
This will be a great day. -No!

809
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:41,052
When an Algerian will be champion
it shall be for Algeria.

810
01:19:42,554 --> 01:19:45,920
-Your boxer should
fight for Algeria.

811
01:19:46,262 --> 01:19:49,842
Let the sport out of it!

812
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:52,798
No personal passions!

813
01:19:53,013 --> 01:19:56,841
The whole person must
be devoted to the party!

814
01:19:57,054 --> 01:19:58,595
The cause is just!

815
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:00,636
Get it?

816
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,588
Why are you yelling?

817
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:06,135
This fight, I will.
Tell your party.

818
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:08,178
You've taken everything.

819
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:13,087
Boxing is my pride.
-That is treason!

820
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:15,252
Listen,

821
01:20:15,472 --> 01:20:18,589
I will no longer be the shame
of my mother.

822
01:20:18,805 --> 01:20:20,346
Nobody can stop me.

823
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,513
Messaoud, nobody can stop me.

824
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:30,595
Said, it's an order.

825
01:20:30,806 --> 01:20:34,171
If he fights for the
enemy, he's a traitor.

826
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:37,465
-I do my fighting.
Do as you want.

827
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:40,590
Said, what is he worth, the kid from Algier

828
01:20:40,806 --> 01:20:42,797
if he has no hands?

829
01:20:43,015 --> 01:20:44,258
Or eyes.

830
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:46,757
You understand that?

831
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:51,546
Go ahead, kill your brother.

832
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,845
Kill me if you're a man.

833
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,172
I will make my fight.

834
01:20:57,348 --> 01:20:58,628
As you wish.

835
01:21:06,474 --> 01:21:07,848
You're crazy.

836
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,758
You're crazy!

837
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:20,796
-If it continues, I can not
do anything for him.

838
01:21:21,016 --> 01:21:24,844
The revolution is a bulldozer.
It destroys everything

839
01:21:25,058 --> 01:21:29,301
-How are you going to condemn?
-He disobeyed orders.

840
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:30,678
Brother or not

841
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,882
I'll come home.

842
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,890
You don't stop.

843
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,133
You shall not kill my brother.
Nobody shall!

844
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:39,263
Or,

845
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:45,099
shoot, my brother. Shoot!

846
01:21:48,392 --> 01:21:50,513
What happened to you?

847
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:52,716
You lost the head.

848
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,427
Thank you for all this.

849
01:22:16,393 --> 01:22:19,178
This evening, you'll
invite me to dinner.

850
01:22:21,935 --> 01:22:24,471
I'm sorry, I can't.

851
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:28,475
You have to.

852
01:22:28,685 --> 01:22:32,679
Otherwise, I'll stop delivering
the bags of money.

853
01:22:34,602 --> 01:22:35,680
Thanks.

854
01:22:35,894 --> 01:22:38,679
Forget the revolution
for an evening.

855
01:22:39,936 --> 01:22:41,180
Here.

856
01:22:42,311 --> 01:22:43,969
My brother is coming.

857
01:23:06,645 --> 01:23:08,885
Why are not you married?

858
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:13,436
I have not met my soul mate.

859
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:22,098
-That's my brother.
You have to go.

860
01:23:26,813 --> 01:23:28,554
Who's that? -Messaoud.

861
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,807
Goodbye.

862
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:41,271
A blonde?

863
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:44,221
What will others say?

864
01:23:44,438 --> 01:23:47,057
-There's nothing between
her and me.

865
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:50,136
Look.

866
01:23:51,814 --> 01:23:55,096
Otmani gave me the
plan of the office.

867
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:59,059
I also have invitations.

868
01:23:59,272 --> 01:24:00,552
That's good.

869
01:24:02,647 --> 01:24:04,224
You should take this.

870
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:07,141
It is loaded.
There are 5 rounds.

871
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:09,927
Release the safety clutch.

872
01:24:16,981 --> 01:24:18,143
Good.

873
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:47,096
Invitation?

874
01:24:50,316 --> 01:24:51,430
Here.

875
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:02,102
Lift your arms.

876
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,058
First floor. Wait there.

877
01:26:01,944 --> 01:26:03,686
Commissioner Picot?

878
01:26:04,027 --> 01:26:05,271
What do you want?

879
01:26:06,611 --> 01:26:08,020
No, stop!

880
01:26:18,236 --> 01:26:19,729
Give me that.

881
01:26:24,028 --> 01:26:25,106
Go!

882
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,564
Stop!

883
01:26:57,154 --> 01:26:59,026
Go! Go!

884
01:27:10,697 --> 01:27:12,771
They had false papers.

885
01:27:13,113 --> 01:27:17,522
Those who make them, they are connate.
The network.

886
01:27:26,197 --> 01:27:28,982
-What are you doing?
-I was worried.

887
01:27:29,197 --> 01:27:31,733
Worried about what?

888
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:34,566
Please don't come here anymore.

889
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:37,981
Don't come here!
It can be dangerous!

890
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:39,690
Don't come anymore!

891
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:03,819
"Long live the union

892
01:28:04,157 --> 01:28:06,148
for peace in Algeria."

893
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,611
French Communist Party.

894
01:28:08,824 --> 01:28:10,151
You have not changed.

895
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,941
Paris without the Krauts.

896
01:28:15,283 --> 01:28:19,063
-What are you doing, except
smashing doors

897
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:21,315
of honest citizens?

898
01:28:22,366 --> 01:28:25,400
I am still myself. For France.

899
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:27,862
Colonel! It has been found!

900
01:28:47,242 --> 01:28:48,699
Good job.

901
01:28:48,909 --> 01:28:50,946
Thanks, you may remember.

902
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,323
Bush! We have enough. Go.

903
01:28:56,993 --> 01:28:59,611
We must identify with this man.

904
01:28:59,826 --> 01:29:02,658
This time we take something.

905
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:05,652
We have a face. Need a name.

906
01:29:05,993 --> 01:29:09,738
Souni-Abdelkader, arrested
8 May 1945 in Sitif.

907
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:11,444
It is indeed the same.

908
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:14,492
He received his education in prison.

909
01:29:17,868 --> 01:29:21,151
Hideouts identified.
On surveillance.

910
01:29:21,368 --> 01:29:25,362
I want people to get their
hands on this Abdelkader.

911
01:29:37,827 --> 01:29:39,107
He grew up.

912
01:29:44,744 --> 01:29:46,569
He's a little man.

913
01:29:50,703 --> 01:29:52,279
He walks.

914
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:54,488
Thank God.

915
01:29:58,745 --> 01:30:01,150
For him, I did a lot.

916
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:23,115
Good-night.

917
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:25,996
Oh! Officers,
good evening.

918
01:30:26,204 --> 01:30:27,578
How you doing?

919
01:30:28,788 --> 01:30:30,032
You recognise this?

920
01:30:30,371 --> 01:30:31,829
Your name's Souni.

921
01:30:33,246 --> 01:30:35,118
You got friends in FLN?

922
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:38,991
Republic-Franaise.
I don't know.

923
01:30:39,872 --> 01:30:41,199
You don't know.

924
01:30:41,538 --> 01:30:45,070
No, Mr. Inspector.
I don't know the FLN.

925
01:30:45,289 --> 01:30:47,528
I own a proper business.

926
01:30:48,997 --> 01:30:51,865
You'll close. Security problems.

927
01:30:58,456 --> 01:31:00,114
Son of a bitch.

928
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:02,156
What are we gonna do?

929
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:05,454
-We'll close, my boy Vincent.
We'll close.

930
01:31:11,123 --> 01:31:15,827
-Ladies and gentlemen, we shut
down for security reasons.

931
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,319
Drinks will be offered.

932
01:31:17,665 --> 01:31:21,031
If you change your mind, alright.

933
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:58,165
-A cop called Faivre came
to close the cabaret.

934
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:00,365
Beware of him.

935
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:03,113
He has your picture, Abdelkader.

936
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:06,741
Don't come over to my home anymore.
Is that clear?

937
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,416
Neither one nor the other.

938
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:11,078
As they say here: I'm not playing anymore.

939
01:32:12,084 --> 01:32:12,996
Wait.

940
01:32:18,292 --> 01:32:19,489
Faivre-

941
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:22,659
I know a Faivre.

942
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:24,534
Colonel Faivre.

943
01:32:24,751 --> 01:32:26,457
From Dien Bien Phu.

944
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,324
Colonel?

945
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:59,117
Do you remember me?
2nd Class Souni,

946
01:32:59,336 --> 01:33:02,748
Algerians sharpshooters,
Dien Bien Phu.

947
01:33:03,086 --> 01:33:05,657
Camp 113, remember?

948
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,372
Get in the car.

949
01:33:26,087 --> 01:33:27,876
Tell me, Colonel,

950
01:33:28,087 --> 01:33:31,417
are you ashamed of what you did?

951
01:33:32,295 --> 01:33:33,325
No.

952
01:33:35,129 --> 01:33:38,660
I've invited you here to give you

953
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:41,249
a chance to redeem yourself.

954
01:33:42,796 --> 01:33:45,580
I'm pleased to see you.

955
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:47,621
A man without reproach.

956
01:33:47,962 --> 01:33:50,285
The assassinated cops

957
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:52,869
had no family?

958
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:57,414
-I serve a just cause.
-Me too.

959
01:33:57,754 --> 01:34:00,041
I am fighting for France.

960
01:34:00,255 --> 01:34:01,664
She has to stay an empire

961
01:34:02,005 --> 01:34:03,711
in order to exist.

962
01:34:04,046 --> 01:34:05,539
De Gaulle said that.

963
01:34:06,922 --> 01:34:09,375
Me too, I'm a Gaullist.

964
01:34:10,922 --> 01:34:14,702
How about if I told
you it were justified

965
01:34:14,922 --> 01:34:18,619
that French are silenced
by Algerians?

966
01:34:20,797 --> 01:34:25,419
Replace Algerians and French with
French and Germans

967
01:34:25,631 --> 01:34:27,289
and it is 1941.

968
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:33,869
You're on the wrong side.

969
01:34:34,089 --> 01:34:36,459
Unlike 10 years ago.

970
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:40,832
You would have been a good resistance.

971
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,377
I wish I would've had you.

972
01:34:46,506 --> 01:34:49,954
You could give me information

973
01:34:50,173 --> 01:34:52,662
on the minister's instructions.

974
01:34:57,257 --> 01:35:01,713
The resistance fighters now have
all the honour.

975
01:35:03,799 --> 01:35:06,122
It's not the same war.

976
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:10,548
There is a history between
France and Algeria.

977
01:35:10,882 --> 01:35:13,999
Algerian workers were federated

978
01:35:14,216 --> 01:35:17,084
because a whole nation is angry.

979
01:35:17,299 --> 01:35:19,586
For nothing, you think?

980
01:35:21,008 --> 01:35:23,378
Give us a little time.

981
01:35:23,591 --> 01:35:26,874
The Algerians will become citizens.

982
01:35:27,216 --> 01:35:29,622
Progress is a war.

983
01:35:30,217 --> 01:35:34,257
You can again be a
hero, not a loser.

984
01:35:36,133 --> 01:35:38,041
We are the same.

985
01:35:39,925 --> 01:35:42,923
Yes. We are sacrifices, Faivre.

986
01:35:43,717 --> 01:35:45,293
But you, the past.

987
01:35:50,884 --> 01:35:52,163
Colonel

988
01:35:56,009 --> 01:35:57,288
Colonel.

989
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:26,342
-One must fight terrorism
with its own weapons.

990
01:36:26,552 --> 01:36:30,628
For this, we will create
a secret organization

991
01:36:30,844 --> 01:36:34,968
which will take the appearance of
a criminal organization.

992
01:36:39,594 --> 01:36:42,165
The Minister of Justice
and the prefect

993
01:36:42,386 --> 01:36:44,922
guarantee us immunity

994
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:47,417
in our actions.

995
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:50,250
It will be called
"The Red Hand".

996
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:55,587
Its objective:

997
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,422
terrorize supporters of the FLN

998
01:37:01,512 --> 01:37:03,384
and kill its leaders.

999
01:38:31,307 --> 01:38:34,424
-They want us to fit
into their game

1000
01:38:35,974 --> 01:38:37,515
We will respond.

1001
01:38:38,432 --> 01:38:39,759
We will respond.

1002
01:38:55,891 --> 01:38:57,005
Mum...

1003
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,974
Don't be afraid.

1004
01:39:00,975 --> 01:39:03,759
It's an early stage tuberculosis.

1005
01:39:06,267 --> 01:39:08,802
This disease will not kill me.

1006
01:39:09,017 --> 01:39:10,510
Not in this country.

1007
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:15,682
Soon, I will get better.
Don't worry.

1008
01:39:17,892 --> 01:39:19,468
Don't worry.

1009
01:39:22,892 --> 01:39:24,930
Champion of the world. What?

1010
01:39:25,143 --> 01:39:26,849
World Champion!

1011
01:39:27,851 --> 01:39:30,138
The other one doesn't know boxing.

1012
01:39:30,351 --> 01:39:32,804
Let him come. Then hit.

1013
01:39:33,018 --> 01:39:36,882
How can I make one out of you?
Tell me!

1014
01:39:37,101 --> 01:39:39,886
Has he worked on his dodges?
-Yes.

1015
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:43,016
He made you work on your dodging?

1016
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:45,596
He's working on his dodges!

1017
01:39:57,602 --> 01:39:58,632
Yes

1018
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:01,930
Yes, that's fine.

1019
01:40:02,269 --> 01:40:03,431
Listen

1020
01:40:04,519 --> 01:40:06,095
Very important.

1021
01:40:08,894 --> 01:40:14,346
I want to invest everything I have
in a high level match.

1022
01:40:14,561 --> 01:40:16,801
First, he wins in France,

1023
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:19,852
then in Europe and
and then America.

1024
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:24,684
He'll write history,
you'll see.

1025
01:40:31,395 --> 01:40:33,137
Hurry up.

1026
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:34,509
Go!

1027
01:40:50,896 --> 01:40:52,270
Stop!

1028
01:40:53,438 --> 01:40:54,468
What is it?

1029
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:00,099
Go!

1030
01:41:11,188 --> 01:41:12,847
That's enough!

1031
01:41:13,188 --> 01:41:14,646
Lift!

1032
01:41:21,814 --> 01:41:23,390
A unit of Harkis

1033
01:41:23,731 --> 01:41:25,105
liquidated...

1034
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:28,520
The apartments are being monitored?
Yes.

1035
01:41:28,856 --> 01:41:33,478
-He's hosted somewhere.
We'll double the surveillance.

1036
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:37,221
Him we will have, but we'll
lose the war.

1037
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:38,813
They will win.

1038
01:41:53,982 --> 01:41:57,597
-Messaoud, my son,
here's my last will.

1039
01:41:57,815 --> 01:42:00,268
There is a bit of our land.

1040
01:42:00,482 --> 01:42:02,188
If we return to Algeria,

1041
01:42:02,524 --> 01:42:04,396
we'll plant a vineyard.

1042
01:42:04,607 --> 01:42:06,065
If I die before,

1043
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,101
place it like this on my cheek.

1044
01:42:09,316 --> 01:42:10,892
You will not forget?

1045
01:42:11,107 --> 01:42:12,648
Don't worry.

1046
01:42:12,858 --> 01:42:14,481
We're going home.

1047
01:42:20,524 --> 01:42:22,183
Mum.
-Yes.

1048
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,806
I don't want to lie to you.

1049
01:42:29,858 --> 01:42:31,399
I killed people.

1050
01:42:31,608 --> 01:42:33,931
I killed many.

1051
01:42:38,192 --> 01:42:39,566
With these hands.

1052
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,059
I've constriction.

1053
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:45,515
Mum. I've strangled.

1054
01:42:48,192 --> 01:42:50,432
I was forced to do so.

1055
01:42:50,651 --> 01:42:52,392
God is my witness.

1056
01:42:53,192 --> 01:42:55,562
So my son can have a better life.

1057
01:43:01,318 --> 01:43:04,186
Everything I've done, I've done for him.

1058
01:43:04,526 --> 01:43:07,477
Everything for him.

1059
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:12,190
For a long time, I've known
nothing but death.

1060
01:43:12,402 --> 01:43:14,439
I know nothing but death.

1061
01:43:14,652 --> 01:43:16,310
Forgive me, mum.

1062
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:29,147
Yes?

1063
01:43:33,361 --> 01:43:34,984
Good evening. Good evening.

1064
01:43:44,528 --> 01:43:46,684
I'm going to Germany.

1065
01:43:46,903 --> 01:43:49,189
You must accompany me.

1066
01:43:49,403 --> 01:43:51,358
-When?
-Tonight.

1067
01:43:53,362 --> 01:43:54,771
Okay.

1068
01:44:42,155 --> 01:44:46,978
- What we wanted to prove by taking
on these young soldiers?

1069
01:44:47,197 --> 01:44:48,773
Heinous crimes

1070
01:44:52,614 --> 01:44:54,071
Yes?
- Morvan.

1071
01:44:54,281 --> 01:44:58,737
An Algerian has entered the
theatre of Helene Legendre.

1072
01:44:58,947 --> 01:45:00,440
It's Abdelkader.

1073
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:02,353
We have them.

1074
01:45:02,573 --> 01:45:05,144
Red Hand will take care of them.

1075
01:45:06,364 --> 01:45:09,446
A policy of social democracy

1076
01:45:09,656 --> 01:45:11,860
wanted by the government.

1077
01:45:12,073 --> 01:45:15,569
That's what's worrying
the separatists.

1078
01:45:16,198 --> 01:45:17,774
Pressed to act,

1079
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:20,905
they wanted their bloody night.

1080
01:45:21,115 --> 01:45:22,524
And yet

1081
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,604
they have only managed to strengthen
our determination.

1082
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:52,782
Helene! Helene!

1083
01:46:33,243 --> 01:46:34,356
That's good.

1084
01:46:39,701 --> 01:46:40,815
Pay him.

1085
01:46:54,119 --> 01:46:58,657
MP40-machine guns, 200 units.
Fully revised.

1086
01:47:02,411 --> 01:47:05,776
Don't sleep!
Look, take more.

1087
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:08,074
Here. There you go, go!

1088
01:47:08,286 --> 01:47:09,447
Faster!

1089
01:47:10,286 --> 01:47:11,909
Let's go!

1090
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:13,742
Faster! Go!

1091
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:19,076
Operation completed.

1092
01:47:19,286 --> 01:47:22,368
Go to France, each on your own.

1093
01:47:22,578 --> 01:47:24,119
Not in groups.

1094
01:47:24,828 --> 01:47:26,202
One by one.

1095
01:47:26,995 --> 01:47:29,566
Above all, do not talk about it to anyone,

1096
01:47:29,912 --> 01:47:32,780
understood?

1097
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:35,238
Important.

1098
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:38,328
Absolute silence. Discipline.

1099
01:47:39,746 --> 01:47:41,369
God bless you.

1100
01:47:42,787 --> 01:47:43,984
Good luck.

1101
01:47:44,204 --> 01:47:46,823
In Paris, watch the curfew.

1102
01:47:47,954 --> 01:47:51,071
-See you soon, Messaoud.
-God bless you.

1103
01:48:01,705 --> 01:48:04,573
This is an American song.

1104
01:48:04,788 --> 01:48:05,985
It sucks.

1105
01:48:06,205 --> 01:48:08,610
They call that music?

1106
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:09,825
Dance.

1107
01:48:10,038 --> 01:48:11,117
Dancing?

1108
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:13,534
How does one dance to that?

1109
01:48:16,164 --> 01:48:17,076
That's good.

1110
01:48:24,497 --> 01:48:26,488
It's really a shame.

1111
01:48:26,706 --> 01:48:27,736
Shame.

1112
01:48:27,956 --> 01:48:30,444
I like that.
-I don't like it.

1113
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:27,326
What are you doing here?

1114
01:49:29,917 --> 01:49:30,947
The curfew.

1115
01:49:31,292 --> 01:49:35,700
-It's for Algerians.
Not for Moroccans.

1116
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,662
Your papers.

1117
01:49:46,959 --> 01:49:48,452
Follow us.

1118
01:49:59,876 --> 01:50:04,119
<i>...greeted at the airport

the next day...</i>

1120
01:50:11,127 --> 01:50:12,406
You're Algerian.

1121
01:50:15,168 --> 01:50:16,626
And Germany?

1122
01:50:19,252 --> 01:50:20,579
What

1123
01:50:20,919 --> 01:50:22,246
are you going to do?

1124
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:25,494
We know that the FLN
is in Frankfurt.

1125
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:30,084
<i>- France could become an
exporter of petrol...</i>

of Algeria."</i>

1128
01:50:41,294 --> 01:50:43,084
You want to tell me anything?

1129
01:50:43,795 --> 01:50:46,746
Well, you go back to the Harkis.

1130
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:52,117

<i>There is light for everyone.</i>

1136
01:51:08,921 --> 01:51:11,077
He has spoken. Valenciennes.

1137
01:51:30,546 --> 01:51:31,660
Hello?

1138
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,878
-Your brothers have been turned in.
-Who is this?

1139
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:38,999
- Otmani. I was in Indochina
with your brother.

1140
01:51:39,338 --> 01:51:40,748
This isn't a trap.

1141
01:51:40,963 --> 01:51:44,660
Messaoud saved me.
Hereby, I pay my debt.

1142
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,207
Where are they?

1143
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,838
In Valenciennes.

1144
01:52:29,215 --> 01:52:30,543
Salaam aleikoum.

1145
01:52:30,757 --> 01:52:33,080
Are you ready? Mount.

1146
01:52:33,424 --> 01:52:34,833
Take up arms.

1147
01:52:35,049 --> 01:52:36,423
Go, go!

1148
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:41,246
Machine guns on one side,
ammunition on the other.

1149
01:52:41,466 --> 01:52:42,840
Hurry.

1150
01:52:45,133 --> 01:52:46,294
Quick, quick!

1151
01:52:47,424 --> 01:52:49,664
Go! Ho, there!

1152
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:51,924
Discharged.

1153
01:53:10,759 --> 01:53:12,002
Silence!

1154
01:53:16,217 --> 01:53:19,583
Shhh! Listen. Listen.

1155
01:53:20,634 --> 01:53:21,664
Messaoud

1156
01:53:22,634 --> 01:53:23,664
The police.

1157
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:37,717
Hide!

1158
01:53:39,885 --> 01:53:40,998
Cover!

1159
01:53:59,719 --> 01:54:00,833
Warning!

1160
01:54:15,053 --> 01:54:16,131
Long live Algeria!

1161
01:54:35,095 --> 01:54:37,133
Abdelkader! Don't come out!

1162
01:54:38,346 --> 01:54:39,507
Hide!

1163
01:54:48,638 --> 01:54:50,510
Varin, with me!

1164
01:55:20,764 --> 01:55:23,169
Messaoud! Behind us!

1165
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:14,385
Get up!

1166
01:56:14,724 --> 01:56:15,921
Behind me!

1167
01:56:42,559 --> 01:56:44,348
Messaoud! Hurry!

1168
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:24,556
Easy.

1169
01:57:29,769 --> 01:57:31,262
Tell Mum,

1170
01:57:33,269 --> 01:57:34,299
my wife

1171
01:57:35,894 --> 01:57:37,091
my son...

1172
01:57:40,436 --> 01:57:42,474
Tell them to forgive me.

1173
01:57:44,228 --> 01:57:46,265
Don't forget, Abdelkader.

1174
01:57:46,478 --> 01:57:48,101
Hush, Messaoud.

1175
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,018
Don't talk.

1176
01:58:00,645 --> 01:58:01,924
My brother.

1177
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,390
My brother!

1178
01:58:08,104 --> 01:58:09,217
Messaoud.

1179
01:58:13,896 --> 01:58:15,093
Messaoud!

1180
01:58:47,314 --> 01:58:48,854
God rest your soul.

1181
01:58:50,022 --> 01:58:51,349
My brother.

1182
02:00:03,358 --> 02:00:04,851
Explain to Mum

1183
02:00:05,734 --> 02:00:06,895
and his wife

1184
02:00:08,025 --> 02:00:10,596
that he didn't die for nothing

1185
02:00:10,817 --> 02:00:12,523
but for justice.

1186
02:00:32,443 --> 02:00:36,022
The men are motivated.
Continue the fight

1187
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,066
against the police.

1188
02:00:38,277 --> 02:00:39,520
Abdelkader...

1189
02:00:39,735 --> 02:00:41,358
We need a demonstration.

1190
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:44,264
A peaceful demonstration.

1191
02:00:45,485 --> 02:00:47,310
All Algerians.

1192
02:00:47,652 --> 02:00:50,567
Our weapon to arrange the
independence.

1193
02:00:50,777 --> 02:00:54,273
-It will be a massacre.
The police will take revenge.

1194
02:00:54,610 --> 02:00:57,313
There will be deaths.
It's certain.

1195
02:00:57,527 --> 02:00:58,937
I agree.

1196
02:00:59,152 --> 02:01:02,684
But if the French government
uses repression against us,

1197
02:01:02,902 --> 02:01:05,473
it's in our interest.

1198
02:01:05,694 --> 02:01:08,894
Remember the international opinion.

1199
02:01:09,111 --> 02:01:12,109
The whole world will
be watching us.

1200
02:01:12,445 --> 02:01:15,810
Abdelkader, this will
serve our cause.

1201
02:01:17,403 --> 02:01:19,193
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1202
02:01:19,528 --> 02:01:20,855
Come with me.

1203
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:26,809
Abdelkader.

1204
02:01:27,028 --> 02:01:31,022
We need to organize this
demonstration in Paris,

1205
02:01:31,237 --> 02:01:32,564
At October 17th.

1206
02:01:32,779 --> 02:01:35,102
But you will not participate.

1207
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,070
For your brother,
don't meddle.

1208
02:01:38,279 --> 02:01:41,277
There will be cops, at the match.

1209
02:01:41,487 --> 02:01:43,277
You can be recognized.

1210
02:01:43,487 --> 02:01:44,945
No recklessness.

1211
02:01:45,154 --> 02:01:47,559
Your brother, we'll take care.

1212
02:01:48,113 --> 02:01:51,360
The match should not take place.
You agree?

1213
02:01:51,571 --> 02:01:52,436
Yes.

1214
02:01:52,654 --> 02:01:54,195
May God help us.

1215
02:01:58,071 --> 02:01:59,398
Be careful.

1216
02:02:20,697 --> 02:02:21,727
Good evening.

1217
02:02:37,323 --> 02:02:39,527
How's the kid from Algiers?

1218
02:02:40,198 --> 02:02:41,276
Faster.

1219
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:43,397
Who's the best?

1220
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,984
The champion?

1221
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:46,063
Me!

1222
02:02:46,282 --> 02:02:48,023
I already congratulate you.

1223
02:02:48,365 --> 02:02:49,988
There. Concentrate!

1224
02:03:25,241 --> 02:03:26,403
Said?

1225
02:03:26,742 --> 02:03:28,199
Said, come on.

1226
02:03:28,408 --> 02:03:30,067
Ah, my brother...

1227
02:03:30,408 --> 02:03:32,280
You've come!
-Listen...

1228
02:03:32,492 --> 02:03:35,063
The FLN is here.
They want to kill you.

1229
02:03:35,409 --> 02:03:36,783
Cancel the match.

1230
02:03:37,117 --> 02:03:39,321
What's that you're saying?

1231
02:03:39,534 --> 02:03:40,813
They will kill you.

1232
02:03:41,159 --> 02:03:42,533
Stop the match.

1233
02:03:42,867 --> 02:03:46,399
-You're not serious?
This match, it's my life!

1234
02:03:46,742 --> 02:03:48,200
We don't have time!

1235
02:03:48,409 --> 02:03:51,407
Cancel the match, understand?
Cancel it!

1236
02:03:54,784 --> 02:03:57,866
You're the only brother
I have left.

1237
02:03:58,076 --> 02:04:00,197
I don't want to lose you.

1238
02:04:01,535 --> 02:04:04,449
-All my life I've waited
for this moment.

1239
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:06,615
And you ask me to cancel?

1240
02:04:06,826 --> 02:04:09,031
But look, they are here.

1241
02:04:23,285 --> 02:04:24,778
Here, great.

1242
02:04:31,702 --> 02:04:32,781
Uncle.

1243
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:37,197
Get out.

1244
02:04:37,536 --> 02:04:38,733
What?

1245
02:04:39,078 --> 02:04:40,405
I'm warmed up.

1246
02:04:40,619 --> 02:04:42,077
Please.

1247
02:04:42,411 --> 02:04:45,113
What's wrong with your head?
-I'm begging you!

1248
02:04:45,453 --> 02:04:47,325
It's not possible.

1249
02:04:48,953 --> 02:04:51,489
Has he gone mad?
-Get out.

1250
02:04:51,828 --> 02:04:53,072
Please.

1251
02:04:55,537 --> 02:04:56,946
Sit down.

1252
02:05:03,954 --> 02:05:05,115
Get dressed.

1253
02:05:07,746 --> 02:05:10,032
Get dressed? Why?

1254
02:05:10,371 --> 02:05:13,037
Because there will be no match.

1255
02:05:13,371 --> 02:05:15,160
What, no match?

1256
02:05:15,496 --> 02:05:16,657
Calm down.

1257
02:05:16,871 --> 02:05:19,952
-Calm down?
Why can't I box?

1258
02:05:21,454 --> 02:05:24,073
Don't argue. There'll be no match.

1259
02:05:24,288 --> 02:05:25,829
I'm not getting dressed!

1260
02:05:26,038 --> 02:05:27,661
-They will kill you.
-Who?

1261
02:05:27,996 --> 02:05:29,738
The FLN.

1262
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:31,193
What FLN?

1263
02:05:31,413 --> 02:05:34,162
They will kill you if you box.

1264
02:05:34,497 --> 02:05:35,326
Listen to him.

1265
02:05:35,663 --> 02:05:36,409
Stay here.

1266
02:05:36,747 --> 02:05:38,572
I'll box.

1267
02:05:40,164 --> 02:05:41,360
Obey!

1268
02:05:41,705 --> 02:05:42,984
Get out.

1269
02:05:44,372 --> 02:05:45,746
They will kill you.

1270
02:05:48,914 --> 02:05:50,869
What are you doing?

1271
02:05:55,872 --> 02:05:57,662
You'll be a champion!

1272
02:06:23,957 --> 02:06:25,366
Stay behind me.

1273
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:05,280
Run!

1274
02:07:09,209 --> 02:07:10,749
Push!

1275
02:07:29,335 --> 02:07:30,578
Left!

1276
02:07:33,793 --> 02:07:35,202
Police!

1277
02:07:41,585 --> 02:07:42,829
Run, Said!

1278
02:07:58,294 --> 02:07:59,573
Watch out!

1279
02:08:00,627 --> 02:08:02,286
Move, move!

1280
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,578
Long live Algeria!

1281
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:31,248
Pardon me.

1282
02:08:35,379 --> 02:08:38,875
Long live Algeria!

1283
02:09:04,338 --> 02:09:08,415
Long live Algeria!

1284
02:09:12,589 --> 02:09:15,373
The Algerians out! Get out!

1285
02:09:28,423 --> 02:09:31,290
Abdelkader! Abdelkader!

1286
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,706
Go, my brothers!

1287
02:09:39,923 --> 02:09:41,830
Long live Algeria!

1288
02:10:03,549 --> 02:10:04,627
No!

1289
02:10:04,841 --> 02:10:06,298
Abdelkader!

1290
02:10:06,507 --> 02:10:07,835
Abdelkader!

1291
02:10:08,174 --> 02:10:09,371
Abdelkader!

1292
02:10:09,591 --> 02:10:10,965
No!

1293
02:10:11,299 --> 02:10:12,757
My brother!

1294
02:10:15,091 --> 02:10:16,465
Don't die!

1295
02:10:17,341 --> 02:10:18,503
No!

1296
02:10:18,716 --> 02:10:19,794
My brother!

1297
02:10:20,133 --> 02:10:21,626
No!

1298
02:10:24,883 --> 02:10:26,162
Abdelkader!

1299
02:10:27,175 --> 02:10:28,419
Don't die!

1300
02:10:29,467 --> 02:10:30,497
My brother!

1301
02:11:02,343 --> 02:11:03,752
You have won.

1302
02:11:05,926 --> 02:11:10,051
Long live Algeria!.... translated by : ansta: 3ady_20
