1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
What's your point, Major Kiefer?
Sir...

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,500
Just make sure we find the bodies.
We need to make a count.

3
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,260
The funerals...

4
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,700
There will be no funerals.
No next-of-kin.

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,860
Nothing ever happened here.
Colonel...

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,300
Ah. Here's one of them now.

7
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,780
SCREAMING

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,700
HORN BLARES

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm afraid it's the same
all over Hastings.

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,260
You could try the Royal, but I'm not
sure they'll have anything.

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,340
Major John Kiefer.
I have a reservation.

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,740
Major Kiefer. Yes.

13
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,500
I suppose you're on your way home?
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,660
Glad to get back to your family?
Look -

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,140
just give me the key, goddamnit,
and let me go to my room.

16
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,180
I'm sorry. I'm tired.

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,140
Thank you.

18
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,620
(SIGHS)

19
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,300
What some bunting, love?
How much?

20
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,860
Two and six a quarter yard -
and you don't need coupons.

21
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,100
That's outrageous.
You try and find any in the shops!

22
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,260
"Shift grease with Zixt hand soap!"

23
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,420
"Beecham's -
the golden rule of health."

24
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,340
I hope you take my point,
Miss Stewart.

25
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,100
Absolutely.
Short and pithy.

26
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,740
Six words, but they pin the product
down in the public mind.

27
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,620
That's what we'll be looking for
in a successful applicant.

28
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,180
I thought the position
was for a secretary, Mr Ingleton.

29
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,420
Secretary to our chief copywriter.
You'd also be his apprentice.

30
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,500
We're looking
for someone with imagination,

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,220
someone willing to grasp the nettle.

32
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,180
Oh, that's me.

33
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm willing to grasp it.
So!

34
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,580
Convince me.

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,060
I'm sorry?
Six words. A slogan I can't resist.

36
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,740
One that will persuade me
to take you on.

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,660
Well, um...

38
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,620
Can't keep the client waiting,
Miss Stewart.

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,460
Um...

40
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,940
Sam Stewart.
She gets the job done!

41
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,620
(SIGHS) Seven words.

42
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,260
Well, he's certainly an active
little chap. Nothing wrong there.

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,300
Both of you are in good health.

44
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,660
The only question
we have to ask is -

45
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,580
is he going to wait
for the end of the war?

46
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,260
How long do you think it will be?

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,300
The war or the baby?

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,220
I'm afraid
I couldn't predict either.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,740
But you've nothing to worry about,
Mrs Milner.

50
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,180
Have you a bed at St Mary's?
Yes. That's where I worked.

51
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,060
Let them look after you for once.

52
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,140
Have you chosen a name?
We're going to call him Winston.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,460
The fourth Winston this week.
Not surprising, I suppose.

54
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,780
Winston Milner.

55
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,900
We're still talking about it.

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,860
Aren't we?

57
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,420
How are you feeling?

58
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,540
Tired. I'm afraid
this wasn't very well timed.

59
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,580
I couldn't be happier.

60
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,820
I bought two dozen nappies
yesterday - one coupon each.

61
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,060
I don't know what we're going to do
about his clothes.

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,980
Well, last time I saw Sam,

63
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,780
she'd got her hands
on an army blanket

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,700
and was turning it
into a romper suit.

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,780
That's a fine start in life.
An old blanket.

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
At least he'll be born
in a world without war.

67
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,940
Oh! If he waits that long.

68
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,700
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,420
We've started moving stuff out.
I'd never have guessed.

70
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,700
I can't believe they
want to close the old place down.

71
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,620
The new building on Wilder Road -

72
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,620
it's a bit of an eyesore.
Nothing to do with me, Sergeant.

73
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,580
There's a Mr Griffiths waiting
for you, sir. Local councillor.

74
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,100
I put him in your office.
I hope that's all right. Fine.

75
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,660
Morning, sir.
Morning. How is she?

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,700
Just seen the doctor, sir.
All's well. Good.

77
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,060
Have you heard yet, Mr Milner?
Not yet.

78
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,460
Promoted to DI and a dad!
Not bad for a week's work.

79
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,220
I haven't been promoted yet.
It's in the bag.

80
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,620
And when you get your pip, maybe
you can put in a word for me.

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,980
No, not there.

82
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,580
It's the victory day celebrations.
Is it? What's the matter with them?

83
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,580
Well, large numbers of people
out on the streets day and night.

84
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,300
The council has a responsibility,
and there are certain issues

85
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
we have to keep in mind.
What issues in particular?

86
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,220
As far as I'm concerned,
none at all.

87
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,740
But as you'll see, I've been asked
to chair a committee

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,460
to look into all aspects
of public order and safety.

89
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,980
We've taken a room at the museum.

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,060
It was the only space we could get.

91
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,060
Your name is at the top.

92
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Well, ten o'clock tomorrow.
That's not a lot of notice.

93
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,500
We weren't given much notice
ourselves, Mr Foyle.

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,180
But I'm sure we can deal
with the matter expeditiously.

95
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
We do need to co-ordinate
with the police.

96
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,220
Well, of course.
Thank you.

97
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,500
Bye.

98
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,620
Thank you, Mr Longmate.
Shall we go inside?

99
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,660
..my wife's great-grandfather was
the first proprietor of the hotel.

100
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,100
So are you expecting the next
election soon, Mr Longmate?

101
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,940
Well, it can't happen soon enough
for me. There are certainly plenty

102
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,660
of Conservative MPs urging
the premier to end coalition.

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,260
And you're confident
of a Conservative victory?

104
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,780
Well, aren't you? I think
even most Labour MPs expect it.

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,260
Is it true you're planning
a victory celebration

106
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,300
in the streets of Hastings?
That's right.

107
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,460
You're paying for it yourself?
Yes.

108
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,580
You don't think
people might see that

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,780
as an inducement to vote for you
in the election?

110
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,220
You mean a bribe?

111
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,940
(TUTS) Well, I certainly hope not.

112
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,420
I think you underestimate
the electorate, Mr Charman.

113
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,860
You ask any of my staff
here at the hotel.

114
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,180
We deserve a party,
and we're going to have one.

115
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,860
The fact that I'm paying for it
is neither here nor there.

116
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,940
Thank you very much, sir.

117
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,980
Always glad to talk
to the Chronicle.

118
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,420
Sir, we've had a notification
of the committee meeting.

119
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,260
It's tomorrow
morning at ten o'clock.

120
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,740
At the town hall?
They had to move it to the museum.

121
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,180
There's a shortage of space.
Nothing surprises me.

122
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
This whole town's turned
on its head.

123
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,900
Would you like me to attend?
Ah, yes.

124
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,900
It would be good if you could take
minutes, Miss Hylton. Anything else?

125
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,180
We're getting an awful lot
of requests for rooms.

126
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,100
The telephone's
been ringing nonstop.

127
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,980
Hastings, the seaside,
the end of the war.

128
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,060
Where else would you want to be?

129
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,220
I've got something for you.
Oh, come in.

130
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,420
It didn't turn out quite as I hoped,
but...

131
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,900
It was that army blanket.
For the baby!

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,260
Oh! Thank you, Sam. It's...

133
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,340
Edith will love it.

134
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,820
Any news on the move yet?
I still haven't got my promotion.

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,860
Well, they'd be mad
not to promote you.

136
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,620
Oh, if you do go to Brighton,
will you need a driver?

137
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,900
I don't think I'll get a car.

138
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,020
Darn. Oh, well, better show my face.
Yeah.

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,660
KNOCK AT DOOR

140
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,540
Yeah?
Just to tell you I'm back, sir.

141
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,460
Thank you. How did it go?

142
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Not very well, I'm afraid, sir.
Oh?

143
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,820
I really don't know
what I'll do after the war.

144
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,020
I am glad Adolf's finally copped it
and all that,

145
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,940
but a part of me can't help
wishing it would go on another year.

146
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,420
Well, I'm glad
we don't all think like that.

147
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,020
No. It's a stupid thing to say,
I suppose.

148
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,500
I don't know.
This place is closing down,

149
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,780
you're retiring,
Milner's transferring to Brighton.

150
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,260
We've been together so long,
I feel I'm losing my family.

151
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,180
I don't know what I'm going to do.

152
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,940
I've tried advertising, accountancy,
three other offices,

153
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,700
but nobody seems to want me.

154
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,540
I'll probably go back to Leominster,

155
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,860
live with my parents
and become a governess or something.

156
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,940
Something here might interest you.

157
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Is it a job?
Well, sort of.

158
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,060
Organisation called SSAFA.
Mean anything?

159
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,980
No, sir. What is it?

160
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,700
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen
and Families Association.

161
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,740
Um, they help returning servicemen.

162
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,220
Help them how?
I'm not altogether sure,

163
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,860
but they need volunteers,
and it could be right up your street.

164
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,780
All right, sir. I'll breeze along.

165
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Don't you want to reconsider?

166
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,740
Reconsider what?
Retiring.

167
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,660
Um...no, thank you.

168
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,420
Did you get the bread?
Where did this come from?

169
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,700
What?
It was on the front door.

170
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,340
A tiger?
Yes. Who put it there?

171
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,100
I - I didn't see it.
It wasn't there this morning.

172
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,020
What is the matter with you, Mark?

173
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,780
What is it?
Nothing.

174
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,220
It must be something.
It's obviously upset you.

175
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,580
It's nothing.

176
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,100
Perhaps you ought to take something.
You're miles away.

177
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,940
I didn't get the bread.
All the bakers are sold out.

178
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,140
Right. Well, we won't have
bread with our tea, then.

179
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,380
It doesn't matter. I'll be in late.

180
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,260
You're always late.
Are you going to the pub? Mother.

181
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,500
You haven't been the same
since you came back.

182
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,740
I wish you'd tell me what happened.

183
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,460
You haven't been the same.

184
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,820
RADIO: 'I'm I'm in the village
of Luneberg,

185
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,580
and I'm watching the German army
coming into surrender.'

186
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,740
'German tanks, guns
a multitude of lorries

187
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,140
and infantrymen in their hundreds
have been arriving,

188
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,740
bringing with them beaten men.'

189
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,820
'In the midst
of these defeated soldiers

190
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,380
comes a huddle of RAF release
prisoners, cheering as they go by.'

191
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,180
'It's what we've been waiting for -

192
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,860
the end of the German army
in the north.'

193
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,020
I don't understand it, sir.

194
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,620
Hitler's dead, Goering's gone mad -
they say he's wearing a toga -

195
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,020
and the rest of them
are having their faces changed.

196
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,700
Why won't they announce
it's all over?

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,660
Beats me.

198
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,580
Station, sir?
No. The museum.

199
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,060
Taking a day off?
Wouldn't that be nice?

200
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,020
Oh, I spoke to the people at SSAFA.

201
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,620
I'm seeing them this afternoon.
Well, that's good.

202
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,740
Do you want me to wait for you, sir?
What a good idea.

203
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,260
Ziegler. That's a German name.

204
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,140
I was actually born in Austria.

205
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,900
Yes. Well, it's all the same now.

206
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,340
Forgive me, but I don't see what
business my nationality is of yours.

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,020
You don't come in here
without my say-so. Obviously.

208
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,700
If you want to disrupt this
committee because of my name...

209
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,660
Is there a problem?
No sir. Just checking the register.

210
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,980
Who are you?
Brown, sir.

211
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,820
Michael Brown. Assistant curator.

212
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I've been asked to keep an eye
on you gentlemen while you're here.

213
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm Henry Ziegler. Dr Ziegler.
How do you do? Christopher Foyle.

214
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,660
This gentleman seems to have
some problem with my parentage.

215
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,140
Not at all, sir.
I'm just doing my job.

216
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,020
All right for us to go in now,
do you think?

217
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,540
Oh, certainly, sir.
I'll tick you off. Up the stairs.

218
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,300
Odd place for a Victory Day
committee. Yeah, isn't it?

219
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, I think we must be through here.

220
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,460
..fortunately,
we still have supplies.

221
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,780
I just hope we're not going
to be accused of hoarding.

222
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,260
Ah, Mr Foyle. And Dr Ziegler.

223
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,260
May I introduce Martin Longmate,
who owns the Majestic Hotel.

224
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,100
Longmate. We've met, I think.

225
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,380
No. I don't think so.

226
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,140
Martin Longmate.
I feel sure I know the name.

227
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,540
You may have read about me.
Ah, yes? In the press.

228
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm standing for parliament.
Perhaps.

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,740
And Miss Hylton has kindly
agreed to take the minutes.

230
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,460
How do you do?

231
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,500
So are we all here?

232
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,780
One more still to come.
I'm sorry I'm late.

233
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,060
Christopher!
John.

234
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,260
What are you doing?
What are YOU doing?

235
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,140
I'm on the committee.
Well, me too.

236
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,380
I suppose now I come to think of it,
you're the first person they'd ask.

237
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,260
How are you?
Much the same.

238
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,140
But you were transferred.
That's right. But I'm back.

239
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,620
I'm Major John Kiefer,
with the 215th US Engineers.

240
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,300
We built the air base
at Hawthorn Hill.

241
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,580
That monstrosity!
So you don't like it, huh?

242
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,460
Well, it helped us launch the
invasion in Europe and win the war.

243
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,460
You know, I'm really sorry
if it spoiled the landscape.

244
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,180
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

245
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,060
No, no, no I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

246
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,380
It just took a lot of the...

247
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,220
blood, sweat, toil and tears
your Mr Churchill goes on about.

248
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,940
Are you waiting for someone?

249
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,860
DCS Foyle.
Ah.

250
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,660
Do you work here?

251
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,500
Yeah. I'm assistant curator.

252
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,100
Yeah, I was in the Home Guard
until they stood us down.

253
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,060
Now I'm back here.

254
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,900
Do you know
how long they're going to be?

255
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,180
I couldn't believe it -

256
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,260
they've got a Jerry up there!
Did you see that?

257
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,500
No, I can't say I did.

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,220
I mean, you read
what that lot have been doing,

259
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,540
Belsen and all that stuff,
and it makes you sick.

260
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,420
They're not human.
Well,

261
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,340
forgive and forget, I suppose.

262
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,020
Not a bit of it. We ought
to kill the whole lot of them.

263
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,900
Wipe them off the face of the earth.

264
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,460
Nice talking to you.

265
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,780
Shall we start at the beginning?

266
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,220
Public order offences.
Like what, Mr Griffiths?

267
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,620
The destruction
of public property, for a start.

268
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,580
Are you aware that several park
benches have already disappeared,

269
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,660
dismantled, we believe,
to make bonfires?

270
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,460
Boy, that's the British. You come
out of a war and start worrying

271
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,260
about a few park benches.
Major Kiefer, I should remind you

272
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,500
there are many hundreds
of GIs here in Hastings,

273
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,140
not known for their orderly conduct
when it comes to street parties.

274
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,420
I guess you've got it in
for the Yanks, haven't you?

275
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,580
I didn't say that.

276
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,540
Maybe I should remind you,
Mr Griffiths,

277
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,180
the end of the war was announced
on US bases a week ago,

278
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,420
and, ah, we didn't
have any problems.

279
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,740
A week ago?
Actually, it was an error.

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,180
But uh, we didn't lose our heads.
No dead bodies.

281
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,260
Look, there will be offences -

282
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,980
drunkenness,
destroying public property.

283
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,180
But uh, surely to goodness,
after five years,

284
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,100
people deserve
to let their hair down.

285
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,340
And you're organising a party,
is that right?

286
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,420
It's to be the largest
in the south of England.

287
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,220
Mr Longmate's paying for it himself.

288
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm just doing my bit,
as I wasn't able to fight.

289
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,780
You weren't fit for active service?

290
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,260
A problem with my eyes.

291
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,580
Your eyes?
That's right.

292
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,940
Anything else?
Besides park benches?

293
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,060
Right now,
we need all the help we can get.

294
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,900
Our main role is a practical one.

295
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,420
Information, to begin with.

296
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,700
You worked with the police?
Yes.

297
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,460
Well, a bit of detective work
may be called for.

298
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,500
We have thousands of soldiers
searching for friends and families.

299
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,980
People have moved.

300
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,580
Many have been bombed out.

301
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,260
And then there are
wounded or missing servicemen

302
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,100
with families searching for them.

303
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,980
How can I help?

304
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,140
Well, we have people coming in
every day,

305
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,540
and every single one of them
has a different need.

306
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,860
It may just be
a question of clothing.

307
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,180
Don't they get demob suits?
That's hardly adequate.

308
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,780
No, we have a central clothing branch
in London

309
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,740
that sends out almost
a million pieces of clothing a year.

310
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,220
Then there's food, housing

311
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,460
or just a friendly face,
someone they can talk to.

312
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Well, that's me.

313
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,860
Miss Stewart,
I think I should warn you,

314
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,300
some of these men are more damaged
than any of us really understands.

315
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,500
Fighting in a war,
being taken prisoner, being injured -

316
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
just being away,
in some cases for years -

317
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,220
it takes its toll.
I'm sure.

318
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,220
So you think you can cope?
I'll give it my best shot.

319
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,020
Not quite the right expression
in the circumstances,

320
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,220
but let's see how you go.

321
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,140
Bodies.

322
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,860
Thank you, Major Kiefer.
Hundreds of them!

323
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,380
It was nobody's fault, Major.
That's not true.

324
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,580
You know it's not true.
Who cares about truth?

325
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,860
We win the war. That's all
that matters. Just get back home.

326
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,740
(ECHOING) Just get back home...
Just get back home...

327
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,380
Ahh!

328
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,420
(FIGHTS FOR BREATH)

329
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
Ah...

330
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,580
BIRDSONG

331
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,340
MUSIC ON RADIO

332
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Eddie!

333
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,220
Be careful with that! That's a
hundred quid's worth of best china.

334
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,020
Best china? All we've got in
the canteen is a few cracked mugs.

335
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,940
Evidence, Miss Stewart. Nicked
from a warehouse in Eastbourne.

336
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,860
The case comes up next month.

337
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,780
Morning, sir.
Sergeant.

338
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,060
There's something in the paper
you ought to see.

339
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,420
Don't tell me.
They finally announced it's over?

340
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,660
No such luck.
No, it's on the employment page.

341
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I thought it might suit you.

342
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,820
Prospective conservative
candidate seeks personal assistant.

343
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,540
I don't know, Brookie.
I don't know a thing about politics.

344
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,900
You don't know
about advertising either,

345
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,740
but that didn't stop you.
That's true.

346
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,660
It's a local number.
Why not give it a ring?

347
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,420
Yeah, I could do worse.

348
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,740
Then if he does get in,
you could be in Parliament.

349
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,300
Maybe I'll meet Winnie!
Yeah. Morning, Mr Milner.

350
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,100
Morning.

351
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,340
CLATTERING
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,980
Sorry, sir.

353
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,060
Sir?
Sergeant.

354
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,220
How was the committee?
Well, a complete waste of time.

355
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,300
A lot of talk
about nothing in particular,

356
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,500
no action at the end of it -
as expected, really.

357
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,300
At least it's over. No,
they want us back tomorrow. Hello?

358
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,060
Hotel reception, please.
A Saturday?

359
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,380
We have to be prepared
for every eventuality, it seems.

360
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,860
VE Day. That's what they're
calling it. Victory in Europe.

361
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,060
Hello? I understand you have
a Major Kiefer is staying with you.

362
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,940
Is that right?

363
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,540
Why didn't you tell me you were
coming home? All right, ain't it?

364
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,340
Stop and ask someone
if I could use the blower.

365
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,980
You could have written.
I only got out at the last minute.

366
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,940
There was a spare seat on a Dakota
and the CO said I could have it,

367
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,900
cos I'd been out there the longest.

368
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,100
So where were you?
I don't even know where you've been.

369
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,780
It was an island.
A place called Ist.

370
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,380
Ist?

371
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,620
That's a funny name.
Yeah.

372
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,500
We'll have to find it on the map.

373
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,940
It would have been easier
knowing where you were.

374
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,860
That was the worst of it.

375
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,060
Well, we moved around a bit.

376
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,260
Here...give me a hug.

377
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,060
You feel different.
What are you talking about?

378
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,300
I don't know. You've put on weight.

379
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,180
That's not a nice thing to say!

380
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,540
No. It suits you. It's funny though.

381
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,020
What?

382
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
Nothing.

383
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,660
You're different too, Eddie.

384
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,300
How?
I haven't seen you for four years.

385
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,140
You've been away for four years.

386
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,540
It's like I'm meeting you
for the first time.

387
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,340
Yeah...well, we've got
a lot of catching up to do.

388
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,020
Not now! I've got to get to work.

389
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,260
You're not serious.

390
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, I'm not going to work.
Of course I'm not.

391
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,780
But I've got to let Mr Longmate
know.

392
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,580
I'll have to call in.
Who's Mr Longmate?

393
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,180
My boss. I wrote to you.

394
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,140
The Majestic Hotel.
He gave me a job.

395
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,060
Is that all he gave you?

396
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,860
Don't say things like that!

397
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,180
Why don't you come along with me?

398
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,100
Yeah. Maybe I will.

399
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,780
We'll go along together.
You can meet Mr Longmate.

400
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
Maybe he can help you.

401
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,220
Why should I need any help?
You need a job.

402
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,500
A job? Work?

403
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,380
The war's over, Eddie.
We need to start again.

404
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,420
Yeah.

405
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,660
You made it.

406
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,900
That's all that matters.

407
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,260
And we're together.

408
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,060
I can't bear it.

409
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,900
Your blood pressure is very high.

410
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,060
When did you last get
a proper night's sleep?

411
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,140
I can't sleep.

412
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,300
Maybe it's the silence.
You'd be surprised

413
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,380
how many people
find it impossible to sleep

414
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,820
without bombs dropping, and sirens.
I need something.

415
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,500
What you need is to rest.
Rest.

416
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,380
What is it you've got on your mind?
I'm being persecuted.

417
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,220
Persecuted?

418
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,700
Because of what happened.
It was terrible. Horrible.

419
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,660
But it wasn't just me.
Please, old chap.

420
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,740
Try to calm down.
You're not making sense.

421
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,540
Why are they blaming me?
Nobody's blaming you for anything.

422
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,420
You've worked yourself
up into a state.

423
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I can't even go out of the house.

424
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,820
Look, I'm going to give you
a prescription.

425
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,260
Something to calm you down
and help you to sleep.

426
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,540
And I think you should give
our next committee meeting a miss.

427
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,220
You're in no state for anything.
It wasn't my fault!

428
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,660
I don't deserve this!

429
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,380
I'm very, very pleased to meet you,
Edward.

430
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,260
You didn't tell me
he was coming home.

431
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,020
I didn't know.

432
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,340
Can I get you anything?
A drink? Something to eat?

433
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,060
I'm all right, thank you, sir.
Do sit down.

434
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,100
Well, I imagine
you've been around the houses, then.

435
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,220
Tunisia, Greece, Albania,
Libya and Italy. That's right, sir.

436
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,300
Quite a war.
You could say that.

437
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,820
You're glad it's over?

438
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,580
I can imagine
you'll find it hard to adapt -

439
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,700
Civvy Street and all that.
I just need time to myself, sir.

440
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,980
With my wife.
Of course. Janice,

441
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,820
you must take
as much time as you need.

442
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,300
I hate to let you down, Mr Longmate.
Don't even think of it.

443
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,860
And Edward, when you've had
a chance to settle in a bit,

444
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,940
you must come and see me.
You were a joiner before the war?

445
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,180
A general carpenter, sir.

446
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,340
We've plenty of work.
We'll have a place for you.

447
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,660
What about the committee,
Mr Longmate?

448
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,020
Susan can come with me. Don't worry.

449
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,540
The luggage is in?
All in, sir.

450
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,980
LID BANGS

451
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,340
It's nothing, Eddie. Come on!

452
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,780
I have an appointment
with Mr Longmate. It's Miss Stewart.

453
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,820
I'll let him know you're here.

454
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,340
Well, here we are again.
Just like old times.

455
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,540
Is it?

456
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,460
You tell me.
Here. I brought you something.

457
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,900
That's very kind of you.

458
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,420
I figured supplies might be low.
You're right.

459
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,300
You can open it.

460
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,060
Oh, it's a bit early for me.

461
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,340
Not for me.
Sit down.

462
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,620
Water?
No, thanks.

463
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,180
How's your boy?
I wish I knew.

464
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,540
He's in Malta.
Haven't heard for quite a while.

465
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,940
So why do you want to see me?

466
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,500
I said I'd like to see you if you
had time. Not quite the same thing.

467
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,980
So this isn't official?
No.

468
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Bottoms up.

469
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,660
Another?
No, thank you, Christopher.

470
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,580
I don't need another.

471
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,900
You asked me to come over here.
I want to know why.

472
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,300
Well, look, it just occurred to me

473
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,900
that after the surprise
of meeting the other day,

474
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,860
you've been in Hastings,
haven't been in touch - I wondered

475
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,820
if everything was all right.
I'm fine. Glad to be back.

476
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,860
You've been in Devon. Is that right?
Yeah.

477
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,580
And it rained even more
than it does here.

478
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,660
Do any fishing?
Never got the chance.

479
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,780
Well, listen, I'm going out tomorrow.
Interested?

480
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,020
I thought
we were all meeting again tomorrow.

481
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,220
The goddamn committee.
The goddamn committee

482
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,140
is in the afternoon.
We've got the morning.

483
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,820
No thanks, Christopher. I'll pass.

484
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,460
I kind of lost the taste
for fishing over the years.

485
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,780
I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,820
I lost the taste
for a lot of things.

487
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,660
You know what?

488
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,060
I just want to go home.
That's about the size of it.

489
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,940
Well, here we are.
Please take a seat.

490
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,300
Um, tell me about your war,
Miss Stewart.

491
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,220
Well, there's not much to tell,
really.

492
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,340
I started out in the MTC.
Motorised Transport Corps.

493
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,260
And then I was transferred
to the police.

494
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,780
A detective?
No such luck.

495
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
A driver. And that's
what I've been doing ever since.

496
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,900
And are you interested in politics?

497
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,180
Absolutely.

498
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,580
So what are your views on,
for example, Beveridge

499
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,700
and his ideas
for a National Health Service?

500
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,020
Oh - I'm all for it.

501
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,300
But we also want to reduce taxation.

502
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,460
Can't you do both?
It may not be possible.

503
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,860
Ah. That is a bit tricky, isn't it?

504
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,020
Have you thought about Labour plans
for public ownership?

505
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,900
Constantly.

506
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,980
Look. I don't really know much
about politics, Mr Longmate.

507
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,900
In fact
I don't really know anything.

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,460
But it seems to me we trusted Mr
Churchill to get us through the war,

509
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,380
and we ought to trust him
with the peace.

510
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,460
Well, that's very honest of you,
Miss Stewart,

511
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,300
and honesty in politics
can be a very rare commodity.

512
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,660
I wonder if you'd have lunch
with me tomorrow?

513
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,780
Oh! Well, I'm not sure I'm -

514
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm sorry. That's forward of me.
Please don't take it the wrong way.

515
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,820
You see, a large part of the work
being my personal assistant

516
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,860
will involve one-to-one contact
with me and with my constituents.

517
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,540
We need to know
that we can get along.

518
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
So all I'm proposing is something

519
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,060
a little less formal
than this interview.

520
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm afraid I'm not free for lunch.
I'm working with SSAFA.

521
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,900
That's very commendable. Does you
credit. How about dinner?

522
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,340
Tomorrow?
The hotel has a very good cook.

523
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I suppose so. All right.

524
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,460
Well, I'll see you here at seven
o'clock, and we can talk some more.

525
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,060
You're not eating anything.
I'm not hungry.

526
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,940
You must be hungry.

527
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
That's the best tinned salmon.

528
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,460
I don't know the last time I opened
a tin. I never have enough points.

529
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,860
Where did you get it?
The hotel.

530
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,260
Longmate?
What's wrong with you, Eddie?

531
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Yes, he gave it to me for you.
He's looked after me.

532
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,420
What's that meant to mean?

533
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,900
He's given me a job!

534
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,100
I had to do something
while you were away.

535
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,300
Is this how it's going to be?

536
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,820
You've come back,
but it's like I hardly know you.

537
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,540
I need to see someone.
Who?

538
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,740
The quack. I've got gut-rot.
I need to see someone.

539
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll make you an appointment.
It's all right. I've done it.

540
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,540
Dr Ziegler.
Ziegler?

541
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,220
I'm seeing him tomorrow.

542
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,100
You should let me look after you.

543
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,700
You can.
I'll tell you where you can start.

544
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,300
What is it you're not telling me?

545
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,820
Where've you been?
The pub. I felt like a drink.

546
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,700
You could have had a drink here.
There's nothing in the pantry.

547
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,620
Have you eaten?

548
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,460
No.

549
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,140
Would you like something?
It's all right, Mother.

550
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,820
You've got to eat.

551
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,180
What's this? I don't know.
It's addressed to you.

552
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,380
Who delivered it?

553
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,060
I didn't see.

554
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,020
Someone knocked on the door.
I went outside

555
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,100
and it was there on the step.

556
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,820
You didn't see them?

557
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,980
I just told you.

558
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,420
Are you going to open it?

559
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,900
No.

560
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,340
(SOBS)

561
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,940
VERA LYNN:
# When The Lights Go On Again

562
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,860
# All over the world

563
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,580
# And the boys are home again

564
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,140
# All over the world

565
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,860
Dad?

566
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,260
I thought I'd find you here.

567
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,500
# A kiss won't mean goodbye

568
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,620
# But hello to love... #

569
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,540
Here you are.
Cheers, Dad.

570
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,300
Hm! A full bottle of scotch.
Where on earth did you get that?

571
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,580
Well, it's bourbon.
Ah, Americans.

572
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah, a friend of mine. Well, he was.

573
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,420
So is this just a visit,
or are you back for good?

574
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,380
I'm not flying any more.

575
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,380
I had a touch of sinusitis
a couple of months ago.

576
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,220
More than a touch.
Four days in hospital.

577
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,900
Cured?

578
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,980
Don't ask. It was bloody painful.

579
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,100
Then the Group Captain sent me home.

580
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,980
So you're out of it?

581
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,340
Yes. I made it.

582
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,940
I can't stop thinking
about all the ones who didn't.

583
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:54,180
Rex Talbot. Charlie Paige.
So many of them.

584
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,980
They were my friends, and yet
it's like I hardly knew them.

585
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,820
Here one day, gone the next.

586
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,300
The best of the best.

587
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,980
Why them, not you?

588
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,460
That's what I wonder all the time.

589
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,660
Perhaps you were the better pilot.

590
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,900
You know, what they say
is exactly the opposite.

591
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,780
The real fliers, the ones
who knew what they were doing,

592
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,020
they were the easiest to bring down.

593
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,500
It was the lazy bastards,
the ones who cut corners,

594
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
who didn't do it by the book -

595
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,580
we got away with it because
Jerry didn't know what to expect.

596
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,140
You're definitely
leaving the police?

597
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,540
Can't wait.

598
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,100
How's Sam?
Why do you ask?

599
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,380
Just wondering.

600
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,380
You met somebody else, didn't you?
Yeah.

601
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,580
It didn't work out.

602
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,700
Debden was bloody awful,
if you want the truth, Dad.

603
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,180
It drizzled the whole time and the
only decent pubs were in Cambridge.

604
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,140
I didn't like the training.
I missed my Spit.

605
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,860
Kate was a nice girl.
In the WAAF.

606
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,540
I sort of persuaded myself
I was in love with her,

607
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
but I wasn't.

608
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,780
Well, Sam's all right.
I mean, she's still the driver,

609
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,940
and she's got some voluntary work
with SSAFA.

610
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,380
I'd like to see her.

611
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,460
Maybe I'll look her up.
You weren't very kind to her.

612
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,780
I know.

613
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,620
Stupid bloody war.

614
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,220
Do you think it was worth it, Dad?

615
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,860
Well, we've all paid a price,
some more than others,

616
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,900
but I have absolutely no doubt
whatsoever.

617
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,820
Yes.

618
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,340
And I'm very glad you're back.

619
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,100
PHONE RINGS

620
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,060
Hello?

621
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,940
'It was just a few numbers.'

622
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,020
Who is this? What do you want?

623
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,060
More than 700 American boys
died because of you.

624
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,260
That's not true.
I wasn't responsible.

625
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,740
You're mistaken. Now leave me alone!

626
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,420
You look like
you could do with a cup.

627
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,060
The sugar's had it, I'm afraid.

628
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,820
I don't take sugar.
That's all right, then.

629
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,700
I'm Sam Stewart.

630
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,660
Hylton. Edward. Ed.

631
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,820
Just back?
Yeah.

632
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,500
Where were you?
All around.

633
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,140
Army?
Y Patrol.

634
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,260
Long range desert group,

635
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,220
signals operator.

636
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,980
You must be glad to be out.
No. No, I'm not sure I am.

637
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
I don't know
why people aren't more cheerful.

638
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,300
The war's over,
but everyone seems the same.

639
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,460
Maybe it hasn't sunk in yet.

640
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,100
I was told you could help with work
and that sort of thing.

641
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,940
We can try.

642
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,220
So what can you do for me,
Miss Stewart?

643
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,660
Well, we have a booklet.

644
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,860
It tells you what kind of things
we have on offer -

645
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,780
university grants, training,
employment schemes and so on.

646
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,180
Are you all right for money?

647
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,700
I've got money. They gave me
eight weeks' paid leave.

648
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,060
And you have somewhere to live?
I have a house,

649
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,500
but I'm thinking of moving.
I don't want to stay in Hastings.

650
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,540
Maybe you should try
the Resettlement Advice Office.

651
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,860
There's one in Welham Road.
Welham Road.

652
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,660
And did you know
we have a married families club?

653
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,100
Are you married?
You might like to join.

654
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,300
I'm sorry.
If you want the honest truth,

655
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,140
this is my first day here
and I'm not much cop at it.

656
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm all right at making a cup
of tea, but that's about it.

657
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,620
Do you want me to find someone else?
No. I've got nothing to say.

658
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,500
Is it really so bad, being back?

659
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,220
I don't know where I am any more.

660
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,140
I don't know what to believe.

661
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,340
Four years out there,
behind the lines,

662
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,260
doing what we did,

663
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,660
all of us together.

664
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,020
And they suddenly tell us
it's all over,

665
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,900
and we've got to come back
and start again.

666
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,740
How are we meant to do that?

667
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,340
How are we meant to
put it all behind us?

668
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,180
A cup of tea,
married families club...

669
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,100
Half my mates got killed out there.

670
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,380
Maybe they were the lucky ones.

671
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,940
I don't understand
why they keep hanging on.

672
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,740
It's bad for people, waiting
all the time for an announcement.

673
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,380
I'm getting a lot of patients

674
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,300
with nervous conditions,
depressed, unable to sleep.

675
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,940
I heard a rumour it'll be tomorrow.
I heard that rumour about today.

676
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,540
I have received confirmation
that when the victory is announced,

677
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,460
public houses are to remain open
until midnight.

678
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,500
Now where is it?

679
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,220
Licensing hours,
Hastings and Eastbourne.

680
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,820
Is that what you're looking for?
Thank you.

681
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,780
As Dr Ziegler said,
I haven't slept myself.

682
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,220
That's too bad.

683
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,940
Are you well enough to go on?
Yes, yes.

684
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,860
That's why we're all here.

685
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,380
More whisky and gin has been
distributed across the south coast,

686
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,540
in bottles marked
NOT TO BE SOLD UNTIL VICTORY NIGHT.

687
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,300
We need to be sure that's
strictly adhered to, Mr Foyle.

688
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,100
I don't quite see how
we're supposed to do that, exactly.

689
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,420
We can send officers
into as many pubs as you like,

690
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,940
but the chances of them coming out
again are pretty slim, I'd have said.

691
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,940
So what did he say?

692
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,260
Dr Ziegler wasn't there,
but the nurse saw me.

693
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,100
There's nothing to worry about.
The baby's being slow, that's all.

694
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,860
Janice!

695
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,580
I'm sorry?

696
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,660
It's Edith! You must remember.

697
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,660
We met at Dr Ziegler's.
No. You're wrong. I don't know you.

698
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,060
But you were...

699
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,260
I'm sorry. I must have
mistaken you for somebody else.

700
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,660
Who was she?
I don't know. I never met her.

701
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,340
She knew your name.
I didn't know hers.

702
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,020
You look tired, Edward.

703
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,660
I've got a few errands to run.
Why don't you go home on your own?

704
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,820
Right. I don't think there are
any other matters outstanding.

705
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,140
Well, if that's so,

706
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,340
would you mind very much
if I took myself off?

707
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,900
I still have a party to organise.
How many people are you inviting?

708
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,620
The whole town's invited, Dr Ziegler
- that includes you.

709
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,860
Ah, thank you. But I think I shall
be staying peacefully at home.

710
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,740
There'll be enough whisky and gin
for everyone, that I can promise.

711
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,580
Not to be sold until victory night.
Exactly.

712
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,020
We wouldn't want to be sending out
the wrong signals.

713
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,420
Miss Gilbert will take the minutes,
and I'll say good day.

714
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,420
I should be going as well.
Ah, Mr Foyle, there was one thing

715
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,260
I wanted to talk to you about.
Yeah?

716
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,900
Um, it's a private matter. I wonder
if I might call in at the station?

717
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,780
Are you there this afternoon?

718
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,820
I am. Any time you like.
Thank you.

719
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,580
You going my way?
No, I need some shuteye.

720
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,140
I'm heading back to the hotel.
Ah, right.

721
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,940
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.

722
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,660
It's Saturday.
What are you doing here?

723
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,460
I thought you might like
to get out, sir.

724
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,020
The sooner the better.

725
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,300
Good day, Mr Griffith.

726
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,220
What are you doing with that?
What do you think? Burning it!

727
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,780
Good lads.

728
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,580
Bunting! Union Jacks!
Red, white and blue!

729
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,780
No street party's complete -
buy your colours.

730
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,180
A couple of flags, please.
Five bob each, mate.

731
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,580
Five bob? You're pulling my leg.
You want one, that's what you pay.

732
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,420
(SIGHS)

733
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,420
All right. I'll have this one.
That one's two quid.

734
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,180
What?
This one's five bob.

735
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,180
You're not serious!
Do I look like I'm joking?

736
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,060
You don't like it, go elsewhere.

737
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,980
People died for this flag.
Don't that mean something?

738
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,420
I'm trying to do business. No,
what you're doing is profiteering.

739
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,620
You hadn't noticed
there's a law against that?

740
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,300
Says who? The war's over, mate.
Or haven't they told you?

741
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,220
The law's still the law.
What are you going to do? Arrest me?

742
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,180
Yeah. That's what I'm going to do.

743
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,380
My name is Sergeant Brooke,
Sussex constabulary.

744
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,420
And you are coming with me.
Oh, bloody hell.

745
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,180
Stop that man!

746
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,380
Stop! Stop that man!

747
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,180
Stop!

748
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,020
Stop! Stop!

749
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,500
STOP!

750
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,140
Hey! Stop! Stop that man!

751
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,820
DOGS BARK

752
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,540
Stop!
Aargh!

753
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,420
(GROANS)

754
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,660
Miss Stewart.
How very good of you to come.

755
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,220
Thank you for inviting me.
Shall we go in?

756
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,140
Mm.

757
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,540
May I ask you something,
Mr Longmate?

758
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,540
Do you invite everyone who's
applied for this job to dinner?

759
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,940
Absolutely not. Shall we say you're
um...through to the second round.

760
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,420
Two advantages to owning an hotel.

761
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,340
Deep cellars, and...
I get to choose who drinks what.

762
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,900
How did you come to own an hotel?

763
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,900
I'd like to say that I started from
the bottom and worked my way up,

764
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,380
but I'm afraid that's not true.

765
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,940
I inherited the hotel
when my wife died.

766
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,380
I'm sorry.

767
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,220
It was at the very start of the war.

768
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,300
She was...visiting a friend
in London and er...

769
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,540
..took a direct hit.

770
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,780
Well, there have been so many
casualties, so much suffering,

771
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,260
and that's why this election
will be so important.

772
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,420
We've got to rebuild.
It's a chance to start again.

773
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,660
You never told me what you expect
your assistant to do.

774
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,580
To stay close to me.
To be someone I can trust.

775
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,980
That's not quite what it said
in the advertisement.

776
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,860
Well, I was paying by the word.

777
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,540
So you were in the MTC?
For a year.

778
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,940
And then the police.
That's rather unusual.

779
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,580
Who exactly did you drive?

780
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,940
A detective. Here in Hastings.

781
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,020
His name is Mr Foyle.

782
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,380
Christopher Foyle?
Yes.

783
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,860
Have you met him?
Yes, I was with him this afternoon.

784
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,660
Martin.

785
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,140
Miss Hylton!
I've been looking for you.

786
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,780
I'm afraid this is a private dinner.
I really can't talk now.

787
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,460
A private dinner?

788
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,500
I know what you're doing.

789
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,420
I know exactly what you're doing!
Janice,

790
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,420
remember, this is a public place.
you can't behave like this.

791
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,700
I need to speak to you.
Not now! Now!

792
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,620
SILENCE FALLS

793
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,300
Miss Stewart, I'm afraid
you're going to have to forgive me.

794
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,220
This is my current secretary,
who is a little distraught,

795
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,980
but er...to be honest, if I may,

796
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,260
I don't think you'd be right
for the post.

797
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,180
I'm very sorry.

798
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,100
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

799
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,260
I've got to work.
You're not serious.

800
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,980
Well, it's not exactly how I'd choose
to spend my Sunday.

801
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,940
Who's been murdered this time?
A man called Ziegler. Dr Ziegler.

802
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,060
German?
Austrian.

803
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,580
But as English as you and me.

804
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,980
So who killed him?

805
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,900
Well, don't ask me, I've no idea.

806
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,700
What are you gonna do
while I'm gone?

807
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,100
Oh, I don't know.
Not much, I don't think.

808
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
Poor Dad!
It could only happen to you!

809
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,460
What do you mean?

810
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,940
The whole country preparing for
a giant knees-up,

811
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,060
and you're stuck with the body
in the library.

812
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,940
It was in the museum.

813
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,180
That's it, just to the left a bit.
Perfect.

814
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,500
Well, that's er...very colourful.

815
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,660
They were an absolute steal, sir.

816
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,780
They're just getting ready
for the big announcement.

817
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,820
Are you all right, by the way?
Dr Ziegler.

818
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,380
Yeah, he ran right into me, sir.
Well, I ran into him.

819
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,180
Speak to you?

820
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,940
Not a word, I'm afraid, sir.
It was just my luck, really.

821
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,300
If he'd said who stuck the knife in,
we could have all gone home.

822
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,180
Good morning, sir.
Sorry to drag you in on a Sunday.

823
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,620
I knew Dr Ziegler.
Did you?

824
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,420
So did I.

825
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,980
How did you know him?
He'd been treating Edith.

826
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,460
He was unmarried,
no family that we know of.

827
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,740
He'd been living in London,
came down to Hastings last year.

828
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,900
What else do we know about him?

829
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,780
Well, we know that the er...
last conversation I had with him

830
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,140
was about him wanting to see me
about something.

831
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,220
Do you think that's why
he was killed?

832
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,860
Could be.

833
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,300
You don't think it was his name,
do you, sir? Ziegler.

834
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,340
There's so much anti-German feeling,

835
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,780
what with these pictures of Belsen,
and the rest of it.

836
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,420
He didn't look or sound German.

837
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,300
What do we know about the knife?
The killer took it with him.

838
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,300
But the pathologist
looked at the wound

839
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,300
and said we're looking for something
with a long, curved blade.

840
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,860
(KNOCK)
Yeah.

841
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,300
Is it true someone's been murdered?

842
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,500
Perhaps.

843
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,740
I'll get the car.

844
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,180
I don't know. Really!
Dragging me back here on a Sunday!

845
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,380
Yeah, it's so inconsiderate getting
murdered on a weekend, isn't it?

846
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,060
Yes, yes, all right.

847
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,180
You didn't much care for Dr Ziegler,
I seem to remember.

848
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,100
I didn't have anything against him.
Not what I heard.

849
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,260
Oh?

850
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,420
Germans - kill the lot of them,
wipe them from the face of the earth.

851
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,580
Do you remember saying that?

852
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,340
You're not trying to say
I put a knife in him, are you?

853
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,340
It looks as if there's a knife
missing here, wouldn't you say?

854
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,380
I don't know anything about that.

855
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,620
And wouldn't this normally be locked?

856
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,820
Well, people are bringing stuff
in and out.

857
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,900
Someone must have forgotten
to lock it.

858
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,540
You were downstairs when the meeting
broke up yesterday, weren't you?

859
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,780
Well, I was er...I was at the door.

860
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,820
Hm. Do you remember, by any chance,
which of us came out first?

861
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,780
Well, I can't be certain because
I wasn't there the whole time.

862
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,700
Um... The Yank. Major Kiefer.

863
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,860
Yes, he was the first one out.
Yes, I can tell you that for sure.

864
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,980
And you'd remember that because...?

865
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,100
Well, I saw him and I heard him.

866
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,180
And then I went
along the corridor...

867
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,500
- call of nature, if you must know -

868
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,940
..and then the next person I saw
was er...

869
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,340
Mr Griffiths.
And there was a woman, as well.

870
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,940
Came out around the same time as me.
You remember her?

871
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,500
No, I didn't see her.

872
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,460
Were any of them carrying anything
suspicious when they left?

873
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,300
You mean like a great big
fishing knife? No, I didn't see.

874
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,300
He was killed on his way home
with a knife taken from the museum.

875
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,820
It seems probable that it was
someone in the meeting.

876
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,860
So that's Kiefer, Longmate,
Longmate's secretary...

877
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,460
And Griffiths.

878
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,580
From Ziegler's appointment book,
he saw him on Friday.

879
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,380
The notes mentioned blood pressure
and stress.

880
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,900
He was prescribed sleeping pills.
Really?

881
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,540
What happened?
It's a suicide. He took pills.

882
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,420
Mr Griffiths?
Yes.

883
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,420
Who authorised the removal
of the body?

884
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,820
I've no idea, guv.
But it's all cut and dried.

885
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,260
He left a note, apparently.

886
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,420
And, quite frankly,
I've got a party to get to.

887
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,380
No-one's hanging around here.

888
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,500
And this is definitely
your son's handwriting?

889
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,700
Yes, it is.

890
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,660
And this was on the kitchen table
when you came down this morning?

891
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,860
I've already told you.

892
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,900
"It wasn't me. I wasn't responsible.
I'm sorry, I can't live with this."

893
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,820
It's obviously a...
very great shock for you.

894
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,820
(SIGHS) The war's over.

895
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,900
He came through it.

896
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,940
And then he has to do this.

897
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,900
What's the point?

898
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,860
Wasn't responsible for what?

899
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,620
What do you think he meant by that?
I don't know.

900
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,700
He hadn't been the same
since he came back.

901
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,700
He wasn't eating. He was
spending time down at the pub,

902
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,700
he hardly said a word.

903
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,460
Since he came back from where?

904
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,500
Er... The West Country.

905
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,940
He was with the Royal Signal Corps.

906
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,820
He didn't tell me
any more than that.

907
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,300
The name Ziegler
mean anything to you?

908
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,060
That was Mark's doctor.

909
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,140
The one who gave him
the sleeping pills.

910
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,380
The ones he took.

911
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,180
Well, once again, we're um...
very sorry.

912
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,020
It doesn't make any difference.

913
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,380
This bloody war -
it's taken everything anyway.

914
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,780
It's taken everything
we ever cared about.

915
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,940
And people have become most strange.

916
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,940
Somebody sent him some sand.

917
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,300
Some sand?

918
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,540
An envelope full of sand.

919
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,260
When was that?

920
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,580
A few days ago. Friday.

921
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,140
Anything else?
He said he was being followed.

922
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,220
He thought someone was...
watching him.

923
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,900
I thought he was just
imagining things.

924
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,620
I told you, he hadn't been the same.

925
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,060
But there was a picture also
pinned to the door.

926
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,140
A picture? A picture of what?

927
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,580
It was cut out of a magazine.
It was an animal. A tiger.

928
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,940
Well, why would someone do that?

929
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,700
A tiger?

930
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,020
What's it meant to mean?

931
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,380
So, did you see the doctor?
I turned up for the appointment.

932
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,540
He weren't there.

933
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,020
So, how are you feeling?
Are you feeling better?

934
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,740
Why don't you tell me about her?
Who?

935
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,220
That woman we met. In the street.

936
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,140
I...I told you. I've never
seen her before in my life.

937
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,740
That's not what she thought.
Well, she was wrong.

938
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,540
Look, I'm fed up of this.

939
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,940
I've had enough of it!

940
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,300
You're lying to me, Janice.
I know you are!

941
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,660
I never met her before!
You're lying!

942
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,900
I'm sorry.

943
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,660
I'm sorry.

944
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,580
I'm sorry.

945
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,260
You can get 12's worth
of civilian clothing.

946
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,980
Don't forget your demob suit.

947
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,460
If you need any more information,
come back any time.

948
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,340
Thank you, Miss.

949
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,140
I already have my 12.
And my demob suit.

950
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,860
Not that I think I'll be wearing it.

951
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,700
But I was told you also gave advice.

952
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,660
When did you get back?
Yesterday.

953
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,420
From Debden?
No, I've been flying again.

954
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,820
I was in Malta.

955
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,580
How are you?
Well, I...I need someone to talk to.

956
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,700
Well, we've plenty of leaflets.

957
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,340
Yes. Yes, I can see.

958
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,340
But I don't think I'd find
the answer to my problem there.

959
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,380
What is your problem?

960
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,300
Well, er...

961
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,060
..it's like this, you see.

962
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,260
I was in Hastings for a while.

963
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,820
My squadron was only
a couple of miles away.

964
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,380
And while I was there, I...
sort of fell in love.

965
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,900
Well, no sort of about it.

966
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,620
I met this girl and the two of us
walked out for a time.

967
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,580
Andrew, please. And then I got
sent to this training centre.

968
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,700
And I was promoted to
Squadron Leader.

969
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,820
But I hated it there.

970
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,820
And the fact is, I must have been
a little bit out of my mind,

971
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,860
because I behaved like
a complete cad.

972
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,540
I broke it off with this girl.

973
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,220
I didn't even have the nerve
to tell her face to face.

974
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,340
I wrote her a letter and told her
I'd met someone else,

975
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,100
even though I knew the someone else
wasn't a patch on her,

976
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,060
and of course
it didn't last very long.

977
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,180
And there hasn't been a day when I
haven't regretted what I did...

978
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,380
..and wished I could somehow undo it

979
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,220
and take back the hurt
I know I must have caused.

980
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,300
And that's why I'm asking
your advice, you see, because...

981
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,940
..because I'm still looking
for a way.

982
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,700
I'm not sure there is a way, Andrew.

983
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,900
But if I saw her and...

984
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,020
..told her what a fool I was,
and begged her to consider?

985
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,340
I don't think she's the sort of girl
who would like begging.

986
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,140
Do you think
she'd at least consider?

987
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,860
Consider what?
Well, just seeing me.

988
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,460
Spending time together,
just being friends.

989
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,660
Well, she'd have to look
in the leaflets,

990
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,700
see what they advise.

991
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,780
(SCOFFS) You don't have a leaflet
about love.

992
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,220
No, but I've quite a few
on desertion.

993
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,180
Yes, well...

994
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,100
Well, thank you anyway.

995
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,940
You know, Sam, in all this time
you've hardly changed at all.

996
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,300
Really?

997
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,220
But I have.

998
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,660
Sir,

999
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,860
you know the man you're going
to see? Martin Longmate.

1000
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,060
He owns the hotel, doesn't he?
He does.

1001
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,220
Well, I think you ought to know,

1002
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,420
I applied to be
his personal assistant.

1003
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,700
Did you? Did you get it?
I don't think so.

1004
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,060
Well, maybe best not to accept it
anyway, not just yet. Thank you.

1005
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,620
Well, well, well!

1006
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,980
Come to say goodbye?
You're leaving?

1007
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,180
That's right. I got my 85 points.

1008
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,260
That earns me a ticket on the good
ship Aquitania heading for New York.

1009
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,180
I'm not sure that's going to be
possible.

1010
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,180
Why's that?
You probably know about Ziegler.

1011
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:49,140
Sure. But you're not gonna tell me I
had anything to do with that, right?

1012
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,780
I mean, I hardly knew the man.
You may not know about Griffiths.

1013
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,780
What about him?
He's dead.

1014
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,100
Dead?

1015
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,900
Sit down.

1016
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,340
Since when?
Saturday night.

1017
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,980
How?
An overdose.

1018
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,660
Well, why would he do that?

1019
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,580
I thought you might be able
to tell me.

1020
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,580
I can't tell you anything.

1021
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,460
Maybe it's pretty obvious.

1022
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,140
Ziegler and Griffiths
died on the same day, right?

1023
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,780
So maybe Griffiths killed Ziegler.

1024
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,780
I don't know why -
you can find that out.

1025
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,980
He killed him, then he regretted it
and he took his own life.

1026
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,900
He left a note.

1027
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,620
Yeah?

1028
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,900
"It wasn't me, I wasn't responsible."
That's all it said.

1029
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,700
There you are - it's a confession.

1030
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,220
How well did you know him?

1031
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,460
I never met him before in my life.

1032
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,460
For a man you never met, he seemed to
have quite an affect on you.

1033
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,180
He was the boring head of a boring
committee, we all felt the same.

1034
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,980
How did you get to be
on that committee?

1035
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,780
As a matter of fact, I volunteered.

1036
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,940
I was killing time.

1037
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,980
After you'd finished in Devon?
Yeah.

1038
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,540
What is it you were doing in Devon?
What is this, the Third Degree?

1039
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,500
Look, Christopher,
I'd like to help you,

1040
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,340
I really would,
but you know I can't.

1041
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,180
And I can't let you leave.
You know that.

1042
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,860
You think you can stop me?

1043
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,940
I have a wife.

1044
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,180
I have two sons that I haven't seen
in over three years.

1045
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,780
I'm sorry.

1046
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,820
I thought we were friends,
Christopher.

1047
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,500
Well, so did I.

1048
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,740
Mr Longmate is ready to see you now.
Thank you.

1049
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,500
I have to say,
this is a terrible business.

1050
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,540
Almost unbelievable.

1051
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,100
A murder, now of all times!

1052
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,340
(SIGHS)
Well, have you made any progress?

1053
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,620
Perhaps. Um... Just a couple of
things, if you don't mind.

1054
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,260
Excuse me.

1055
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,540
Well, anything I can do to help.

1056
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,980
You first met Dr Ziegler when?

1057
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,340
Same time as you, at the committee.

1058
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,500
You were never a patient of his,
then?

1059
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
No.
Mm-hm.

1060
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,540
What's the matter with your eyes,
if you don't mind me asking?

1061
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,780
I beg your pardon?
I remember you telling Dr Ziegler

1062
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,980
your eyesight was the reason you
were exempt from the armed forces.

1063
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,620
Nothing wrong with that, of course,
but you're not wearing glasses

1064
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,780
and you didn't seem to have a problem
reading at the meeting.

1065
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,180
Well, er...
I might as well come clean.

1066
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,660
Actually, I lied.

1067
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,220
The real reason why
I was exempted was angina.

1068
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,860
I have a heart condition.

1069
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,260
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1070
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,980
I want to go into politics,
Mr Foyle.

1071
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,780
Do you think the people of Hastings

1072
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,700
would vote for someone
with a weak heart?

1073
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,220
You feel they'd sooner vote
for someone who lies?

1074
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,100
I think you're being a little harsh.

1075
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,100
The next election may be tougher
than anyone thinks.

1076
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,300
I just don't want to give
my political opponents

1077
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,220
any ammunition, that's all.

1078
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,420
I'm well enough to stand
for parliament, I know I am.

1079
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,820
I want to serve my country,
Mr Foyle.

1080
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,900
That may sound
hopelessly old-fashioned,

1081
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,180
but I'm not gonna let this chance
pass me by.

1082
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,220
Sir, did you notice the woman
leaving his office just then?

1083
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,580
His assistant.
Mm.

1084
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,020
I met her a few days ago with Edith.

1085
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,260
They were both patients
of Dr Ziegler.

1086
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,820
Know what he was treating her for?
No, but I have a pretty good idea.

1087
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,820
Well, it's got to be one of them.

1088
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,500
Major Kiefer or Martin Longmate.

1089
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,060
They were both in the room.

1090
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,500
Or it could have been
that curator chap, I suppose.

1091
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,820
Michael Brown.
It could have been me.

1092
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,500
Didn't like to mention it, sir.

1093
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,020
What did you get on Griffiths'
military service?

1094
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,780
Nothing, sir.
It's all definitely hush-hush.

1095
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,020
I made a few calls,
but it's a brick wall.

1096
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,540
But he was in the West Country.
As was Kiefer.

1097
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,180
Has your letter arrived, by the way?

1098
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,100
My promotion?
Mm-hm.

1099
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,700
No, sir. Still no news.

1100
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,260
Can't you give them a call, sir?
Chivvy them on a bit.

1101
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,020
It'll come.
With your permission,

1102
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,420
I'd like to talk to Mrs Hylton
while you're away. Certainly.

1103
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,540
Where are you going, sir?
London.

1104
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,460
You're about to run me
to the station.

1105
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,140
Can I ask why
you're going to London, sir?

1106
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,860
Course you can.

1107
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,380
Miss Pierce?
Mr Foyle.

1108
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,220
I was very surprised
to be getting your call.

1109
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,020
I was very surprised to be making it,
quite honestly.

1110
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,220
How's Hastings?

1111
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,820
Much the same as here, I'd imagine.
We're just waiting.

1112
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,260
The end of the war.

1113
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,140
I understand Churchill and Stalin

1114
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,900
are negotiating the exact moment
to announce it.

1115
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,700
Meanwhile, I can reliably inform you

1116
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,780
that you can expect an announcement
on the wireless this evening.

1117
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,660
What, that it's over?
No.

1118
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,060
The Ministry of Information
is going to announce

1119
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,580
that there'll be
an announcement tomorrow.

1120
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,260
In other words, the announcement
of the announcement.

1121
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,500
Good to see the spirit of Colonel
Blimp is still alive and well.

1122
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,100
You said you wanted my help.
That makes a pleasant change.

1123
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,260
Well, since you've been so very
unhelpful on two separate occasions

1124
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,100
during the course of the war so far,

1125
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,900
I'm giving you a chance
to make up for it.

1126
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,060
Point taken.

1127
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,380
I just need some information.
Go on.

1128
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,780
Sometime last year, maybe this,

1129
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,060
in the west of England,
Devon perhaps, something happened.

1130
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,660
A naval operation involving
the Americans on a beach, maybe.

1131
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,180
Can you be a little more specific?
Well, no.

1132
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,460
I just have one name. Griffiths.
Mark Griffiths, Royal Signals.

1133
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,900
You've made inquiries?
Nobody will talk to me.

1134
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,980
What makes you think
they'll talk to me?

1135
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:59,220
I'll need a couple of hours.
All right.

1136
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,900
Er... Where will you be?

1137
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,460
Wherever you like.

1138
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:06,420
How about Whitehall? Kingly Street
should be quiet enough.

1139
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,540
You've seen -
there are crowds everywhere.

1140
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,180
All waiting for the end.

1141
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,260
Everyone's out there celebrating,

1142
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,980
and here are you and I,
still stuck in the shadows.

1143
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:17,260
I thought you liked the shadows.

1144
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,500
Five o'clock. Good to see you again.

1145
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,980
Mrs Hylton?
Yes.

1146
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,860
Sergeant Milner, Hastings Police.

1147
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,980
I've come about Dr Ziegler.

1148
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,020
Well, you'd better come in.
Thank you.

1149
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,140
Are you on your own?

1150
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,580
No, my husband Eddie's upstairs,
asleep.

1151
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,660
Demobbed?
Yeah, he was in Italy.

1152
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,620
You don't remember meeting me,
do you?

1153
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,220
No.

1154
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,660
I was with my wife, Edith.
She's pregnant.

1155
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,300
Your husband doesn't need to know
anything about this, but I do.

1156
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,860
Please.

1157
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,660
When you met my wife
at Dr Ziegler's surgery,

1158
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,620
you were heavily pregnant.

1159
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,860
Where is the baby?

1160
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,220
She's with my mother.

1161
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,140
And your husband has no idea?

1162
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,860
He suspects. He knows something's
not right, but...

1163
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,180
I do love him.

1164
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,700
But he's been away for four years.

1165
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,860
I was on my own.

1166
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,220
I wish it hadn't happened,
but it did.

1167
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,900
And now he's back, and I've been
tearing myself apart.

1168
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,260
I can't tell him - he'd kill me.

1169
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,540
But Dr Ziegler knew.

1170
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,300
I was terrified he'd tell Eddie
about me, about me and the baby.

1171
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,340
Is that why you went to the museum?

1172
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,500
To see him?

1173
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,460
No.

1174
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,540
I went to see Martin. Mr Longmate.

1175
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,900
He's the father.

1176
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,340
Right.

1177
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
We didn't mean for it to happen.

1178
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,740
He was on his own, too.

1179
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,700
His wife had died in a bombing raid.

1180
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,500
I felt sorry for him, and...

1181
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,980
one night we were working late...

1182
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,900
Does he know the baby's his?

1183
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,380
He wanted to get rid of it.

1184
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,740
But I couldn't do that.

1185
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,420
So then he said he knew people.

1186
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,740
Said he could arrange
for it to be adopted.

1187
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,780
And that's what we were gonna do.

1188
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,220
But then your husband came home.

1189
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,380
I've been so scared.

1190
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,820
I don't want to lose him,
I couldn't bear that.

1191
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,740
If he finds out...

1192
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,740
Eddie mentioned he was seeing
Dr Ziegler.

1193
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,780
I panicked.

1194
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,620
I had to talk to someone,

1195
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,900
and I thought Martin
would know what to do.

1196
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,980
So I went to the museum.

1197
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,940
But it was too late.

1198
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,300
You didn't see Mr Longmate?

1199
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,820
No. He'd already gone.

1200
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,380
That's all I need to know.

1201
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,140
Will you be coming back?
No.

1202
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,220
I have everything.
I'll see myself out.

1203
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,300
DOOR CLOSES

1204
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,500
I heard.

1205
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,220
Everything.

1206
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,340
You like to inhabit
dangerous territory, Mr Foyle.

1207
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,020
Well, not by choice.

1208
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,500
This time,
even you should tread carefully.

1209
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,660
I've stuck my neck out for you,
and I have to say,

1210
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,700
I felt a very cold breeze indeed.

1211
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,820
Operation Tiger -
does that mean anything to you?

1212
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,300
Might.

1213
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,860
Slapton Sands in Devon.

1214
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,060
What happened there?
Nothing happened there.

1215
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,580
That's the official verdict,

1216
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,940
and that's how it shall remain
for years to come.

1217
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,380
Unofficially?

1218
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,780
You never spoke to me,
I never gave you this,

1219
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,380
and it would be better
if nobody ever found out

1220
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,900
you knew anything about it.
All right.

1221
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:07,100
Just remember, a war always hides
a great many dirty secrets.

1222
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,100
This has been a long war...

1223
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,540
..and this secret's very dirty
indeed.

1224
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,220
He wanted her to get rid of it,
but she refused,

1225
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,340
so he was going to get it adopted.

1226
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,460
It turns out Martin Longmate's not
as straightforward as he seems.

1227
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,460
Was he ever?

1228
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,380
Sergeant.

1229
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,060
What's going on?

1230
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,300
Oh, nothing, sir.
It's er...in the...

1231
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,820
It's just that cartoon, sir.
You probably don't read it. Jane.

1232
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,980
Not a stitch on today, I see.
You probably noticed that.

1233
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,660
Yes, sir. The lads and I
were just commenting on it.

1234
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,100
I suppose it's to mark the end
of the war.

1235
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,100
Well, not a moment too soon,
if that's anything to go by.

1236
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,780
Right, sir.
We're just off to Wilder Road,

1237
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,540
take a peek at the new HQ.
I should.

1238
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,660
Paul! It's here.

1239
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:15,860
I should open it.

1240
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,580
I've got it.
Darling!

1241
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,340
Sir,

1242
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,980
thank you.

1243
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,380
Congratulations.

1244
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,100
Oh!
Edith?

1245
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,660
I came here at such a pace, I...

1246
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,740
Paul, I think it's coming!

1247
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,740
Er... Chair.

1248
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,140
Get Brooke back, will you?

1249
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,420
What's the um...hospital number?

1250
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,020
383.

1251
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,900
Where's Sam?

1252
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,380
She's um...with the Servicemen's
Association this morning.

1253
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,740
Oh, I'm sorry, Paul.
Don't worry.

1254
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,100
(GROANS)

1255
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,380
Missed him, sir.

1256
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,580
Never mind. Thank you.

1257
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,140
(DIALS NUMBER)

1258
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,180
That's it. We're nearly there.

1259
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,040
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.

1260
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,560
I think it's time you explained.

1261
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,880
If it's all in there,
what else do you want to know?

1262
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,680
I want to hear it from your point
of view. I wasn't there.

1263
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,720
It was a training exercise
at Slapton Sands,

1264
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,640
for the landings at Utah Beach.

1265
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,320
Operation Tiger.

1266
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,120
A year ago, April 28.

1267
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,720
I'd been transferred to
the amphibious truck company,

1268
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,800
working on floating harbours
and LSTs.

1269
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,200
Landing ships, tanks,
that kind of stuff.

1270
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,760
I was billeted
with the 4th Infantry division.

1271
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,480
I got to know a lot of the boys.

1272
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,480
That's what most of them were.

1273
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
Just kids.

1274
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,160
A few years older than my own.

1275
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,800
Anyway, one night, right in
the middle of an exercise...

1276
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,640
..nine German U-boats
came out of nowhere.

1277
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,880
And there was a whole fleet of LSTs,

1278
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,120
just sitting there,
right in front of them.

1279
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,600
So they opened fire.

1280
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,160
749 of our soldiers and sailors
killed.

1281
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,680
It was all hushed up.

1282
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,640
They had to think about morale.

1283
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,840
So why did nobody warn the kids
on the LSTs

1284
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
that the Germans were on their way?

1285
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,920
Well, I'll tell you.

1286
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,640
They did.

1287
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,360
But it turned out
there'd been a typing mistake.

1288
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,160
Someone had sent out
the wrong radio frequency.

1289
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,680
Just a couple of misplaced numbers,
that's all.

1290
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,440
So no-one on the LSTs
heard anything,

1291
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,160
and all those people died.

1292
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,760
And that was Griffiths.

1293
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,680
Took me a year to find out.

1294
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,040
Talking to the right people.

1295
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,160
Asking a lot of questions
about something

1296
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,000
that wasn't supposed to
have happened.

1297
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,200
But he was the one responsible.

1298
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,120
Griffiths was a major
with the Royal Signals Corps,

1299
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,040
Allied Liaison.

1300
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,760
He did the right thing, then,
killing himself. No!

1301
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,640
You don't understand.

1302
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,920
I see those kids.
Every night, I see them.

1303
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,080
I can't get them out of my head.

1304
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,600
I just wanted him to accept
responsibility, that's all.

1305
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,040
I thought if he did that,
then maybe I could make sense of it.

1306
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,320
Well, the fact is
nobody knows what happened.

1307
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,120
Radio frequencies were changed,

1308
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,400
the Germans noticed
increased radio traffic.

1309
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,120
While the corvettes didn't show up,
the LSTs were in the wrong formation,

1310
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,720
so whatever you may think,
it wasn't one man's mistake.

1311
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,920
Griffiths was in charge,
and at the end of it,

1312
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,600
they just shipped him out,
they got rid of him.

1313
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,800
As far as he was concerned,
that was the end of it.

1314
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,960
He just ran out.

1315
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,360
And it was really worth
hounding him to death?

1316
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,000
I didn't want him to die.

1317
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,640
That wasn't the idea, I swear to it.

1318
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,240
I don't know what I wanted.

1319
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,360
I should never have come.

1320
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,320
Well, it's a bit late for that.

1321
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,440
So now what?

1322
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,480
From the law's point of view,

1323
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,640
there's not a case against you
that would stand up in a court.

1324
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,560
So you're free to go.

1325
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,320
So that's it, then?
I think so, don't you?

1326
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,760
Funny thing about war, Christopher -

1327
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,920
people change.

1328
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,680
Or are you the only one
who remained above it all?

1329
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,280
So what are you going to do
with yourself, Sam?

1330
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,040
After the war?

1331
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,960
I don't even want to think about it.

1332
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,520
But it looks as if advertising
and politics are out.

1333
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,280
How about you?

1334
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,920
I don't know.

1335
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,680
Will you stay in Hastings?
Mm, I suppose so.

1336
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,560
I'll go fishing with Dad,
and we'll spend some time together.

1337
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,600
I haven't really got anywhere else
to go.

1338
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,800
Well, will you fly again?

1339
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,760
My eyesight is more or less shot
to pieces with the sinusitis, so no.

1340
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,840
I think that's finished.

1341
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,920
You'll have to go into business,
then.

1342
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,960
Or maybe you can join the police.

1343
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,080
Mm. Then you can be MY driver.

1344
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,400
I don't think so!
(CHUCKLES)

1345
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,520
That's the worst of it, Sam.

1346
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,600
This feeling I have that maybe
the best of my life is over.

1347
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,680
Flying the dawn patrol,

1348
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,360
the friends I made.

1349
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,440
Even the ones I lost.

1350
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,560
How can I work in an office,

1351
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,000
travel in and out on a 37 bus,
after what I've been through?

1352
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,880
How can any of us?

1353
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,880
Maybe you could write.

1354
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,000
You used to write reams of poetry.

1355
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,760
Well, I used to scribble a bit,
I suppose.

1356
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,880
What was that poem you told me?

1357
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,120
Oh, I don't remember.
Oh, please, Andrew.

1358
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,320
Actually, I wrote one quite
recently, just before I left Malta.

1359
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,440
Go on.

1360
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,520
I don't know if it was any good
or not, but...

1361
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,800
It's called "All Clear."

1362
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,320
They've sounded out
the last all clear

1363
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,200
And told us,
those who made it here...

1364
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,320
..That very soon
we'll hold once more

1365
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,240
Those things that we held dear.

1366
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,200
Yet nothing's clear to me.

1367
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,200
I gaze from darkness
to a summer haze.

1368
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,240
And though they part, the clouds
of war lead only to uncertain days.

1369
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,360
Do you really think that?

1370
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,560
I think that's very sad.

1371
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,640
(GROANS) Sam, I'm sorry.

1372
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,800
I've got to watch out for myself.

1373
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,880
I'm beginning to sound like
an old man.

1374
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,840
Well, you don't look like one.

1375
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,440
Sam, why don't we get married?

1376
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,680
What?!
I mean it.

1377
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,400
You don't know
what you're going to do,

1378
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,200
I don't know what I'm going to do -

1379
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,960
it makes sense to not know
what we're going to do together.

1380
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,560
Is that why you invited me here?
Don't get angry with me.

1381
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,120
I said I'd be your friend.

1382
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,240
I said I'd see you again,
but that's all.

1383
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,400
It's unfair to ask for more.

1384
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,280
Especially in so unromantic
a fashion.

1385
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,640
All right.

1386
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,520
But I might as well tell you,
I'm going to work on you, Sam.

1387
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,240
Until one day
you'll change your mind about me,

1388
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,400
and forgive me
for being such a bloody fool.

1389
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,320
And you will marry me.
Oh, yes?

1390
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,600
If only because you'd secretly love

1391
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,560
to have my dad
as your father-in-law.

1392
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,720
Hm...

1393
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,760
Let's drive back and get a pint.

1394
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,600
All right.

1395
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,320
Everything all right?

1396
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,120
Mr Longmate, could I have a word?

1397
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
Of course. Shall we use my office?

1398
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,120
Probably wise.

1399
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,120
Please, follow me.

1400
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,560
Is this about Dr Ziegler?

1401
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,400
Who else?

1402
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,320
Well, please, sit down.

1403
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,440
No, I won't stay longer
than I have to.

1404
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,320
Perhaps you should.
Should I?

1405
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,680
With a heart condition like yours,
you can't be too careful.

1406
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,480
That's very considerate, but um...
I'll be fine, thank you.

1407
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,960
How can I help you?

1408
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,840
Well, we hoped you might help with
whatever you can remember

1409
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,760
about your military service medical.

1410
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,880
It was a long time ago, Mr Foyle.
I can't see why you'd be interested.

1411
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,280
Some confusion about the details,
apparently.

1412
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,040
Might you remember
where it took place?

1413
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,160
Er... London,

1414
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,680
though precisely where
I would be less sure about.

1415
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,400
Mm-hm. Examining doctor, perhaps?

1416
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,920
Afraid not.

1417
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,840
I see.

1418
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,280
Though there's probably
a record of it somewhere,

1419
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,000
if you think it's important.
Well, there's um...

1420
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,200
there's a record of it in my pocket.

1421
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,720
A doctor's letter
recording an appointment for...

1422
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,280
Martin Longmate, April 23rd, 1941.

1423
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,760
At a surgery in London, Hampstead,
with signed confirmation of angina

1424
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,400
and exemption from active service.
Would this be your appointment?

1425
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,520
You'll forgive me pointing out,
but if you have the information,

1426
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,320
I fail to see why you're
questioning me regarding it.

1427
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,720
And why on earth you consider there
to be a problem.

1428
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,960
Well, certainly not a problem for me.

1429
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,440
It just looks as if it might be
for you.

1430
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,920
It's a question of the signature here
of the examining doctor.

1431
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,560
You're saying it's not genuine?
No, far from it.

1432
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,480
I'm saying it's Dr Ziegler's.

1433
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,480
Longmate. We've met, I think.

1434
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,640
No, I don't think so.

1435
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,240
Martin Longmate.
I feel sure I know the name.

1436
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,200
So why say you hadn't met?

1437
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,640
It was four years ago,
for God's sake.

1438
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,240
I do meet a lot of people.

1439
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,160
They all give you medicals?

1440
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,320
Not a very good reason, perhaps,
is because you never had.

1441
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,080
Because the Martin Longmate
he examined wasn't you, was it?

1442
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,160
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1443
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,680
He examined the man
you paid 150 to take your place,

1444
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,880
who does have angina,
and who had a very nice line

1445
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,000
in acquiring exemption certificates

1446
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,560
for those interested
in avoiding military service,

1447
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,960
until his arrest the other day.
He sends his regards.

1448
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,440
It was actually er...200.

1449
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,520
Was it?

1450
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,200
Oh.

1451
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,920
We'll remind him. Thank you.

1452
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,960
Life, eh?

1453
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,360
Almost the end of the war

1454
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,160
and you run into the very last person
in England you want to see.

1455
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,080
I panicked.

1456
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,720
When he asked me about my exemption,
I told him it was my eyesight

1457
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,000
because...if I'd said angina,

1458
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,880
he might have put two and two
together.

1459
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,600
There was too much to lose -

1460
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,680
my...political ambitions,
my business.

1461
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,760
And then when I heard him
asking to speak to you...

1462
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:10,360
Actually, Mr Foyle, there was one
thing I wanted to talk to you about.

1463
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,880
Um... It's a private matter.

1464
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,480
I wonder if I might call in
at the police station.

1465
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,120
Any time you like.

1466
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,760
'All I could think of
was getting rid of Ziegler

1467
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,800
before he could talk to you.

1468
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,000
And that's exactly what I did.'

1469
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,600
(GROANS)

1470
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,840
What gave me away?

1471
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,440
You were the first to leave
the committee room,

1472
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,120
but Kiefer was the first out of the
building, according to the doorman.

1473
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,760
Ah.

1474
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,080
All so unnecessary and unfortunate.

1475
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,960
What do you mean?

1476
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,560
All Ziegler wanted to speak to me
about was Griffiths,

1477
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,200
who was in a very bad state.
Ziegler was concerned.

1478
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,800
And unfortunate, because er...

1479
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,080
having evaded the draft,

1480
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,280
murdered a member
of the medical profession,

1481
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,360
tried to avoid detection
to feather your own nest,

1482
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,480
I'd have said
you were a born politician.

1483
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,960
But, the law being what it is,

1484
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,240
hanging is perhaps the very best way
you can serve your country.

1485
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,360
Make the most, lads.
It's a bona fide French champagne.

1486
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,200
Well, congratulations, Mr Milner.

1487
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,560
Just celebrating the new arrival,
sir. Hope you don't mind.

1488
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,760
Well, of course not. Boy or a girl?

1489
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,680
A girl, sir. Thank heavens.

1490
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,200
Goodbye to Winston Milner.

1491
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,720
But she wants to call her
Clementine - Mrs Churchill.

1492
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,480
Where's this come from?
The evidence room, sir.

1493
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,640
Somehow the label came adrift
and sadly, we couldn't place it.

1494
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,320
Oh, yeah? Well, congratulations.

1495
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,720
Cheers.
Congratulations.

1496
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,520
Sir!
Cheers.

1497
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,440
'The Prime Minister, The Right
Honourable Winston Churchill.'

1498
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,400
CHURCHILL: 'Yesterday morning,

1499
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,320
at 2:41am...

1500
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,800
..at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

1501
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,920
General Jodl, the representative
of the German High Command,

1502
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,800
and our Grand Admiral Donitz,

1503
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,920
the designated head
of the German state,

1504
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,960
signed the act of
unconditional surrender

1505
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:47,560
of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe

1506
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,840
to the Allied Expeditionary Force.'

1507
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,640
It's over.

1508
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,600
I can't believe it.

1509
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,800
Sir, I'd better get back to Edith

1510
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,200
and er...Clementine.

1511
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,200
Of course.

1512
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,760
Good luck.

1513
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,600
Thank you, sir.

1514
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,520
And er...if you don't mind, sir,

1515
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,480
I promised the lads that they could
join in the celebrations.

1516
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,600
It seems only right.
Absolutely. Go ahead.

1517
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,680
Cheers, sir. Enjoy the champers.
Thank you.

1518
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,600
Come on, lads.

1519
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,120
They said you drove Milner
and his wife to the hospital, sir.

1520
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,760
I did.

1521
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,960
But I thought you couldn't drive.

1522
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,320
Are you telling me
that all these years...

1523
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,520
I've never actually at any time
said I couldn't drive,

1524
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,160
I just preferred not to.

1525
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,240
So you never really needed me?

1526
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,800
I wouldn't say that.

1527
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,520
All hell's breaking loose outside.
You ought to come and join us.

1528
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,000
I will.
I'm going to dance all night.

1529
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,520
Will you dance with me?
I'll dance with anybody.

1530
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,960
But especially you.

1531
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,760
Are you coming, Dad?
No, I'll catch you up. You go on.

1532
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,920
All right.

1533
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,040
Are you sure? We'll never find you.

1534
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,200
I'll make sure you do. Off you go.

1535
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,160
Andrew.

1536
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:23,960
# It's a lovely day tomorrow

1537
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:31,720
# Tomorrow is a lovely day

1538
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:38,840
# Come and feast
your tear-dimmed eyes

1539
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:46,520
