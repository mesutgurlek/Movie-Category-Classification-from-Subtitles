1
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,780
<i>January, 1942...</i>

2
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>...the high-water mark of Nazi conquest.</i>

3
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,250
<i>Hitler's armies hammered at the gateway
to the Near East.</i>

4
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,820
<i>Their Japanese allies
poured across Asia...</i>

5
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:56,727
<i>...an irresistible flood of men
and weapons...</i>

6
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,334
<i>...driving to link up
with the Germans to the west...</i>

7
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:02,062
<i>...crushing the world between them.</i>

8
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,999
<i>Sweeping into Burma...</i>

9
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:09,237
<i>...they captured the vital air base
at Myitkyina and cut the Burma Road.</i>

10
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,573
<i>Our forces, pitifully weak...</i>

11
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:15,206
<i>...retreated along elephant trails,
through jungles...</i>

12
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:20,379
<i>...across rivers and mountains
to the temporary refuge of India.</i>

13
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:24,989
<i>General Joseph Stilwell
said the last word on the campaign.</i>

14
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,958
<i>I claim we got a hell of a beating.</i>

15
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:31,726
<i>We got run out of Burma,
and that's humiliating as hell.</i>

16
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:34,495
<i>I think we ought to find out
what caused it...</i>

17
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,901
<i>...go back and retake the place.</i>

18
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,142
<i>Meeting in Quebec...</i>

19
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,540
<i>...President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill...</i>

20
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,270
<i>...gathered their strength.</i>

21
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,608
<i>To India they sent our men.</i>

22
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:53,245
<i>Irish, English, Scot and Welsh.
Australian, New Zealander, Gurkha, Sikh.</i>

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,186
<i>And from the United States
came 3,000 volunteers...</i>

24
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,760
<i>...seasoned jungle fighters...</i>

25
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,025
<i>...veterans of Guadalcanal,
New Guinea, Bougainville.</i>

26
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,134
<i>Men who responded to a call...</i>

27
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:10,466
<i>...for one dangerous
and hazardous operation somewhere.</i>

28
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:16,771
<i>Organized as the 5307th Composite
Unit Provisional...</i>

29
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,404
<i>...and placed under the command
of Brigadier General Frank D. Merrill...</i>

30
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,986
<i>...they became a part of the forces
which sought to regain Burma.</i>

31
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:31,121
<i>On January 4th, 1944,
the invasion was launched.</i>

32
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,730
<i>Merrill's mission:
To sneak behind enemy lines...</i>

33
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,526
<i>...surprise and destroy
the main Japanese supply base...</i>

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,863
<i>...in North Burma, Walawbum.</i>

35
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,098
<i>Moving in three columns...</i>

36
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:47,175
<i>...spearheaded by an advance platoon,
its point...</i>

37
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:50,073
<i>...they succeeded
in making their way undetected...</i>

38
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:54,273
<i>...through 200 miles
of Japanese territory.</i>

39
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,385
<i>After three months
in the cruelest jungle on earth...</i>

40
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:02,456
<i>...the point was close to its goal.</i>

41
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,463
Bend in the trail.

42
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,863
We better see
what's around the other end.

43
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,833
Come on, Wheeler.

44
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,056
<i>A few miles to the rear...</i>

45
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:39,991
<i>...the main body reached
the last physical barrier to Walawbum...</i>

46
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,721
<i>...the Tange Ga River.</i>

47
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,026
Private Driscoll, take cover!

48
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:35,114
Think that Japanese plane saw us?

49
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:38,845
Let's pray to God he didn't.

50
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,567
Sneaking 3,000 men through
this damn jungle's gonna drive me nuts.

51
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:55,465
Come on, let's go!

52
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,123
- Private Driscoll.
- Yes, sir? Yes, sir?

53
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,625
What happened to you?
That plane could have spotted you.

54
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,058
I don't know what's eating me.

55
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,357
Going through this jungle's
driving me nuts.

56
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,327
Get moving.

57
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:33,802
I got 3,000 nervous wrecks
on my hands, doc.

58
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,944
90 days and 90 nights
bellying behind Japanese lines...

59
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:43,711
...afraid to talk, afraid to breathe.
What do you expect?

60
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:51,051
Left guard, this is quarterback.
Come in, left guard.

61
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:52,888
Left guard to quarterback.
Come in, quarterback.

62
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,360
You think that plane spotted
any of your men?

63
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,795
No, sir.
We have good cover here from the air.

64
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,264
<i>Well, what's your situation?</i>

65
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,233
Scouts report 300 enemy
in village of Tange Ga.

66
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,304
Tell your patrols to steer clear of them
and stay out of sight.

67
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,567
Yes, sir.

68
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:12,512
Right guard, this is quarterback.
Come in, right guard.

69
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,877
Right guard to quarterback.
Come in, quarterback.

70
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,111
Left guard is crossing the river now.
When you reach it, move fast.

71
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,381
That plane's liable to come back
any minute. What's your picture?

72
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:25,755
Patrols report small enemy force
moving west along river bank.

73
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,488
Don't touch them.
Hold where you are until they pass.

74
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,131
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,366
Advise point
that we're moving out again.

76
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,067
Another bend in the road.

77
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,873
Wonder what's around this one.

78
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,375
Stock from quarterback.
Stock from quarterback.

79
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,017
Come in, Stock.

80
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,447
Quarterback to Stock!

81
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,015
Knock out that gun!

82
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,120
Quarterback to Stock,
knock out that gun.

83
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,478
See that, officer?

84
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,778
- Yeah.
- He's all yours.

85
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,354
Bullseye gets that officer,
you move in with smoke and frag.

86
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,160
- Aye.
- Bullseye.

87
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,740
Stay away from my ammo.

88
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:40,255
- Doskis.
- Yeah?

89
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:43,415
- Any of those Japanese get away?
- No, sir.

90
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,453
- Muley.
- Yes, sir?

91
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,901
- Where have you been?
- Watching out for Eleanor.

92
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,662
She could have got hurt.

93
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,105
O'Brien make it all right?

94
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,416
No, not with that leg.

95
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,715
Stock, you wouldn't leave me here?

96
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,321
You know we don't leave anybody,
O'Brien.

97
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,685
I'll radio the column
and have them pick you up.

98
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,656
- Muley.
- Yeah, Stock?

99
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,921
- Stick with him.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,394
Let us go.

101
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,557
I got some extra smokes
stashed away in Eleanor's pack.

102
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,760
I'll dig them up for you.

103
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,668
We knocked out two guns, sir.

104
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,329
What took you so long?

105
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,172
I want news.

106
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,906
Have Taggy tap into that line
leading to those guns.

107
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,710
- <i>That line's been hit.</i>
- Well, find another one.

108
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,046
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- All right.

109
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,624
Barney, have my battalion commanders
come up here right away.

110
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,361
- Hey, Taggy.
- Yeah?

111
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:04,097
Do you know enough Japanese to run
interference for me in a geisha house?

112
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:07,936
- What geisha house?
- In Tokyo, when we get there.

113
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,203
I'll teach you what I picked up
in Bataan.

114
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,745
From there on, you're on your own.

115
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,147
Hey, there's a wire.

116
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,515
I better climb and pick up some gossip
for the general.

117
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,282
Hey, Bullseye, what's eating you?

118
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,586
Ah, come on, something's eating you.
What's eating you?

119
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,094
Chowhound,
I'll tell you about one last time.

120
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,598
You stay away from my chow,
you hear me?

121
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,406
- Sir.
- General.

122
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:42,576
Well, now they know we're here.

123
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,543
In a way, it's a relief.
I can let my breath out.

124
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,615
Heh. I suggest you hold it
until we take Walawbum.

125
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:52,345
You think we ought to notify the British
we're not such a hot secret anymore?

126
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,648
It might change their plans
to link up with us.

127
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:57,452
I'd hate to be in the middle of Burma
all by ourselves.

128
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:01,619
Whether the British get there or not,
we've got to knock out Walawbum.

129
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,594
That's the job we volunteered for.

130
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,735
Chuck, your responsibility is gonna be
the underground ammo dump.

131
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:07,891
Yes, sir.

132
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,800
Sammy, your responsibility
is the communications center.

133
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,907
Sir, Lieutenant Stockton.

134
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,377
Go ahead, Stock.

135
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,945
Taggy intercepted
one of their messages, sir.

136
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,513
Here's his translation.

137
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,277
"Americans in our rear. Where?"

138
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,711
"How many? What's their strength?"

139
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,255
"Identify their units."

140
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Meet me at 0.33.

141
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,260
Right.

142
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:50,737
Gentlemen, there's a Japanese battalion
on its way to Walawbum.

143
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,642
We've gotta beat them there.

144
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:55,079
Twenty-mile march,
have your men drop their packs.

145
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,582
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,239
- Hello, Stock.
- Hello, general.

147
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,745
How's the voice on the radio
holding out?

148
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,884
Getting a little hoarse, sir.

149
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,584
You lost a little weight,
don't you?

150
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,722
Look a little skinny yourself, sir.

151
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,824
Yah, fatter than the last time
we were here.

152
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:40,450
Yah, it's a lot better when they ran us
out of this rattrap two years ago.

153
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,426
But it's still rough.

154
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,366
How do you like running
your own platoon?

155
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,838
You didn't tell me when you gave me
command, I'd be getting gray hairs also.

156
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,908
Hello, Stock.

157
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,071
Hello, doctor.

158
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,611
- Did you pick up Private O'Brien, sir?
- Mm-hm.

159
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,274
Is he gonna lose his leg?

160
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,950
Not if we can fly him back to India.

161
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,548
Hello, boys.

162
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,383
We'll fly him back
as soon as we take Walawbum.

163
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:16,121
You know, if someone could get in
behind them at Walawbum...

164
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:20,667
...and create a diversion,
it'd help an awful lot.

165
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:23,532
Why don't I get going?

166
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,571
Yeah, why don't you?

167
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,545
Doctor, general look okay to you, sir?

168
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,185
Nobody looks okay to me.

169
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,818
Keep an eye on him, will you, sir?

170
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,892
That's an unusual relationship between
a general and a second lieutenant.

171
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,394
Started a long time ago
when Merrill was a major...

172
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,396
...and Stock was a sergeant.

173
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:03,477
Some day, that boy's gonna be
a general, if he can lick one problem.

174
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:27,830
- Stock, Stock.
- What?

175
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,845
Yeah?

176
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,012
You know when Merrill put those bars on you...

177
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,585
...he made you the big wheel
in this platoon.

178
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,243
So?

179
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,418
So, don't be sticking your neck out for us
by taking the point.

180
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,851
Let one of those other knotheads do it.

181
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,423
You're right. Bullseye.

182
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,330
- Yo.
- Take the point.

183
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,335
Lucky boy.

184
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,495
Shut up.

185
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,342
Chowhound, keep him company.

186
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,288
- Hah!
- Ohh...

187
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,030
Stock?

188
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,737
This way, buddy.

189
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,691
You want me to stay behind?

190
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,327
Squeeze that joker off
while you start the fireworks?

191
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:37,625
Uh-uh. I got your work cut out
at the ammo dump.

192
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,768
Kolowicz.

193
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:45,133
Put a man here to take care of that OP
when we blow up the rear.

194
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:21,073
Taggy, grenade that ammo truck.

195
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,210
Bullseye, you get that OP.

196
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,710
We attack in 33 seconds.

197
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,545
Right guard, sir.

198
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:37,986
- Have you lost your watch?
- No, sir.

199
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,128
Then why haven't you told me
you're ready?

200
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:41,489
You are ready, aren't you?

201
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,891
Just about, sir.

202
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,295
Just about isn't good enough.
Get cracking.

203
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,059
Yes, sir.

204
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,602
- Left guard, sir.
- All set?

205
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,864
Getting my heavy stuff
into position, sir.

206
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,098
<i>What's holding you up?</i>

207
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,938
We don't kick this off in time,
we've lost the element of surprise.

208
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,147
Okay.

209
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,759
Here, use mine.

210
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,220
Stock's blown the ammo dump.

211
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,547
Okay, you're on your own.

212
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,456
- We're moving in, Frank.
- All right. Now hit them hard.

213
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,810
Put your weapon away, you won't
find any Japanese around here.

214
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,967
We've licked them, sir.

215
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,410
You're sure?

216
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,720
Oh, you better get out of here, sir.

217
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,950
- Nervous, Stock?
- Me?

218
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,423
Hell, no. Let's go.

219
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:42,093
You know...

220
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:46,274
...I like that boy.

221
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,943
He's relaxing.

222
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:21,609
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- You stay away from my girl.

223
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:24,841
I recommend this guy for a Section 8.

224
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,555
Kolowicz.

225
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,093
When are we going home?

226
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,356
I don't know,
the general ain't checked me yet.

227
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:47,298
- Level with us. When are we going?
- When we get replaced by the British.

228
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:52,304
- What's holding them up?
- The enemy, you meathead.

229
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:01,879
- Hey, Kolowicz.
- Yeah.

230
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,315
- When are we going home?
- Is that all you guys ever think about?

231
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:09,022
I've been thinking about it
ever since Guadalcanal.

232
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:13,924
Sarge, will you make him stop eating
that slop? Turning my stomach.

233
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,963
A little rice with some chocolate bars
chopped in. What's wrong with that?

234
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,291
Ugh.

235
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:22,629
Hey, Eleanor, want some chow?

236
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,478
- Taggy.
- Hmm?

237
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:34,945
How many times do I have to tell you?
Tuck in the shirt.

238
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,084
Why does my shirt
always bother you, sarge?

239
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:38,913
You look sloppy.

240
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:42,420
- Nobody said I was sloppy in Bataan.
- You ain't on Bataan.

241
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,583
Nobody said I was sloppy
when I escaped from the Philippines.

242
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,091
You ain't in the Philippines.

243
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:49,322
Nobody said I was sloppy
in that open boat to Australia.

244
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:51,022
You ain't in an open boat either.

245
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,158
And nobody minded how sloppy I looked when
I enlisted in the American Army to keeping fight.

246
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,032
- I'm a Filipino!
- Yeah, just tuck it.

247
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,867
And I will wear my shirt out
until all tyrants are dead.

248
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,303
- Death to the tyrant!
- All right.

249
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:30,928
- You got O'Brien's?
- Yeah.

250
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:34,166
- Addresses?
- Right here.

251
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,279
This letter's to his father.

252
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,180
I was with him once on furlough.
They were pretty close.

253
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,517
I can't write letters.

254
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,284
This one took me two hours.

255
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:56,556
General, he's a great letter writer.

256
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,723
Wrote one for me once,
that time I was wounded.

257
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:03,496
He didn't have a home address for me
so he asked me for it.

258
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:08,575
I didn't have one, so I wasn't about
to tell him that. So I made up one.

259
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,576
He gave me the letter to read.

260
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,406
It was all about me and stuff like that.

261
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,212
I couldn't let a letter like that just go
any place, so I told him the truth.

262
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,584
I told him I didn't have anybody
for him to write to.

263
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,990
You can't guess what he did, Kolly.

264
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:31,098
He mailed that letter home to his wife
along with a picture of me.

265
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,829
You know what he said?

266
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:35,993
He said, "Sergeant..."

267
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:42,533
"...any time anybody wants to write home
about you, you give them my address."

268
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:01,193
How can I write these letters?

269
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:10,232
- Stock, sergeant.
- General.

270
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,337
Any sign of anything coming
around that bend?

271
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:15,498
No, sir.

272
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:17,975
Alert your men
that General Stilwell's expected.

273
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,876
- If he shows up, let me know.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,513
How many?

275
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,217
Eight.

276
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:34,521
When are those ambulance planes
getting here to pick up our wounded?

277
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:40,126
Plane was shot down by zeros
from Myitkyina.

278
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,705
Stock, what'd he say?

279
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,341
- When are we going home?
- You mean lieutenant.

280
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,909
From now on, all round here
he's the lieutenant, you remember that.

281
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:52,103
Now, get back to your gun.

282
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:56,106
Oh, boy.

283
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,881
Whew.

284
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:02,215
Why are you pulling rank for me?
I don't mind being called Stock.

285
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,018
- I like being close to my men.
- You're too close to them.

286
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,085
What's wrong with that?

287
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,656
You've gotta be able to write
those letters.

288
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,666
What'd the general say?
When are we going home?

289
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,376
- We're never going home.
- You talk like you got hit in the head.

290
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,912
Look, Merrill got kicked out
of Burma, didn't he?

291
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,979
Listen, I got it from a guy
in the first battalion.

292
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,438
The general won't be happy...

293
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,251
...till every Japanese
is bounced out of Burma.

294
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,410
Come off it.

295
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,989
Merrill wants to get out of this place
just as bad as we do.

296
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,217
Somebody's coming.

297
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:53,797
Now, Eleanor, you just keep calm.

298
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:58,036
You ain't got a thing to worry about,
your Uncle Muley, he'll take care of you.

299
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,551
Ha-ha! Here they come, boys!

300
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,620
The British are here!
We've been relieved!

301
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,381
See? Just like I told you.

302
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,049
Just like I told you the other day,
the British are here. Come on!

303
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,789
The British are here!
Muley, Taggy, come look at this!

304
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,025
I told you, Doskis.

305
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,033
Boy, we glad to see you guys.

306
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:24,466
Hey, what's your outfit?

307
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,504
The Queen's Own Royal
West Kent Regiment.

308
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,904
- Hey, that's a fancy name.
- How about that?
- Yah.

309
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,741
- What is your outfit?
- The 5307th Composite Unit.

310
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,746
Provisional.

311
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,942
Oh, quartermaster corps.

312
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,146
Quartermaster?
Do we look like supply clerks to you?

313
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,488
We're the United States Infantry
and death to the redcoats!

314
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,390
- Where you guys headed?
- Myitkyina.

315
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,159
Myitkyina?

316
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,991
Those poor guys.

317
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,159
Five hundred-mile hike from here.

318
00:30:56,337 --> 00:31:00,137
Yeah, and the 18th Japanese
Imperial Division's there.

319
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:03,106
Man, I'm glad
I'm not in that British army.

320
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,003
Amen.

321
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:08,509
General Stilwell, gentlemen.

322
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,120
- Merrill, Bannister.
- General.

323
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,416
- How are you, Frank?
- Fine, sir.

324
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:19,719
Well, you would say that anyway.

325
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:26,827
I'll come right to the point, Frank.
You've got to take Myitkyina.

326
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:31,962
I thought that was a British mission.

327
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,767
It still is.

328
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:36,502
But Myitkyina's going to need all of us.

329
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,341
Well, my men have earned
a breather, general.

330
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,778
After Myitkyina.

331
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,747
Sir, we've taken a beating.

332
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:48,753
My people have got malaria, dengue,
dysentery, psychological fatigue.

333
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:52,017
Being behind the enemy lines
for three months has sapped them.

334
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:55,924
You've got to beat the monsoon, Frank.
That means moving right away.

335
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,962
We're not the only outfit in Burma.

336
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:01,659
You're the only American infantry
between New Guinea and Italy.

337
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,137
British have been fighting here alone
three years now.

338
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,637
We've got to pull our weight.

339
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:11,245
I suggest you grab their railhead first
at this spot here, Shaduzup.

340
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,642
That will knock out their transportation.

341
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:16,978
Then cross the mountains to Myitkyina.

342
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:21,053
Sir, what the general is describing
is a six months' campaign...

343
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:24,385
...over the worst terrain in the world.

344
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,619
My men have just come 125 miles
through all sorts of hell.

345
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:30,855
To ask them to go another 500
and then fight a pitched battle...

346
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,092
...when they get there
is not only unfair, it's impossible.

347
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,099
And it's your job to do the impossible.

348
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,135
- Not without replacements.
- Replacements?

349
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:41,070
Every theater commander
is crying for replacements.

350
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,540
Eisenhower has got
first priority in Europe.

351
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,440
Then come MacArthur and Nimitz.

352
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,979
I'm a low man on the totem pole.

353
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:49,446
Frank, you're all I've got.

354
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:50,845
May I remind the general...

355
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:53,487
...every one of my men
is a two-year combat veteran.

356
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:57,352
They gave up earned furloughs so they
could volunteer for one mission, Walawbum.

357
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,356
They had one job to do and they did it.

358
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,825
Their job is to keep
the Japanese out of India...

359
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:05,090
...keep them from linking up
with the Germans.

360
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,938
That's my big nightmare, Frank.

361
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:17,601
One million Japanese
joining forces with the German army.

362
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:23,108
Myitkyina is the linchpin to Burma.
And Burma's the road to India.

363
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:31,382
It's gonna be tough, Frank,
but it's got to be done.

364
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:38,761
Oh, by the way, the newspaper boys
have made up a name for your men.

365
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,959
They're called the Marauders.

366
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,749
Come on, Eleanor.

367
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,262
Come on, Eleanor, come on.

368
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,598
- Come on, Eleanor!
- Come on, Eleanor!

369
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:20,768
Lieutenant, lieutenant.

370
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,432
General Merrill wants to see you, sir.

371
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,306
Hey, you're gonna get the word now,
Sto... Lieutenant.

372
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,708
Tsk.

373
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:32,653
Hey, maybe they'll give us
a private plane.

374
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,311
Who cares what kind of a plane
as long as it's Bombay.

375
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,957
How far is Bombay from New York?

376
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,889
Maybe they'll give us a big parade
up Dewey Boulevard. In Manila, hey.

377
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:43,224
- Now, for some real chow.
- San Francisco, here I come.

378
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,845
- You sent for me, sir?
- Stock, what shape are your men in?

379
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,915
They're rich.
Our mule just won the race.

380
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:04,312
- And you?
- I didn't bet.

381
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,816
You know what I mean.

382
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,919
All I have to admit, I'm looking
forward to getting back to Bombay.

383
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,958
Those eight men you lost,
that hit you pretty hard, didn't it?

384
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,992
They were my friends.

385
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,996
You think you can face
losing more of your friends?

386
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,496
We're not going back to Bombay,
are we?

387
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,933
Nope. We're going to Shaduzup.

388
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,438
There's a railhead there,
it has to be taken and held.

389
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,180
They're gonna be looking for us.

390
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,976
So we're gonna go there the hard way,
through the swamps.

391
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,743
Yes, sir.

392
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,253
Your men have been out at point
for a long stretch now.

393
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,720
They've got a break coming.

394
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,382
If you want me to,
I'll put another platoon out front.

395
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,960
You leaving me that choice?

396
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:49,562
That's right.

397
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,698
Well, that's a tough decision to make.

398
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,128
Can I think it over?

399
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:56,031
We're moving right out.

400
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:58,733
Why don't I get going?

401
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:02,506
Yeah, why don't you?

402
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:28,595
Frank.

403
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:32,604
Don't you think you might have
told him about Myitkyina?

404
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:38,202
It's tough enough for him
to tell them what he's telling them now.

405
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,682
All right, take 10.

406
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,691
Oh, baby.

407
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,828
Well, how's it going, Chris?

408
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:14,268
Beats milking cows back in Kansas.

409
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:18,936
Better radio the column,
tell them we're taking a break.

410
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:22,779
Stock to quarterback, we're taking 10.

411
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:24,845
Okay.

412
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:04,153
Battalion reports are no good.

413
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:07,123
They're out of food, water.

414
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:10,991
Sick list is growing.
They need more rest.

415
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,766
Who doesn't?

416
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,765
Behind our timetable now
on account of all this muck.

417
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,237
I don't know how they're doing it.

418
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:24,174
Typhus, malaria.

419
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,816
We're hurting. We're hurting, Frank.

420
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:35,319
You better get the column started,
Barney.

421
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,119
All right, Frank.

422
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,498
What's the matter with you?

423
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,705
You look funny to me, general.

424
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,034
Heh. Funny.

425
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:01,044
You're not gonna pin
one of those little tags on me.

426
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:04,013
Pin it on your back, if you not looking
they'll drag you out of here.

427
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:07,677
I told you, all I had was a dizzy spell,
maybe a touch of fever.

428
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:09,720
Nothing to it.

429
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,949
Open your shirt.

430
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,151
Will you stop apple-polishing?

431
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,319
You already took my blood pressure.

432
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,328
Open your shirt.

433
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,595
You're wasting my time.

434
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,709
Would you like me to cough?

435
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,785
How long you been getting away
with this?

436
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:40,943
Away with what?

437
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:44,614
- You don't have to lie, general, I'm your doctor.
- The last physical, I was topnotch.

438
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:48,023
- I don't believe you.
- A captain always believes a general.

439
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,390
How long have you been having
chest pains?

440
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,731
When was the last time
you had a pain in your left arm?

441
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,563
Did you go in a pool of sweat?

442
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:03,335
I'm in one now, damn it.

443
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,905
My men are liable to die in this swamp
without firing a shot.

444
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,854
Okay, okay.

445
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:21,421
I had one about a year ago,
three years ago, I...

446
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,298
In Tokyo, as military attache.

447
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,396
I was treated at a private hospital.

448
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,403
What was the diagnosis?

449
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:39,240
I'll tell you what it was. Heart.

450
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,448
Coronary thrombosis.

451
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:44,379
And you're on your way to another one.

452
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,886
Doc, keep this under your hat.

453
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:54,927
Captain Kolodny,
I'd like you to regard that as an order.

454
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,317
- Hey, Stock.
- Yeah.

455
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:29,928
Ain't this column got any food?

456
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,997
What do you bet
they're holding out on back there?

457
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,929
Nobody's holding out on you,
Chowhound.

458
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,966
We're all in the same boat.

459
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,104
Yeah, we could use one around here,
you know.

460
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,768
I didn't know we have enough blood left
for these damn leeches.

461
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,312
Medic.

462
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,810
Get Doskis.

463
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:02,357
Hey, Stock, on the level,
when we getting out of here?

464
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,297
Like I told you,
when we hit the railroad tracks.

465
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,129
Railroad tracks? Heh-heh. He's kidding?

466
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:14,240
There ain't nothing at the end of this
swamp except maybe more swamp.

467
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,241
Relax, Bullseye.

468
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,878
Take advantage of the break.

469
00:43:19,046 --> 00:43:21,776
How did you even get into this outfit,
Muley?

470
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,150
They drafted Eleanor.

471
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:25,717
Where she goes, I go.

472
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,555
Yeah, you're two of a kind.

473
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:32,351
Boy, if my mother could see me now.

474
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,359
- You know, there was a time...
- Hey, what time is it?

475
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:37,763
Seven-fifteen.

476
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:39,627
A.M. or P.M.?

477
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,290
A.M., you knothead.

478
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:43,663
Taggy, it's P.M.
It's night, it's getting dark.

479
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:45,065
You're out of your head.

480
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,106
It was night already.

481
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:53,007
Now, I'm watching very carefully.
It's P.M.

482
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,946
Okay, wise guy,
if you're so smart, what day is it?

483
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,113
It's Tuesday.

484
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,753
Everybody knows it's Sunday.

485
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:03,048
- It's Tuesday.
- It's Sunday.

486
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,191
You been hearing church bells
or something?

487
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,589
You both got battle fatigue.
It's Wednesday.

488
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:09,820
How do you know? You got a calendar?

489
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:12,227
- It's my birthday.
- Let's bake a cake.

490
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,192
No.

491
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,404
I got a better idea.

492
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,401
Let's have some steaks.

493
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:27,412
You better knock that idea
right out of your mouth, Chowhound.

494
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,708
People eat horses. What's the matter?

495
00:44:29,883 --> 00:44:32,818
Nobody eats mule meat
until I tell you to.

496
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,955
Now, get some shuteye
for a few minutes.

497
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,287
All of you.

498
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,293
Whoa, baby. Now, just settle down.

499
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,196
That's it.

500
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,271
When I close my eyes,
I see a mule's behind.

501
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:00,039
Also when I open them.

502
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,387
What's wrong with Doskis?

503
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,320
Typhus.

504
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,030
Typhus.

505
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:26,739
Are you sure?

506
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:29,375
He's got the rash,
and I found a bug bite in his leg.

507
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:31,773
He's running 105.

508
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:33,845
Does he know it?

509
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:36,175
He thinks it's malaria.

510
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,514
Tag him that.

511
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,914
Yes, sir.

512
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:05,896
All right, knock it off.

513
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,768
Knock it off, knock it off. Come on.

514
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:08,930
Muley.

515
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:11,077
Chowhound. Come on.

516
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,513
You guys wanna fight,
wait till we find some more Japanese.

517
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:16,546
I caught Chowhound
going through my pack.

518
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:18,776
This phony muleskinner's
hoarding the food.

519
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:20,817
What did you do with the K rations...

520
00:47:20,988 --> 00:47:23,479
- ...I saw you put in that pack?
- I gave them to you last week...

521
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:25,420
...you crazy tapeworm!

522
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:32,444
Come on.

523
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:34,233
Let's go.

524
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:36,199
Lieutenant Stockton.

525
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,435
- What's holding you up?
- One of my men's down.

526
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:51,716
- Who is it?
- Corporal Doskis.

527
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,520
What's the matter with him?

528
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:01,989
Typhus.

529
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,995
- What did you tag him?
- Malaria.

530
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:08,328
- Got many cases?
- Got too many.

531
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,782
Railroad tracks
shouldn't be too far away now.

532
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:14,157
I wonder if he made contact
with anybody.

533
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,275
Over here, general.

534
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,677
I found the railroad tracks.

535
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:09,479
Barney, send for a food drop.

536
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:15,427
See, just like I told you, Eleanor...

537
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,758
...Uncle Muley said
he'd get you out of this swamp.

538
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,429
Attagirl.

539
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,003
Reached rear base loud and clear
on the radio, sir.

540
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,472
The food is on the way.

541
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,820
All right, everybody, back
in the swamp and keep moving.

542
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,134
Aren't we gonna wait for the air drop,
sir?

543
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,633
No.

544
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,864
- These men are starving.
- I'd rather have them hungry than dead.

545
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,000
Parachutes will bring
the enemy to this spot.

546
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:05,301
We're not gonna be here.

547
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,777
- What do we do for food?
- Fight for it.

548
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,913
Right at the end of those tracks
is our objective.

549
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,913
We'll eat Japanese food.

550
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:16,619
I want everybody in the swamp.
Get moving!

551
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,399
All of you, in the swamp!

552
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,434
Get moving!

553
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:21,840
Stock, let me have that hot one.

554
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:53,144
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on, let's get you over here.

555
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:01,911
Uh...

556
00:59:04,657 --> 00:59:07,217
Let's have a look at this, young lady.

557
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:17,726
Here.

558
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,365
Hey, look, hey.

559
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:26,941
Watch me.

560
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,339
See?

561
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,758
See? Won't hurt you.
Here.

562
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:43,289
There.

563
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,247
That ought to hold it.

564
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:13,455
Get you over to the doc...

565
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:18,154
...and see if we can't get
that piece of shrapnel out of there.

566
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:21,427
Medic.

567
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,064
Take care will you.
She's got steel in her thigh.

568
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:27,468
- I gave her some sulfur.
- Sure, Stock.

569
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,073
Hey. Heh.

570
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,473
Hey, he's not gonna hurt you. There.

571
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:35,773
Hey, it's going to be all right.

572
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:39,042
Go on now, he's gonna
take care of your leg.

573
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:44,418
There.

574
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,070
Here you are, Eleanor.

575
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:13,508
It's genuine Shaduzup H2O.

576
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:30,221
Hey, Bullseye.

577
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:33,061
Hmm?

578
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,159
Girls.

579
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,328
Yeah.

580
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:05,785
Are the landing strips ready?

581
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,825
The wounded all set for evacuation.

582
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:12,897
Hey, you out of pipe tobacco?

583
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:14,259
Oh-ho.

584
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,924
No, I guess I lost my pouch
in the swamp somewhere.

585
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,401
Signal from headquarters.
Northern Combat Command.

586
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:21,870
General Stilwell is messaging you, sir.

587
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,838
Ben, give him a hand decoding,
will you?

588
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,068
Yes, sir.

589
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:27,875
Do you have a match?

590
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:32,276
He sure doesn't waste much time,
does he?

591
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,248
Well, doc...

592
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:36,617
...what's the score?

593
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,723
You want details?

594
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:42,122
No, no, just the bottom line.

595
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:46,425
The 5307th has collapsed.

596
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:50,558
From a medical viewpoint,
they're finished as a fighting unit.

597
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:56,238
Could I have that fire again? I don't seem
to be able to get this pipe going.

598
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:59,503
I have never seen human beings
in such condition.

599
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:04,707
Drained. Physically
and psychologically drained.

600
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,047
I'm not tagging them
for specific ailments.

601
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,486
Simply marking every man
in the outfit AOE.

602
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,092
Accumulation of everything.

603
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,322
They're through.

604
01:05:17,897 --> 01:05:20,024
I have General Stilwell's message, sir.

605
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,097
Read it.

606
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:24,236
"Three Japanese divisions invading India."

607
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:26,837
"Imperative we take Myitkyina.
Can you do it?"

608
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,997
Frank, he's asking if we can do it.

609
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,666
- That lets us out.
- Does it?

610
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,540
Of course it does. He's not ordering us
to go to Myitkyina.

611
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:36,443
He's leaving it up to you.

612
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:40,643
Yeah. Yeah, he's leaving it up
to me, all right.

613
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:44,283
All right, doc.

614
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:48,518
Let's have a look at this
washed-up outfit of ours...

615
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:54,132
...all right make up my mind whether
or not we can go on to Myitkyina.

616
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:04,934
May I ask you a question, general?

617
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,704
What are you looking for?

618
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:12,082
Something that's not
in your medical book, doc.

619
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,378
- Can I get out of line?
- No.

620
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,989
All right, forget about the Army.
This is just between doctor and patient.

621
01:06:18,157 --> 01:06:19,385
Answer's still no.

622
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,992
All right, then I'm going to talk to you
as a friend.

623
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:25,358
If you're thinking about sending
these men to Myitkyina, don't do it.

624
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:27,795
You'll never be able
to live with yourself.

625
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,269
How do you know what I'm able
to live with?

626
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:34,201
I wouldn't want it on my conscience.

627
01:06:34,373 --> 01:06:37,501
Nobody wants you to have anything
on your conscience.

628
01:06:37,677 --> 01:06:42,376
You're being paid to make diagnoses,
I'm paid to make decisions.

629
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:45,642
I hope your decision is as accurate
as my diagnosis.

630
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:47,911
Checking on your diagnosis
right now.

631
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,022
- Who's going to check on your decision?
- Me.

632
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:54,318
You're kidding yourself, general.
You got no decision to make.

633
01:06:54,493 --> 01:06:57,724
These men are at the end of their rope,
and so're you.

634
01:06:57,897 --> 01:07:00,593
When you're at the end of your rope,
all you have to do...

635
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,202
...is make one foot move out
in front of the other.

636
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:08,272
You just take the next step.
That's all there is too.

637
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:19,316
Who're you?

638
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,843
Merrill. Who're you?

639
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:24,083
Lieutenant Lemcheck make it?

640
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,426
Did Lemcheck make it?

641
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:30,459
I saw him get hit.

642
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,358
Poor Lemcheck.

643
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:33,991
Poor Lemcheck...

644
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,132
He's dead.

645
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:47,140
Did Lemcheck make it?

646
01:07:48,347 --> 01:07:50,338
He's Lemcheck.

647
01:08:51,777 --> 01:08:54,541
Chris, headquarters needs
another radio man.

648
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,078
Taggy, you go along with him.

649
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:02,080
They've got some captured
Japanese documents need translating.

650
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:05,917
Kolowicz, put four men on security.

651
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:09,993
Bullseye, pick up eight cases of ammo
for the platoon.

652
01:09:10,162 --> 01:09:11,823
Ammo?

653
01:09:13,966 --> 01:09:16,264
What's Merrill volunteering us for
this time?

654
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,801
We're low. Get the ammo.

655
01:09:18,971 --> 01:09:20,438
I don't need any ammo.

656
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:22,369
Damn it, I'm not fighting anybody.

657
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,771
Pick up the ammo, Bullseye.

658
01:09:24,944 --> 01:09:27,139
Tell Merrill to pick it up himself.

659
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:30,305
- What did you say?
- I said, tell Merrill to pick it up himself.

660
01:09:30,482 --> 01:09:33,178
I've taken my last order
from that butcher.

661
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:48,463
I'm sorry, Stock.

662
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:52,231
I didn't mean it.

663
01:09:52,404 --> 01:09:54,133
I didn't either.

664
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,605
- I'll get the ammo.
- I'll give him a hand, lieutenant.

665
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:16,522
- They're coming apart.
- Yeah.

666
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:18,629
Yeah, we all are.

667
01:10:19,498 --> 01:10:22,729
Well, I hope Merrill don't take us
any further than this.

668
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:25,870
What's left of us.

669
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:44,084
"I just made..."

670
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:45,655
"...the most..."

671
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:51,563
"...difficult decision..."

672
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,358
"...of my life."

673
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:58,894
"I pray..."

674
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:04,600
"...I've chosen correctly."

675
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:11,411
"Kiss the children for me."

676
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,481
"My love..."

677
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,557
"...to you, as always."

678
01:11:22,494 --> 01:11:24,394
"Frank."

679
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:27,831
Hello, Stock.

680
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,434
Message to General Stilwell
transmitted, sir.

681
01:11:30,602 --> 01:11:32,092
Thank you.

682
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:35,063
General?

683
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,807
I've never asked a favor of you before,
but I've gotta ask one now.

684
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:43,312
I'd like your permission to tell my men
when they're going home.

685
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:51,419
Stock, I've just radioed General Stilwell
that I've decided to go into Myitkyina.

686
01:11:52,624 --> 01:11:55,286
- To Myitkyina?
- Yup.

687
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:58,658
I told him, in my opinion,
we can take the base.

688
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:03,432
Sir, my men can't make it.

689
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:05,069
Yes, they can.

690
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,967
- You don't know my men.
- I know them better than you do.

691
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:11,701
General, it's not that they don't want
to fight. They can't.

692
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:13,902
They just can't physically fight anymore.

693
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,607
If they've got a single ounce of strength
left in them, they can fight.

694
01:12:22,054 --> 01:12:23,954
Men don't mean anything to you,
do they?

695
01:12:25,891 --> 01:12:29,725
They're just two legs to walk with,
shoulders to carry a pack...

696
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:32,693
...pair of hands to shoot a rifle,
that's all.

697
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:37,532
When I pinned those bars on you,
I made a leader out of you.

698
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,770
And when you lead,
you have to hurt people.

699
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,100
The enemy and sometimes your own.

700
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,844
I don't want any more
of my men butchered.

701
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:49,913
And I request to be relieved
of the command of my platoon.

702
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,277
Request denied. I need you too much.

703
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:17,330
O'Steen.

704
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:21,569
Pick that up.

705
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,465
Pick up the ammo belt and put it on.

706
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:41,148
Here you go.

707
01:14:44,997 --> 01:14:47,397
Hold on to that ammo.
You're no good to me dead.

708
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:52,960
- Go on, O'Steen.
- Yes, sir.

709
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:20,017
What's holding it up?
Come on, let's move out.

710
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:25,185
Come on now, Eleanor. Come on, baby.

711
01:16:25,364 --> 01:16:28,663
Now, come on, Eleanor,
you volunteered for this too.

712
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:34,469
Okay.

713
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,040
- Ready to shove her over.
- No!

714
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:39,006
You can't do that, sarge.

715
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,908
She'll be all right after a little rest.
Her load's too heavy.

716
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,245
Muley, she's holding up
the whole column.

717
01:16:48,553 --> 01:16:49,850
Wait, I'll carry her load!

718
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:58,520
Bullseye, give me a hand
with this pack.

719
01:18:10,702 --> 01:18:15,036
Come on, Eleanor,
we can climb this little old hill.

720
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:55,709
Just like old Uncle Muley told you.

721
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,010
We made it, Eleanor.

722
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:12,561
Come on, Muley.
Watch your head, come on.

723
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,821
Over yonder is Myitkyina.

724
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:45,287
You don't agree with what I'm doing,
do you, Barney?

725
01:19:45,464 --> 01:19:49,594
Well, the textbooks would say
that dividing our forces at this point...

726
01:19:49,768 --> 01:19:52,362
...invites piecemeal destruction.

727
01:19:55,173 --> 01:19:58,506
I wouldn't teach students
this sort of thing.

728
01:19:59,344 --> 01:20:01,209
But if we can make the Japanese think...

729
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:04,678
...that there's twice as many of us
as there are...

730
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:11,317
Well, what would you do
if it were your decision?

731
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,118
I'd go through the same hell
that you did making yours.

732
01:20:16,795 --> 01:20:20,458
How long do you figure
before you can hit the base?

733
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:26,270
In our condition, 24 hours.

734
01:20:26,438 --> 01:20:31,535
18th Japanese Division
will be waiting there for us.

735
01:20:32,377 --> 01:20:34,607
Do you feel anything?

736
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,781
- Rain.
- Yeah.

737
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:43,187
Yeah, only a few drops,
but it could be the beginning.

738
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:46,017
We've got to beat that monsoon.

739
01:20:50,028 --> 01:20:52,997
When this is all over,
you know what I'm going to do?

740
01:20:54,032 --> 01:20:57,195
I'm gonna get married.
I'm gonna have about six kids.

741
01:20:57,369 --> 01:21:01,066
I'll line them up against the wall and tell
them what it was like here in Burma.

742
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:04,675
And if they don't cry,
I'll beat the hell out of them.

743
01:21:04,843 --> 01:21:06,071
I'll see you in Myitkyina.

744
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:08,144
So long, friend.

745
01:21:23,895 --> 01:21:26,762
Request general's permission
to bury my man here.

746
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,677
In there.

747
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:00,915
Get on that radio.
Find out if Bannister's been hit.

748
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:38,647
Wonder what they're up to next.

749
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:41,857
There's only one way to find out.

750
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:52,596
Pass the word. Taggy's going out.

751
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:00,502
Enemy infiltration increasing along
the first battalion right flank, sir.

752
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:03,368
- Who's holding that position?
- Stock's platoon, sir.

753
01:26:18,022 --> 01:26:19,922
Hey, sarge?

754
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:26,356
Kolowicz, where are you?

755
01:26:28,533 --> 01:26:32,492
Sarge, hey, sarge.

756
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:39,040
Now, you keep your mouth shut.

757
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,993
Don't shoot. It's Taggy, I'm coming in.

758
01:27:06,571 --> 01:27:09,005
- Did you learn anything?
- Banzai when it gets light.

759
01:27:09,173 --> 01:27:10,162
Are you hurt?

760
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:11,865
A little.

761
01:27:25,456 --> 01:27:27,686
Infiltration's stopped, sir.

762
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:32,829
Stock's okay, sir.
I just talked to his radio man.

763
01:27:45,376 --> 01:27:47,071
You got good cover in here, Eleanor.

764
01:27:53,084 --> 01:27:56,679
Taggy got some dope.
There's a banzai dawn.

765
01:27:58,389 --> 01:28:00,857
Terry, pass the word along the line.

766
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:04,483
- Stock.
- Yes, sir?

767
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:14,798
That's all.

768
01:28:32,123 --> 01:28:35,889
Stay awake, soldier. Banzai dawn.

769
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:41,158
Banzai dawn, Kolly.

770
01:28:43,301 --> 01:28:45,132
Banzai dawn.

771
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:47,168
Banzai dawn.

772
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,637
Banzai dawn. Banzai dawn.

773
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:11,556
- Here.
- It's your last one, sir.

774
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:15,995
Go on, take it.
Doc says smoking's bad for me.

775
01:31:46,617 --> 01:31:48,606
Come in, left guard.
Come in, left guard.

776
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:51,714
<i>We're pinned down
by heavy gun fire from west of here.</i>

777
01:31:51,889 --> 01:31:53,789
<i>Send medics, send medics.</i>

778
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:55,550
<i>Victor to Tom, I have fallen back.</i>

779
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:57,455
<i>I am reorganizing and digging in.</i>

780
01:31:57,628 --> 01:32:01,120
<i>Lou hit by enemy sniper.
Suggest you get down at once.</i>

781
01:32:01,299 --> 01:32:03,631
<i>All units! All units! Enemy making
heavy rush through center.</i>

782
01:32:03,801 --> 01:32:04,859
<i>Breakthrough! Breakthrough!</i>

783
01:32:53,284 --> 01:32:55,445
<i>Left guard to quarterback.
Japanese falling back.</i>

784
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,815
<i>Right guard to quarterback.
Enemy pulling out.</i>

785
01:33:07,398 --> 01:33:10,765
- We beat them off, they're running.
- But why?

786
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,304
Quarterback to Bannister.
Come in, Bannister.

787
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:19,739
<i>This is Bannister. Come in, quarterback.</i>

788
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,674
- What is your situation?
- <i>We've reached the airstrip.</i>

789
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,782
<i>We're attacking. Resistance is heavy.</i>

790
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,180
It's gonna get heavier.

791
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:31,248
That's the reason
the Japanese are pulling out.

792
01:33:31,422 --> 01:33:35,085
Heading back to Myitkyina to defend
the airstrip. We'd better get a move on.

793
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:52,175
Notify battalion
to assemble all able-bodied men.

794
01:33:52,343 --> 01:33:55,540
- We're moving on Myitkyina.
- Yes, sir.

795
01:34:14,131 --> 01:34:17,623
I want every man who can walk,
every man who can carry a rifle.

796
01:34:17,802 --> 01:34:21,294
- You cannot order these men to fight.
- Every man who can carry a rifle!

797
01:34:21,472 --> 01:34:23,963
Bannister needs one more push.
With these men we can take Myitkyina.

798
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:26,632
You cannot order them to fight.
They'll never make it.

799
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:28,039
You'll never make it.

800
01:34:28,212 --> 01:34:30,908
Doc, just give me something
to keep me on my feet 24 hours.

801
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:34,210
- That's all I ask, 24 hours.
- You're asking for a miracle, general.

802
01:34:34,385 --> 01:34:36,751
I don't have any up my sleeve
and neither have you.

803
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,821
A miracle isn't called for.

804
01:34:38,989 --> 01:34:42,857
Just another step. Just one more step!

805
01:34:54,805 --> 01:34:57,399
All right, everybody, on your feet.

806
01:34:57,575 --> 01:35:00,738
As long as you can breathe,
you can fight.

807
01:35:01,846 --> 01:35:03,609
Come on, boy, pick up that rifle.

808
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,078
Come on, son, follow me.

809
01:35:05,249 --> 01:35:07,979
You can make it.
All you have to do is take that next step.

810
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:12,111
That's all there is to it,
just put one foot in front of the other.

811
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:13,278
Come on, let's go!

812
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,711
You heard the general.

813
01:35:42,386 --> 01:35:44,115
On your feet.

814
01:35:45,523 --> 01:35:48,083
Kolowicz, move out.

815
01:35:51,128 --> 01:35:53,858
Chris, let's go.

816
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:56,359
Move out.

817
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:00,502
Let's go.

818
01:36:34,939 --> 01:36:37,464
What sort of men are these?

819
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:40,069
How do they do it?

820
01:36:41,178 --> 01:36:43,646
How can they do it?

821
01:36:44,849 --> 01:36:49,411
<i>But they did it. They did the impossible.</i>

822
01:36:49,587 --> 01:36:52,420
<i>They took Myitkyina.</i>

823
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:59,386
<i>On that day of victory, of the 3,000
volunteers who marched into Burma...</i>

824
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:02,930
<i>...only 100 remained in action.</i>

825
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,967
<i>On that same day,
Merrill's Marauders were demobilized...</i>

826
01:37:06,136 --> 01:37:08,969
<i>...and thus ceased to exist officially.</i>

827
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,974
<i>But by order
of the president of the United States...</i>

828
01:37:12,142 --> 01:37:14,736
<i>...a special-unit citation
was awarded these men...</i>

829
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,403
<i>...so that history
would never forget them.</i>

830
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:21,608
<i>Today, their traditions are being carried
on by the U.S. Army Special Forces...</i>

831
01:37:21,785 --> 01:37:24,754
<i>...and the other proud units
of the United States Army.</i>

832
01:37:25,856 --> 01:37:27,721
<i>We salute them all.</i>
