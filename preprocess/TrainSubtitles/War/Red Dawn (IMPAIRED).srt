would always begin

18

with the armies spread out
in a semi-circle,

19

20

Then they would ride forward,

22
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:55,158
Now, the ends would kind of
close in to form a shrinking circle.

23
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,066
Everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

24

When the Mongols could see each other

25
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,500

I don't know.

163
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,924
But I'm alive.

164
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,997
And I'm staying here.

165
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,400
My family would want me to stay alive.

166
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,234
Your family would want you to stay alive.

167
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:47,142
You think you're so smart, man.
But you're just a bunch of scared kids.

168
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,179
What do you think you are?

169
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,979
Alone, I guess.

00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,657
No, you're not.

The rest of you get going.

176
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,598
All right, but if you stay

177
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,500
you're gonna do exactly what I say, okay?

178
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,534
- Huh?
- Yeah.

179
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,302

Sorry.

Me too, man.

Okay.

Now,

185
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,069
Matt and I've been coming up to these
mountains with our dad all of our lives.

186
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,545
We can hunt, we can fish,
we can stay up here a long, long time.

187
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,938
Okay?

188
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,072

191
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,861
I got him!

192
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,867
You got him.

193
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,149
- Gonna eat good...
- He's still breathing.

194
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,884
Never shoot twice.

195
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,944
Shoot twice, they can find you.

196
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,388
He's dead, anyway.

197
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,956
How do you know?

198
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,897
I used to read a lot about
Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

199
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,767
The Blackfeet, if you shot twice,
would know right where you were.

My dad named me after Jed Smith.

This is your first time, isn't it?

202
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,346
Yeah. What?

203
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,815
You gotta drink if it's your first. We did.

204
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,880
What's it taste like?

205
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,752
It's not too bad.

206
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,091
It's kinda salty like a steak or
when you've got a nosebleed, you know.

207
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,496
You gotta do it. It's the spirit of the deer.

208

You did it.

there's gonna be something
different about you. Always.

Wasn't so bad.

were gonna make trouble for them.

Your daddy's dead, Robert.

They shot him.

373

The Russians found some guns missing,

374
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,422
so they shot him for aiding guerillas.

375
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,761
What do you mean '"aiding guerillas'"?
He never aided anybody.

- We took the stuff.
- We killed him.

377

They killed him, son.
Made him an example.

your son is a prominent student leader.

489
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:58,575
Yes. Well, he is a leader,
but not in a violent or physical way.

490

No, you see, Daryl is more
of a politician, like his father.

A member of an elite paramilitary

Yes, but that's not military.

he's scared, he's hungry,

494

and he's just as anxious to avoid conflicts
as you and me.

He's not a troublemaker.

That's why they're here now.

and we won't either.

Not on our own soil.
