Suture. Clamp.

3
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,813
Suture.

- Sponge.
- [Scoffs]

00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:20,217
Frank, as long as we
have to work together...

6
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:22,515
- I don't see why we can't be friends.
- Friends?

7
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:26,921
Don't you dare mention the word "friend"
to me, you... you nurse. Scissors.

8
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:29,586
- Ow!
- Hmm.

9
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:33,791
Hey, you two, these public displays
of affection have got to stop.

10
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:37,130
- [Both Chuckling]
- [B.J.] I've seen it happen before.

11
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:40,262
Married men go all to pieces
when their girlfriends get engaged.

12
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:42,273
- Cut.
- It's not losing a girlfriend.

13
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,673
- He's afraid of getting
his own wife back.
- [Chuckles]

14
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:48,406
Look at this foot...
kid's quite a marksman, isn't he?

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,472
Don't let Frank hear you say that.
If he finds out this kid shot himself...

16
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,484
he'll form a posse
and have him lynched.

17
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:57,318
Yeah. Suture. Wonder why
they always go for the foot.

18
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,448
Why didn't he try shooting
himself in the canteen?

19
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:01,458
Yeah, then they could win
the Purple Tush.

20
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:05,257
- Close for me.
- Blow it out your ear.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,534
All right, where did you hide
the Band-Aids?

22
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,571
Band-Aids? You're working on
an abdominal wound the size
of the Grand Canyon.

23
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,698
It's for me, you simp.
She pinched my pinkie with her scissors.

24
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,709
She was getting even.
You pinched her plenty of times.

25
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:21,245
- Tit for tat.
- Yeah, what's that?

26
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,873
That? In medical parlance,
we call that a foot.

27
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,883
- See? It's a matched set.
- You know what I mean.

28
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,715
I happen to be an expert on foot wounds,
and that looks fishy to me.

29
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:32,484
- I think he has a fish fetish.
- This man shot himself.

30
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,424
- No, no, no, no.
That's not what happened.
- No?

31
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:39,988
See, this is Danny Fitzsimons,
the star placekicker from Fordham.

32
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,226
Now, what happened is,
an enemy soldier...

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,666
shot at him
from very close range.

34
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,069
And instinctively, Danny tried to kick
the bullet out of the way.

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,074
- It's true.
- You're kidding!

36
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,076
- No.
- Well, what about the enemy soldier?

37
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:55,443
- Ten-yard penalty.
- For roughing the kicker.

38
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:57,448
Twerps.

39
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,916
There's an incoming chopper, sirs.
Two wounded.

40
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:02,749
- Radar, get him into post-op.
- Then go find Father Mulcahy.

41
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:04,812
He oughta have a little talk
with our football hero.

42
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,824
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,651
- Corporal?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,663
Does Fordham
have a football team?

45
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,132
- I don't know, sir.
I've been in post-op all morning.
- Oh.

46
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:40,717
Take care of my pal first.
He's much worse.

47
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,420
- We're gonna take care of everybody.
- Please go check on him.

48
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,191
- He saved my life.
- Lift him out.

<i>[B.J. Chattering]</i>

- Notice anything unusual about this guy?
- <i>He's out of uniform.</i>

51
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:54,895
- He's wearing a fur coat.
- I'm glad he's conscious.

52
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,305
I'd hate to have to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

53
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,247
- How is he?
- He's fine.

54
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:05,875
He just asked me how you bust out
of this chicken outfit.

Um, Father...
Oh, I'm sorry, Father.

58
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,668
No. Oh, what is it, Radar?

59
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:29,104
Oh, Father, Captain Pierce
wants you in the O.R. Right away.

60
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:32,007
- He says he has someone
he wants you to talk to.
- Well, certainly.

61
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,375
- It's not for the last rites, is it?
- Oh, no, sir.

62
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:37,142
- Thank heaven.
- Oh, uh, Father...

63
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:40,480
excuse me, would you happen to know
if Fordham has a football team?

64
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:44,113
A darn good one. They don't call them
the Rams for nothing.

65
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,350
I knew a priest
would know.

66
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:49,985
He tried to warn me about the mine,
but I wasn't paying attention.

67
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:52,291
So he tripped it...
saved my life.

68
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,298
I think he's gonna
be all right.

69
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,300
It's mostly the leg,
especially the paw.

70
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,701
Captain, I don't mean to seem
unsympathetic, but that dog
really shouldn't be in here.

71
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:02,968
- Think of the germs.
- You have more germs
than that dog, Nurse.

72
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,839
- I beg your pardon!
- I rise in defense of the lady.

73
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:10,712
- She showers frequently.
I know because I watch her.
- Pervert.

74
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:13,376
I just meant that dogs don't have
as many germs as humans.

75
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,011
- <i>Forget it.</i>
- Hawkeye? There's someone
you want me to talk to?

76
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,282
Yeah. I got kind of
an unusual case for you, Father.

77
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:21,325
Oh, my!
What denomination is he?

78
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:24,328
<i>[Hawkeye] He's a German shepherd.</i>
<i>I guess that makes him a Lutheran.</i>

79
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,330
Oh, gee.
What happened, fella?

80
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,094
It's not the dog, Father.
It's Private Fitzsimons in post-op.

81
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,227
- What's the trouble?
- Why don't you just go
have a talk with him, okay?

82
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,238
Certainly.

83
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,265
- Oh, Frank, um...
- Huh?

84
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:40,368
I got a case over here.
It's a little over my head.

85
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:43,346
It's another foot wound. Since you're
the expert, why don't you take it?

86
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:47,181
Of course. You understand that
it's not necessarily because
I'm a better surgeon than you.

87
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:50,312
- It's just that, uh, I know my feet.
- I know.

88
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,913
Uh, listen. L-I, um,
I think I oughta warn you...

89
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,482
that this definitely
is self-inflicted.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,528
- You're sure?
- Positive.

91
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:00,463
He tripped a land mine on purpose.
We have a witness.

92
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:04,263
[Sighs]
Well, I'm here as a doctor.

93
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:07,703
I mean, first we'll get him healthy
again, then, uh, court-martial him.

94
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,104
And if all goes well,
put him in front of a firing squad.

95
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,370
- Where is he?
- Right over here.

96
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:18,177
- That's a dog!
- Very good, Frank.

97
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,447
- I knew he'd get it.
- I'm not operating on any damn dog.

98
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,046
Oh, come on, sir. You've got to.
After all, dogs are people too.

99
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:28,354
Well, I'm not going to do it. Especially
because that's a self-inflicted wound.

100
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:31,725
- He did it to save my life.
- Well, that's what he says now.

101
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:36,631
Look. He might be a dog, but he
also happens to be a corporal
in the United States Army.

102
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:40,398
See, these two were scheduled to be
rotated back to the States any day now.

103
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:43,908
And it wouldn't look very good, Frank,
if... if, uh... What's his name?

104
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,944
- Cupcake.
- Really?

105
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,242
If Corporal Cupcake
never made it back to the States...

106
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:51,373
because you wouldn't
operate on him.

107
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,409
- Don't forget. He's a hero.
- He's scheduled to be awarded
the Silver Fire Hydrant.

108
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:59,082
Well... I better scrub.

109
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,721
You're gonna be okay, boy.

110
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,061
An altar boy, my.
Where you from?

111
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:12,501
Philadelphia.
Saint Isadore's Parish.

112
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,529
Philadelphia!
I was in the seminary there.

113
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:20,305
- You must know Father Marty Gallagher.
- Sure do. He's my pastor.

114
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:24,041
Oh, I studied with him.
Oh, what a man.

115
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:27,414
- We used to call him
"Boom Boom" Gallagher.
- So did we.

116
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,181
- Father, do you know how
he got his name Boom Boom?
- No, I don't.

117
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:32,246
He was a chaplain
in World War II.

118
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:34,258
He was always
way up at the front.

119
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:38,456
He was so close to the artillery
that when he finished a sermon,
the enemy would say "Amen."

120
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,399
[Laughs] Yes, he used to tell us
stories about the war.

121
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:47,962
But I have to admit, I don't find war
quite as exciting as he did.

122
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,202
- Neither do I.
- You know, Father Gallagher...

123
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,643
would be proud of you
right now.

124
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:56,908
- I don't think so.
- Oh, why wouldn't he be?

125
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:59,882
Because I shot myself
in the foot to get outta here.

126
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,186
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,818
Danny, how old are you?

128
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,384
Eighteen... and a half.

129
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:15,229
<i>Well, you're young. You're far</i>
<i>from home. You made a mistake.</i>

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,234
But we all do foolish things.

131
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,066
<i>It wasn't foolish.</i>
<i>I'd do it again in a minute.</i>

132
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,573
You can't mean that.

133
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:26,405
Father, you sit around
with your butt in the mud for weeks...

134
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,970
watching snipers pick off your buddies
one by one.

135
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:33,074
They sneak up at night in canvas shoes,
so you can't hear them.

136
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,018
<i>One night, I was in a foxhole</i>
<i>with four other guys.</i>

137
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:39,022
I snuck out to go to the latrine,
and when I got back...

138
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,024
all four of them were dead.

139
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,461
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

140
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,966
Danny, I'm sure
it's rough out there.

141
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:52,811
L-I imagine
it's very difficult, but...

142
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:55,640
<i>You imagine? Father,</i>
<i>haven't you ever been up there?</i>

143
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,183
- No.
- Not even once?

144
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,651
You've never been up there?
Not even for a little while?

145
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:07,354
Well... I've wanted to go...

146
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,691
but... I'm not allowed.

147
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:15,290
[Sighs] Boy, if Boom Boom
could see us now.

148
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,358
He'd wonder
where he went wrong.

149
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:21,964
Well, let's not talk about Boom Boom.
Let's talk about you.

150
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,569
Tell me about it.
I know it's rough.

151
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:29,375
Father, with all due respect,
we don't have anything to talk about.

152
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,110
Let's face it. You have no idea
what it's like up there.

153
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:38,351
Whoops! Missed again.

154
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,414
I have the same trouble
myself, sir.

155
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,722
Well, at least my cheeks
won't be bloodshot.

156
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:46,025
If these drops of yours work,
I'll get you a field promotion.

157
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:49,498
Sir, I know we've talked
about this before...

158
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:53,334
but I want you to understand
how useless I feel here.

159
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,568
Why, the men don't need
my words of comfort...

160
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,109
when they're safe
and being taken care of.

161
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:03,113
They need comfort up there, where
they're wet and cold and facing bullets.

162
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,240
Father, you've got
the toughest job in camp...

163
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:08,946
and there's not much glory in it
like there is for the surgeons
and the nurses.

164
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,454
But you're the one
who really holds things together.

165
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,457
You should be proud.

166
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,119
Colonel, I had
a seminary teacher...

167
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,560
who was a chaplain
in World War II.

168
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,622
- Father Marty Gallagher.
- Boom Boom Gallagher?

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,863
- Oh, why, you knew him?
- <i>No.</i>

170
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:28,064
Heard about him.
He was famous for the poker games...

171
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,267
he used to organize whenever
the German artillery took a break.

172
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,571
Colonel, Boom Boom
used to excite us with his stories...

173
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:37,206
about being right up front with
the men, and that's where I wanna be.

174
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:41,446
Father, this is a different war.
Line officers don't want
chaplains up at the front.

175
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,785
It's just another unarmed man
they have to be responsible for.

176
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,552
Whoops!
Got the ear that time.

177
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:51,255
Yeah, right. We don't have any choppers,
and you don't have any ambulances.

178
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,095
Now if we could just run out
of wounded soldiers, we wouldn't
have to be in business at all.

179
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:01,835
All right. Look, I'll send a litter jeep
right up there, okay?

180
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:03,898
All right. Yeah, okay.

181
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,605
- [Sighs] Radar.
- Yeah.

182
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,375
They got a guy up at the aid station
who needs surgery.

183
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:12,643
Do you think you and Igor
could grab a jeep and go get him?

184
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,049
Go up to the aid station
where all the shooting is?

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,315
- A man's life depends on it.
- Well, I know.

186
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,358
But I got all this work here.
Colonel Potter expects me to...

187
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,792
- Okay. I'll do it.
- Okay. Thanks. I gotta go back to O.R.

188
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,229
[Sighs] Hey, how's the dog doing...
Corporal Cupcake?

189
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,497
Oh, he's gonna be fine. He's got
a pleasant little snarl on his face.

190
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,800
You don't belong up there.

191
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,966
You belong right here.
We need you.

192
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:42,503
Sir? Oh, pardon me.

193
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,515
- Uh, what is it, Radar?
- Uh, sir...

194
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,608
there's someone badly wounded
up at the aid station.

195
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,676
Your permission for Igor and me
to go get him?

196
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:51,620
All right, Radar, go ahead.
But be careful.

197
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,786
- Yes, sir. Sorry I interrupted
your service, Father.
- <i>[Mulcahy] Hmm?</i>

198
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,820
You're doing a fine job,
but try to understand.
You're a chaplain, not a soldier.

199
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,733
Well, I think I'm a soldier too, sir.
I certainly look like one.

200
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:07,636
I once saw a picture
of Calvin Coolidge in a war bonnet...

201
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:09,640
but that didn't
make him an Indian.

202
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,074
- Sorry, Father.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:15,010
[B.J.]
Father.

204
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,014
Father Mulcahy,
is anything wrong?

205
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,341
You have a very determined
look on your face.

206
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:23,285
Do I? Well,
I don't mean to.

207
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,347
- Is there something I can do for you?
- No. No.

208
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,984
I guess I'll have
to do for myself. Thank you.

209
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,028
Sure.

210
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,431
Come on, Igor.
We gotta get rolling.

211
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:39,495
Igor, you stay here.
I'll go with Radar.

212
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:42,631
Uh, Father, you gotta get permission.
I only got orders for Igor and me.

213
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:46,700
I'll be responsible, Radar. There's
a wounded man, and he needs a priest.

214
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:50,214
- Here. Take my helmet.
- Father, you're gonna get
both of us in trouble.

215
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:53,114
- Radar, you play poker, right?
- Not now, Father.

216
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:56,779
No, no, no, no. A very wise priest
once said...

217
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:01,417
"No matter how well you bluff,
eventually you have to
put your cards on the table."

218
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:03,461
- I can't argue with that...
- [Engine Starts]

219
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,962
'Cause I don't know
what you're talking about.

220
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,830
- Okay, take it away.
- <i>[Explosions In Distance]</i>

221
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,907
Easy now.
That's good. Okay.

222
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,342
- Yeah, just sign here.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:23,404
You guys are lifesavers. I don't know
how long he'd last without surgery.

224
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:25,608
That's a bad chest wound.

225
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,049
No use, Padre.
Every once in a while...

226
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,247
the Chinese let us know
that they invented gunpowder.

227
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,517
How in heaven's name
do you ever get used to it?

228
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:36,321
You get used to
never getting used to it.

229
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,363
I wish he were conscious.
I'd like to offer some comfort.

230
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:42,525
Being unconscious is as comfortable
as you can get up here, Padre.

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,864
Do you ever get
any wounded dogs up here?

232
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:47,200
Nah. They're too smart
to get wounded.

233
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:49,706
They just point out where the Chinese
are, and they step aside.

234
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:52,368
- They're kinda like generals.
- Radar, we'd better get underway.

235
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:54,912
- This man needs attention.
- Right.

236
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,913
- Well, wait a minute.
- What?

237
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:00,917
We had a goat up here once though.
Very serious shrapnel wounds.

238
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,919
Oh, wow. What'd you do?

239
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,547
We ate 'im.

240
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,558
[Engine Starts]

241
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,338
- How's he doing, Father?
- He seems okay.

242
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:32,645
Radar, I want to thank you
for bringing me along on this.
I really needed the experience.

243
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:35,948
That's okay, Father. Sometimes it's
more important to be nice to people...

244
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,784
than to worry
about the rules, you know.

245
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,088
Geez, I remember once in school,
we were having this test, you know...

246
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,094
and there was this boy,
Leonard Gerst.

247
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,790
- He wanted to, you know, copy off of me.
- Ah.

248
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,766
And I knew his mother would beat him up,
uh, if he flunked the test...

249
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,894
- so I let him copy.
- That was a very nice thing
to do, Radar.

250
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:56,304
- Also, he gave me three dollars.
- [Laughs]

251
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:04,109
I'll have a cafe espresso. And for
my friend here, a cappuccino deluxe.

252
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,116
- Help yourself.
- Ah.

253
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:10,746
We also have a special today on roast
crown of lamb with cranberry stuffing...

254
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:14,280
served with a side order
of fresh poached salmon and dill sauce.

255
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,293
No, thanks.
I had that for breakfast.

256
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,454
This is terrible,
even by my standards.

257
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,988
And this from a man who drinks lime
Kool-Aid with strips of bologna in it.

258
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,831
Klinger, have you seen
Father Mulcahy?

259
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,896
No, sir, I haven't seen him all day.
But if it's a spiritual problem...

260
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,964
give me a minute,
and I'll come back as a nun.

261
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,533
Careful, Klinger. Dressing as a nun
can be habit-forming.

262
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:37,704
It isn't a spiritual problem.
It's physical...

263
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,716
- a hole in a foot.
- Spare me.

264
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:42,014
Some guys shoot themselves in the foot
to get sent back home.

265
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:45,283
Not me. I'd ruin a perfectly
good pair of nylons.

266
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:48,689
Say, Pierce...
Butt out.

267
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,024
I checked on that
Fitzsimons kid...

268
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,563
and he couldn't have played football
for Fordham... he's only 18.

269
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:56,259
He entered when he was 16, Frank.
Got lucky.

270
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:00,168
- He went there on a bingo scholarship.
- Oh, those Catholics.

271
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,638
- How's Corporal Cupcake?
- <i>[Frank] Who?</i>

272
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,868
The pooch.
Woof! Woof!

273
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:07,070
Oh, him.
Resting comfortably.

274
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:09,079
He'll be back on his paws
in no time.

275
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,172
What a humiliating experience.

276
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,945
No surgeon with an ounce of self-respect
would operate on a dog.

277
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,384
Frank, some vets earn
more money than doctors.

278
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,614
- Oh?
- Sure.

279
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,623
Better get his address.

280
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:22,592
- Put him on my Christmas card list.
- Couldn't hurt.

281
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:32,271
Oh! You know, you really
don't get used to it.

282
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,668
- <i>Radar! Radar, pull over!</i>
- <i>Huh?</i>

283
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,766
Stop the jeep. He's choking. There's
something wrong! Oh, God, pull over!

284
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,107
I am.
Wait a minute!

285
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,984
- What's the matter?
- Help me.

286
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,986
- Help me to clear his throat.
- Ooh!

287
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:52,319
- [Soldier Gasping]
- It isn't working.

288
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,155
Well, maybe there's something
stuck down there, Father.

He's not breathing at all!

Get one of the doctors.

293
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,570
Right.

294
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,905
Hi. This is the litter jeep,
MASH 407...

295
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:14,377
Litter jeep calling MASH 4077!
Come in! Come in, anybody!

296
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:17,540
I'm not just anybody, but I'll talk.
What is it, Radar?

297
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:21,382
Uh, Klinger, it's Radar.
Listen, we're in trouble here.
Get me a doctor, real quick.

298
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:24,650
Gotcha! Captain Pierce, Hunnicutt,
Colonel Potter, an emergency!

299
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:27,487
- What?
- The radio, sir. It's Radar.

300
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,119
- Put it on the speaker.
- What's the problem, Radar?

301
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:33,858
The guy we're bringing back
can't breathe. Father Mulcahy
says his tongue is swollen up.

302
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,232
- What's Mulcahy doing there?
- This is Father Mulcahy.

303
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,136
I know I'm not supposed to be here,
but we've got a man in bad trouble.

304

- He needs help!
- Father, where's the man wounded?

305
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:45,307
Well, in the chest, Hawkeye,
but I don't think that's the trouble.

306
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:47,675
His tongue is swollen,
and he can't breathe.

307
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:50,738
- Is he getting any air at all?
- No, sir. Not much.

308
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,148
- Hardly any at all.
- Tracheotomy.

- Right.
- Father, Radar, listen carefully.

You only have
a couple of minutes.

311
00:17:57,323 --> 00:18:00,486
One of you is gonna have to cut a small
hole in the man's throat to let air in.

312
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,926
- You mean, cut like a doctor?
- We'll give you
step-by-step instructions.

You do it.

314

- Hawkeye, do you think we can?
- If you don't, the man's dead!

All right, Father,
here we go.

317
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,098
First you need something
to cut with... a sharp knife.

318
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,201
- Sharp knife.
- You have a first-aid kit.

319
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,678
See if there's anything
sharp in there you can use.

320
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,912
- [Soldier Groaning]
- Uh, let's see.

321
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:31,855
Geez, there's nothing in here
but these funny little scissors
they gave us in kindergarten.

322
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,858
Why can't they keep
these things complete?

323
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:37,657
- Don't you have anything else?
- I've got my Tom Mix pocketknife.

324
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,925
- Tom Mix pocketknife.
- Your what?

325
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,628
<i>Tom Mix</i> was an old radio show.
It's very sharp.

326
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:47,331
Okay, fine. That's fine. Look. You need
a small tube. When you make the hole...

327
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,239
you're gonna put the tube in,
and the man will breathe through that.

328
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,472
- A tube?
- Part of a syringe will do
if there's one in the kit.

329
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,412
You could use the top of a fountain pen.
Just snip off one end.

330
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:00,282
- Is a pencil okay?
- No, it has to be
something hollow. Think!

331
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,378
- Wait! Wait! My bottle of eyedrops.
- Eyedrops!

332
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,446
The dropper is plastic.
I'll just pull the cap off.

333
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,458
[Hawkeye] Okay, that's kinda small,
but that'll do.

Iook for a notch
at the base of his throat.

340
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,007
It's right where the chest starts.
Right in the middle.

341

- Oh, boy!
- I got it!

342
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:35,417
Good. Now take the knife
and make an incision...

343
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,888
a vertical incision through the skin
about two inches long.

344
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,982
There's gonna be a little blood,
but that's okay.

now open that skin with your fingers...

349
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,536

of little horizontal rings of tissue.

- He got it.

351

Okay, now this is it, Father.

352
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:08,177
That tissue is fibrous.
It's not going to be easy to cut.

353
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:10,312
Make an incision between
the rings of tissue...

354
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,516
and then stick the tube
in the hole you made.

355
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:15,185

through that tube. Now work fast!
