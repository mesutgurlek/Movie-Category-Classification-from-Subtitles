1
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,755
(Distant gunshot)

2
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,960
(Explosion)

3
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,377
(Speaks Turkish)

4
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,343
(Yells indistinctly)

5
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,259
ALL: Allahu Ekber!

6
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,752
Allahu Ekber!

7
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,001
ALL: Allahu Ekber!

8
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,086
(Barks command)

9
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,755
(Man screams)

10
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,794
(Issues command)

11
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,710
(All cheer)

12
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,757
I think we're close, mate.

13
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,843
I think we're very close.

14
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,505
(Horse whinnies)

15
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,505
(Grunts)

16
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,086
(Laughs)

17
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,548
(Laughs)

18
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,136
(Dog barks)

19
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,797
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,253
Told you there was
water there, didn't I?

21
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,503
Told you. (Laughs)

22
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,676
(Dog barks)

23
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,006
Lizzie?

24
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,798
Everything alright?

25
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,544
(Forced laugh)
Arthur's worn through

26
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,089
the toe of his boot again.

27
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,676
What does he do?

28
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,839
(Laughs)

29
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,339
The boys are all in bed.

30
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,836
They're waiting for you
to read to them.

31
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,881
- I'm bone-tired, Lizzie.
- Oh, come on.

32
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,753
You know this is their
favourite time of the day.

33
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,761
'Prince Hussain
called to the man

34
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,923
and asked him why the carpet
he wished to sell

35
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,669
was so expensive,

36
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,760
saying, "It must be made
of something

37
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,047
quite extraordinary."

38
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,252
The Merchant replied,

39
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,673
“My Prince,
your amazement will be

40
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,215
all the greater when I tell
you that it is enchanted.

41
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,542
Whoever sits on this carpet,
closes his eyes

42
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,750
and says the magic word
'Tangu'

43
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,674
may be transported through
the air in an instant.

44
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,677
Wherever his heart
desires to be."'

45
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,673
I hit water at 15 feet.

46
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,385
Bit brackish
but good pressure.

47
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,672
With water we'll be able to

48
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,260
put stock
in that valley block.

49
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,048
They didn't even
wipe the mud off it.

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,218
It's been four years, Liz.

51
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,756
You're so clever.

52
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,047
You can find water

53
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,341
but you can't even find
your own children.

54
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,881
Why can't you find them?

55
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,843
(Sobs)

56
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,005
You lost them!

57
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,672
(Soldiers shout)

58
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,301
Come on, Art!

59
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,260
You won't win any medals
up there, mate!

60
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,093
Yeah, it's two hours
back to Rainbow,

61
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,551
we've got to get a wriggle on!

62
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,135
- You got that?
- Yeah.

63
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,093
I reckon I got it by now, Dad.

64
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,630
Arthur...

65
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,550
Look after me brothers and
keep me bloody head down.

66
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,714
I know.

67
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,794
(All cheer)

68
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,506
- Love you, Dad
- See you, Dad!

69
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,252
(Dog barks)

70
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,089
Lizzie?

71
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,089
Lizzie!

72
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,006
(Dog continues barking)

73
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,214
Lizzie?!

74
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,672
Lizzie!

75
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,839
Lizzie!

76
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,046
(Shovel scrapes against dirt)

77
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,800
You understand,
in all conscience,

78
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,545
I could not bury your wife
in consecrated ground

79
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,261
if I thought she had taken
her own life.

80
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,424
Consecrated ground is
his promise to the faithful.

81
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,670
She fell in and drowned,
so your conscience is clear.

82
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,635
Three sons killed.

83
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,048
That was quite an ordeal
for Eliza.

84
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,386
As the book of Job teaches us,

85
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,128
God sets these trials
for a reason.

86
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,094
Many families in the district
have made similar sacrifices

87
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,256
for king and country.

88
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,420
You know, you have a gall
coming in here,

89
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,634
making demands.

90
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,549
You haven't stepped inside
this place for four years,

91
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,591
you haven't been
to confession,

92
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,301
you're all but lost to God.

93
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,714
Yes.

94
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,211
And you and God can feed me
to the pigs for all I care.

95
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,505
But you knew this woman.

96
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,172
She was here every Sunday.

97
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,136
I've dug the grave,
I made the coffin,

98
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,093
all I'm asking you to do
is say some words

99
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,334
and throw some dirt.

100
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,217
That cart of yours...

101
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,758
...would make a useful
benefaction for our community.

102
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,218
An offering to God.

103
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,670
Well, He might <i>as</i> well
take that too.

104
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,214
(Dog barks)

105
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,672
I'll find them, love.

106
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,299
I'll find them and I'll bring
them home to you.

107
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,673
(Shovel scrapes against dirt)

108
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,297
Nearly there.

109
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,214
Thank you.

110
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,923
Not now. Later.
Thank you.

111
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:25,256
Major Hasan Bey to see
Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes

112
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,254
- at the War Graves.
- We know who he is, mate.

113
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,005
Righto.

114
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,465
Four years ago
they'd have given me a VC

115
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,130
for shooting that bastard.

116
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,593
Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes,

117
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,052
may I present Major Hasan Bey.

118
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,510
Major Bey was commander of...

119
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,627
Just Major Hasan.

120
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,627
- Bey just means Mister.
- Yes. Indeed.

121
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,173
Mr. Bey gave you boys hell
at Lonesome Pine, Sir.

122
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,795
We all know who Major Hasan
is, Lieutenant. Thank you.

123
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,881
Merhaba.
Hosh geldieniz.

124
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,378
Hosh Bulduek.
Turkce biliormusunuz?

125
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,547
Ah...

126
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,797
English?

127
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,715
I see you have finally taken
the Peninsula.

128
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,880
Yes.

129
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,176
Lost the battle, won the war.

130
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,339
Well, Sergeant Tucker here

131
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,460
will show you to
your accommodations.

132
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,086
Perhaps once you've refreshed
we could meet in my tent?

133
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,926
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

134
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,424
While I'm here, I thought
I'd make myself useful.

135
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,544
If you have any horses
that need any work,

136
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,919
I might go for a little ride.

137
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,636
Preferably something
with a bit of pep.

138
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,336
Ah, Sergeant Tucker,
acquaint Lieutenant Greeves

139
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,335
with Widowmaker.

140
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,710
She could use a workout.

141
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,959
With pleasure, Sir.

142
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,552
Now, we've already
started work in this area,

143
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,795
in the Nek down to Hill 971.

144
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,170
I assume they briefed
you fully at the war office.

145
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,636
We would appreciate your help
locating our dead.

146
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,343
Your dead?

147
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,426
Lost over 10,000 ANZACS
here on Gallipoli

148
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,544
and still don't know
where half of them are.

149
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,135
Some were buried properly

150
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,469
but a lot of the graves
have been lost, overgrown

151
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,756
or washed away,
or their crosses were pilfered

152
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,627
for firewood
after we evacuated.

153
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,797
Retreated.

154
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,464
You were here?

155
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,130
First Light Horse.

156
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,627
What do you need of me?

157
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,752
Well, the land has changed,

158
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,752
but you know the area
better than anyone.

159
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,172
I was hoping you could help us

160
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,511
locate the companies
we lost track of.

161
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,547
We can start in the morning.

162
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,130
(sighs)

163
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,128
We lost 70,000 men.

164
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,843
Here.

165
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,460
At Çanakkale.

166
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,837
For me, this place
is one big grave.

167
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:43,091
I don't know what you chaps
were belly-aching about.

168
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,302
This is a veritable
Garden of Eden.

169
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,509
If your troops had taken
this hill on the first day,

170
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,218
we would have been finished.

171
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,709
How close did we get?

172
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,422
There.

173
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,209
There you go, Sir.
Your Garden of Eden.

174
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,796
Joshua?
Where are the boys?

175
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:02,545
Ed, Henry, let's go home.

176
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,714
Run!

177
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,797
Come on, Ed!

178
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:26,839
<i>Boys?</i>

179
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,672
Boys?!

180
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,590
Art! Ahhh!

181
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,630
Ed!

182
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,839
Get down!

183
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,880
(All moan)

184
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,048
It's alright, boys.
It's alright.

185
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,962
Good on you, Art, for not
leaving your brothers behind.

186
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,551
Hey, Ed, what's
the magic word?

187
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,214
The one that
makes the carpet fly?

188
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,880
- Tonga?
- Tangu, you wombat.

189
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,047
That's it - Tangu.

190
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,966
Come on, cuddle up.
Get tight, close your eyes.

191
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,175
Ed's peeping, Dad.

192
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,464
Ed, close your eyes.

193
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,677
It only works
if your eyes are closed.

194
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,136
Alright, boys, let's get
out of here. All together.

195
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,127
ALL: Tangu!

196
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,760
(indistinct shouting)

197
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,377
Bugger off, the pair of you.

198
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,968
Go away. No.

199
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,801
- No?
- No.

200
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,840
Anything you want
my mama can make.

201
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,255
Hot water, no Germans.

202
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,501
No. Clear off.

203
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,922
Beautiful hotel.

204
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,339
Best room.

205
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,835
I'm going to Gallipoli.

206
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,835
- How do I get to Gallipoli?
- Huh?

207
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,255
I want to go to Gallipoli.

208
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,797
(Speaks Turkish)

209
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,385
- Mister? Mister?
- Gallipoli.

210
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,719
(Speaks Turkish)

211
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,585
Come to our hotel.

212
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,836
Beautiful hotel.
Beautiful view.

213
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,302
Anything you want,
my anne can make.

214
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,966
Maybe you can help me.
I'm going to Gallipoli.

215
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,130
No, you're not.

216
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,923
No-one goes there
without a permit.

217
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,044
You'll have to go to
the British War Office

218
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,419
- in Sultanahmet.
- Where?

219
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,340
- Sultanahmet. We go!
- Old city.

220
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:01,338
And... I'd keep an eye
on your bag if I were you.

221
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,801
Crafty little buggers.

Hello.

233
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,044
I, uh... I need a room.

234
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,840
You're from England?

235

No.

00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,468
No, I'm from Australia.

237
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,091
Um, I'm sorry,
Orhan has made a mistake.

238
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,801
We have no rooms.

239
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,171
Your son dragged me halfway
across this wretched city.

240
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,340
Ah, no, no, no, no.
The boy was right.

241
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,086
Our best room is now vacant,
Mister...?

242
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,334
Connor.
Joshua Connor.

243
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,798
You are most welcome,
Mr. Connor.

244
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,960
The room is up the stairs.

245
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,381
Breakfast is at eight.

246
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,298
Would you like for her
to bring the tea?

247
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,509
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

248
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,128
But your son did mention
there might be some hot water.

249
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,718
Ah, it is shameful to lie.

250
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,551
You are a spoilt mother's boy.

251
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,170
Oh, no, it's alright. I must
have just misunderstood.

252
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,506
Please, please.
It is his duty.

253
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,756
Thank you very much.

254
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,297
This your room.

255
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,545
You seem to know
where everything is.

256
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,136
How about tomorrow you take me
to the War Office?

257
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,252
- I'll pay you.
- Yes, you will.

258
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,214
(Knock on door)

259
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,211
Towels for you, Mr. Connor.

260
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,677
I am preparing you a hot bath
down the hall.

261
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,044
It will take some time.

262
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,464
My son is no liar.

263
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,631
He seems
a very resourceful boy.

264
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,503
He is.
Very resourceful.

265
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,877
You have children?

266
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,926
Yes.

267
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,589
Three sons.

268
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,961
(Prayers chanted in distance)

269
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,090
What are they selling?

270
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,712
They're not selling anything,
Mr. Connor.

271
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,959
It's a call to prayer.

272
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,511
Your guide book
is out of date.

273
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,172
I didn't come here
to sightsee.

274
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,169
You should see the
Blue Mosque, at least.

275
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,464
Even in my 'wretched city'

276
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,881
it is a beautiful place
to find God.

277
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,594
I didn't come here
for him either.

278
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,925
I'm on my way to Gallipoli.

279
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,464
You mean Çanakkale.

280
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,003
There is nothing there
but ghosts.

281
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,011
My son, he cannot help you
tomorrow.

282
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,172
He is needed here.

283
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,420
Have your bath and come back.

284
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,467
I regret to inform you

285
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,587
we do not issue civilians
travel permits to Dardanelles.

286
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,881
It remains a very sensitive
military zone.

287
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,674
In fact, our friends the
Greeks have made things

288
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:26,839
even more complicated

289
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,131
by invading
Turkey's western coast.

290
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,220
It'll be some time before
we bring order to this chaos.

291
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,710
Arthur, Henry and Edward
Connor.

292
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,006
All served
in the 7th AIF Battalion.

293
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,547
They all enlisted together.

294
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,005
And they died together.
All killed in the one day.

295
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:54,507
August 7th... 1915,
at Lone Pine.

296
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,967
Yes. We do have
the Imperial Graves Unit

297
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,801
on the Peninsula as we speak.

298
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,215
They have a formidable task
ahead of them.

299
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,380
You must understand,

300
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,468
these men on Gallipoli,
they are experts.

301
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,587
All I need from you is a
piece of paper and a stamp

302
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,756
saying that I can go there.

303
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,627
I simply couldn't, Mr. Connor,

304
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,423
even if that
were my inclination.

305
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,010
I can find them.

306
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,878
How could you possibly hope
to do that?

307
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,510
Do you know what the army
used to do

308
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,218
with the rank and file dead

309
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,677
after Waterloo, Crimea,
Khartoum?

310
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:33,420
They would dig
an enormous bloody pit

311
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:36,876
and rake the whole lot in
with a few handfuls of lime.

312
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,836
No names.
Horse, mules and the men.

313
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,585
All turned into fertilizer.

314
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,757
This is the first war
anyone has given a damn.

315
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:53,043
My boys should be buried
at home,

316
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,965
beside their mother.

317
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,506
Go home, Mr. Connor.

318
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,461
(Shouting and chanting)

319
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:53,714
Come.

320
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,917
You have buildings like this
where you come from?

321
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,301
...but he didn't give up.

322
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,045
He kept on fighting
for three days.

323
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,927
I told you my son had work
to do here, Mr. Connor.

324
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:52,919
- Oh, I...
- He's ten!

325
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,794
What would you expect him
to say?

326
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,545
Keep it.
It's our secret.

327
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,837
(Laughter, piano plays)

328
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,552
(Hens cluck)

329
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,548
(Speaks Turkish)

330
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,631
- Good morning.
- Mr. Connor.

331
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,297
Would you like some breakfast?

332
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,464
Please.

333
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,926
I-I'm sorry, I don't
understand.

334
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,380
What's he saying?

335
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,131
Uh... my father hopes
you enjoy your breakfast.

336
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,667
Would you happen to have a...
a boiled egg?

337
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,171
(Omer speaks Turkish chant)

338
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,302
(Orhan repeats Turkish chant)

339
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,252
(Hens cluck)

340
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,135
Thank you.

341
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,590
English?

342
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,551
Ah.

343
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,335
Um... your wife,
he's asking where she is.

344
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,551
She's dead.

345
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,297
And your sons?

346
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,382
AYSHE: Without papers,
you cannot go to Gallipoli.

347
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,173
Take the ferry
to the town of Chanak,

348
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,464
then find a fisherman.

349
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,666
If you pay him enough, he'll
sail you across the straits.

350
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,886
He'll have no need
for British permits.

351
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,219
Thank you.

352
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,048
(Speaks Turkish)

353
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,585
Mr. Joshua!

354
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,837
Please, you find my Baba
in Çanakkale.

355
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,007
Tell him he must come home.
Anne needs him.

356
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,256
- This is your father?
- Mm-hm.

357
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,800
- Who's the man in the hotel?
- My uncle.

358
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,755
I'll have a look.

359
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,964
You bring him home!

360
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,503
(Soft clattering)

361
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,966
HUGHES: So, what were you
doing before the war?

362
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,381
HASAN: This is
the Ottoman Empire.

363
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,673
There was no 'before the war'.

364
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,626
In another life,
I was an architect.

365
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,003
I was a civil engineer.

366
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,834
Sir?
Are we expecting company?

367
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,585
Whoever they are,
bring them to my tent.

368
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:48,212
Sergeant, grab a couple of
blokes and go with Lt Greeves.

369
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,427
Sir.

370
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,048
(Echoing screams)

371
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,590
(Gunshot, screaming)

372
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,961
(Hooves thud, horses neigh)

373
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,381
Mr. Connor, I'm at a loss.

374
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,717
You walk off your farm,

375
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,959
you turn up unannounced

376
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,006
in this place of horrors...
and for what?

377
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,799
Gallipoli is eight square
miles of collapsed trenches,

378
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,419
bomb craters, barbed wire,

379
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,419
and more unexploded
grenades and shells

380
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,260
than there are pebbles
on that beach.

381
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,718
It is not safe.

382
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,882
I know what date
my sons were killed.

383
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,092
At Lone Pine.

384
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,136
There's a map,
and the last entry

385
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,048
in his diary is August 7th.

386
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,636
Rest assured,
I aim to put a name

387
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,252
next to every man out there,

388
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,877
including your sons.

389
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,798
I'm sorry, but you can't stay.

390
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:49,252
Tucker, escort Mr. Connor
back to his boat.

391
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,585
Your sons.

392
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:10,258
DAWSON: Sir, dinner.
- Come in, Dawson.

393
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,878
Wrap your laughin' gear
around that, sir.

394
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,549
Yum-yum, pig's bum, eh?

395
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,170
DAWSON: Sir.
- Hm.

396
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,340
Something you might want
to see.

397
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,880
Damn.

398
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,085
Want me to arrest him, sir?

399
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,676
And then what?

400
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,008
Take some food down to him.
And a blanket.

401
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:59,217
(Distant conversations)

402
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,834
- Not swimming?
- No.

403
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,256
What are you doing
with your farmer?

404
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,094
There's a supply ship back
to Constantinople in two days.

405
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,132
Maybe we could help him
until then.

406
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,003
You know what the chances
of finding his boys are.

407
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,253
We have the day
they were killed.

408
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,547
I know the area.

409
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,136
Yeah, we both know it,
but why change everything

410
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,298
for one father
who can't say put?

411
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:48,217
Because he's the only father
who came looking.

412
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,260
Sergeant!

413
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,009
Change of plan.

414
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,460
CONNOR: Who's the Turk?

415
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,506
<i>Hasan the assassin.</i>

416
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,627
Saw us land, saw us off.

417
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,798
That dog wiped out
half my battalion.

418
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,876
He would've killed your boys.
We're all best friends now.

419
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,128
I get to serve him breakfast
every morning.

420
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,052
Don't worry, Mr. Connor.
Abdul's, not ours.

421
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,004
This was our front line here.

422
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:42,086
You were there. Machine gun
here, machine gun here.

423
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,300
And one more there.

424
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:49,634
We could see you.
So many blue eyes.

425
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,844
Mashallah.

426
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,928
HASAN: It is very lucky
in Turkey to have blue eyes.

427
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,511
Everywhere, except here.

428
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,629
(Grunting, explosions)

429
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,131
(Gunshots)

430
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,381
(Distant shouts)

431
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,470
OFFICER: Listen up, boys!
Listen up!

432
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,756
We got to move up
that left flank!

433
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:19,300
Keep your heads low,
push forward! Now!

434
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,920
Stick up the nose
of these jokers!

435
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,761
We're gonna take
the trench tonight!

436
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:27,003
(Whistle blows, men shout)

437
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:31,084
(Explosions, men scream)

438
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,836
(Gunshots)

439
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,961
(Projectile whooshes)

440
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,544
(Explosions and gunfire)

441
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,511
(Men scream, grenade blasts)

442
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,843
TUCKER:
They're throwing rocks, boys!

443
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,426
They're out of ammo!

444
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:01,091
Let's get into the bastards!

445
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,551
SOLDIER: All as one!

446
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,341
Let's do it.
Let's do it, come on!

447
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:09,088
(Men scream)

448
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,926
(Explosions)

449
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:15,468
You came in from two sides -
here and here.

450
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,256
(Men scream)

451
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,549
HASAN: We built a roof
to protect us from shell fire.

452
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:25,591
Instead we made a trap
for ourselves.

453
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:29,087
(Shouting and grunting)

454
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:35,750
Inside it was bayonets,
knives, hands, teeth.

455
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,674
It was so dark and close,

456
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,045
we did not see
who it was we struck.

457
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,886
(Grunting and snarling)

458
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,048
(Distant shouting)

459
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,760
(Screaming)

460
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,594
(Grunting)

461
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,917
(Men shout)

462
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:08,669
HASAN: Three days.

463
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,044
We only stopped

464
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,966
because we could not climb
over the bodies.

465
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,302
(Grunting)

466
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,715
(Screams)

467
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,547
(Gunshot)

468
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,343
(Rifle cocks)

469
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,086
(Gunshots)

470
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:40,421
(Distant screaming and
shouting)

471
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,048
As long as Allah
make me breathe,

472
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,465
let me see nothing
like these days again.

473
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,630
(Boom!)

474
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,669
(Boom!)

475
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,840
(Explosions continue)

476
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:11,136
(Gunfire)

477
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,795
(Gunfire)

478
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,548
(Boom!)

479
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,465
(Grunts)

480
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,209
HENRY: Are you alright, Artie?
ARTHUR: Bugger off, you two!

481
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,585
Leave me!

482
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:38,713
HENRY: Yeah, righto, mate!
Whatever you reckon!

483
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,177
(Arthur screams)

484
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:47,512
ARTHUR: Leave me!

485
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,797
(Arthur pants)

486
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:51,887
(Gunshots)
- No!

487
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,378
No!

488
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,923
(Rapid gunfire)
- (Arthur screams)

489
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:03,545
(Screaming)

490
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:06,546
(Arthur pants)
(Edward screams)

491
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,170
(Sobbing, screaming)

492
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,920
(Men groan and wail)

493
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,504
(Throaty wail)

494
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,544
(Sobs softly)

495
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,594

They're right here.

(Scraping and digging)

503
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,797
Sir.

504
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:43,215
It's your son. Edward.

505
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,844
No, I wouldn't.

506
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:13,544
The bastards executed him.

507
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:17,467
He gave the order
not to take prisoners.

508
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,757
He killed the sick,
he shot the wounded.

509
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,219
One shot through the head,
that's how they did it.

510
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,212
Especially him.
He killed your son.

511
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,301
He gave them no chance,
that's what he did.

512
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:30,135
HUGHES: Stop him!

513
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,048

(Shouts angrily)

515
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,130
- Steady on, Sergeant.
- You killed my sons!

516
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,959
You sent them, Mr. Connor.
You invaded us.

517
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:45,053
Take him away.
Put him under guard.

518
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,093
I'm most terribly sorry.

519
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:57,135
He has two more sons.
We should keep looking.

520
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,052
War's over, Sergeant.

521
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:18,297
HUGHES: We found Henry.
- Lying beside him.

522
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,719
How on God's earth
did you know they'd be there?

523
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,881
But you haven't
found Arthur yet.

524
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,002
HUGHES: No, we combed
the area thoroughly.

525
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,174
Well, he wouldn't leave his
brothers, so he must be there.

526
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,421
We'll give Henry and Edward
a proper burial tomorrow.

527
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,920
I promised their mother
I would... find them and...

528
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,922
...and bring them home.

529
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,626
This is their home now.
It's not enemy ground anymore.

530
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,876
They're among friends,

531
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,752
probably the closest
they ever had.

532
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,798
Leave 'em,
they always will be.

533
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:54,964
Take 'em back,

534
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:57,632
they're just a couple of
dead blokes in the cemetery.

535
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,219
She wanted them buried
in consecrated ground.

536
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,052
How much blood do you need
for it to be holy?

537
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,590
You know we lost
over 2,000 men

538
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,301
in those four days
at Lone Pine?

539
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,843
The Turks lost 7,000.

540
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,302
We didn't take
too many prisoners either.

541
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,045
I don't know
if I forgive any of us.

salted tears
streaked his cheeks.

he cried, "My son.

Major Hasan, I wanted
to apologise to you

557
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,672
for my outburst.

558
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:40,297
There is a Persian saying -
may you outlive your children.

559
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:41,919
It sounds like a blessing,

560
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,385
but it is the worst curse

one can place
on the head of a man.

562
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:50,094
I had this list
sent from Istanbul.

563
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,801
This is your family name.

564

What is this list?

565
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:58,668
If this is your son,
he was taken prisoner.

566
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:04,344
He did not die here.
He left Çanakkale. Alive.

No. I have finished helping.

Mr. Connor,
do you have your passport?

You were specifically ordered
not to go to Gallipoli.

I'm not in your army.

All I need to know is the name
of the prison camp

they sent my son to.

600

If your son did not return
home,

the sad reality is,
he's deceased.

This was the Ottoman Empire,

one of the largest empires
the world has ever known,

604

it's being carved up.

The Bolshies,
they want the Black Sea.

The French and Italians,
they want the Aegean.

incidentally,

609
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,802
the Turks and the Greeks
are turning the place

into a complete
and utter blood bath.

So where, pray,
in all this madness

612
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,211
would you like us to start
looking for your son?

613
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,335
You said the prison camps
were in Anatolia?

614
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,881
Who would have those records?
The Turk army?

615

they sent my son Arthur to.

Please, I'm at a dead end.

01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,794
Next time.

657
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,377
Oh! Mr. Connor...

658
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:22,802
Perhaps if you were to follow
20 paces behind,

659
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,294
then there would be no shame.

660
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:29,422
(Chuckles) I will get my hat
and my coat.

661
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,631
(Conversational hum)

662
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,548
CONNOR: You know where I live,
my home?

663
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:03,876
Sometimes it doesn't rain for
three or four years at a time.

664
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,047
We have to find water

665
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,169
That's fallen through cracks
in the earth.

666
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:09,260
How do you find it
underground?

667
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,219
Well, there's the trick.
You have to feel it.

668
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,086
And you feel it every time?

669
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,711
No.
I have dug a lot of wells

670
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,756
that just turned out
to be holes.

671
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,252
CONNOR: I'll show you.

672
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,628
I have something of yours.

673
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,129
Orhan asked me
to find your husband.

674
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,344
I hate this photograph.

675
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,382
Turgut is a musician,
never a soldier.

676
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,594
How long were you married?

677
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,672
I am married.

678
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,794
12 years.

679
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,295
My mother had arranged for me
to marry someone else.

680
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:06,715
But my father fought her.

681
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,799
He told her, 'Why would we
want our daughter

682
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:12,510
to be as miserable as us?'

683
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:18,966
It is not easy
to marry for love here.

684
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,256
Maybe my mother was right.

685
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,547
Turgut was mad.

686
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:25,170
Bills to the roof not paid,
music all hours,

687
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:27,670
parties, lazy friends.

688
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,635
I miss the chaos.

689
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,923
I wish my mother
had arranged my marriage.

690
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,589
You did not love your wife?

691
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,292
Oh, I adored her.

692
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,215
I was just so bad at courting,

693
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,212
I think she only married me
out of impatience.

694
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,677
(Chuckles) But it was happy.

695
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:54,422
Very. Until the boys were
lost.

696
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,339
It's good to know
where they are.

697
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,301
Not lost or nameless anymore.

698
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,712
I was told my oldest son
was taken prisoner.

699
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,756
So he's alive?

700
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,343
I don't know.

701
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,880
But you have hope.

702
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,630
Hope's a necessity
where I come from.

703
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,718
AYSHE: Goodnight, Mr. Connor.

704
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,718
Goodnight.

705
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:52,670
(Sobs softly)

706
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,378
(Knocking)

707
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:47,134
(Fire crackles,
paper flutters)

708
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:57,467
Take care,
your fate is in there.

709
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,425
It is a silly peasant game.
You have to drink it first.

710
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,219
Now we wait.

711
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:30,629
We decide everything here
by coffee. Business, holidays.

712
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,755
- Even our husbands.
- And that works?

713
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,845
When two families
come together

714
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,130
to arrange a marriage,

715
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,877
the young girl
serves them coffee.

716
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,594
If it is sweet,
she approves of the match.

717
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,676
If it is bitter, go away.

718
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,882
The more sugar,
the deeper the love.

719
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:08,922
(Scoffs)
It is all peasant nonsense.

720
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,377
(Hens cluck)

721
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,593
- (Grunts)
- (Shouts)

722
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,176
(Cries)

723
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,339
Stay here.

724
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,005
(Cries)

725
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:01,884
Stop! Stop, you fool!
This is not your business!

726
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,881
This is what you want?
The enemy?

727
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,219
It has nothing to do with him!

728
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,667
My brother was a fool!
You disgrace our family!

729
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,299
Go! Go, you have to leave now!

730
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:23,840
You've offended his honour,
he'll not forgive this!

731
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,256
- He hit you!
- I hit him!

732
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,922
You see,
you understand nothing.

733
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:29,339
You will never understand!

734
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,381
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

735
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,128
Yes. Yes, you and your sons
and your armies,

736
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,627
all doing the right thing!

737
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,548
All you did was rob Orhan
of a father

738
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,419
and left me with choices
like this!

739
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,510
Then, please, let me help.

740
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,719
Ha, so now you will rescue us.

741
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,006
I didn't mean it like that,
I raised three boys.

742
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,217
And where are they now?!

743
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:52,967
This is not your world.
Go home, Mr. Connor!

744
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:17,631
You don't need to go. She gets
angry with me all the time.

745
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:52,087
(Grunting)

746
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:04,381
JEMAL: You would make a good
ambassador, Connor Bey.

747
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:10,921
You know him? This man
has dishonoured my family!

748
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:13,670
My orders are to take him
to Major Hasan.

749
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,839
Come here, Connor.

750
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,167
First we will teach him a
lesson about honour.

751
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,760
All four of you?

752
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,630
Come on.

753
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:43,671
JEMAL: I found your son's name
on a list of wounded.

754
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,875
They take him from Çanakkale
to a camp in Afyon.

755
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,503
After Afyon we don't know.
Winters are hard.

756
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,423
What, you mean he died there?

757
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:55,376
(Scoffs) No more records.
We are Ottoman, not German.

758
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,470
Tomorrow you will be on a
boat, back to Australia.

759
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:01,052
Jemal and I will travel east,
to Ankara.

760
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:04,296
Mustafa Kemal is gathering
a Nationalist army there.

761
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,090
We must pass through Afyon.

762
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,132
I will ask if anyone
remembers your son.

763
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,797
Could he still be in Afyon?

764
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:12,794
No.

765
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:16,171
As a soldier, as a father,

766
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:19,296
I tell you,
it is past praying.

767
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,215
ALL: Mustafa Kemal!

768
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,507
- Who's he toasting?
- Turkey's future.

769
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:39,209
(Jemal sings in Turkish)

770
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:59,467
(All join in singing)

771
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,672
HASAN: Look at him.

772
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,716
He is the worst sergeant
in the whole Ottoman Army.

773
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:46,382
Three times I have saved
this man's life.

774
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,969
- Never once in battle.
- (Chuckles)

775
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,585
Look at him, like a peacock

776
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,881
with big moustache
and gold buttons.

777
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,799
'I love my wife,
I love my children,

778
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:58,261
I have a big stick
up my arsehole.'

779
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,377
(Laughs)

780
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,550
Tonight, we kill this man
with lion's milk.

781
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:07,045
JEMAL: Serefe. Forget.
- Serefe.

782
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:09,295
- Serefe.
- (Speaks Turkish)

783
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,419
(Singing continues)

784
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,844
(Cheering)

785
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,960
(Chuckling)

786
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:24,756
First Australian I met-
not to shoot at, to talk to -

787
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,219
Was a thief - at Lone Pine.

788
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:30,007
This man waves a white cloth,

789
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:33,550
calls out and walks straight
across no-man's land.

790
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,135
He is carrying something.

791
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,177
1,000 guns are on him.
2,000 eyes. But he walks.

792
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:46,049
He reaches us and drops one
of our wounded into our hands.

793
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:51,167
We shared a cigarette
and he walked back.

794
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,128
- No-one shot him?
- I should have.

795
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,504
It's only when he got back
I realised

796
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,298
he had stolen my cigarettes.

797
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:01,760
And my lighter.

798
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:05,300
(Both chuckle)

799
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:13,090
AYSHE: Mr. Connor.

800
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,382
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
If I could pick up my bag.

801
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,923
Of course.
Orhan put it in your room.

802
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:25,045
I wish to apologise
for all I said.

803
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:28,296
I was angry.
I meant none of it.

804
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:30,795
I'm the one
who should be apologising.

805
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:33,841
You're right, I did fill their
heads with heroic nonsense.

806
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,710
God and king and country.

807
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:38,712
It was my job to steer my boys
to manhood.

808
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,506
And I failed them.

809
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:44,209
I measure a man by how
much he loves his children,

810
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:46,176
not by what the world
has done to them.

811
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,585
They'll be here for me
in the morning.

812
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,876
Well...

813
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,844
You can't travel
on an empty stomach.

814
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:13,171
♪ SOFT ROMANTIC PIANO

815
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:45,835
ARTHUR (Shouting): No!

816
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,086
(Rapid gunfire)

817
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:39,717
(Call to prayer
from many voices)

818
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:42,586
(Chanting continues)

819
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:52,511
BRINDLEY: Mr. Connor!

820
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:56,255
Mr. Connor! Good morning.
Come down here, please.

821
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,469
We've a very long walk
to the dock.

822
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:02,463
Lieutenant, if you'd be so
kind as to go down to the dock

823
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:07,293
and speak to the captain and
make sure he holds that boat.

824
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,135
Thank you.

825
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:13,175
CONNOR: I saw him, I saw
him clearly. He's not dead.

826
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,841
- You cannot go back.
- No.

827
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,710
(Knocking)
BRINDLEY: Connor!

828
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:20,210
Come on.

829
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,960
Kick that damn door in!

830
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,256
(Man grunts, door crashes)

831
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,627
Connor!

832
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:31,670
Go up over the roof.
You can get to the city wall.

833
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:34,590
(Door crashes)
SOLDIER: Move!

834
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:38,042
(Speaks Russian)

835
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,761
- Where's Joshua Connor?!
- (Speaks Russian)

836
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:41,922
BRINDLEY: Connor?

837
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,252
Upstairs!
Quickly!

838
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:52,211
Be careful of the tiles.

839
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:57,510
SOLDIER: On the roof!

840
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,799
Connor!
Connor!

841
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:16,136
(Shouting in Turkish)

842
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,628
(Grunting)

843
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:25,006
He's alive, I know he is.

844
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,423
Please, take me with you.

845
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,719
(Train rattles)

846
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,469
Ambassador, what part
of the Ottoman Empire

847
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,675
did Australia get?

848
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,715
It wasn't about land for us.

849
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,426
Always it's about land.

850
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:31,672
We don't need any more land.
We fought for a principle.

851
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:34,170
You fight, you die,
you get nothing.

852
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:35,760
JEMAL: Good principle.

853
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,961
- A weapon, yes?
- In the right hands.

854
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:55,257
JEMAL: Yeah?
- It's a game, called cricket.

855
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,753
JEMAL: Cricket?
- Yeah, it's a cricket bat.

856
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,424
- You play?
- Yeah. Well, everybody plays.

857
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,419
Yeah, you need a ball
and that's the bat.

858
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:03,589
Show us.

859
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,760
- You need a lot of space.
- Yeah.

860
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:15,177
CONNOR: So the idea
is you have the ball

861
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:17,010
and you bowl it
with a straight arm

862
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:18,502
and you try and
hit the wicket.

863
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,131
- Straight arm?
- Straight arm.

864
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,672
Ready?

865
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,468
(Laughter)

866
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,802
That's the way.
Straight arm.

867
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:34,716
Englishers, always with rules.

868
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,549
(Cheering and applause)

869
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:42,214
(Conversations in Turkish)

870
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:46,131
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick.

871
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:02,334
The Greeks are deeper inland
than I thought.

872
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:05,052
They terrorise the people
and burn the towns.

873
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:10,094
We used to be one country,
now we are constantly at war.

874
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,669
(Rifles cock)

875
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,595
(Brakes squeal)

876
01:27:09,042 --> 01:27:11,636
(Gunfire, glass shatters,
shouting)

877
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,503
(Screaming)

878
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,548
(Rapid gunfire)

879
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,635
(Screaming)

880
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,173
(Explosion, shouting)

881
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:24,885
(Shouting, screaming)

882
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,798
(Explosion)

883
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:30,342
(Shouting, gunfire)

884
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:46,301
Joshua, pick up a gun!

885
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:49,170
(Shouting, gunshots)

886
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:01,215
(Men scream)

887
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,176
(Rapid gunfire)

888
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,048
(Shouts threateningly)

889
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:30,218
(Shouts)

890
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:47,584
I'm from Australia... yes.

891
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:06,592
(Distant shouting and
screaming)

892
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,049
ANZAC Bey,
don't invade a country

893
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:28,544
if you don't know where it is.

894
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:35,466
(Jemal says prayers)

895
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,752
(Says prayer)

896
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,460
(Grunting)

897
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,927
(Gunshot, screaming)

898
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:53,840
(Bang!)

899
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:06,296
(Distant screaming and
shouting)

900
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,086
(Gunshots)

901
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,878
HASAN: Our horses need rest.

902
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,636
- Raki?
- Ouzo.

903
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,377
Same mother.

904
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,630
To Jemal.

905
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:10,960
It is a miracle Allah
turned a blind eye so long.

906
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,795
I will ride with you
as far as Afyon.

907
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,424
Joshua! Where are you going?
Afyon is this way.

908
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:25,209
He's here.

909
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,334
Arthur!

910
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:39,668
Arthur!

911
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,009
Joshua?
Come.

912
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,543
Arthur?

913
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,626
Art.

914
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,501
Dad.

915
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:29,959
Son.

916
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:40,334
You're here?

917
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,501
Yes.

918
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:46,043
Yes.

919
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,460
Time to come home.

920
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:12,047
I'm not coming back.
None of us are.

921
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,668
They're dead.

922
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,675
I know.

923
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,543
How's Mum?

924
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,377
She's with your brothers.

925
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,551
You told me to take care
of them.

926
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:47,252
You said, 'Look after
your brothers'. I didn't.

927
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,968
Henry had his face shot off.

928
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:56,669
One minute he was there
and then he just... wasn't.

929
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,045
Ed bled out for hours.

930
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:02,171
(Moans)

931
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:10,342
(Moans)

932
01:35:38,042 --> 01:35:40,136
- Artie.
- Hey.

933
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,377
I want Mum.

934
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,459
Hold on.

935
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:54,344
Someone will come for us.

936
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,960
I'm a gut shot rabbit.

937
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:03,134
Artie.

938
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,927
Yes, mate.

939
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:10,426
I can't shoot myself.

940
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,801
They won't let me into heaven.

941
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:18,549
- You can't ask me.
- You have to do it.

942
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:19,668
No.

943
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,547
You're my brother.

944
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:23,385
Climb onto the carpet, mate.

945
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,335
Let's get out of here.

946
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,093
Take me home, Artie.

947
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:39,427
It only works
if you close your eyes.

948
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,172
I love you.

949
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:00,842
Tangu.

950
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:19,879
(Wails)

951
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:25,959
I killed them.

952
01:38:28,042 --> 01:38:29,885
They can't come home.

953
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,172
So...

954
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:35,294
You see?

955
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:40,177
It's alright to leave me here.

956
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,504
I didn't lift a finger
to stop any of you.

957
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:51,507
I killed your brothers
the day I waved you off.

958
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:56,961
Arthur...
your brothers live on in you.

959
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,797
You must go.

960
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,673
It's too dangerous here.

961
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:07,136
He's right, Joshua.
The Greek soldiers are here.

962
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,627
I must leave now.

963
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,752
(Shouting)

964
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,010
(Shouts in Greek)

965
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:28,752
How do I thank you?

966
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:30,252
Teshekullar.

967
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:34,844
Teshekullar, Hasan Bey.

968
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:37,962
(Shouting and gunfire
in the distance)

969
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:48,258
Tell your son
when he's well...

970
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:50,594
Tell him he still owes me
a packet of cigarettes.

971
01:39:52,042 --> 01:39:53,635
And one lighter.

972
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:05,171
(Shouting in Greek)

973
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:06,669
(Screaming and shouting)

974
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,796
- Arthur!
- Dad! This way!

975
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,084
(Shellfire)

976
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,958
(Gunfire)

977
01:40:32,167 --> 01:40:34,135
(Speaks Greek)

978
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,878
(Shouts in Greek)

979
01:41:01,167 --> 01:41:02,510
Give us a hand.

980
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,218
This'll take you
across the valley.

981
01:41:09,333 --> 01:41:10,710
Once you pass the village,

982
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,881
head north towards the coast
and follow it.

983
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:16,044
I'm not leaving without you.

984
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:18,544
(Shell explodes in the
distance)

985
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:22,256
I've buried your mother.
I've buried your brothers.

986
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,878
If you're not coming with me
I have nowhere to go.

987
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:32,802
Either we leave here together
or we'll die here... together.

988
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:36,631
(Shell explodes nearby)

989
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:47,676
Is it cold?

990
01:41:47,792 --> 01:41:49,920
No.
It's freezing.

991
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,673
When we finish here,

992
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:34,545
why don't we see if we can
find some fresh clothes?

993
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:39,713
Righto.
Sounds good.

994
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:46,254
'You want room, clean sheets,
hot water...'

995
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:49,049
No Germans.
'..no Germans.'

996
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:50,168
(Gasps)

997
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:54,800
Joshua Bey!
You came back for me!

998
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:59,086
Welcome back, Mr. Connor.
Is this your son?

999
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:00,209
Arthur.

1000
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:05,167
Orhan... help me show Arthur
our second-best room.

1001
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:15,589
She's outside.

1002
01:43:57,667 --> 01:43:58,668
Mr. Connor.

1003
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:05,002
You speak Turkish
like a villager.

1004
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,627
Am I welcome here?

1005
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,252
All are welcome here.

1006
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,503
You don't seem surprised
that I'm back.

1007
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:16,549
It was in your coffee,
weeks ago before you left.

1008
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,136
I told you.
