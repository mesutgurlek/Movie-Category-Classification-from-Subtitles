How about you and me go up
the Queensland property for a while?

We'll clear out those scrubber bulls

You owe me an explanation.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,960
Father, I've had years of schooling.
It's enough.

61
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,960
What relevance is a degree
in running a cattle property, anyway?

Just give me some breathing space
for a year,

will be 12,000 miles away.

Perhaps university was a waste of time.

77
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Martin, we are British, and being...

78
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,716
Oh, I thought we were Australian,
Father.

79
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,280
And being British carries with it
responsibility as well as privilege.

80
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Whatever the Europeans want to do
is no business of ours.

how long will this country stand?

Why didn't you let on it was you?

for European culture?

then throw them aside
when they're no longer wanted.

Oh, a cottage for life and a pension

is hardly what I'd call
being 'thrown aside'.

It doesn't bring your father back.

That larrikin son of theirs is home.

132

Martin?

133
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Yeah. They reckon he got kicked out
of that fancy university.

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,280
Probably swallowed his silver spoon.

"Indescribable enthusiasm and entire
unanimity throughout Australia

138

"in support of the Empire in war."

Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

140
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,680
We have never been so united.
The whole colony will give its...

141
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,800
Nation, Father.
We're no longer a colony.

142
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,233
Er, 'nation', then.

143
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,200
We are not at war yet, Rupert.

144
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
We will be at any moment.

145
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
The Prussians have been rampaging
through Belgium and France

146
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,480
for two days now,

147
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,320
and they are well past
the deadline of Britain's ultimatum.

148
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,440
Today's papers report that there's
been an exchange of messages

149
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,840
between the Tsar,
the Kaiser and King George.

150
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,520
Those three are cousins.

151
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,273
One must pray sanity will prevail.

152
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,920
My dear George, you will
never change. Always naive.

153
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,353
(All chuckle)

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Well, Rupert, if it is naivety

155
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,920
to hope that the nations
of our great Western civilisation

156
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,200
can settle their differences
like rational people,

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,918
then I am as you say.

158
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,920
If a simple farmer like myself
can see the thing clearly

159
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,880
then surely you, as a scholar, can.

160
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,480
Whatever the cause, whatever
the excuse, the issue is quite plain.

Mum sent me to keep an eye on you.

631
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,320
You can carry your own gear, sis.

632
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
Morning, Sister.

633
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,320
(English accent) May I be
of assistance, ma'am?

634
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
Thank you, Private.

635
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,720
Corporal.
Where are you ladies staying?

636
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,000
So, this is what you meant
when you said you'd see us.

637
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,680
I've had my name down
on the reserves for months.

638
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,160
And you never told us.

639
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,640
You never asked.

640
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,840
It's really good to see you.
(Giggles)

641
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,600
You coming to France with us?

642
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,080
Mm-hm.

643
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,240
France. I can tell you a few stories...

644
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,200
Put the bags down here,
please, Corporal.

645
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,440
Oh... (Laughs)... cut the 'Corporal'.

646
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,120
(WHIMSICAL MUSIC)

647
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, I see.

648
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,760
Army rules. Some places
are out of bounds to other ranks.

649
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,640
But you'd understand that,
wouldn't you?

650
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,234
Just like the big house
at Hereford Downs.

651
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,959
Well, one to you, madam,
but I'll even the score.

652
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
What - by applying for a commission?

653
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,434
I wouldn't go that far. I'll get you back.

654
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,953
(Laughs)

655
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,800
BILL: I wasn't complaining, mind you.

656
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,600
I've always been a top man, myself,
on that sort of score.

657
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,920
So we went for a daytrip -
just a daytrip, mind.

658
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,516
Little town called Bologne.
Nice grub, but the beer wasn't much.

659
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,840
Someone said the other day
that the French eat frog's legs.

660
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
I don't think I'd like that much.

661
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,360
G'day, boys.

662
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,793
ALL: G'day, Dick.

663
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,040
What do you reckon, Marty?
What's that?

664
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,634
They're saying in France,
we could eat frog's legs.

665
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,560
(Laughs) It's not compulsory.

666
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,760
What, so you've been, then?

667
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,557
Mm-hm.

668
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,279
Life's fairly snouted
the young squire today.

669
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,680
My sister's a lieutenant and
Martin Barrington's only a corporal.

670
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,160
(All laugh)
Good on you, Dick.

671
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,040
Alright, alright, what's France like?

672
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,960
Well, I went up the Loire Valley,

673
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,840
and it was, well, like something
you've never seen before.

674
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,320
A great, slow river that never
runs dry, vineyards, castles.

675
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,680
A sun that never gets too hot.

676
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Any sheilas?

677
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,955
For sheilas, you should try Paris.

678
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,560
Well, go on.

679
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,400
Folies Bergere, Moulin Rouge,
Bal Tabarin.

680
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Wine, women and song
right round the clock.

681
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,200
(All snigger)

682
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,360
ROLY: One soon learns to expect
the unexpected in the army.

683
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,840
On the day our transports were getting
ready to leave Australian waters,

684
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,200
Turkey came into the war
on Germany's side.

685
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,480
Instead of the fields of France,
it was the sands of Egypt.

686
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,320
Now, after five months of training, we're
heading for a place called Gallipoli.

687
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,680
Martin said the idea was to attack
Germany through the back door.

688
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,480
They even gave us a new name
for the occasion - ANZAC.

689
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,640
Well, Pat says it sounds like
a South American Indian tribe,

690
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,240
but it stands for the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps.

691
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,040
The mood was quiet.

692
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,520
The boys knew that all of Australia
would be watching us today.

693
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,560
(Men sing) Oh, God, our help
in ages past

694
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,951
Our hope for years to come...

695
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,680
What are you
breaking up the crate for?

696
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,720
Firewood, Roly.
Haven't you ever been in the bush?

697
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,080
Course not. He was brought up
respectable, weren't you, Roly?

698
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,513
(All laugh)

699
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,040
Now, remember, lads,
the biscuits and water you have

700
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,720
are to last for three days.

701
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,880
There's nothing else
at this spot in Gallipoli.

702
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,520
Right, skip.
Nothing but Turkish soldiers.

703
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
Stub out that cigarette.

704
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,040
Now, we turn left once ashore,
do the beach quickly.

705
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,520
No smoking.

706
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,000
Good luck to you, lads.
You too, skip.

707
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Good luck to you, sir.
Good luck, Roly.

708
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,280
Three days rations, boys -
the biscuits and the water.

709
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,794
Look after 'em.
Three days on the rations.

I can't contact the company.

You and 100 others.

Get a message to the Colonel.

Tell him they've landed us
a mile to the north.

Hey, slip up and tell the Turks
it's a mistake.

They've got all the high ground.

They know the bloody country.
They've got reinforcements coming.

No, let General Bridges summarise.

863
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,080
Of my three brigades, one has ceased
to exist as a fighting formation.

864

The other two
have suffered severe casualties.

865
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,600
Where are you getting
your information from?

866
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,760
From wounded
and men returning to the beach.

God, what have shocked men and
stragglers to say that is accurate?

868
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,240
It leads me to the conclusion
that our fighting spirit

869
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,440
that has held up so far will crack
under this impossible pressure.

870
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,280
I believe we should evacuate
before this happens.

An evacuation at night in contact with the
enemy - that's a recipe for a shambles.

is up to the same standard.

1104

There is a rumour that General Walker
is strongly against the attack.

1105
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,320
He regards it
as an unnecessary sacrifice

No.

you don't expect me not to ask it.

1110

Mrs Baker, I only want to have a word.

1118

Mrs Baker, please.

1120

You've got an army telegram,
haven't you?

1121
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,440
No, I don't have any
telegrams with me today.

1122
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,000
But I do have some news
of your son, Dick.

1123
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,240
I thought you'd like to know.
I gather you haven't had a letter yet.

1124
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,720
Kate, she writes like clockwork,
but Dick's not one for pen and paper.

1125
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,840
Martin Barrington's letters
have been coming through

1126
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,720
and he writes so much about Dick.

1127
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Well, go on, then.
Oh, please, Reverend.

1128
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,280
For a start, it appears your son
is doing well in the army.

1129
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,838
They've already made him a corporal.

1130
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,840
Here, mate. You OK?

1131
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,480
Yeah, OK.

1132

What's it like?

1133
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,720
It's a hell of a fight, but the boys
are in the Turkish trenches.

1138

So you had a long talk to Kate, eh?

1139
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,039
Yeah, long enough.
You know, just what I told you.

1140

You'll do the right thing by her,
won't you?

Organisation and planning.

1418

After nine months in Gallipoli,

1419
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,554
our only achievement
was the way we left.

1420
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,357
This must never happen again.

Who was that bloke, Marty?

1422
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,840
General White.

1423
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,560
Yeah, well, I hope
he can practise what he preaches

1424
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,790
when we get to France -

(Choir sings) There's a long, long
trail a-winding

1430
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:30,200
Into the land of my dreams

1431
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:35,000
Where the nightingales are singing

1432
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,360
And the pale moon beams

1433
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:45,920
There's a long, long night
of waiting

1434
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,600
Until my dreams all come true

1435
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,320
Till the day when I'll be going

1436
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:02,920
Down that long, long trail
with you.
