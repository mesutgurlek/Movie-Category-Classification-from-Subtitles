<i>The Times, Newsday</i> and every channel

Ain't you ever heard of the early bird?

- Christ.
- Go find a wailing wall.

- I got lost.
- Comin' here?

- Come and go at the same time.
- Give me some angle.

All I can give you
is an empty feeling, kid.

The perp's over at Bellevue,
eighth floor peanut gallery.

The victim's deader
than yesterday's beer.

I'll play Santa at the PA
on Christmas Day. Or I'll...

I'll pay Hong Kong Sue over on Forty
Deuce to blow your noodle like Satchmo.

"Good Cop Helps Poor Kids."

Honest to Jesus, you get three months
of Saturdays out of it. Come on.

62
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,972
I can't go back to scratching out obits.

See those guys?
Don't turn around.

They're rolling up to Harlem
to sniff around the perp's apartment.

Only case that dynamic duo has cracked
has Schaefer written on the side,

but maybe you'll see something.
Don't quote those gumflappers.

- You need a quote, you call me.
- OK.

- Yeah, what's up?

- Thank you. Thank you.

- Come on.
- All right.

71
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,238
We'll start in the living room
and work our way back.

72
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,510
Close the door behind you, kid.

73
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,440
This perp is very, very religious.

74
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,913
Nothing wrong with being
in good standing with the Lord.

75
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,377
And a war hero, too.
Look at this, a Purple Heart.

Hey, Keith, the Brown Bomber.

77
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,359
[Keith] Muhammad Ali would've knocked
him out. Way too fast for Joe Louis.

78
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,295
He can run, but he can't hide.

79

Hey, Dan, what the hell is this?

80
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,805
- [Dan] What you got there?
- I don't know. It's heavy.

81
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,807
Whatever this is, it ain't junior-grade.
This thing looks expensive.

82
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,620
My wife claws around flea markets
looking for this crap every weekend.

83
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,523
I'm telling you, this ain't normal.

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,255
This definitely ain't normal.

85
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,162
- Back up, buddy.
- Sorry.

86
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,722
[Keith] No problem.

87
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,564
- Professor Brooks?
- Yes.

88
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,572
I get a lot of these things.
Old rocks. Antique specials.

89
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,510
It seems like every
schmuck in the world

who finds a backyard arrowhead
mistakes me for Iris.

91
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,049
Put it here.

92
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,748
From Greek mythology.
She is the faithful voice of Zeus.

93
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,453
She flies from place to place
and commands respect

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,895
from mortals and from im...

95

...immortals.

96
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,964
- Where the hell'd you get this?
- From a perp's apartment.

97
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,270
- It's got this mark...
- Don't touch it.

98
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:35,008
This is over 450 years old.

99
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,847
It's the missing Primavera
from the Santa Trinita.

100
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,353
Is that the <i>Niña,</i> the <i>Pinta</i>
or the <i>Santa Maria?</i>

101
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,446
Oh, for God sakes, detective.

102
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,481
It's the oldest elliptic

103
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,893
arch bridge in the world.

104
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,456
It's in Florence, Italy.

105
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,763
Built by Ammanati.

106
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,202
This was one of four statues on it.

107
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:04,073
The Primavera, meaning "spring."

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,941
This head has been missing

109
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:10,608
since the Nazis blew up
the bridge in 1944.

110
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,883
My God! This is a gold mine!

111
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,680
A gold mine!

112
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,820

Please. Enough.

00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,687
I need a little break, OK, baby?

121
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,100
[Tim] They say you haven't
spoken or eaten in two days.

122
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,162
They'll try to force-feed you.

123
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,503
Make you rise, like Jesus.

124
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,950
Come on. I've hiked all over
New York asking about you.

125
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,782
I talked to everybody.
Cops, your sister.

126
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,381
Spoke to your cousin in San Juan.
You're clean as a board of health.

127
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,086
You got no kids, no debts, no enemies.

128
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,253
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

129
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,661
Twenty-five years
of a great marriage,

130
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,963
till your wife's heart gave out.

131
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,562
So why you stick a German Luger
in a guy's chest

132
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,940
three months short of your retirement?
Five million dollars.

133
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,946
That's how much that head would
draw on the black market.

134
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,677
What's it doin' buried there
on the bottom of your closet?

135
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,925
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

136
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,453
Unless you can afford a lawyer,
you're gonna swallow happy pills

137
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,296
in this nuthouse the rest of your life.

138
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:20,101
But my story could help you.
And you need help, mac.

[woman, in Italian] Enrico, what kind
of art dealer specializes in Nazi art?

140
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,981
Because it's a lucrative business.

141

more than you love 'love.'

[Keith] Pina, no.
Don't come over here.

145

[in Italian] Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.

146
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,005
I gotta catch up. World might've
ended, I wouldn't know

147
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,237
'cause we've been going at it
two days. For crying out loud.

148

462
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,404
We hold here till night.
Me and Bishop'll take first watch.

463
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,278
Hector, you and Train take second.
Give the boy whatever first aid you got.

464
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,553
What'd you get us into now, Diesel?

465
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,259
It's always something with you,
big fella. Here, you gonna need these.

466
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,733
Come on, kid.
[speaks Italian] Eat.

467
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,167
Eat.

468
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,162
Come on.

469
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,003
He won't take the medicine.

470
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,807
Go on, give it here.

471
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,216
You want some chocolate, boy?

472
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,257
I wouldn't get attached.
He'll be dead in a week.

473
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,252
I ain't never been this close
to a white person before, Hec.

474
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,528
Never even touched one.
Not even a dead one.

475
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,934
If this one dies, I'll give you
a whistle as a consolation prize.

476
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,962
- You really think he'll die?
- Why worry about it?

477
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,998
We could all be dead
in an hour anyway.

478
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,974
Why you always kissing that thing, Hec?

479
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,853
- Reminds me who my father is.
- I don't need help remembering my pa.

480
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,518
His name's Chester.
Chester Train.

481
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,390
Let's give this kid some water.

482
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,790
[in Italian] Water.

483
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,995
Arturo?

484
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,271
Can I ask you something?

485
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,707
What you want, boy?

486
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,643
[in Italian] Can you tell me who I am?

487
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,781
Hector, you speak that Italian?
What's he saying?

488
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,284
He said, "Who am I?"
But who's he talking to?

489
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,343
Lord, I knew it!

490
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,083
I could see it in his face!
Look at him, Hec.

491
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,920
Shh! Quiet down.

492
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,426
Good God!

493
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,361
- He got the power!
- What power?

494
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,423
God knows it. In the olden days,
everything could speak.

495
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,867
- The trees, the birds.
- Shh!

496
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:10,101
If you could hear them things,
then that mean you had it.

497
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:18,308
This boy's standing
in the shadow of God, Hector.

498
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:22,478
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for standing
on Your holy righteous word, Lord!

499
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,283
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

500
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,967
As you were.

501
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,000
- General Almond.
- Colonel.

502
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,874
I have a photo you should see, sir.

503
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,007
Forget that a minute. How bad
are the numbers from yesterday?

504
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,642
- Bad, sir.
- And Ike gets mad when he gives me

505
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,517
waiters and shoeshine boys
to fight the Krauts with.

506
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,580
Germans are dug in.
And that gun at La Spezia's killing us.

507
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:38,084
Fifteen thousand colored soldiers.
One in four is a casualty.

508
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,222
And all I'm hearing about
is one goddamned gun?

509
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,167
We have guns, too, here.
Look, see, colonel? I got one.

510
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:49,832
This colored division...
This is an experiment, Jack.

511
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:54,936
An experiment. These are the first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers. Not ours.

512
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,847
- Sir, I respectfully disagree.
- That's why they sent you here, Jack.

513
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,647
To lead me into the New World.

514
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,120
A gift from the Brits.
Taken at 11,000 feet. See?

515
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,650
That's a German buildup at
Lama Di Sotto. Two or three regiments.

516
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,630
- Surprise attack you worried about?
- I hope not.

517
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,462
I got corroboration from a partisan.

518
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,991
Anybody crush grapes
with feet can't be trusted.

519
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,936
Get some Krauts to confirm.

520
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,735
Already working on it, sir.
Captain Rudden!

521
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,672
- Good evening, general.
- Come.

522
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,411
Germans may be planning counter-
offensive down the Serchio Valley.

523
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,443
We need a POW to confirm.
You running patrols there?

524
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,320
George Company has a squad
sitting right in that area.

525
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,621
- How?
- They pushed across the Serchio

526
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,356
beyond Hill Maine at the weak point.
I heard them call for artillery.

527
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:50,594
Might've broken Jerry's hold
on the river. Captain Nokes didn't fire.

528
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,398
- Why not?
- He couldn't see 'em, sir.

529
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,871
Didn't believe they crossed,
they got hung up.

530
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:59,342
I had Fox Company positioned
down the river from George Company.

531
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,345
Got pretty hot over there.
Four of 'em right up a mountain.

532
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,609
Got weapons and a radio
if they're alive.

533
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,378
- Who are the four men?
- Shouldn't be hard to find out.

534
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,885
One of them's the biggest Negro
you've ever seen in your life.

535
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,945
Mmm.

536
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,083
Very well then. Dismissed.

537
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,500
[door shuts]

538
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,289
[speaking German]
My God, I've had it.

539
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,850
Come on, it's enough.

540
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,019
Yeah, let's go.

541
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,298
I need something to eat.

542
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,695
[speaking Italian]
The Germans are leaving!

543
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,637
[bell tolling]

544
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,111
[speaking German] Push it up
or I'll kill it right now.

545
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,982
I'm pushing as hard
as I can.

546
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,749
Pull, pull, pull.

547
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,689
My goodness I'm hungry.

548
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,991
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.

549
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,231
[in Italian] Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.

550
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,634
They won't get fat on it.

551
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,229
Let's hope they choke on it.

552
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,832
Shut up, the two of you!

553
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,140
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.

554
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,320
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

555
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,118
tell us if we'll see him
or never see him again.

556
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,647
Is he still alive?

557
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,660
My eyes aren't
what they used to be.

558
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,992
- [rattling table]
- Come on!

559
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,327
So, so, so?

560
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,697
We can't even joke? Come on.

561
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,127
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

562
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,196
You're the usual scoundrel!

563
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,

564
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,699
he thinks he can do what he wants.

565
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,210
Oh yes?

566
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,612
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?

567
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,740
The Pope?

568
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,842
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

569
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,182
And the light?

570
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,777
How did your electricity come back on?

571
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,981
Papa.

572
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,182
Come with me.

573
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
Come with me.

574
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,783
How did the light come back on?

575
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,660
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.

576
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,300
You would think that
after all these years,

577
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,969
you would treat your friends better.

578
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,377
What is wrong with you, Papa?

579
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,505
Would you tell me?

580
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,681
It's Natalina.

581
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,153
What did she do?

582
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,054
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.

583
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,423
You still going on about the same story?

584
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,691
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

585
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,098
There's strange things going on.

586
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,602
My electricity returned...

587
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,536
from God knows where
after two and a half years.

588
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,233
I was going to ask you about that.

589
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,970
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

590
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,741
for every bandit and German to see.

591
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,444
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.

592
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,884
What are you talking about?

593
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,451
She prays for you every day.

594
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,853
Know what I say?

595
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:16,158
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.

596
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,531
Tell everyone that
Mussolini disgusts you,

597
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,298
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

598
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,502
Il Duce made us a world power again.

599
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,375
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.

600
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,971
Papa, II Duce betrayed Italy.

601
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,778
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.

602
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,115
You are still so young, my child.

603
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,053
You don't know the ways of the world.

604
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,579
But you will learn.

605
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,717
And from whom?

606
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,090
From a Fascist like you?

607
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,222
You're just like your mother.

608
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,993
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts

609
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,932
are only good for hiding dirt.

610
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,127
Okay, let's go.

611
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,868
[knocking on door]

612
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,674
Germans!!!

613
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,471
It's your house.

614
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,483
Holy Mother of God.

615
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,564
It's okay.

616
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,569
It's okay.

617
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,695
It's okay, it's okay.

618
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,602
Hector, ask who's in charge.
Tell them we're Americans.

619
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,204
[in Italian] Americans?

620
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,274
[in English] Me, too. Half.

621
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,580
[in Italian] Half.

622
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,213
[in English] Me sister Ida, half.

623
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,019
[in Italian] We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.

624
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,322
Put us together,
we make one American.

625
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,793
[in Italian] Okay, wait. Wait.

626
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,695
Wait. Wait. Wait.

627
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,959
Thank you.

628
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,261
Who's in charge here?

629
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,613
Anybody here speak English?

630
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,412
[in Italian]
Where are the Germans?

631
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,683
Everywhere. Boom, boom.

632
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,452
My name is Renata.

633
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,263
- Where'd you learn English?
- I was nanny for a British family.

634
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,860
And a jolly good tuck-in-the-bed
tinkerer you must be.

635
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,838
- You can nanny me. Want a Camel?
- Cool it, Bishop.

636
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,037
I'm Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps.
We got a boy that needs help.

637
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,806
[in Italian]
A boy? He has a boy.

638
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,505
Oh, my God.

639
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,577
Is he alive? Put him here.

640
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,211
Slow. Slowly.

641
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,052
Where did you find him?

642
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,286
[Hector] On the Mountain.
Do you know him?

643
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,386
[Natalina]
No, I don't know him.

644
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,897
But he can stay here
until he gets better.

645
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,128
Tell them we're taking the boy
to a hospital. They can come.

646
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,399
They need to evacuate.
We'll escort them down the mountain.

647
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,202
[in Italian] We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.

648
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,134
The hospital around the corner?

649
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,372
The Germans are everywhere.

650
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,438
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

651
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,949
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.

652
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,782
I don't know how you
got past Vergemoli.

653
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,483
The only way to Pietrasanta...

654
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,185
where the Americans might be...

655
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,749
is over that way,

656
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,786
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

657
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,259
Says we're surrounded.

658
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,460
Doesn't know how we got
past German lines,

659
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,732
but the only way we might find
some Americans is up there.

660
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,137
- The Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
- Sleeping Man?

661
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,575
- [in Italian] What is that?
- It's a legend.

662
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:53,571
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.

663
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,312
So he lays across the Mountain...

664
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,753
to protect her from the wind and rain.

665
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,986
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.

666
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,395
Legend has it that
one day he will awaken.

667
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,726
A legend about a shepherd
that fell in love...

668
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,067
Whatever she's saying,
we gotta rest until sunup.

669
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,369
- OK.
- Stay here? No, no.

670
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,136
Stay here. <i>Si, si.</i>

671
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,167
If they sing to the Krauts,
we will pull a trigger on this

672
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,046
and tell the hammer to hurry. Won't be
nothing but powder and steel here.

673
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,643
We are not Germans.
We are Italians.

674
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,052
- Full blood.
- And what are we? Half blood?

675
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,955
[in Italian]
We should take him...

676
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,722
and put him to bed.

677
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,993
The boy stays here. He's sick.

678
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,549
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

679
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,809
[in German]
Catching up on your reading?

680
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,977
Yes, Colonel, I'm informing myself
about the enemy.

681
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,353
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.

682
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,358
This helps us identify them.

683
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,587
Who is the poet?

684
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,356
Giovanni Pascoli.

685
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:51,857
Do you think it's appropriate
to waste your time reading poetry?

686
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:57,771
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.

687
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,105
What are you planning to do about it?

688
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,204
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.

689
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,714
My men are exhausted.

690
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,943
We need ammo and food.

691
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,612
Food? You want food?

692
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,349
You can suck icicles
in Russia...

693
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:18,725
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.

694
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,322
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?

695
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,528
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

696
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,502
Good. Listen closely.

697
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,407
I have come too far to repeat myself.

698
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,709
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

699
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:42,480
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.

700
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,147
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.

701
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,453
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...

702
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,153
to him and his criminal friends.

703
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,252
Bandenbefehl?

704
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,923
Is there an echo out here?

705
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:59,094
General Kesselring's standing
field order for the Italian Republic.

706
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,626
At a commander's sole discretion,

707
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,469
for every one German soldier killed,

708
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,873
we execute ten Italian civilians.

709
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:12,439
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.

710
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:16,111
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...

711
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,677
my men would kill innocent civilians.

712
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,350
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

713
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:27,159
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.

714
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,131
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.

715
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,532
Bandenbefehl!

716
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,729
Bandenbefehl.

717
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,439
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.

718
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,969
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.

719
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,311
And three:

720
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,217
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.

721
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,026
We are missing a Corporal...

722
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,691
from the 35th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 5th Company.

723
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,725
Name: Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.

724
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,738
[Eichholz] We have some every day.
What's so special about him?

725
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,141
You and I are not here...

726
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:17,010
to question the Führer's orders.

727
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,606
You are to send out a search party.

728
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,139
Find him.

729
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,879
Don't let him escape.

730
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,910
And when you have him...

731
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,822
get word to me immediately.

732
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,696
Let's go!

733
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,275
<i>[in Italian] If I am no longer</i>
<i>that lamp...</i>

734
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,115
<i>which flickers in front</i>
<i>of a sweet Maria.</i>

735
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,620
[in German] What does that mean?

736
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,653
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

737
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,924
Whatever he's done,

738
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,827
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.

739
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,928
Mount a search party.

740
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,956
We have to find him first,

741
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,992
hold him and give him a few days...

742
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,131
before Pflueger pulls out
his teeth, one by one.

743
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,197
Yes.

744
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,007
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

745
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,909
I want to return to my family.

746
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,136
[in Italian]
I've watched you grow up.

747
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,441
But you haven't become much.

748
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,946
And he can't do much.

749
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,845
- You're laughing at me?
- Of course.

750
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,350
Where did you get that?

751
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,875
So many things you want to know.

752
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,012
Here. Take it and eat.

753
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,385
Give me some, too.

754
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,686
Are you afraid you're
not going to get any?

755
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,885
Here. Grow.

756
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,553
Give me a chestnut, too.

757
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,026
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

758
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,725
Hey, leave me alone.

759
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,700
Aren't you the dandy?

760
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,498
Ah, he's offended.

761
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,503
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

762
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,239
You have to be on the lookout.

763
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,510
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.

764
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,176
I almost choked.

765
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,846
You wait here.

766
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,331
My friend.

767
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,634
The Americans are getting closer.

768
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,898
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.

769
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,069
They know it already, for sure.

770
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,171
You? How are you?

771
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,444
Me? I'm okay.

772
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,541
You?

773
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,075
I always have Marco's
face in front of my eyes.

774
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,651
Don't worry about that.

775
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:20,924
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.

776
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,089
I care.

777
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,530
In your opinion...

778
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,832
when we will be in front of God,

779
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,701
if we ever get there,

780
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,707
is he going to ask us
for our political card?

781
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,710
Is he going to say,
"Marco, no... Ludovico, no.

782
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:38,236
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists."

783
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,877
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?

784
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,183
You're asking yourself
too many questions.

785
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,816
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.

786
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,452
And then who will kill the Germans?

787
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,518
Hey.

788
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,164
Anyway, what's done is done.

789
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,307
George Company to 370,
George Company to 3-7, over.

790
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,243
George Company to 370, over.

791
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,738
[in Italian] Someone tell that
big beast to get out of my room.

792
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,838
Shh! The Boy has a fever.

793
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,510
He needs to eat and get some rest.

794
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,542
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.

795
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,760
Arturo.

796
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,300
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

797
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,165
if you could only see it.

798
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,694
It's enormous.

799
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,900
No, even bigger.

800
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,302
Of course I saw it.

801
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,471
It's all made of chocolate.

802
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,481
You break a piece off,

803
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,312
and it grows back.

804
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,716
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

805
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,685
Good heavens.

806
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,220
Something's not right.

807
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,664
Someone put the evil eye on him.

808
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,998
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

809
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,869
- To where?
- With the Americans.

810
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,566
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.

811
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,234
This is my house.

812
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,640
I have a house too.

813
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,010
Natalina.

814
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,536
What do you think?

815
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,640
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.

816
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,208
We need a Priest here.

817
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,413
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.

818
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,321
A Priest can take
the Devil out of him.

819
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,383
Train, get up. We gotta book.

820
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,092
[Train] Excuse me.

821
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,568
Hey, boy. Hey.

822
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:17,663
Time for you
to take your medicine again.

823
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,032
Here it comes. Ready?

824
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,738
[humming]

825
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,270
There. Thank you.

826
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,009
Get you some of that soup, boy.

827
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,179
Mmm.

828
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,624
- Yes.
- He would not eat before.

829
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,323
Here you go, boy.

830
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,136
It's all over your shirt.

831
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,434
- Come on, boy. Let's go.
- [in Italian] My Chocolate Giant.

832
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,345
- OK, sarge. We ready.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

833
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,282
We? Boy, where the hell "we" goin'?

834
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,410
You wasn't chiseling him,
we wouldn't be here.

835
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,080
- You think Nokes is lookin' for us?
- What?

836
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,420
Hector been tryin' to fix that radio
since we got here.

837
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,222
- Shh!
- What?

838
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,657
<i>Arrive- damn-derci.</i>

839
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:28,375
Hector. We gotta bail. Ask the old man
if he'll show us another way outta here.

840
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,812
- Maybe we can reach the 366.
- We can't get five feet outta here

841
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,645
without being flavor of the week
for the <i>Guten Tags.</i>

842
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,642
These people survived for years
without mortars. Stay with the <i>paisans.</i>

843
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,986
You wanna stay here and play house,
go ahead, but I'm bookin'.

844
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,619
Ask the old man if he'll show us
another way outta these mountains.

845
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:50,291
Tell him we'll pay him. We got plenty of
that funny money they use around here.

846
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,493
[speaks Italian]
Can you show us a safe path?

847
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,400
There is no safe way.

848
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,064
Germans. Boom! Boom!
