he asked me if I had any skill.

249
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,789
- (ASLAUG LAUGHING)
- And that I doubted whether...

250
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,693
anyone in that hall could
drink as much as me.

251
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:51,898
He asked his cup bearer
to bring his sconce-horn.

252
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:56,302
He said some men there took
two draughts to empty it,

253
00:20:56,303 --> 00:21:00,038
but nobody was so feeble that
they couldn't drain it in three.

255
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,044

until I was breathless.

But when I finished,

258
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:12,885
I saw that the level of the drink...

was just a little bit
lower than when I started.

So the king,

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,395
he asked me if I wanted to try my hand

at some other type of contest.

263

(SHOUTING) wrestle with someone.

Who did you wrestle?

265

She... was called Elli.

266
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:35,958
She was his old foster-mother.

I hurled myself upon her!

270

But the moment that I laid hands on her,

271
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,572
I realized...

272
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,958
she was strong.

273
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,094
And she caught me in a lock
and threw me off balance.

274
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:58,314
I clung to her desperately,

275
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:02,634
but after a struggle,
I was forced to one knee...

had ebbed with my efforts.

A great city, which the Romans built,

I've once visited Paris myself.

It is set upon an island in the middle
of a great river called the Seine.

it for the first time.

346

It was like a dream,

we should not allow
them to stay any longer.

SIGGY:
A stranger has come to Kattegat.

499
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,143
His name is Harbard.

500
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,815
It is possible that he is...

501
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:39,118
a magician, or...
He has powers of some kind.

502
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,819
SEER:
Why do you think that?

503
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:46,025
Before he arrived, I dreamt of him.

504
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,626
And so did two other women.
All of us, the same dream.

506
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,868
Queen Aslaug cannot comfort her
son Ivar when he is suffering.

507
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,319
But this man, he...

508
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,272
He takes away Ivar's pain,

509
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:02,107
and the boy goes back to sleep.

510
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,210
If he possesses powers,

511
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,179
then he is putting them to good use.

512
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,166
But are you sure?

513
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:16,155
Two young boys died today.

514
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:20,126
- A fisherman caught them in his nets.
- Yes, I know.

515
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,928
Might he not be connected
to the deaths of these boys?

516
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,095
Why should he be?

517
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,349
I don't know.

518
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:30,435
But you would know.

519
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,774
What have the gods told you?

520
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,275
What have you foreseen?

521
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:37,977
(SEER SIGHING)

522
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:41,614
The gods have vouchsafed me nothing,
told me nothing.

523
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:45,417
They have neither warned me,
nor promised me anything.

524
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,506
And I have foreseen nothing.

525
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,457
But we have foreseen something.

526
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:58,297
We women, we dreamt that you were...

527
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:00,182
You were tied up,
that you were bleeding,

528
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,684
and you could neither move nor cry out.

529
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,638
That is what we saw.

530
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:09,641
We saw that...

531
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,361
nobody could help us.

532
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:18,116
It's true.

533
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:21,202
No one can help you.
