that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention,

a kingdom for a stage,

princes to act and monarchs
to behold a swelling scene.

11
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,009
Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself, assume the port of Mars.

And, at his heels, leashed in like hounds,

would famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

to bring forth so great an object.

that did affright the air at Agincourt?

Suppose, within the girdle of these walls,

00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,760
are now confined
two mighty monarchies

My lord, I'll tell you.

37
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:36,183
That same bill is urged

38
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:39,645
which, in the eleventh year
of the last king's reign,

39
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:42,564
was likely to have been
against us passed,

40
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:45,651
but that the scambling
and unquiet times

41
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,861
did push it out of further question.

42
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,822
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

43
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:54,368
It must be thought on.
If it pass against us,

44
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,454
we lose the better half
of our possession,

45
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:01,582
for all those temporal lands
which men devout

46
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,335
by testament have given to the Church,

47
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:08,172
would they strip from us -
thus runs the bill.

48
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:11,842
- This would drink deep.
- 'Twould drink the cup and all.

49
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,470
- (Audience laughs)
- By what prevention?

50
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:19,850
The King is full of grace and fair regard.

51
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:22,644
And a true lover of the holy Church.

52
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,480
The courses of his youth promised it not,

53
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:28,608
since his addiction was to courses vain,

54
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:32,362
his companies unlettered,
rude and shallow,

55
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:36,282
his hours filled up with banquets,
riots, sports,

56
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,827
and never noted in him any study.

57
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:41,830
And so the prince
obscured his contemplations

58
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,957
under the veil of wildness,

59
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,917
which grew, no doubt,
like the summer grass,

60
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,503
- fastest by night.
- (Laughter)

The breath no sooner left
his father's body

62
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:58,387
but that the wildness, mortified in him,
seemed to die too.

63
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:02,266
- Sir John Falstaff...
- (Cheering)

64
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,228
...and all his company along with him,

65
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,897
- he banished...
- (Booing)

66
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:16,529
...under pain of death,
not to come near his person...

67
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,656
- (Yelling)
...by ten miles!

68
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:24,871
Yea, at that very moment,
consideration like an angel came

69
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:28,374
and whipped the offending Adam
out of him.

70
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,419
Never was such a sudden scholar made,

71
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:35,255
never came reformation in a flood

72
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,424

75
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:47,642
My good lord, how now for mitigation
of this bill urged by the Commons?

76
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:50,562
Doth his majesty incline to it, or no?

77
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:55,608
He seems indifferent,
or rather swaying more upon our part,

78
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,903
for I have made an offer to his majesty,

79
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,572
as touching France,

80
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,617
to give a greater sum
than ever at one time

81
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,579
the clergy yet did to his predecessors
part withal.

82
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,915
How did this offer seem received,
my lord?

83
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:13,417
Of good acceptance of his majesty,

84
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,711
save that there was not
time enough to hear,

85
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:18,379
as I perceived
his grace would fain have done,

86
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:21,883
of his true title to some
certain dukedoms

87
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:26,346
and generally
to the crown and seat of France,

88
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,849

his great-grandfather.

that broke this off?

to give him hearing.

- It is.
- Then go we in to hear his embassy,

97
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,046
which I could with a ready guess declare

98
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:05,466
before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

99
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:09,095

00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:24,182
and justly and religiously unfold

115
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:27,644
why the Law Salic that they have
in France

116
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:31,106
or should, nor should not,
bar us in our claim.

00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,609
We charge you in the name of God,

118
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:37,946
take heed how you awake
the sleeping sword of war.

00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:43,117
For never two such kingdoms did contend
without much fall of blood,

do make such waste in brief mortality.

121
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:51,500
Then hear me, gracious sovereign,
and you peers

122
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:56,964
that owe your lives, your faith,
your services to this imperial throne.

123
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:01,677
There is no bar to make
against Your Highness' claim to France

124
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,555
but this,
which they produce from Pharamond.

125
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:09,267
"In terram Salicam
mulieres ne succedant" -

126
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:13,104
No woman shall succeed in Salic land -

127
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:18,651
which Salic land the French unjustly gloze
to be the realm of France.

128
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:21,654
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm

129
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,198
that the land Salic lies in Germany,

130
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:28,119
between the floods of Saale and of Elbe,

131
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:33,749
where, Charles the Great,
having subdued the Saxons,

132
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,210
there left behind and settled
certain French

133
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:40,922
who, holding in disdain
the German women

134
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,675
for some dishonest manners
of their life...

135
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,760
(Laughter)

136
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:51,724
...established there this law - to whit,
no female should be inheritrix in Salic land,

137
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,186
which is this day in Germany
called Meissen.

138
00:14:55,228 --> 00:15:01,108
Then doth it well appear the Salic Law
was not devised for the realm of France.

139
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,028
Nor did the French possess
the Salic land

140
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,656
until four hundred one-and-twenty years

00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:31,361
of the Lady Ermengarde,
daughter to Charles,

161
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,947
the foresaid Duke of Lorraine.

162
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,409
So that, as clear as is
the summer's sun...

163
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,413
- (Laughter)
...all hold in right and title of the female.

164
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,124
So do the kings of France unto this day,

165
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,251
howbeit they would hold up
this Salic Law

166
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:51,255
to bar Your Highness
claiming from the female.

167
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,843
May I with right and conscience
make this claim?

168
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,888
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,

169
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:02,766
for in the Book of Numbers it is writ,

170
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:08,147
"When the son die, let the inheritance
descend unto the daughter."

171
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,065
Gracious lord, stand your own.

172
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,735
Look back into your mighty ancestors.

173
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,070
Go, my dread lord,
to your great-grandsire's tomb

174
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:19,115
from whom you claim.
Invoke his warlike spirit,

175
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,409
and your great-uncle's,
Edward the Black Prince.

176
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:24,204
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth do all expect

177
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:27,415
that you should rouse yourself
as did the former lions of your blood.

178
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,043
They know your grace hath cause
and means and might.

179
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,169
So hath Your Highness.

180
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:35,339
Never king of England
had nobles richer or more loyal subjects,

whose hearts have left their bodies
here in England

and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.

with blood and sword and fire,
to win your right.

In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty

will raise Your Highness
such a mighty sum

187
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:57,735
as never did the clergy at one time
bring in to any of your ancestors.

the noble sinews of our power,

France being ours we'll bend it
to our awe

193

over them.

(# March)

Now are we well prepared to know
the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin,

197
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,151
for we hear your greeting is from him,
not from the king.

198
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,405
May it please Your Majesty
to give us leave

199
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,157
freely to render what we have in charge,

200
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,494
or shall we sparingly show you far off

201
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,414
the Dauphin's meaning
and our embassy?

202
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,833
We are no tyrant, but a Christian King,

203
00:18:55,875 --> 00:19:00,129
therefore with frank and with uncurbed
plainness tell us the Dauphin's mind.

204
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,424
Thus then in few.

205
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,926
Your Highness lately sending
into France

206
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:09,762
did claim some certain dukedoms,

207
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,849
in the right of your great predecessor,
King Edward the Third.

208
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,435
In answer to which claim,
the Prince our master

209
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:18,980
says that you savour
too much of your youth.

210
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,941
He therefore sends you,
fitter for your study,

211
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,110
this tun of treasure,

212
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:27,863
and in lieu of this desires you
let the dukedoms that you claim

213
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,489
hear no more of you.

214
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,408
This the Dauphin speaks.

215
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,412
What treasure, Uncle?

216
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:43,003
Tennis balls, my liege.

217
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,130
(Laughter)

218
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:58,601
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

219
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,272
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

220
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,568
When we have matched our rackets
to these balls,

221
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,945
we will in France, by God's grace,

222
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:13,573
play a set shall strike his father's crown
into the hazard!

223
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,160
Tell him he hath made a match
with such a wrangler

224
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:20,622
that all the courts of France
will be disturbed with chases.

225
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:26,294
And we understand him well, how he comes
o'er us with our wilder days,

226
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:28,880
not measuring what use
we made of them.

227
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,884
But tell the Dauphin
we will keep our state,

228
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:36,053
be like a king,
and show our sail of greatness

229
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:39,223
when we do rouse us
in our throne of France.

230
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,351
And tell the pleasant prince

231
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:46,480
this mock of his
hath turned these balls to gunstones

232
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:48,649
and his soul shall stand sore charged

233
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,194
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them,

234
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:55,197
for many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

235
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,409
mock out of their dear husbands,
mock mothers from their sons,

236
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:04,038
mock castles down.
Ay, some are yet ungotten and unborn

237
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:07,667
that shall have cause to curse
the Dauphin's scorn.

238
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:13,256
But this lies all within the will of God, to
whom we do appeal and in whose name

239
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,634
tell you the Dauphin we are coming
on to venge us as we may,

240
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,637
and to put forth our rightful claim
in a well-hallowed cause,

241
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,930
so get you hence in peace.

242
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,682
And tell the Dauphin

243
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:27,394
his jest will savour but of shallow wit

244
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:32,566
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

245
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,570
Convey them with safe conduct.
Fare you well.

246
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:01,927
- This was a merry message.
- We hope to make the sender blush at it.

247
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,972
Therefore let our proportion for these wars
be soon collected,

248
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:07,932
and all things thought upon
that may with reasonable swiftness

249
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,726
add more feathers to our wings,

250
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:14,397
for, God before, we'll check this Dauphin
at his father's door.

and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.

Now thrive the armourers,
and honour's thought

255
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,966
reigns solely in the breast of every man.

256
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:45,636
They sell the pasture now
to buy the horse,

with winged heels, as English Mercuries.

and hides a sword from hilt
unto the point

with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets,

- Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

No, by my troth, not long,

by the prick of their needles

thinks't thou my spouse to get?

And there's enough. Go to.

00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:55,458
- Away, you rogue.
- Faith, he's very ill.

315
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:01,672
By my troth, the King
hath killed his heart.

316
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:08,261
Good husband, come home presently.

317
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:13,266
Come, shall I make you two friends?

318
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:15,393
We must to France together.

319
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:18,897
Why the devil should we keep knives
to cut one another's throats?

320
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:22,776
Let floods o'erswell
and fiends for food howl on.

321
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:26,488
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won off you at betting?

322
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,323
- Base is the slave that pays.
- (Laughter)

323
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,575
Now that will I have.
That's the humour of it.

324
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:34,578
As manhood shall compound.
Push home.

325
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:39,750
By this sword, he that
makes the first thrust, I'll kill him.

326
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:42,836
By this s-s-s-sword I will.

327
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:45,255
- "This s-s-s-s-sword".
- (Laughter)

328
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,674
And oaths must have their course.

329
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:53,471
Corporal Nym and thou wilt be friends,
be friends.

330
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:57,767
An thou wilt not, why then
be enemies of me too? Prithee, put up.

331
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,355
As ever you come of women,
come quickly to Sir John.

332
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:05,066
He's so shaked
of a burning contigion fever,

333
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,652
it's lamentable to behold.

334
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:10,613
Sweet men, come to him.

335
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:19,955
The King hath run bad humours
on the knight.

336
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:23,959
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fractured and corroborate.

337
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:27,504
The King is a good king,
but it must be as it may.

338
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:29,631
He passes some humours.

339
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,758
Let us condole the knight.

340
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:35,428
For, lambkins, we will live.

341
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,513
(Applause)

342
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,640
(Cheering)

343
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,039
Linger your patience on

344
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:09,711
and we'll digest the abuse of distance,
force a play.

345
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,006
The King is set from London

346
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:17,886
and the scene is now transported, gentles,
to Southampton.

347
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:22,682
There is the playhouse now,

348
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,017
there must you sit,

349
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,021
and thence to France
shall we convey you safe

350
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:32,858
and bring you back,
charming the narrow seas

351
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,985
to give you gentle pass.

352
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:38,906
But here, till then,

353
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:43,577
unto Southampton
do we change our scene.

354
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,871
(Priest sings Latin prayer)

355
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:06,140
(Congregation join in)

356
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:22,030
# Amen #

357
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:25,075
Now sits the wind fair.

358
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,747
Uncle of Exeter, set free
the man committed yesterday

359
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,831
that railed against our person.

360
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,918
We consider it was the heat of wine
that set him on,

361
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,504
and on his wiser thought we pardon him.

362
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:42,508
- That's mercy, but too much security.
- Let him be punished, sovereign,

363
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,177
lest example breed, by his sufferance,
more of such a kind.

364
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,638
O let us yet be merciful.

365
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,809
We doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way.

366
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,020
- Then forth, dear countrymen.
- (All cheer)

367
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,606
Let us deliver our puissance
into the hand of God,

368
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,942
putting it straight in expedition.

369
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,986
- Cheerly to sea.
- (All) Hurrah!

370
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,780
- The signs of war advance!
- Hurrah!

371
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,826
No King of England,
if not King of France!

372
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:25,757
(Chorus) Still be kind
and eke out our performance...

373
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,885
with your mind.

374
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:28,192
God save thy grace, King Hal.

375
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:32,863
My royal Hal. God save thee,
my sweet boy.

376
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:37,659
My King, my Jove,
I speak to thee my heart.

377
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:41,663
(Henry) I know thee not, old man.

378
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:43,999
Fall to thy prayers.

379
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:48,879
How ill white hairs become
a fool and jester.

380
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:52,006
I have long dreamed of
such a kind of man,

381
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,552
so surfeit-swelled,
so old and so profane.

382
00:32:56,595 --> 00:33:00,223
But being awaked,
I do despise my dream.

383
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:03,059
Reply not to me with a foolish jest,

384
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:06,354
presume not that I am the thing I was.

385
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:10,608
For God doth know,
so shall the world perceive

386
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:14,361
that I have turned away my former self,

387
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:17,948
so shall I those that kept me company.

388
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:10,665
Prithee, honey sweet husband,
let me bring thee to Staines.

389
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:15,378
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.

390
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:19,090
Bardolph, be blithe.
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.

391
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:21,800
Boy, bristle thy courage up.

392
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,263
For Falstaff he is dead,

393
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,348
and we must yearn therefore.

394
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:31,393
Well, Sir John is gone, God be with him.

395
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,146
Would I were with him,
wheresome'er he is,

396
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:36,857
either in heaven or in hell.

397
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,943
Nay, he's not in hell.

398
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,822
He's in Arthur's bosom,
if ever man went to Arthur's bosom.

399
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:50,828
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any christom child.

400
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:55,291
He parted e'en
just betwixt twelve and one,

401
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,461
e'en at the turning of the tide.

402
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:02,381
When I saw him fumble with the sheets,

403
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:06,844
play with flowers,
smile upon his finger ends,

404
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,137
I knew there was no way but one.

405
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:12,807
For his nose was as sharp as a pen.

406
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:16,728
And he babbled of green fields.

407
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:23,360
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.
"What, man, be of good cheer."

408
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:32,910
So he cried out, "Gone, gone, gone,"
three or four times.

409
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:38,082
Now I, to comfort him,
bid him he should not think on God.

410
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:42,753
I hoped there was no need to trouble
himself with any such thoughts yet.

411
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:47,383
So he bade me lay more clothes
on his feet.

412
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,929
I put my hand in the bed and felt them.

413
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:54,430
They were as cold as any stone.

414
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,851
Then I felt to his knees

415
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:01,271
and they were as cold as any stone.

416
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:07,402
And so... upwards... and upwards...

417
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,824
and all was cold as any stone.

418
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,787
They say he cried out for sack.

419
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,791
Ay, he did that.

420
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,127
- And for women.
- Ay.

421
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:29,298
- That he did not.
- Ay, that he did.

422
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,383
And he said they were devils incarnate.

423
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:34,011
He said once the devil would have him
about women.

424
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:39,473
He did in some sort, indeed,
handle women,

425
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:43,436
but then he was rheumatic.
He spoke of the Whore of Babylon.

426
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:47,273
Do you not remember,
he saw a flea stand on Bardolph's nose

427
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:49,942
and said it was a black soul
burning in hell-fire?

428
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:53,487
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

429
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:57,366
That's all the riches I got in his service.

430
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:01,995
Shall we go? The King will be gone
from Southampton.

431
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:04,080
Come, let us away.

432
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,416
My love, give me thy lips.

433
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:09,419
Look to my chattels and my movables.

434
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:11,838
Go, clear thy crystals.

435
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,300
Yoke-fellows in arms, let us to France.

436
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:20,972
Like horse-leeches my boys,
to suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.

437
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,185
Touch her soft lips, and part.

438
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,605
Farewell, hostess.

439
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:35,611
I cannot kiss, that's the humour of it,
but... adieu.

440
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:39,907
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close, I thee command.

441
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:57,090
Farewell, farewell, divine Zenocrate.

442
00:37:58,217 --> 00:38:03,888
Is it not passing brave to be a king
and ride in triumph through Persepolis?

443
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:31,081
(Chorus) Thus, with imagined wing,
our scene flies swift as that of thought.

444
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:36,043
Suppose that you have seen
the well-appointed King at Hampton Pier

445
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:38,629
embark his royalty and his brave fleet.

446
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:42,675
Play on your fancies, and in them behold

447
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:45,970
upon the hempen tackle
ship-boys climbing.

448
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:50,057
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give
to sounds confused.

449
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,062
Behold the threaden sails, borne with
the invisible and creeping wind,

450
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:57,981
draw the huge vessels
through the furrowed seas,

451
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,316
breasting the lofty surge.

452
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,236
O do but think you stand upon the shore,

453
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:08,700
and then behold a city
on the inconstant billows dancing,

454
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:11,536
holding due course to Harfleur.

455
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,418
Follow, follow, and leave your England,
as dead midnight still,

456
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:22,129
guarded with grandsires,
babies and old women.

457
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:26,633
For who is he, whose chin is but enriched
with one appearing hair,

458
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:31,972
that will not follow these culled
and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?

459
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:38,270
The French,
advised by good intelligence

460
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:41,023
of this most dreadful preparation,

461
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:43,232
shake in their fear,

462
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:48,070
and with pale policy,
seek to divert the English purposes.

463
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:26,316
Thus comes the English
with full power upon us.

464
00:40:27,235 --> 00:40:30,402
And more than carefully it us concerns

465
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:34,448
to answer royally in our defences.

466
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:38,494
Therefore you Dukes of Berri...

467
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,164
and of Bourbon,

468
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:45,459
Lord Constable and Orléans,

469
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:47,503
shall make forth.

470
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,714
And you, Prince Dauphin,

471
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,467
with all swift dispatch

472
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,721
to line and new-repair our towns of war

473
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:01,808
with men of... courage

474
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,062
and with means... defendant.

475
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,526
My most redoubted father,

476
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,570
it is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe,

477
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:18,782
and let us do it with no show of fear,
no, with no more than if we heard

478
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:22,369
that England were busied with
a Whitsun morris dance.

479
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:25,247
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,

480
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:30,210
so guided by a shallow, humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

481
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,588
O peace, Prince Dauphin.

482
00:41:34,716 --> 00:41:37,550
You are too much mistaken in this king.

483
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:40,219
Question, your grace,
our late ambassadors

484
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:42,388
with what great state
he heard their embassy,

485
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:44,765
how well supplied with aged counsellors,

486
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:47,226
how terrible in constant resolution.

487
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:50,062
Well, 'tis not so,
my Lord High Constable.

488
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:52,398
But though we think it so, it is no matter.

489
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:57,278
In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

490
00:41:57,321 --> 00:42:00,572
And he is bred out of that bloody strain

491
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:04,200
that haunted us in our familiar paths,

492
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:07,287
when Crécy battle fatally was struck,

493
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:14,127
and all our princes
captive by the hand of that black name,

494
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:18,256
Edward, Black Prince of Wales.

495
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:25,888
This is a stem of that victorious stock,

496
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,224
and let us fear the native mightiness...

497
00:42:30,644 --> 00:42:32,811
and fate of him.

498
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:34,897
(# Flourish)

499
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:39,193
Ambassadors from Harry,
King of England,

500
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:41,278
do crave admittance to Your Majesty.

501
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:44,782
We'll give them present audience.
Go and bring them.

502
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,547
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

503
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,300
and let them know
of what a monarchy you are the head.

504
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:09,513
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
as self-neglecting.

505
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,225
(# Fanfare)

506
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:30,617
From our brother England?

507
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,787
From him,
and thus he greets Your Majesty.

508
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,207
He wills you,
in the name of God Almighty,

509
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,960
that you divest yourself and lay apart

510
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:45,965
the borrowed glories that by gift of
heaven, by law of nature and of nations,

511
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,551
'longs to him and to his heirs,

512
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:51,345
namely the crown.

513
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:54,348
Willing you over-look this pedigree,

514
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:57,392
and when you find him evenly derived

515
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:02,439
from his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third,

516
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:06,526
he bids you
then resign your crown and kingdom,

517
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:10,363
indirectly held from him,

518
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:12,782
the native and true challenger.

519
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,870
If not, what follows?

520
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:19,621
Bloody constraint.

521
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:23,625
For if you hide the crown even in
your hearts, there will he rake for it.

522
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:27,421
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,

523
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,507
in thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,

524
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,010
that if requiring fail, he will compel.

525
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:38,307
This is his claim, his threatening,
and my message...

526
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,352
unless the Dauphin be in presence here,

527
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:45,730
to whom expressly I bring greeting too.

528
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:49,358
For us, we will consider of this further.

529
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:54,322
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
back to our brother England.

530
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:59,035
For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.

531
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:01,621
What to him from England?

532
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:12,005
Scorn and defiance,
slight regard, contempt,

533
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:17,469
and anything that may not misbecome
the mighty sender, doth he prize you at.

534
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:20,889
Thus says my King.

535
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:25,477
And if your father's highness do not,
in grant of all demands at large,

536
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,021
sweeten the bitter mock
you sent his majesty,

537
00:45:29,064 --> 00:45:32,775
he'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it.

538
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:37,822
Tomorrow shall you know our...
mind at full.

539
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:40,282
Dispatch us with all speed,

540
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:43,994
lest that our king come here himself
to question our delay.

541
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:51,459
(Chorus) Work, work your thoughts,

542
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:54,337
and therein see a siege!

543
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,756
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,

544
00:45:56,799 --> 00:46:00,343
with fatal mouths
gaping on girded Harfleur.

545
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:24,658
Once more... unto the breach,
dear friends, once more,

546
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,870
or close the wall up
with our English dead.

547
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:38,421
In peace
there's nothing so becomes a man

548
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,424
as modest stillness and humility.

549
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,676
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

550
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,512
then imitate the action of the tiger.

551
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,890
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

552
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:52,643
disguise fair nature
with hard-favoured rage.

553
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:54,687
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,

554
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,899
let it pry through the portage of the head
like a brass cannon.

555
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,859
Let the brow o'erwhelm it
as fearfully as doth a galled rock

556
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,111
o'er hang and jutty his confounded base,

557
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,572
swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.

558
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:08,825
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

559
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:12,913
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height.

560
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:17,626
On, on, you noblest English, whose blood is
fet from fathers of war-proof,

561
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,711
fathers that like so many Alexanders

562
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,463
have in these parts
from morn till even fought,

563
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,715
and sheathed their swords
for lack of argument.

564
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,675
Dishonour not your mothers.

565
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,887
Now attest that those whom you call fathers
did beget you.

566
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,097
Be copy now to men of grosser blood

567
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,516
and teach them how to war.

568
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,061
And you, good yeomen,
whose limbs were made in England,

569
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:39,146
show us here the mettle of your pasture.

570
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,774
Let us swear that
you are worth your breeding,

571
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,859
which I doubt not, for there is
none of you so mean and base

572
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:47,487
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes.

573
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:51,449
I see you stand like greyhounds
in the slips, straining upon the start.

574
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:54,410
The game's afoot. Follow your spirit,

575
00:47:54,453 --> 00:48:02,168
and upon this charge cry, "God for Harry,
England and Saint George!"

576
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:06,089
(Soldiers) God for Harry,
England and Saint George!

577
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:12,761
God for Harry, England
and Saint George!

578
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:17,683
On, on! To the breach! To the...

579
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:24,940
Pray thee corporal, stay.
The knocks are too hot.

580
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:27,693
Ah, knocks, they come and go,

581
00:48:27,735 --> 00:48:29,944
God's vassals drop and die,

582
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:33,906
and sword and shield, in bloody field,
both win immortal fame.

583
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,533
(Yells)

584
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:39,787
'Tis honour, and that's the truth of it.

585
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,914
Would I were in an alehouse in London.

586
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:44,792
I'd give all my fame for a pot of ale,
and safety.

587
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:47,962
God's plud! Up to the breach, you dogs!

588
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:50,256
Avaunt, you cullions!

589
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:54,134
Ah!

590
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:57,095
Ah! Be merciful, great duke,
to men of mould.

591
00:48:57,138 --> 00:49:01,141
Ah! Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage!

592
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,521
(Chorus) The nimble gunner
with linstock

593
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:08,273
now the devilish cannon touches.

594
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:12,277
And down goes all before it!

595
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:19,533
Captain Fluellen!

596
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:28,959
Captain Fluellen,
you must come presently to the mines.

597
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:31,712
The Duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

598
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:33,672
(Welsh accent) To the mines?

599
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:37,051
Tell you the duke
it is not so good to come to the mines.

600
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:40,303
For look you, the mines is not according to
the disciplines of war.

601
00:49:40,554 --> 00:49:42,597
The concavities of it is not sufficient.

602
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,767
For look you, the adversary, you may
discuss unto the duke, look you,

603
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:49,020
is digt himself
four yards under the countermines.

604
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,940
I think he will blow up all
if there is not better directions.

605
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:55,860
The Duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order of the siege is given,

606
00:49:55,903 --> 00:50:00,031
is altogether directed by an Irishman,
a very valiant gentleman, i'faith.

607
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:03,033
- Mm. It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
- I think it be.

608
00:50:03,076 --> 00:50:06,703
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
I will verify as much in his beard.

609
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:10,165
He has no more directions in the true
disciplines of the wars, look you,

610
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,043
of the Roman disciplines,
than is a puppy dog.

611
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,337
- (Laughs) Here he comes.
- Bah!

612
00:50:15,588 --> 00:50:18,090
And the Scots captain, Captain Jamy,
with him.

613
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:22,886
Ah! Captain Jamy is a marvellous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain,

614
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:25,888
of great expedition and knowledge
in the ancient wars.

615
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:28,057
I say good day, Captain Fluellen.

616
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,226
Good e'en to your worship,
good Captain James.

617
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,645
Good day. Put it there.

618
00:50:32,687 --> 00:50:37,108
Captain Jamy is a marvellous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

619
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,946
How now, Captain Macmorris,
have you quit the mines?

620
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:44,073
Have the pioneers given o'er?

621
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:47,201
(Irish accent) O, by the saints,
'tis ill done.

622
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:51,246
The work is give over,

Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,

629
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:13,767
will you vouchsafe me, look you,
a few disputations with you?

630
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,103
Partly to satisfy my opinion

631
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:19,940
and partly for the satisfaction,
look you, of my mind.

632
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:26,071
As touching the direction of the military
disciplines, that is the point.

633
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:30,075
It shall be very good, good faith,
good captains both.

634
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:32,828
And I would fain hear some discourse
between you twain.

635
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:37,248
This is no time to discourse,
so God save me.

636

No, the day is hot, and the weather and
the wars and the King and the dukes.

637
00:51:43,046 --> 00:51:45,673
This is no time to discourse.

And there is throats to be cut,
and work to be done,

645
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:07,319

take themselves to slumber,

for it, ay, or go to death.

And I'll pay it as valorously as I may.

That shall I surely do.
That is the brief and the long of it.

there is not many... of your nation.

00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:46,898
What is my nation?

655
00:52:46,941 --> 00:52:49,484

and a knave and a rascal?

Look you,

659
00:52:58,744 --> 00:53:02,330
if you take the matter otherwise
than is meant, Captain Macmorris,

660
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,916
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me with that affability

661

and in the derivation of my birth,
and other particularities.

664
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:17,928
I do not know you
as good a man as myself,

returns us word his powers are
not yet ready to raise so great a siege.

- Not so, I do beseech Your Majesty.
- Be patient, for you shall remain with us.

776
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:31,874
Now forth, Lord Constable,
and princes all,

777
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:35,795
and quickly bring us word
of England's fall.

778
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,681
(# Fanfare)

779
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,482
You know me by my habit.

780
01:02:57,525 --> 01:03:00,610
Well then, I know thee.
What shall I know of thee?

781
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:03,612
- My master's mind.
- Unfold it.

782
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,782
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

783
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,493
"though we seemed dead,
we did but slumber.

784
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,995
"Tell him we could have rebuked him
at Harfleur,

785
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,457
"but we thought not good
to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.

786
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,294
"Now we speak upon our cue,
and our voice is imperial.

787
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,381
"England shall repent his folly,
see his weakness,

788
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,049
"and admire our sufferance.

789
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:26,634
"Bid him therefore consider
of his ransom,

790
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,805
"which must proportion the losses we have
borne, the subjects we have lost,

791
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,849
"the disgrace we have digested.

792
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:36,811
"For our losses,
his exchequer is too poor.

793
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,062
"For the effusion of our blood,

794
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,648
"the muster of his kingdom
too faint a number.

795
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:44,610
"And for our disgrace,
his own person kneeling at our feet

796
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,487
"but a weak and worthless satisfaction.

797
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,658
"To this add defiance,
and tell him for conclusion

798
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:55,620
"he hath betrayed his followers,
whose condemnation is pronounced."

799
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:59,958
So far my King and master,
so much my office.

800
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:04,588
- What is thy name? I know thy quality.
- Mountjoy.

801
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:08,133
Thou dost thy office fairly.

802
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:11,427
Turn thee back and
tell thy king I do not seek him now,

803
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:15,097
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

804
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,685
For to say the sooth, my people
are with sickness much enfeebled,

805
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:22,855
my numbers lessened.

806
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:26,734
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am.

807
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:30,446
My ransom is this frail
and worthless body,

808
01:04:30,488 --> 01:04:33,032
my army but a weak and sickly guard.

809
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:35,617
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

810
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:39,078
though France herself and such another
neighbour is stood in our way.

811
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,540
If we may pass, we will.

812
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:47,462
If we be hindered, we shall your tawny
ground with your red blood discolour.

813
01:04:48,172 --> 01:04:51,424
And so, Mountjoy, fare you well.

814
01:04:52,176 --> 01:04:55,428
We would not seek a battle as we are,

815
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:58,722
nor as we are we say we will not shun it.

816
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,432
So tell your master.

817
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,601
I shall deliver so.

818
01:05:04,562 --> 01:05:07,648
- There's for thy labour, Mountjoy.
- Thanks to Your Highness.

819
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:14,905
- March to the bridge.
- The bridge!

820
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:18,158
It now draws toward night.

821
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:21,452
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves.

822
01:05:21,495 --> 01:05:24,038
And on the morrow
bid them march away.

823
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:30,461
(Slow drum beat)

824
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,437
(Chorus) Now entertain
conjecture of a time

825
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,650
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark

826
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:56,611
fills the wide vessel of the universe.

827
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:04,077
From camp to camp,
through the foul womb of night,

828
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,162
the hum of either army stilly sounds,

829
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:11,041
that the fixed sentinels almost receive

830
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:13,669
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

831
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,880
Fire answers fire,

832
01:06:16,923 --> 01:06:18,966
and through their paly flames

833
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:22,052
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

834
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:27,599
Steed threatens steed,
in high and boastful neighs

835
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:29,767
piercing the night's dull ear.

836
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:35,273
And from the tents the armourers,
accomplishing the knights,

837
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,984
with busy hammers closing rivets up,

838
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,237
give dreadful note of preparation.

839
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:47,994
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

840
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:53,123
the confident and over-lusty French
do the low-rated English play at dice,

841
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:57,210
and chide the cripple tardy-gaited night,

842
01:06:57,253 --> 01:07:02,758
who like a foul and ugly witch
doth limp so tediously away.

843
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:10,891
Tut, I have the best armour of the world.

844
01:07:13,977 --> 01:07:15,853
Would it were day.

845
01:07:15,896 --> 01:07:19,023
You have an excellent armour,
but let my horse have his due.

846
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:21,275
It is the best horse of Europe.

847
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:22,943
Hm.

848
01:07:22,986 --> 01:07:25,071
Will it never be morning?

849
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:28,866
My Lord of Orléans,
my Lord High Constable,

850
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:30,618
you talk of horse and armour?

851
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,579
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

852
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:38,041
What a long night is this.

853
01:07:39,627 --> 01:07:42,629
I will not change my horse
for any that treads on four hooves.

854
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:44,798
Ah ha! He bounds from the earth.

855
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,133
When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk.

856
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:50,345
He trots the air,
the earth sings when he touches it.

857
01:07:50,596 --> 01:07:53,723
He is of the colour of nutmeg
and of the heat of the ginger.

858
01:07:53,766 --> 01:07:56,601
He is pure air and fire,

859
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:59,853
and all other jades you may call beasts.

860
01:07:59,896 --> 01:08:03,607
It is indeed, my lord,
a most absolute and excellent... horse.

861
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:05,901
It is the prince of palfreys.

862
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:08,570
His neigh is like the bidding
of a monarch

863
01:08:08,613 --> 01:08:11,907
- and his countenance enforces homage.
- No more, cousin.

864
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,034
Nay, cousin, the man hath no wit

865
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:17,246
that cannot from the rising of the lark
to the lodging of the lamb

866
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:20,124
vary deserved praise on my palfrey.

867
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:23,376
I once writ a sonnet in his praise,
and began thus -

868
01:08:23,627 --> 01:08:25,795
"Wonder of nature..."

869
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:30,133
Ahem. I have heard a sonnet begin so
to one's mistress.

870
01:08:30,175 --> 01:08:33,344
Then did they imitate
that which I composed to my courser,

871
01:08:33,387 --> 01:08:35,638
for my horse is my mistress.

872
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:39,976
Methought yesterday
your mistress shrewdly shook your back.

873
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:45,273
My Lord Constable, the armour
that I see in your tent tonight,

874
01:08:45,315 --> 01:08:48,108
are those stars or suns upon it?

875
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:51,862
- Stars, my lord.
- Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.

876
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:56,950
That may be.

877
01:08:56,993 --> 01:08:59,327
Will it never be day?

878
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:05,000
I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way
shall be paved with English faces.

879
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,171
Who will go hazard with me
for 20 prisoners?

880
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:12,173
(Trumpet sounds)

881
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,759
'Tis midnight.

882
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,887
I'll go arm myself.

883
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:22,975
The Dauphin longs for morning.

884
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:27,396
Hm.

885
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:31,442
He longs to eat the English.

886
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,694
I think he will eat all he kills.

887
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:38,698
Ho-ho, he never did harm that I heard of.

888
01:09:38,782 --> 01:09:41,201
Nor will do none tomorrow.
He'll keep that good name still.

889
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,827
I know him to be valiant.

890
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:45,163
I was told that by one that knows him
better than you.

891
01:09:45,206 --> 01:09:47,332
- What's he?
- Marry, he told me so himself.

892
01:09:47,374 --> 01:09:49,834
And he said he cared not who knew it.

893
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:55,380
My Lord High Constable, the English
lie within 1500 paces of your tents.

894
01:09:56,257 --> 01:09:58,425
Who hath measured the ground?

895
01:09:58,468 --> 01:10:00,761
The Lord Grandpré.

896
01:10:00,803 --> 01:10:03,055
A valiant and most expert gentleman.

897
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,773
Would it were day.

898
01:10:12,815 --> 01:10:14,900
(Trumpet sounds)

899
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:17,985
Alas, poor Harry of England.

900
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:20,905
He longs not for the dawning as we do.

901
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:34,794
Huh. What a wretched and peevish fellow
is this King of England,

902
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:38,714
to mope with his fat-brained followers
so far out of his knowledge.

903
01:10:38,757 --> 01:10:41,508
If the English had any apprehension,
they would run away.

904
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:44,469
That they lack, for if their heads
had any intellectual armour

905
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:46,930
they could never wear
such heavy headpieces.

906
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:49,099
(Both chuckle)

907
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:53,395
That island of England
breeds very valiant creatures.

908
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:56,273
Their mastiffs are
of unmatchable courage.

909
01:10:56,315 --> 01:10:59,943
Foolish curs, that run winking
into the mouth of a Russian bear

910
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:02,487
and have their heads crushed
like rotten apples.

911
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,073
You may as well say,
"That's a valiant flea

912
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:08,450
"that dare eat his breakfast
on the lip of a lion."

913
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:11,912
Just. Just. And the men
are like the mastiffs.

914
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:15,207
Give them great meals
of beef and iron and steel,

915
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,501
they'll eat like wolves
and fight like devils.

916
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:20,087
But these English
are shrewdly out of beef.

917
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:23,048
Hm. Then shall we find tomorrow

918
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:25,426
they've only stomachs to eat
and none to fight.

919
01:11:25,468 --> 01:11:27,552
(Trumpet sounds)

920
01:11:30,889 --> 01:11:34,309
Hm. Now is it time to arm.

921
01:11:35,519 --> 01:11:38,396
Come. Shall we about it?

922
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:40,523
It is now two o'clock.

923
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:45,320
But let me see - by ten, we shall have each
a hundred Englishmen.

924
01:11:55,872 --> 01:11:58,165
(Chorus) The country cocks do crow,

925
01:11:58,249 --> 01:12:00,500
the clocks do toll

926
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:04,171
and the third hour
of drowsy morning name.

927
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:13,262
The poor, condemned English,
like sacrifices,

928
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:16,474
by their watchful fires sit patiently

929
01:12:16,516 --> 01:12:19,602
and inly ruminate the morning's danger.

930
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,524
And their gesture sad, investing
lank, lean cheeks and war-worn coats,

931
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:29,528
presenteth them unto the gazing moon

932
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:31,989
so many horrid ghosts.

933
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:36,368
O now,

934
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:40,455
who will behold the royal captain
of this ruined band

935
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:44,167
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent,

936
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:48,380
let him cry, "Praise and glory
on his head."

937
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:53,009
For forth he goes and visits all his host,

938
01:12:53,052 --> 01:12:55,595
bids them good morrow
with a modest smile

939
01:12:55,638 --> 01:13:00,265
and calls them brothers, friends
and countrymen.

940
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:05,604
A largesse universal, like the sun,

941
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,358
his liberal eye doth give to everyone,

942
01:13:09,401 --> 01:13:13,487
thawing cold fear,
that mean and gentle all

943
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,324
behold, as may unworthiness define,

944
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:22,537
a little touch of Harry in the night.

945
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:26,124
(# Trumpet flourish)

946
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:36,384
Gloucester, 'tis true
that we are in great danger.

947
01:13:37,177 --> 01:13:40,179
The greater therefore
should our courage be.

948
01:13:40,264 --> 01:13:42,640
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.

949
01:13:42,683 --> 01:13:45,267
A good, soft pillow
for that good, white head

950
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:47,394
were better than a churlish turf
of France.

951
01:13:47,437 --> 01:13:50,397
Not so, my liege.
This lodging suits me better,

952
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,066
since I may say, "Now lie I like a king."

953
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:54,901
(All laugh)

954
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:57,028
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

955
01:13:59,657 --> 01:14:02,409
I and my bosom must debate awhile,

956
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:04,703
and then I would no other company.

957
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:08,497
The Lord in heaven bless thee,
noble Harry.

958
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:13,294
God-a-mercy, old heart.

959
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:32,270
Qui va là?

960
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:35,732
A friend.

961
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:41,488
Discuss unto me - art thou officer?

962
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:46,117
Or art thou base, common and popular?

963
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,203
I am a gentleman of a company.

964
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:50,330
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?

965
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:54,333
- Even so. What are you?
- As good a gentleman as the emperor.

966
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,127
- Then you are better than the King.
- Ah.

967
01:14:57,170 --> 01:15:00,172
The King's a bawcock
and a heart-of-gold,

968
01:15:00,215 --> 01:15:03,175
a lad of life, an imp of fame,

969
01:15:03,218 --> 01:15:07,095
of parents good, of fist most valiant.

970
01:15:07,138 --> 01:15:12,518
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring
I love the lovely bully.

971
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:19,649
- What is thy name?
- Henry le roi.

972
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:23,194
Leroi? A Cornish name.
Art thou of Cornish crew?

973
01:15:23,237 --> 01:15:25,404
No, I'm a Welshman.

974
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:28,449
- Know'st thou Fluellen?
- Yes.

975
01:15:28,492 --> 01:15:31,494
- Art thou his friend?
- Ay, and his kinsman, too.

976
01:15:31,537 --> 01:15:35,331
Well, tell him I'll knock his leek
about his head upon Saint Davy's day.

977
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:40,335
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

978
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:44,381
- A figo for thee, then.
- I thank you. God be with you.

979
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:48,635
My name is Pistol called.

980
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:51,054
It sorts well with your fierceness.

981
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:25,378
Captain Fluellen?

982
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,186
- Captain Fluellen?
- Shh! Shh!

983
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:44,772
In the name of Beelzebub, speak lower.

984
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:51,528
If you will take the pains but to examine
the wars of Pompey the Great,

985
01:16:51,571 --> 01:16:53,447
you shall find, I warrant you,

986
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:57,200
there is no tittle-tattle nor pibble-pabble
in Pompey's camp.

987
01:16:57,243 --> 01:17:01,413
I warrant you shall find the ceremonies
of the wars, and the cares of it,

988
01:17:01,456 --> 01:17:03,540
and the forms of it, to be otherwise.

989
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,876
Why, the enemy is loud.
You can hear him all night.

990
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:10,421
If the enemy is an ass
and a fool and a prating coxcomb,

991
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:13,174
is it meet, think you,
that we should also, look you,

992
01:17:13,216 --> 01:17:15,718
be an ass (Shouts) and a fool
and a prating coxcomb?

993
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:18,888
- Shh.
- In your own conscience now?

994
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,389
I will speak lower.

995
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:23,142
I pray you and beseech you that you will.

996
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,108
(Henry) Though it appear
a little out of fashion,

997
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:33,818
there is much care and valour
in this Welshman.

998
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:47,332
Brother John Bates, be not that
the morning which breaks yonder?

999
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:52,212
I think it be. But we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

1000
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:54,589
We see yonder the beginning of the day,

1001
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:57,257
but I think we shall never see
the end of it.

1002
01:17:59,844 --> 01:18:02,262
Who goes there?

1003
01:18:03,515 --> 01:18:05,599
A friend.

1004
01:18:07,686 --> 01:18:09,853
Under what captain serve you?

1005
01:18:09,896 --> 01:18:12,523
Under... Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1006
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:17,361
Oh. A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

1007
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,864
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?

1008
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:24,659
Even as men wrecked upon a sand,

1009
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:26,911
that look to be washed off the next tide.

1010
01:18:28,205 --> 01:18:30,957
He hath not told his thought to the King?

1011
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,335
No. Nor it is not meet he should.

1012
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:37,797
For I think the King is but a man, as I am.

1013
01:18:39,425 --> 01:18:42,259
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.

1014
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:47,431
His ceremonies laid by,
in his nakedness he appears but a man.

1015
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:52,811
Therefore, when he sees
reasons of fears, as we do,

1016
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:56,523
his fears, without doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

1017
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,860
Yet no man should find in him
any appearance of fear,

1018
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:03,488
lest he, by showing it,
should dishearten his army.

1019
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:10,202
He may show what outward courage he will,
but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis,

1020
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,329
he'd wish himself in Thames
up to the neck.

1021
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,792
So I would he were, and I by him,
at all adventures, so we were quit here.

1022
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:20,629
By my troth, I will speak
my conscience of the King.

1023
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:24,967
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere... but where he is.

1024
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,470
Then I would he were here alone.

1025
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:31,306
So should he be sure to be ransomed,
and a many poor men's lives saved.

1026
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:38,897
Methinks... I would not die anywhere
so contented as in the King's company,

1027
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:44,527
his cause being just
and his quarrel honourable.

1028
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,947
It's more than we know.

1029
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,991
Ay.

1030
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:53,494
Or more than we should seek after.

1031
01:19:53,536 --> 01:19:56,997
For we know enough
if we know we are the King's subjects.

1032
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,874
If his cause be wrong,

1033
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:02,544
our obedience to the King
wipes the crime of it out of us.

1034
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:05,380
But if the cause be not good,

1035
01:20:05,423 --> 01:20:08,801
the King himself
hath a heavy reckoning to make,

1036
01:20:09,385 --> 01:20:15,640
when all those legs and arms
and heads... chopped off in a battle

1037
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:19,727
shall join together at the latter day,

1038
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,940
and cry all, "We died at such a place,"

1039
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,570
some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

1040
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:32,573
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

1041
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:35,827
some upon the debts they owe,

1042
01:20:36,662 --> 01:20:39,704
some upon their children rawly left.

1043
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:45,585
I'm afraid there are few die well
that die in a battle,

1044
01:20:46,546 --> 01:20:50,382
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything,

1045
01:20:50,424 --> 01:20:52,801
when blood is their argument?

1046
01:20:52,844 --> 01:20:56,680
Now, if these men do not die well,

1047
01:20:58,015 --> 01:21:01,642
it'll be a black matter
for the King that led them to it.

1048
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:09,900
Ay.

1049
01:21:11,653 --> 01:21:16,532
So, if a son that is by his father
sent upon merchandise

1050
01:21:16,575 --> 01:21:19,618
do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,

1051
01:21:19,661 --> 01:21:21,996
the imputation of his wickedness,
by your rule,

1052
01:21:22,038 --> 01:21:25,081
should be imposed upon his father,
that sent him.

1053
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,459
But this is not so.

1054
01:21:29,128 --> 01:21:33,423
The King is not bound to answer for
the particular endings of his soldiers,

1055
01:21:33,465 --> 01:21:35,508
nor the father of his son,

1056
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:39,137
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

1057
01:21:40,097 --> 01:21:43,057
Every subject's duty is the King's,

1058
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,893
but every subject's soul is his own.

1059
01:21:46,728 --> 01:21:51,148
'Tis certain. Every man that dies ill,
the ill's on his own head.

1060
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:53,358
The King's not to answer for it.

1061
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:56,653
I do not desire he should answer for me,

1062
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:59,740
and yet I determine to fight lustily
for him.

1063
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:05,787
I myself heard the King say
he would not be ransomed.

1064
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,873
(Laughing) He said so
to make us fight cheerfully,

1065
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:12,585
for when our throats are cut, he
may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser.

1066
01:22:13,837 --> 01:22:17,131
If ever I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

1067
01:22:17,174 --> 01:22:19,467
(Laughs)

1068
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:21,594
That's a perilous shot out of a pop-gun,

1069
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:25,181
that a poor and private displeasure
can do against a monarch.

1070
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:27,600
You may as well
go about to turn the sun to ice

1071
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:30,811
with fanning in its face
with a peacock's feather.

1072
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,480
You'll never trust his word after.

1073
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:36,691
- Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
- Your reproof is something too round.

1074
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:39,152
I should be angry with you
if the time were convenient.

1075
01:22:39,195 --> 01:22:41,613
Let it be a quarrel between us, then,
if you live.

1076
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:44,908
- (Trumpet)
- Be friends, you English fools.

1077
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:48,954
We have French quarrels enough
if you could tell how to reckon.

1078
01:22:49,872 --> 01:22:52,165
(Muttering) Never trust in his word, I say.

1079
01:22:59,756 --> 01:23:01,966
(Henry) Upon the King.

1080
01:23:03,635 --> 01:23:06,845
Let us our lives, our souls,

1081
01:23:06,888 --> 01:23:10,766
our debts, our careful wives,

1082
01:23:10,809 --> 01:23:14,812
our children... and our sins

1083
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:17,689
lay on the King.

1084
01:23:18,816 --> 01:23:21,484
We must bear all.

1085
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:25,113
What infinite heartsease
must kings forego

1086
01:23:25,155 --> 01:23:27,824
that private men enjoy?

1087
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:32,662
And what have kings
that privates have not too,

1088
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:35,164
save ceremony?

1089
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:41,003
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony,

1090
01:23:41,045 --> 01:23:43,755
that sufferest more of mortal griefs

1091
01:23:43,798 --> 01:23:46,091
than do thy worshippers?

1092
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:51,722
What drink'st thou oft,
instead of homage sweet,

1093
01:23:52,682 --> 01:23:55,017
but poisoned flattery?

1094
01:23:56,519 --> 01:24:01,273
O be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

1095
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:07,278
Canst thou, when thou command'st
the beggar's knee,

1096
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:09,864
command the health of it?

1097
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:16,287
No, thou proud dream that
play'st so subtly with a king's repose.

1098
01:24:17,289 --> 01:24:20,708
I am a king that find thee,

1099
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:25,963
and I know 'tis not the orb and sceptre,

1100
01:24:26,006 --> 01:24:29,674
crown imperial, the throne he sits on,

1101
01:24:29,717 --> 01:24:34,012
nor the tide of pomp that
beats upon the high shore of this world.

1102
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:38,892
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,

1103
01:24:39,643 --> 01:24:44,898
can sleep so soundly
as the wretched slave

1104
01:24:46,317 --> 01:24:50,611
who, with a body filled and vacant mind,

1105
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:52,988
gets him to rest,

1106
01:24:53,031 --> 01:24:55,741
crammed with distressful bread.

1107
01:24:57,077 --> 01:25:00,329
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,

1108
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:04,958
but like a lackey from the rise to set

1109
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:07,753
sweats in the eye of Phoebus,

1110
01:25:08,296 --> 01:25:12,215
and all night sleeps in Elysium.

1111
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:18,679
Next day, after dawn doth rise and
help Hyperion to his horse,

01:25:19,098 --> 01:25:22,850
and follows so the ever-running year

with profitable labour to his grave.

1114
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:31,234
And but for ceremony, such a wretch,

1115
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:35,612
winding up days with toil
and nights with sleep,

1116

The King himself
is rode to view their battle.

they have full threescore thousand.

then joyfully, my noble Westmoreland,
my dear Lord Gloucester,

my good Lord Exeter and
my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu.

Farewell, good Salisbury,
and good luck go with thee.

1164
01:30:24,306 --> 01:30:26,307
Farewell, kind lord.

1165
01:30:29,436 --> 01:30:31,354
O that we now had here
but one ten thousand

1166
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,189
of those men in England
that do not work today.

1167
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:38,318
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?

1168
01:30:38,444 --> 01:30:42,489
No, my fair cousin.
If we are marked to die,

1169
01:30:42,615 --> 01:30:44,950
we are enough to do our country loss,

1170
01:30:45,076 --> 01:30:49,287
and if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honour.

1171
01:30:49,413 --> 01:30:52,999
God's will, I pray thee
wish not one man more.

1172
01:30:53,543 --> 01:30:55,794
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland,
through my host

1173
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,338
that he which hath no stomach
to this feast, let him depart.

1174
01:30:59,464 --> 01:31:03,884
His passport shall be drawn and
crowns for convoy put into his purse.

1175
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:09,056
We would not die in that man's company
that fears his fellowship to die with us.

1176
01:31:18,608 --> 01:31:22,902
This day is called the Feast of Crispian.

1177
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:25,822
He that outlives this day
and comes safe home

1178
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:28,491
will stand a-tiptoe
when this day is named

1179
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:32,370
and rouse him at the name of Crispian.

1180
01:31:32,496 --> 01:31:35,498
He that shall live this day
and see old age

1181
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:40,336
will yearly, on the vigil,
feast his neighbours and say,

1182
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:43,338
"Tomorrow is Saint Crispian."

1183
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:47,926
Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars and say,

1184
01:31:48,052 --> 01:31:51,680
"These wounds I had on Crispin's Day."

1185
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:53,557
Old men forget.

1186
01:31:53,683 --> 01:31:58,020
Yet all shall be forgot,
but he'll remember, with advantages,

1187
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:00,564
what feats he did that day.

1188
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:04,693
Then shall our names, familiar
in his mouth as household words -

1189
01:32:04,818 --> 01:32:07,486
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,

1190
01:32:07,613 --> 01:32:10,531
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester -

1191
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:14,076
be in their flowing cups
freshly remembered.

1192
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:17,580
This story
shall the good man teach his son,

1193
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:20,541
and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by

1194
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:23,586
from this day to the ending of the world

1195
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:26,714
but we in it shall be remembered.

1196
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:30,717
We few, we happy few,

1197
01:32:30,843 --> 01:32:33,053
we band of brothers.

1198
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:35,305
For he today
that sheds his blood with me

1199
01:32:35,431 --> 01:32:38,225
shall be my brother, be he ne'er so base.

1200
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:40,769
And gentlemen in England now abed

1201
01:32:40,895 --> 01:32:44,147
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here,

1202
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:47,776
and hold their manhoods cheap
whiles any speaks

1203
01:32:47,902 --> 01:32:52,529
that fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's Day!

1204
01:32:52,656 --> 01:32:56,408
- (Cheering)
- My lord, bestow yourself with speed.

1205
01:32:56,534 --> 01:32:58,244
The French are bravely
in their battles set

1206
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:59,703
and will with all expedience
charge on us.

1207
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:01,705
All things are ready if our minds be so.

1208
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:03,666
Perish the man
whose mind is backward now.

1209
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:06,085
Thou dost not wish more help
from England, coz?

1210
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:09,588
God's will, my liege, would you and I alone
could fight this battle out.

1211
01:33:09,714 --> 01:33:11,799
You know your places.
God be with you all!

1212
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:14,707
Once more I come to know thee,
King Harry.

1213
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:17,502
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound

1214
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,004
before thy most assured overthrow.

1215
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:25,760
- Who hath sent thee now?
- The Constable of France.

1216
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:30,181
I pray thee bear my former answer back.

1217
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:33,850
Bid them achieve me,
and then sell my bones.

1218
01:35:33,976 --> 01:35:36,812
Good God, why should they mock
poor fellows thus?

1219
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:40,065
The man that once did sell the lion's skin
while the beast lived,

1220
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:41,900
was killed with hunting him.

1221
01:35:42,902 --> 01:35:46,029
A many of our bodies
shall no doubt find native graves,

1222
01:35:46,155 --> 01:35:50,242
upon the which, I trust, shall witness
live in brass of this day's work.

1223
01:35:50,368 --> 01:35:54,079
And those that leave their valiant bones
in France, dying like men,

1224
01:35:54,204 --> 01:35:57,706
though buried in your dunghills
they shall be famed.

1225
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:59,959
For there the sun shall greet them

1226
01:36:00,085 --> 01:36:02,711
and draw their honours
reeking up to heaven,

1227
01:36:02,838 --> 01:36:05,256
leaving their earthly parts
to choke your clime,

1228
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:08,717
the smell whereof
shall breed a plague in France.

1229
01:36:10,846 --> 01:36:12,763
Let me speak proudly.

1230
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:16,016
Tell the Constable
we are but warriors for the working day.

1231
01:36:16,143 --> 01:36:18,601
Our gayness and our gilt
are all besmirched

1232
01:36:18,727 --> 01:36:20,937
with rainy marching in the painful field.

1233
01:36:21,063 --> 01:36:23,898
And time hath worn us into slovenry.

1234
01:36:24,024 --> 01:36:26,651
But by the mass,
our hearts are in the trim.

1235
01:36:26,777 --> 01:36:27,819
(Men) Hooray!

1236
01:36:27,945 --> 01:36:30,029
Come now no more for ransom,
gentle herald.

1237
01:36:30,156 --> 01:36:32,699
They shall have none, I swear,
but these my bones,

1238
01:36:32,825 --> 01:36:34,784
which if they have
as I will leave 'em them,

1239
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:37,620
shall yield them little. Tell the Constable.

1240
01:36:37,746 --> 01:36:40,747
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well.

1241
01:36:45,795 --> 01:36:48,881
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.

1242
01:36:52,051 --> 01:36:54,470
Now, soldiers, march away.

1243
01:36:54,596 --> 01:36:57,681
And how thou pleasest, God,
dispose the day.

1244
01:39:32,663 --> 01:39:33,830
(Shouting)

1245
01:39:38,961 --> 01:39:40,170
(Neighing)

1246
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:18,164
(Yelling)

1247
01:41:42,495 --> 01:41:45,205
Well have we done,
thrice-valiant countrymen!

1248
01:41:45,331 --> 01:41:48,959
But all's not done -
yet keep the French the field.

1249
01:41:49,085 --> 01:41:50,419
(Yelling)

1250
01:42:17,404 --> 01:42:20,239
O everlasting shame!
Let's stab ourselves.

1251
01:42:20,365 --> 01:42:22,283
Be these the wretches
that we played at dice for?

1252
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,118
Is this the king we sent to
for his ransom?

1253
01:42:24,243 --> 01:42:27,621
Shame on thee, Colonel, shame.
Nothing but shame. Let's die in honour.

1254
01:42:27,747 --> 01:42:30,499
- Once more back again.
- We are enough yet living in the field

1255
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:33,418
to smother up the English
if any order might be thought upon.

1256
01:42:33,544 --> 01:42:35,504
The devil take order now.
I'll to the throng.

1257
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:38,548
Let life be short,
else shame will be too long.

1258
01:44:24,025 --> 01:44:25,358
(Weeps)

1259
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,653
Odd's blood.

1260
01:44:28,779 --> 01:44:31,656
Kill the boys and the luggage!

1261
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:37,495
'Tis expressly against the law of arms!

1262
01:44:39,415 --> 01:44:43,542
'Tis as arrant a piece of knavery,
mark you now, as can be offered.

1263
01:44:43,668 --> 01:44:46,086
In your conscience now, is it not?

1264
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:50,090
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.

1265
01:44:50,216 --> 01:44:53,302
The cowardly rascals that ran
from the battle ha' done this slaughter.

1266
01:44:53,428 --> 01:44:55,220
Here comes His Majesty.

1267
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:11,027
I was not angry since I came to France...

1268
01:45:12,112 --> 01:45:14,030
until this instant.

1269
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:26,084
(Shouting)

1270
01:46:10,919 --> 01:46:12,378
(Cheering)

1271
01:46:34,525 --> 01:46:37,609
Take a trumpet, herald. Ride thou
unto the horsemen on yonder hill.

1272
01:46:37,736 --> 01:46:40,446
If they won't fight with us,
bid them come down, or void the field.

1273
01:46:40,572 --> 01:46:42,448
They do offend our sight!

1274
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,835
Here comes the herald of the French,
my liege.

1275
01:47:09,349 --> 01:47:12,560
His eyes are humbler
than they used to be.

1276
01:47:12,686 --> 01:47:14,270
God's will.

1277
01:47:14,396 --> 01:47:16,481
What means this, herald?

1278
01:47:16,607 --> 01:47:18,733
Comest thou again for ransom?

1279
01:47:25,114 --> 01:47:29,451
No, great King. I come to thee
for charitable licence,

1280
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:33,288
that we may wander o'er this bloody field

1281
01:47:33,414 --> 01:47:37,375
to book our dead and then to bury them.

1282
01:47:38,711 --> 01:47:40,420
The day is yours.

1283
01:47:43,466 --> 01:47:47,885
Praised be God,
and not our strength, for it.

1284
01:47:57,813 --> 01:48:00,773
What is this castle called
that stands hard by?

1285
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,652
We call it Agincourt.

1286
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:10,740
Then... call we this the field of Agincourt,

1287
01:48:11,534 --> 01:48:14,828
fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

1288
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:25,588
# Our King went forth to Normandy

1289
01:48:25,714 --> 01:48:31,010
# With grace and might of chivalry

1290
01:48:31,136 --> 01:48:36,640
# There God for him
wrought marvellously

1291
01:48:36,766 --> 01:48:39,852
# Wherefore England... #

1292
01:48:47,944 --> 01:48:50,737
Here is the number
of the slaughtered French.

1293
01:48:55,909 --> 01:49:00,121
This note doth tell me of ten thousand
French that in the field lie slain.

1294
01:49:00,247 --> 01:49:02,790
Where is the number of our English dead?

1295
01:49:09,006 --> 01:49:13,092
Edward, the Duke of York.
The Earl of Suffolk.

1296
01:49:14,636 --> 01:49:16,345
Sir Richard Ketly.

1297
01:49:17,555 --> 01:49:19,806
Davy Gam Esquire.

1298
01:49:21,475 --> 01:49:26,479
And of all other men...
but five-and-twenty score.

1299
01:49:29,108 --> 01:49:31,443
O God, thy arm was here.

1300
01:49:32,028 --> 01:49:34,571
- 'Tis wonderful.
- Come.

1301
01:49:34,697 --> 01:49:37,365
Go we in procession to the village.

1302
01:49:37,491 --> 01:49:41,035
Let there be sung
Non Nobis and Te Deum,

1303
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:44,788
- the dead with charity enclosed in clay.
- # Non nobis dominum... #

1304
01:49:44,915 --> 01:49:47,166
And then to Calais!

1305
01:49:48,501 --> 01:49:50,669
And to England then,

1306
01:49:51,588 --> 01:49:56,842
where ne'er from France arrived
more happier men.

1307
01:49:56,968 --> 01:50:00,804
# Tuo da Gloriam

1308
01:50:00,931 --> 01:50:08,394
# Non nobis, Domine
# Sed nomine, tuo da Gloriam

1309
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:17,570
# Te Deum laudamus

1310
01:50:17,696 --> 01:50:25,495
# Te Dominum confitemur

1311
01:50:25,621 --> 01:50:32,626
# Te aeternum Patrem

1312
01:50:32,752 --> 01:50:44,054
# Omnis terra veneratur #

1313
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:52,353
(Bells peal)

1314
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,743
(Man laughing)

1315
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:16,376
(Choir sings)

1316
01:51:36,396 --> 01:51:38,272
(Laughs)

1317
01:51:41,067 --> 01:51:43,944
Nay, that's right.
But why wear you your leek today?

1318
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:45,988
Saint Davy's day is past.

1319
01:51:46,114 --> 01:51:50,993
There is occasions and causes why and
wherefore in all things, Captain Gower.

1320
01:51:53,455 --> 01:51:56,540
I will tell you, as my friend,
Captain Gower.

1321
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:59,876
The rascally, beggarly,
lousy knave, Pistol,

1322
01:52:00,002 --> 01:52:02,587
which you and yourself and all the world

1323
01:52:02,713 --> 01:52:05,590
know to be no better than a fellow,
look you, of no merits -

1324
01:52:05,716 --> 01:52:08,634
he is come to me and bring me
bread and salt yesterday, look you,

1325
01:52:08,761 --> 01:52:10,636
and bid me eat my leek.

1326
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:15,475
It was in a place where I could not breed
no contention with him,

1327
01:52:15,601 --> 01:52:19,437
but I will be so bold as wear it in my cap
till I see him once again.

1328
01:52:19,563 --> 01:52:22,814
And then I will tell him
a little piece of my desires.

1329
01:52:23,941 --> 01:52:26,068
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue,

1330
01:52:26,194 --> 01:52:29,988
that now and then goes to the wars to
grace himself at his returning to London

1331
01:52:30,114 --> 01:52:32,449
under the form of a soldier.

1332
01:52:32,575 --> 01:52:33,950
And what such as the camp can do

1333
01:52:34,077 --> 01:52:36,703
among foaming bottles
and ale-washed wits

1334
01:52:36,829 --> 01:52:38,997
is wonderful to be thought of.

1335
01:52:40,124 --> 01:52:43,251
Here he comes,
swelling like a turkey-cock.

1336
01:52:44,294 --> 01:52:48,214
'Tis no matter for his swellings,
nor his turkey-cocks.

1337
01:52:49,841 --> 01:52:53,052
God bless you, Pistol,
you scurvy, lousy knave.

1338
01:52:53,178 --> 01:52:56,055
- God bless you.
- Hah! Art thou bedlam?

1339
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:59,433
Hence! I am qualmish
at the smell of leek.

1340
01:52:59,559 --> 01:53:04,688
I beseech you heartily, scurvy,
lousy knave, to eat, look you, this leek.

1341
01:53:04,815 --> 01:53:08,608
Eugh. Not for Cadwallader
and all his goats.

1342
01:53:08,734 --> 01:53:11,861
There is one goat for you.
Will you be so good as eat it?

1343
01:53:12,905 --> 01:53:15,698
Base Trojan! Thou shalt die.

1344
01:53:15,825 --> 01:53:19,744
- You say very true when God's will is.
- (Cries out)

1345
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:23,540
I will desire you to live in the meantime,
and eat your victuals.

1346
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:26,000
- Come, there is sauce for it.
- (Yells)

1347
01:53:26,127 --> 01:53:28,586
If you can mock a leek,
you can eat a leek.

1348
01:53:28,712 --> 01:53:31,755
- Bite, I pray you.
- Must I bite?

1349
01:53:31,881 --> 01:53:34,049
Out of doubt and out of question, too.

1350
01:53:34,968 --> 01:53:38,220
By this leek,
I will most horribly revenge...

1351
01:53:38,972 --> 01:53:40,931
I eat. I eat...

1352
01:53:41,057 --> 01:53:45,769
- (Spluttering) I swear...
- Nay, pray you, throw none away.

1353
01:53:45,895 --> 01:53:48,439
The skin is good for
your broken coxcomb.

1354
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,774
When you take occasions
to see leeks hereafter,

1355
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,775
I pray you mock at 'em, that is all.

1356
01:53:52,901 --> 01:53:55,027
- Good.
- Ay, leeks is good.

1357
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,407
Hold you, here is a penny
to heal your head.

1358
01:53:59,533 --> 01:54:01,284
- Me, a penny?
- Yes, verily.

1359
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:05,913
In truth you shall take it or I have another
leek in my pocket which you shall eat.

1360
01:54:06,039 --> 01:54:09,125
God b'wi' you and keep you and...
heal your head.

1361
01:54:11,628 --> 01:54:12,920
Brrrrr!

1362
01:54:14,173 --> 01:54:16,882
All hell shall stir for this.

1363
01:54:17,008 --> 01:54:20,135
Go to. You are a counterfeit,
cowardly knave.

1364
01:54:20,261 --> 01:54:23,305
You thought, because he could not
speak English in the native garb,

1365
01:54:23,431 --> 01:54:26,933
that he therefore could not handle an
English cudgel. But you find it otherwise.

1366
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:32,314
And henceforth, let a Welsh correction
teach you a good English condition.

1367
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,733
- Fare ye well.
- (Coin clinks)

1368
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:36,568
(Knight laughs)

1369
01:54:48,413 --> 01:54:51,957
Doth fortune
play the strumpet with me now?

1370
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:58,506
News have I that my Nell lies dead
in the hospital,

1371
01:54:58,632 --> 01:55:00,299
of the malady of France.

1372
01:55:01,634 --> 01:55:04,928
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.

1373
01:55:05,054 --> 01:55:10,767
Old do I wax, and from my weary limbs
honour is cudgelled.

1374
01:55:12,311 --> 01:55:16,523
Well... bawd I'll turn,

1375
01:55:16,649 --> 01:55:20,860
and something lean
to cutpurse of quick hand.

1376
01:55:22,071 --> 01:55:24,738
To England will I steal,

1377
01:55:24,864 --> 01:55:28,700
and there... I'll steal,

1378
01:55:28,826 --> 01:55:32,538
and patches will I get unto these scars,

1379
01:55:32,664 --> 01:55:36,166
and swear I got them
in these present wars.

1380
01:55:50,847 --> 01:55:52,181
(Chickens squawk)

1381
01:55:54,184 --> 01:55:55,434
(Piglet squeals)

1382
01:56:12,868 --> 01:56:14,452
(Choir sings)

1383
01:56:49,571 --> 01:56:52,489
Peace to this meeting,
wherefore we are met.

1384
01:56:53,408 --> 01:56:56,326
Unto our brother France
and to our sister,

1385
01:56:56,452 --> 01:56:58,870
health and fair time of day.

1386
01:57:00,205 --> 01:57:04,292
Joy and good wishes to our
most fair and princely cousin, Katherine.

1387
01:57:05,919 --> 01:57:07,962
And as a branch or member
of this royalty,

1388
01:57:08,088 --> 01:57:10,548
we do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.

1389
01:57:11,634 --> 01:57:16,262
And princes French, and peers,
health to you all.

1390
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:24,144
Right joyous are we to behold your face,

1391
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:27,814
most worthy brother England, fairly met.

1392
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:32,027
So are you, princes English, every one.

1393
01:57:32,153 --> 01:57:35,322
So happy be the issue, brother England,

1394
01:57:35,448 --> 01:57:38,617
of this good day and
of this gracious meeting,

1395
01:57:38,743 --> 01:57:43,287
as we are now glad to behold your eyes -

1396
01:57:43,413 --> 01:57:46,207
your eyes which hitherto
have borne in them,

1397
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:48,376
against the French that met them
in their bent,

1398
01:57:48,502 --> 01:57:52,088
the fatal balls of murdering basilisks.

1399
01:57:52,214 --> 01:57:57,093
The venom of such looks we fairly hope
have lost their quality,

1400
01:57:57,219 --> 01:58:03,474
and that this day shall change
all griefs and quarrels... into love.

1401
01:58:05,101 --> 01:58:07,811
To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

1402
01:58:08,979 --> 01:58:12,065
My duty to you both, on equal love,

1403
01:58:12,191 --> 01:58:14,526
great Kings of France and England.

1404
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:18,196
Since that my office hath so far prevailed

1405
01:58:18,322 --> 01:58:22,409
that face to face and royal eye to eye
you have assembled,

1406
01:58:22,535 --> 01:58:26,996
let it not disgrace me if I demand,
before this royal view,

1407
01:58:27,123 --> 01:58:30,874
why that the naked,
poor and mangled peace,

1408
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,212
dear nurse of arts, of plenties,
and ofjoyful births,

1409
01:58:35,338 --> 01:58:40,426
should not in this best garden
of the world, our fertile France,

1410
01:58:40,552 --> 01:58:42,970
put up her lovely visage.

1411
01:58:45,265 --> 01:58:49,393
Alas, she hath from France
too long been chased,

1412
01:58:51,186 --> 01:58:55,148
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,

1413
01:58:55,274 --> 01:58:58,401
corrupting in its own fertility.

1414
01:58:58,527 --> 01:59:02,655
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,

1415
01:59:02,865 --> 01:59:05,575
unpruned, dies.

1416
01:59:05,701 --> 01:59:10,246
Her hedges even-pleached,
put forth disordered twigs.

1417
01:59:10,372 --> 01:59:15,542
Her fallow leas,
the darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory,

1418
01:59:15,668 --> 01:59:19,421
doth root upon,
while that the coulter rusts

1419
01:59:19,547 --> 01:59:22,048
that should deracinate such savagery.

1420
01:59:23,384 --> 01:59:27,095
The even mead,
that erst brought sweetly forth

1421
01:59:27,221 --> 01:59:32,225
the freckled cowslip,
burnet and green clover,

1422
01:59:32,351 --> 01:59:36,520
wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,

1423
01:59:36,646 --> 01:59:38,731
conceives by idleness,

1424
01:59:40,108 --> 01:59:43,903
and nothing teems but hateful docks,

1425
01:59:44,029 --> 01:59:47,615
rough thistles, kecksies, burs,

1426
01:59:47,741 --> 01:59:51,076
losing both beauty and utility.

1427
01:59:52,454 --> 01:59:56,123
Even so our houses
and ourselves and children

1428
01:59:56,249 --> 01:59:59,251
have lost, or do not learn
for want of time,

1429
01:59:59,376 --> 02:00:02,128
the sciences
that should become our country,

1430
02:00:02,671 --> 02:00:05,298
but grow like savages -

1431
02:00:05,424 --> 02:00:10,053
as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood -

1432
02:00:10,179 --> 02:00:13,139
to swearing and stern looks,

1433
02:00:13,265 --> 02:00:15,600
diffused attire,

1434
02:00:15,726 --> 02:00:20,230
and everything that seems... unnatural.

1435
02:00:21,023 --> 02:00:26,151
Which to reduce into her former favour
you are assembled.

1436
02:00:26,277 --> 02:00:29,905
Then, Duke of Burgundy,
you must gain that peace

1437
02:00:30,031 --> 02:00:32,783
with full accord to all our just demands.

1438
02:00:34,744 --> 02:00:38,413
I have but with a cursory eye
o'erglanced the articles.

1439
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:43,836
Pleaseth your grace to appoint some
of your council presently to sit with us.

1440
02:00:43,962 --> 02:00:47,839
We will suddenly pass our accept
and peremptory answer.

1441
02:00:47,965 --> 02:00:49,674
Brother, we shall.

1442
02:00:50,717 --> 02:00:53,886
Will you, fair sister, go with the princes...

1443
02:00:55,472 --> 02:00:57,431
or stay here with us?

1444
02:00:58,892 --> 02:01:01,227
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.

1445
02:01:01,353 --> 02:01:03,729
Haply, a woman's voice
may do some good

1446
02:01:03,856 --> 02:01:06,858
when articles too nicely urged be stood on.

1447
02:01:06,984 --> 02:01:09,901
Yet leave our cousin Katherine
here with us.

1448
02:01:10,027 --> 02:01:12,279
She hath good leave.

1449
02:01:14,490 --> 02:01:15,907
(Choir sings)

1450
02:01:47,939 --> 02:01:51,233
Fair Katherine, and most fair...

1451
02:01:52,444 --> 02:01:57,238
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier
terms such as will enter at a lady's ear

1452
02:01:57,364 --> 02:02:01,034
and plead his love-suit
to her gentle heart?

1453
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:03,494
Your Majesty shall mock at me.

1454
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:07,123
I cannot speak your England.

1455
02:02:07,499 --> 02:02:12,128
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly
with your French heart,

1456
02:02:12,254 --> 02:02:16,132
I will be glad to hear you confess it
brokenly with your English tongue.

1457
02:02:17,425 --> 02:02:20,886
Do you... like me, Kate?

1458
02:02:21,638 --> 02:02:23,180
Pardonnez-moi?

1459
02:02:24,474 --> 02:02:28,602
I cannot tell what is..."like me".

1460
02:02:31,314 --> 02:02:35,442
An angel is like you, Kate.
And you are like an angel.

1461
02:02:36,486 --> 02:02:38,862
Que dit-il?
Que je suis semblable à les anges?

1462
02:02:38,988 --> 02:02:41,322
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce,
ainsi dit-il.

1463
02:02:41,448 --> 02:02:46,077
O bon Dieu. Les langues des hommes
sont pleines de tromperies.

1464
02:02:48,246 --> 02:02:52,124
What says she, fair one? That
the tongues of men are full of deceits?

1465
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:58,047
Oui, that the tongues of de mens
is be full of deceits.

1466
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,634
(Laughs)

1467
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,221
I' faith, Kate, I am glad
thou can speak no better English.

1468
02:03:06,347 --> 02:03:08,974
For if thou couldst,
thou wouldst find me such a plain king

1469
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:12,394
that thou wouldst think
that I had sold my farm to buy my crown.

1470
02:03:13,479 --> 02:03:16,481
I know no ways to mince it in love,

1471
02:03:16,607 --> 02:03:22,028
but directly to say..."I love you."
Give me your answer, i' faith do,

1472
02:03:22,154 --> 02:03:24,280
and so clap hands and a bargain.
How say you, lady?

1473
02:03:26,491 --> 02:03:29,702
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.

1474
02:03:31,037 --> 02:03:34,581
Marry, if you put me to verses,
or to dance for your sake, Kate,

1475
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:36,375
why, you undo me.

1476
02:03:37,252 --> 02:03:41,130
If I might buffet for my love,
or bound my horse for her favours,

1477
02:03:41,256 --> 02:03:45,259
I could lay on like a butcher,
and sit like a jackanapes, never off.

1478
02:03:45,385 --> 02:03:51,222
But before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly,
nor gasp out my eloquence,

1479
02:03:52,057 --> 02:03:54,475
nor have I no cunning in protestation.

1480
02:03:54,601 --> 02:03:57,520
If thou canst love
a fellow of this temper, Kate,

1481
02:03:57,646 --> 02:04:01,315
that never looks in his glass
for the love of anything he sees there,

1482
02:04:01,442 --> 02:04:05,987
whose face is not worth sunburning...
take me.

1483
02:04:07,489 --> 02:04:12,492
If not, to say to thee
that I shall die is true.

1484
02:04:13,786 --> 02:04:15,620
But, for thy love,

1485
02:04:16,581 --> 02:04:19,875
by the Lord, no.

1486
02:04:20,668 --> 02:04:23,045
Yet I love thee, too.

1487
02:04:24,172 --> 02:04:26,339
And while thou livest, dear Kate,

1488
02:04:26,466 --> 02:04:29,092
take a fellow of plain constancy,

1489
02:04:29,218 --> 02:04:30,594
for these fellows of infinite tongue

1490
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:34,431
that can rhyme themselves
into ladies' favours,

1491
02:04:34,556 --> 02:04:37,183
they do always reason themselves
out again.

1492
02:04:37,851 --> 02:04:41,729
A speaker is but a prater,
a rhyme is but a ballad.

1493
02:04:41,855 --> 02:04:44,774
A straight back will stoop,
a black beard will turn white,

1494
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:47,568
a fair face will wither,
a full eye will wax hollow,

1495
02:04:47,694 --> 02:04:52,281
but a good heart, Kate,
is the sun and the moon.

1496
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:55,451
If thou wouldst have such a one,

1497
02:04:56,495 --> 02:04:57,702
take me.

1498
02:04:58,746 --> 02:05:00,580
And take me, take a soldier.

1499
02:05:01,415 --> 02:05:04,709
Take a soldier, take a king.

1500
02:05:07,254 --> 02:05:09,798
And what sayest thou then to my love?

1501
02:05:09,924 --> 02:05:12,842
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

1502
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:27,689
Is it possible
dat I should love de enemy of France?

1503
02:05:27,816 --> 02:05:30,859
No, Kate, but in loving me
you would love the friend of France,

1504
02:05:30,985 --> 02:05:35,280
for I love France so well
that I will not part with a village of it.

1505
02:05:35,406 --> 02:05:36,532
(Laughs)

1506
02:05:37,492 --> 02:05:41,411
And Kate, when France is mine,
and I am yours,

1507
02:05:41,538 --> 02:05:43,579
then yours is France, and you are mine.

1508
02:05:44,414 --> 02:05:46,874
I... cannot tell what is dat.

1509
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:54,215
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I
am sure will hang upon my tongue

1510
02:05:54,341 --> 02:05:58,594
like a newly married wife about her
husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.

1511
02:06:00,305 --> 02:06:01,931
Er... Je...

1512
02:06:04,518 --> 02:06:08,603
quand sur le possession de France,

1513
02:06:10,106 --> 02:06:13,441
et quand vous avez le possession
de moi...

1514
02:06:14,652 --> 02:06:16,361
Er...

1515
02:06:16,821 --> 02:06:20,282
donc vôtre est France
et vous êtes mienne.

1516
02:06:20,408 --> 02:06:21,491
(Both laugh)

1517
02:06:21,617 --> 02:06:24,870
I shall never move thee in French
unless it be to laugh at me.

1518
02:06:24,996 --> 02:06:26,997
Sauf votre honneur,
le français que vous parlez,

1519
02:06:27,123 --> 02:06:29,248
il est meilleur
que I'anglais que je parle.

1520
02:06:29,374 --> 02:06:33,377
No, i' faith, it's not, Kate.
Thy speaking of my tongue and thy thine

1521
02:06:33,503 --> 02:06:36,130
must needs be granted to be much alike.

1522
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:42,636
But, Kate, dost thou understand
thus much English?

1523
02:06:43,513 --> 02:06:46,724
Canst thou... love me?

1524
02:06:50,061 --> 02:06:51,937
I cannot tell.

1525
02:06:54,148 --> 02:06:57,150
Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate?
I'll ask them.

1526
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:05,200
Come, I know thou lovest me.

1527
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:07,869
And at night, when you are come into your
chamber,

1528
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:10,455
you will question this gentlewoman
about me,

1529
02:07:10,581 --> 02:07:14,334
and I know, Kate, you will to her
dispraise those parts in me

1530
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,293
which you love with your heart.

1531
02:07:17,378 --> 02:07:19,630
But, good Kate,

1532
02:07:20,506 --> 02:07:22,299
mock me mercifully -

1533
02:07:22,842 --> 02:07:27,512
the rather, gentle princess,
because I love thee... cruelly.

1534
02:07:29,349 --> 02:07:33,727
What sayest thou,
my fair flower-de-luce?

1535
02:07:33,853 --> 02:07:37,731
La plus belle Katherine du monde,

1536
02:07:37,857 --> 02:07:41,734
mon très chère et divine déesse.

1537
02:07:43,362 --> 02:07:45,738
Your majesté 'ave a false French enough

1538
02:07:45,864 --> 02:07:49,617
to deceive de most sage demoiselle
dat is en France.

1539
02:07:50,244 --> 02:07:51,911
Now fie upon my false French but,

1540
02:07:52,037 --> 02:07:55,581
by mine honour, in true English,
I love thee, Kate.

1541
02:07:55,707 --> 02:07:58,251
By which honour,
though I dare not swear thou lovest me

1542
02:07:58,377 --> 02:08:00,961
yet my blood begins
to flatter me thou dost.

1543
02:08:02,046 --> 02:08:04,589
Put off your maiden blushes.

1544
02:08:04,715 --> 02:08:07,425
Avouch the thoughts of your heart
with the looks of an empress.

1545
02:08:07,551 --> 02:08:11,221
Take me by the hand and say,
"Harry of England, I am thine" -

1546
02:08:11,347 --> 02:08:15,600
which word thou shalt no sooner bless
mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud,

1547
02:08:15,726 --> 02:08:18,937
"England is thine, Ireland is thine,
France is thine

1548
02:08:19,063 --> 02:08:21,564
"and Henry Plantagenet is thine."

1549
02:08:21,691 --> 02:08:27,611
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,
break thy mind to me in broken English -

1550
02:08:27,737 --> 02:08:29,571
wilt thou have me?

1551
02:08:31,574 --> 02:08:34,785
Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.

1552
02:08:35,745 --> 02:08:38,414
Nay, it shall please him well, Kate.

1553
02:08:39,124 --> 02:08:41,083
It shall please him, Kate.

1554
02:08:42,419 --> 02:08:45,587
Den it shall also content me.

1555
02:08:48,549 --> 02:08:51,801
Upon that I kiss your hand
and call you my queen.

1556
02:08:51,927 --> 02:08:55,555
(Shrieks) Laissez, mon seigneur,
laissez, laissez!

1557
02:08:56,849 --> 02:08:59,392
Ma foi, je ne peut
vous abbaissez votre grandeur

1558
02:08:59,518 --> 02:09:01,769
en baisant la main
d'une de votre indigne serviteur.

1559
02:09:01,895 --> 02:09:04,856
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie,
mon treis-puissant seigneur.

1560
02:09:04,982 --> 02:09:06,357
Oh.

1561
02:09:08,027 --> 02:09:10,652
- Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
- Oh!

1562
02:09:13,823 --> 02:09:16,533
Les dames et demoiselles
pour être baisées devant le noces,

1563
02:09:16,659 --> 02:09:18,952
ce n'est pas la coutume en France.

1564
02:09:36,136 --> 02:09:37,928
Madam my interpreter, what says she?

1565
02:09:38,055 --> 02:09:42,516
That it is not the fashion
for the ladies of France...

1566
02:09:42,642 --> 02:09:43,601
Oh...

1567
02:09:43,727 --> 02:09:48,439
- I cannot tell what is "baiser" in English.
- To kiss.

1568
02:09:48,565 --> 02:09:52,318
Votre majesté entend bettre que moi.

1569
02:09:52,444 --> 02:09:53,903
It is not the fashion for the maids
in France

1570
02:09:54,029 --> 02:09:55,904
to kiss before they are married,
would she say?

1571
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:57,781
Oui, vraiment.

1572
02:09:57,907 --> 02:09:59,824
O Kate...

1573
02:10:03,496 --> 02:10:06,539
nice customs courtesy to great kings.

1574
02:10:08,459 --> 02:10:11,669
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined

1575
02:10:11,796 --> 02:10:14,047
within the weak list
of a country's fashion.

1576
02:10:15,841 --> 02:10:18,884
We are the makers of manners, Kate.

1577
02:10:19,803 --> 02:10:24,973
Therefore, patiently... and yielding...

1578
02:10:31,689 --> 02:10:35,526
You have witchcraft in your lips... Kate.

1579
02:10:39,155 --> 02:10:41,156
God save Your Majesty.

1580
02:10:41,282 --> 02:10:45,159
My royal cousin,
teach you our princess... English?

1581
02:10:45,285 --> 02:10:46,744
(Laughter)

1582
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:50,581
I would have her learn, my fair cousin,
how perfectly I love her,

1583
02:10:50,707 --> 02:10:52,667
and that is good English.

1584
02:10:53,794 --> 02:10:55,586
Shall Kate be my wife?

1585
02:10:56,213 --> 02:10:58,923
Take her, fair son,

1586
02:10:59,049 --> 02:11:03,803
that the contending kingdoms
of France and England,

1587
02:11:03,929 --> 02:11:09,141
whose very shores look pale with envy
of each other's happiness,

1588
02:11:09,267 --> 02:11:15,730
may cease their hatred and
never war advance his bleeding sword

1589
02:11:15,857 --> 02:11:19,151
'twixt England and fair France.

1590
02:11:19,277 --> 02:11:20,944
(All) Amen.

1591
02:11:27,409 --> 02:11:29,326
(Choir sings)

1592
02:12:10,951 --> 02:12:12,785
(Applause)

1593
02:12:23,338 --> 02:12:25,297
(Cheering)

1594
02:12:43,982 --> 02:12:47,485
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen

1595
02:12:47,611 --> 02:12:50,947
our bending author
hath pursued the story,

1596
02:12:51,657 --> 02:12:55,493
in little room confining mighty men,

1597
02:12:55,619 --> 02:12:59,996
mangling by starts
the full course of their glory.

1598
02:13:00,456 --> 02:13:04,834
Small time, but in that small
most greatly lived

1599
02:13:04,961 --> 02:13:06,962
this star of England.

1600
02:13:07,088 --> 02:13:09,714
Fortune made his sword,

1601
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:14,010
and for his sake, in your fair minds

1602
02:13:14,136 --> 02:13:17,138
let this acceptance take.

1603
02:13:17,265 --> 02:13:19,849
(Applause)

1604
02:13:20,351 --> 02:13:22,351
(Choir sings)

1605
02:14:40,093 --> 02:14:46,474
# Deo gratias Anglia

1606
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:53,606
# Redde pro victoria

1607
02:14:56,609 --> 02:15:00,987
# Our King went forth to Normandy

1608
02:15:01,113 --> 02:15:06,159
# With grace and might of chivalry

1609
02:15:06,285 --> 02:15:11,539
# There God for him wrought marvellously

1610
02:15:11,666 --> 02:15:17,169
# Wherefore England may call and cry

1611
02:15:17,295 --> 02:15:27,971
# Deo gratias Anglia

1612
02:15:28,098 --> 02:15:33,977
# Redde pro victoria

1613
02:15:41,652 --> 02:15:46,656
# May gracious God he keep our King

1614
02:15:46,782 --> 02:15:51,619
# His people that are well willing

1615
02:15:51,745 --> 02:15:57,792
# And give him grace without ending

1616
02:15:57,918 --> 02:16:03,338
# Then we may call and safely sing

1617
02:16:03,464 --> 02:16:07,342
# Deo gratias

1618
02:16:07,468 --> 02:16:13,974
# Deo gratias Anglia

1619
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:20,856
# Redde pro victoria #
