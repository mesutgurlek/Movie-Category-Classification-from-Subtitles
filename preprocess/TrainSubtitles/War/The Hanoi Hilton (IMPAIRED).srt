00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,803
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

227
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,754
Earl Hubman,                    
captain, Air Force.             

228
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,704
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

229
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,274
                    Bill Oldham,
                   Marine major.

230
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,842
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

231
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,760
                 I'd get up,    
             but the leg's gone.

232
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,677
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

233
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,194
           Busted in two places.

234
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:40,710
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

235
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:41,679
         Believe it or not,     
    I've been here the longest, 

236
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,646
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

237
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,481
        over six months,        
       over in the Annex.       

238
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,314
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

239
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:44,933
            Besides you.        
Four for me.                    

240
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,550
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

241
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,052
    And the cripple here        
        is the new boy.         

242
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,553
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

243
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,537
          Three weeks.          

244
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:50,520
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

245
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,072
     A year's a long time.      

246
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:51,622
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

247
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,558
Who also have you seen?         
            No one.             

248
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,493
How long have you been--        
        A year. I think.        

249
00:19:55,662 --> 00:20:00,331
        I saw a message         
    on the bath house walls.    

250
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,466
It was signed a Navy driver.    

251
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,101
       That message             
     and that's all.            

252
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,735
It was signed a Navy driver.    

253
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,573
      So it's been...           
It's been a very long time.     

254
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,409
It was signed a Navy driver.    

255
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,379
     I began to think that      
I wouldn't see anyone, and so...

256
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,348
It was signed a Navy driver.    

257
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,554
Seeing you guys is...

00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,925
          so my wife asked him, 
               in a decent,

   Hey, new boy, cell three.    
       Work the transom.        

893
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:31,921
  I loosened that one myself.

 in the corner, it'll slip out. 

896
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,825

            KENNEDY:            
Hi. Welcome to the Hanoi Hilton.
       Pretty nice, huh?        

899
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:56,696
  The food here's pretty lousy  

900
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:57,446
            KENNEDY:            
Hi. Welcome to the Hanoi Hilton.
       Pretty nice, huh?        

901
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:58,731
  but it's all room service,    
        so it's, uh...          

902
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,015

        I'm Williamson,

        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,  

914
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,569
      Yeah, it's true, man.     
            Really?             

915
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,037
        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,

        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,  

918
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:24,891
     unless you outrank me.     

919
00:47:24,892 --> 00:47:25,841
        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,  

920
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:26,526
    What about Colonel Cathcart?

921
00:47:26,527 --> 00:47:27,209
        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,  

922
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,845
            You saw him?        
      You saw the colonel?      

923
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,479
        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,

925
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,348
        I'm Williamson,         
 I was a lieutenant commander,  

926
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:39,088
      Are there no guards here? 

927
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:39,489
        It's siesta.            

928
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:39,889
      Are there no guards here? 

929
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,424
   Three whacks, the gong,      
       pause, then one.         

930
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,958
      Are there no guards here? 

931
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,210
  They live by the gong here,   
    it tells you what to do     

932
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:45,460
      Are there no guards here? 

933
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:46,429
       and when to do it.       

934
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,396
      Are there no guards here? 

935
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,435
          These two empty?      

936
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,220
The one on my left              
has a youngster who talked      

937
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,004
          These two empty?      

938
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:57,323
and he's been in solitary       
       ever since.              

939
00:47:57,324 --> 00:47:58,640
          These two empty?      

940
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,043
       Now how about you?       
          Who are you?          

941
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,444
          These two empty?      

942
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:02,278
           All right.           

943
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,111
          These two empty?      

944
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,098
              Name's Fischer,   
           major, 82nd Airborne.

945
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,083
          These two empty?      

946
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,151
   Now attached to the Pentagon.

947
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:09,218
          These two empty?      

948
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,903
      How did you get here?     

949
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:12,587
          These two empty?      

950
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,158
               I was here       
        for one helicopter trip.

951
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,726
          It malfunctioned.     

952
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,293
               I was here       
        for one helicopter trip.

953
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,761
            We crash landed     
           north of the DMZ.    

954
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,228
               I was here       
        for one helicopter trip.

955
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,214
         [ALL CHUCKLE]          

956
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:22,198
               I was here       
        for one helicopter trip.

957
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:25,601
          Shh! Tell us          
        about Cathcart.         

958
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,488
 As far as Cathcart's concerned,
    let me say that I saw him.  

959
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,374
          Shh! Tell us          
        about Cathcart.         

960
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:33,209
           What was left of him.

961
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:34,794
       What do you mean?        
          What's left?          

962
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:36,378
           What was left of him.

963
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:37,514
          How was he,           
       how were his arms?       

964
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:38,648
           What was left of him.

965
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,818
        Swollen. Very swollen.  
        Blue with rope burns.   

966
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,987
           What was left of him.

967
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:45,555
               Gregory!         

968
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:46,122
           What was left of him.

969
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:47,690
              ALL:              
            Gregory!            

970
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,257
           What was left of him.

971
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:53,296
Look, major, I've been          
in here almost 2 years.         

972
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:53,897
         The punishment         
        has been brutal         

973
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:54,497
Look, major, I've been          
in here almost 2 years.         

974
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,249
      but it's never been       
       life-threatening.        

975
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,000
Look, major, I've been          
in here almost 2 years.         

976
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,369
         Until Gregory?         

977
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:01,854
        He must've brought it   
             on himself.        

978
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,338
         Until Gregory?         

979
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,340
             He must have.      
            He's just a kid.    

980
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,340
         Until Gregory?         

981
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:06,793
It doesn't--                    
         Doesn't what?          

982
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:08,244

983
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,514

1661
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:03,171
         When I was young...    

1662
01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:04,839
         ...at religious school,

1663
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,392
     I remember a great deal was
      made of Abraham and Isaac.

1664
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:09,944
         ...at religious school,

1665
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,263
       How God ordered Abraham  
         to sacrifice Isaac,    

1666
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:14,581
         ...at religious school,

1667
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,151
           his only son,        
         his beloved child.     

1668
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,719
         ...at religious school,

1669
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:22,089
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1670
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:25,376
    and wrestled within himself 
   to decide whether to believe,

1671
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,662
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1672
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:29,931
                to trust God.   

1673
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,198
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1674
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,602
                Or to deny him. 

1675
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:36,621
     And I suppose that most    
  of us identified with Abraham.

1676
01:14:36,622 --> 01:14:38,639
                Or to deny him. 

1677
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,626
      Wondering how we would use
     free choice if that was us.

01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,612

01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,883
  Well, since I've been in here,

1680
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,885
              I've had time     
          to think about Isaac. 

1681
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,886
  Well, since I've been in here,

1682
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:53,905
                Helpless.       

1683
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:54,922
  Well, since I've been in here,

1684

1685
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,277
         and audience to what   
     might become his own death.

1686
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:01,595
           Tied up on an altar  

1687
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:02,614
   And he couldn't trust in God.

1688
01:15:02,615 --> 01:15:03,631
           Tied up on an altar  

1689
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,283
      He had to trust in Abraham
          and hope that God     

1690
01:15:05,284 --> 01:15:06,934
           Tied up on an altar  

1691
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,369
       would act through him.

     for Isaac and Abraham.     

1695
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,582
     Just as it will for us.

1701
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:40,601
     I've tried to seek light   
    in the midst of darkness.   

1702
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,971
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,    

1703
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,957
  the greater the possibility   
           for light.           

1704
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,942
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,    

1705
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:51,562
     I know that all people     
     are not kind and just.     

1706
01:15:51,563 --> 01:15:55,181
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,

           every day,           

1708
