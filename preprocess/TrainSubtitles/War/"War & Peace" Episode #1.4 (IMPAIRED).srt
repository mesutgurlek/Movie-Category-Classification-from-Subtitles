00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I believe I have the pleasure
of speaking with Count Bezukhov?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're a Mason?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sic transit gloria mundi!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I love you, more than
anyone I've ever known.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, that's enough for me.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, but I'm not in a position
to promise you anything.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Father, I'm afraid I'm going
to need some more money.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,490
- How much?
- 43,000.

9
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:19,720
What?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Natasha, this is
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
May I request the pleasure of a
dance with your daughter Natalia?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Go to her, don't let her
get away! Propose to her.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Why doesn't he come?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's been three weeks.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,969
Did he say he would?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No...

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but he loves me, I am sure of it.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Did he say so?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not in so many words. But how
could he look at me as he did

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and not mean it?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,619
And you?

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you love him?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I do. I think I've loved him

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
since the first time I
saw him at Otradnoe.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's not like it was with
Boris, or anyone. It's...

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's so deep, it frightens me.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So it must be true love, mustn't it?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I suppose it must, my dear.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,686
Well then, why doesn't he come?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know, my darling.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If it's meant to happen,
it will happen.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's nothing we can do about it.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Go to bed, and see what
the morning will bring.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
- I can't, Mama.
- No more talk.

Firstly, this marriage would
not be ideal in terms of family,

39

wealth and distinction.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The Rostovs are a perfectly
good family, Father.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That may be, but you could do better
in that respect, and you know it.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Secondly, you are not in early youth
and your health is not strong.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have never fully recovered from
the wound you took at Austerlitz.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And you're in love
with this girl, you say.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Very deeply, Father.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hah!

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,553
Triumph of hope over
experience. All right.

48

Will you do this for me?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Take a year, go abroad, take a
cure, find a tutor for Nikolushka,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and if, after this year,
your passion for this girl

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,813
is still so irresistible,
marry her then.

52

for a private conversation

that I sacrifice my honour

and my feelings for
the sake of money?

Princess Marya, I wasn't expecting...

795
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I have been in despair

796
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
because of the misunderstanding
that happened between us.

797
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
My brother loves you
and I will love you, too.

798
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm so sorry you weren't
properly received the other day.

799
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And Papa, too, he's not against you,
he's old and crotchety with us all.

800
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Can you forgive us?

801
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Of course. There's nothing to forgive.

802
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But...

803
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But...

804
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I have something to ask you.

805
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Will you tell Prince Andrei
when he comes

806
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
that our engagement is at an end,
and I cannot be his wife?

807
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, dear, we must have
offended you deeply...

808
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
No, it's nothing to do
with that, it's... it's me.

809
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm the one who's at fault.

810
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I made a mistake.

811
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But tell him, please, that he is
released from the engagement,

812
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and ask his forgiveness.

813
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

You're to come with us,

No, that's not right, she's to...
