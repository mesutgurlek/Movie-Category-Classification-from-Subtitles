00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:35,930
Harry Ford:
Hello, John.

4
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:44,939
John Wilkes Booth:
<i>[humming].</i>

5
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,676
Murcott: I am
harmless except to myself.

6
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:53,244
Florence Trenchard:
I hear you.

7
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:55,311
Mrs. Mountchessington:
You will please recollect

8
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,945
you are addressing
my daughter.

9
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:00,580
And in my presence.

10
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:01,814
Asa Trenchard: Yes.

11
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,915
I'm offering her
my heart and

12
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,617
hand just as
she wants them,

13
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:08,820
with nothing in 'em.

14
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,155
Mrs. Mountchessington:
Dear, to your room.

15
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:12,422
Augusta: Yes, ma.

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,390
The nasty beast!

17
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,779
Mrs. Mountchessington:
I am aware.

18
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,225
<i>[gun cocks].</i>

19
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:19,053
Mrs. Mountchessington:
Mr. Trenchard, you are

20
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,162
not used to the manners
of good society and that,

21
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,096
alone, will excuse
the impertinence of

22
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:25,565
which you have
been guilty.

23
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,099
Asa Trenchard:
Don't know the manners

24
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,868
of good society, eh?

25
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:31,169
Well, I guess I know
enough to turn you inside out,

26
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:34,572
old woman; you
sockdologizing old man-trap!

27
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:48,083
Tom Hanks: On the evening
of April 13th, 1865,

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,585
John Wilkes Booth
initiates his plan

29
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,587
not only to kill
Abraham Lincoln,

30
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:55,489
but to decapitate
the government of

31
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,590
the United States.

32
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:01,160
A Civil War that has
lasted four years is

33
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,095
drawing to an end.

34
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:05,797
While Washington City
celebrates the surrender

35
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:08,365
of Robert E. Lee's
Confederate Army,

36
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,801
Booth and his
co-conspirators plot

37
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:14,570
a carefully
coordinated triple murder.

38
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:17,672
John Wilkes Booth:
And?

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,140
Mister Powell?

40
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,742
Lewis Powell:
The Secretary of State

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,210
ain't going
nowhere soon.

42
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:24,111
Confined to his bed
and slow to recover.

43
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,880
Got his-self a nurse.

44
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,881
A little slip of a man.

45
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,617
And there's a
nigger butler.

46
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:32,918
John Wilkes Booth:
Mister Atzerodt,

47
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,088
you will check into the
Kirkwood tomorrow morning.

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,890
Vice President
Johnson's suite is

49
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,291
on the first floor.

50
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,932
George Atzerodt: No.

51
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,234
John Wilkes Booth: No?

52
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:46,669
George Atzerodt: No.

53
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:47,936
I do not wish.

54
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:49,471
I cannot.

55
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,173
John Wilkes Booth:
It is too late, George.

56
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:57,278
We have, all of us,
conspired together.

57
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:58,879
George Atzerodt:
To capture, ya.

58
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,881
To kidnap one man.

59
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,917
Not to murder.

60
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,253
John Wilkes Booth:
This is an act of war.

61
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,622
And you are
stuck to it.

62
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,792
It is a tar pit from
which you cannot pull away.

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,961
And when tomorrow
night is through and

64
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,529
our deed is done,

65
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:22,833
we will, all of us,
be known as its authors.

66
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,635
I have seen to it.

67
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:29,137
And we will be
hailed as heroes!

68
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,513
We will meet back
here tomorrow night

69
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,214
at nine o'clock.

70
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,383
And Powell and Herold
will pay a visit

71
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,685
to the
Secretary of State.

72
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:48,454
Mr. Atzerodt will go to
see the Vice President.

73
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:51,791
And I will go to
Grover's Theater

74
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,392
for a performance of

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,530
"Aladdin" or "His
Wonderful Lamp."

76
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:08,439
And there I
will kill a tyrant.

77
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>[small explosion sound]</i>

78
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,351
Tom Hanks: This is the
true story of the killing

79
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,120
of Abraham Lincoln,
the first assassination of

80
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,722
an American president,
and what might be the most

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,925
resonant crime in the
history of the nation.

82
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:32,029
John Wilkes Booth's
plan to kill Lincoln isn't

83
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,864
the first Black Flag
operation to target

84
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,266
the 16th president of
the United States.

85
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,401
At least five
kidnapping or assassination

86
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:40,302
schemes are hatched,

87
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,438
although none
are attempted.

88
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:46,440
None, save
perhaps one.

89
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,442
Abraham Lincoln
is riding alone,

90
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,377
as is his custom,

91
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,846
from the War Department
to the soldier's home where

92
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,550
the family stays during
the hot summer months.

93
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,086
<i>[loud rifle shot]</i>

94
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,156
Abraham Lincoln:
Whoa, whoa!

95
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,458
<i>[grunts].</i>

96
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:06,861
Help me, son!

97
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:07,828
Private Nichols:
Whoa, whoa!

98
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:10,364
<i>[horse neighs].</i>

99
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,402
Private Nichols:
Steady, steady now.

100
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,270
Steady.

101
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:17,838
<i>[horse neighs].</i>

102
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,206
Private Nichols: I, uh,
I heard a rifle shot.

103
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,407
Abraham Lincoln: Yes.

104
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:21,741
Down by the bottom
of the hill.

105
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,610
That is what
frightened him so.

106
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:28,080
And, uh, he bucked and
separated me from my,

107
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:31,050
my $8 pug hat.

108
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:35,220
Private Nichols, I am
much obliged to you.

109
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:46,463
Private Nichols:
Your hat, sir.

110
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:50,433
I found it at the
bottom of the hill.

111
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,372
Abraham Lincoln: It is
properly ventilated for

112
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,008
these hot summer months.

113
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:03,644
Likely some fellow
returning from a day's

114
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,547
hunt discharged his gun in
a precautionary measure of

115
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:10,650
safety before
bringing it into his home.

116
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,287
I assure you I am in
greater danger from a

117
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:16,523
rumor of snipers
than I am from your

118
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:20,126
silence in this affair.

119
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:26,164
I would ask that you tell
no one of this adventure.

120
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,666
Private Nichols:
Sir, I.

121
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:33,037
Abraham Lincoln: I will
be doubly obliged to you.

122
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,541
Private Nichols:
Yes, sir.

123
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,480
Tom Hanks: That
is Abraham Lincoln.

124
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,415
The self-educated
statesman who has

125
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,783
abolished slavery
and will go on to

126
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,886
end the war and
save the Union.

127
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,555
Yet, during his 4
years and 41 days in office,

128
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,857
the intensity of the
hatred leveled toward him,

129
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,792
even by members of his
own party, is extreme,

130
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,627
even by
today's standards.

131
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,129
But while the killing
of Abraham Lincoln

132
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:06,164
serves to sanctify him,

133
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,166
to transform a
controversial

134
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:11,135
president into a
dearly beloved martyr,

135
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,170
it also serves to
pervert the truth

136
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,572
about his killer.

137
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,274
John Wilkes Booth,
a passionate and

138
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,276
well-admired man on
the path to become one

139
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,343
of the greatest
actors of his time,

140
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,645
is reduced by history
to a two-dimensional

141
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:26,547
scoundrel and
dismissed as a madman.

142
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,249
John Wilkes Booth:
Harder!

143
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,117
Faster!

144
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,118
Come on!

145
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,686
<i>[laughs].</i>

James McCollom:
Good God, I've.

149
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,793
John Wilkes Booth:
It's all right, old man.

150
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,696
Come on hard, for God's
sake and save the fight.

Bring the curtain down.

157
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:02,310
James McCollom:
Mr. Booth.

158
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,012
John Wilkes Booth:
Why, Mr. McCollom!

159
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,213
James McCollom:
Mr. Booth, I,

160
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,381
I am so very sorry.

161
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,915
John Wilkes Booth:
Come, come, old fellow.

162
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:09,917
You look as if you
had lost the blood.

163
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,285
Not another word.

164
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:12,886
Now, if you'd had
gotten my eye,

165
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,187
that would have been bad.

166
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:15,355
But you didn't.

167
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,891
And it was, well,
it was splendid!

168
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,093
James McCollom:
Thank you, sir.

169
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,461
Tom Hanks: That is
John Wilkes Booth.

170
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,796
Born and raised
in Maryland,

171
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,230
a border state,

172
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,500
a slave state that did
not secede from the Union.

173
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,802
John Wilkes Booth is
also a Southern zealot,

174
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,337
whose hatred of
Abraham Lincoln is

175
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:37,906
nothing less
than fanatical.

176
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:42,376
In October of 1864,
Booth makes contact

177
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:44,675
with the Confederate
Secret Service.

178
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:46,377
And shortly after
Lincoln's reelection,

179
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:49,713
he determines to
kidnap the President.

180
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,582
He stops in Philadelphia
to visit his sister, Asia.

181
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,584
And there he
writes a letter.

182
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,086
John Wilkes Booth:
To whom it may concern.

183
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:03,424
Right or wrong,
God judge me, not man.

184
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:09,028
My love is for
the South alone.

185
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:13,498
Nor do I deem it a
dishonor in attempting

186
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:18,570
to make for her a
prisoner of this man

187
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:26,042
to whom she owes
so much misery.

188
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,444
Edwin.

189
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,278
Our brother
voted for him?

190
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,412
Asia Booth Clarke: Yes.

191
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,613
John Wilkes Booth:
For a false President?

192
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,549
A tool of the North
who means to crush out

193
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,618
slavery by robbery,
rapine and slaughter?

194
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:42,421
Oh, God, grant that
I may see the end!

195
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:46,924
This country was
formed for the white man

196
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,827
and not for the black.

197
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:56,666
Asia.

198
00:09:56,734 --> 00:10:00,635
Lock this in
your safe for me.

199
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:02,404
I may come back for it.

200
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,005
But if anything
should happen to me,

201
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:10,677
open it alone and send
the letters as directed

202
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,812
for brother Junius
and sister Rosalie.

203
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,684
And one other, to
whom it may concern.

204
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,253
A Confederate
doing duty upon

205
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,255
his own
responsibility,

206
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:27,793
J. Wilkes Booth.

207
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,597
Abraham Lincoln: Hmm.

208
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,568
I will fix that
for you, son.

209
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,737
We'll put a fine
point on it.

210
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,672
Tom Hanks: On
February 5th, 1865,

211
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,240
Abraham Lincoln visits
Alexander Gardner's

212
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:48,910
photographic studio.

213
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:52,113
Abraham Lincoln: Are
we ready, Mr. Gardner?

214
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,614
Alexander Gardner:
Aye, that I am,

215
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:55,015
Mister President.

216
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,117
Now, if you wouldn't
me mind moving to the

217
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,785
other side of the table.

218
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,720
That angle favors you.

219
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:03,189
Tom Hanks: After four
years and more casualties

220
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,891
than in any conflict in
the nation's history,

221
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,561
the Civil War
is almost over.

222
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:11,763
But the image made on
this day will be the

223
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,499
last official portrait
ever taken of the

224
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:18,603
16th President of
the United States.

225
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,408
Abraham Lincoln
has six weeks to live.

226
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,009
Abraham Lincoln: Taddy.

227
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:26,012
With malice toward none;

228
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,781
with charity for all;

229
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:32,184
with firmness in the
right as God gives

230
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,520
us to see the right,

231
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:40,526
let us strive on to
finish the work we are in;

232
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:44,864
to bind up the
nation's wounds;

233
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:50,737
to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just

234
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:56,210
and a lasting peace
among ourselves and

235
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,614
with all nations.

236
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,882
Tom Hanks:
Booth is there.

237
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,987
A face in the crowd on the
steps of the east portico.

238
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,193
On March 17th, 1865,

239
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:16,262
Booth and two
boyhood friends,

240
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,765
along with Confederate
agent Lewis Powell and

241
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,968
smuggler George Atzerodt,
lay in wait along the

242
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,837
President's route
to visit the

243
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:26,639
Campbell Military Hospital.

244
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:29,943
But Lincoln cancels
the hospital visit.

245
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,446
Booth then travels
to New York,

246
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,214
where he learns of a
Confederate plot to

247
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:36,517
kill Lincoln by
planting explosives

248
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:39,253
in the White House.

249
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,264
<i>[faint crying]</i>

250
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,484
Abraham Lincoln:
Who is dead in

251
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,352
the White House?

252
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,987
Honor Guard Soldier:
The President.

253
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:13,525
He was killed
by an assassin.

254
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>[crying becomes louder]</i>

255
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:27,140
<i>[music builds dramaticly]</i>

256
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,711
Tom Hanks: Lincoln
awakens from a dream

257
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,246
of his own death.

258
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:37,915
According to
one account,

259
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,884
it is in the early
morning hours of April 2nd

260
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:44,320
and Lincoln is aboard the
steamship River Queen.

261
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:46,355
He has left Washington
to visit the warfront

262
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,557
where General
Ulysses S. Grant

263
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,192
is poised to capture
the Confederate capital

264
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,128
of Richmond, Virginia.

265
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:57,298
<i>[cannon fire]</i>

266
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:01,268
Abraham Lincoln has
13 days to live.

267
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:07,874
<i>[female singing]</i>

268
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:10,943
Tom Hanks: On
April 3nd, 1865,

269
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:13,813
Confederate forces set
fire to their own capital

270
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,415
of Richmond, Virginia
before evacuating ahead of

271
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:20,118
advancing Union troops.

272
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:21,653
Confederate president
Jefferson Davis

273
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,421
escapes by train.

274
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,992
Abandons his White
House of the Confederacy.

275
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,427
And Abraham Lincoln
lands in Richmond to

276
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:34,565
view the devastated ruins
of this American city.

277
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,072
Soldier: Form up!

278
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,147
Abraham Lincoln: Do
any of you know the

279
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,549
way to General
Weitzel's headquarters?

280
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,517
Freed Slave:
Yas-suh, Master Lincoln.

281
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:55,785
I know the way!

282
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,522
Admiral Porter:
Fix bayonets!

283
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:09,531
<i>[train whistles].</i>

284
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,932

<i>[whistle].</i>

Crook: Window.

00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,875
Abraham Lincoln:
Thank God I have

288
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:25,179
lived to see
this day.

289
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:27,982
On we go.

290
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:36,658
Tad Lincoln: Papa-day.

291
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,663
Old Slave: May de
good Lord bless and

292
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,334
keep you safe,
Massa Lincoln.

293
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,772
Abraham Lincoln:
You are a free citizen

294
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,474
of this republic.

295
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,075
Kneel to God only.

296
00:15:56,143 --> 00:16:01,549
And thank him for the
liberty that is yours.

297
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,122
Tom Hanks: It's one of
the most unforgettable

298
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,358
scenes in
American history.

299
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,027
An American President
walking the streets of a

300
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:16,932
fallen rebel capital in
the midst of a Civil War.

301
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,905
Scarcely 36 hours
after Jefferson Davis

302
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,973
has fled his capital,

303
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,642
Abraham Lincoln
arrives at the

304
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,045
surrendered home of the
Confederate president.

305
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,981
Crook: I am informed
that General Weitzel

306
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:35,116
is on his way, sir.

307
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:39,721
And this is Mrs. O'Melia,
the housekeeper.

308
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:43,091
Abraham Lincoln: Ma'am,
might you direct me to

309
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,496
President Davis' desk?

310
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:02,978
So this must have been
President Davis' chair.

311
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,661
Tom Hanks:
Jefferson Davis will soon

312
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:22,263
be captured in Georgia.

313
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,098
He will die 24
years later,

314
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,567
at the age of 81.

315
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:29,971
Abraham Lincoln:
This is whence

316
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:38,014
Mr. Jefferson Davis has
conducted his war, Tad.

317
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,851
Tom Hanks: But
Abraham Lincoln has

318
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,257
less than 11
days to live.

319
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:50,861
Abraham Lincoln: Might I
have a glass of water?

320
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,530
Tom Hanks: Ironically,
on this day,

321
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:55,466
Tad's 12th birthday,
April 4th, 1865,

322
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,300
the immediate danger
to the President

323
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,735
is not in Richmond.

324
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:01,404
It's on its way
to Washington.

325
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:04,874
Sergeant Thomas Harney,
an explosives expert

326
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,443
with the Confederate
Torpedo Bureau,

327
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,445
has already been
dispatched on a secret

328
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,346
mission to blow up
the White House and

329
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,114
Lincoln in it.

330
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,616
And there is sound evidence
that John Wilkes Booth

331
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,318
learns of the plot
while in New York,

332
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,554
at the same time that
Abraham Lincoln is

333
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,922
walking the streets
of Richmond.

334
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,890
Southern Gentleman:
Sergeant Harney is with

335
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,226
Colonel Mosby in
Virginia as we speak,

336
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,161
seeking to infiltrate
Washington at the

337
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,462
earliest convenience.

338
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,330
John Wilkes Booth:
And Jefferson Davis has

339
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:37,035
sanctioned this
harebrained incendiary scheme?

340
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:40,037
I see.

341
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,440
And it is true that
President Davis escaped

342
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:44,074
intact from Richmond?

343
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,442
Southern Gentleman: Yes.

344
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,477
Thank heaven he is
safely bound for Danville.

345
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:53,180
You seem troubled.

346
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,015
John Wilkes Booth:
Troubled?

347
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,717
I?

348
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,519
For four years I have
lived not daring to

349
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:02,188
express my thoughts
or sentiments,

350
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:06,157
even in my own home,
constantly hearing every

351
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:10,993
principle dear to my heart
denounced as treasonable.

352
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,763
And I have cursed
my willful idleness,

353
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,066
begun to deem
myself a coward.

354
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:20,969
And to despise
my own existence.

355
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,870
Richmond has fallen,

356
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:25,472
in a war against
the Constitution,

357
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,007
against states' rights,

358
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,642
against Southern rights
and institutions.

359
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,846
And a malignant tyrant,
a half-breed,

360
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,649
low-mannered, country
buffoon is threatening

361
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,853
to proclaim himself king.

362
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,626
I should have killed
him on Inauguration Day.

363
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:48,662
I could have.

364
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:53,902
I was that close.

365
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,070
And now, if the South
is to be aided at all

366
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,672
it must be done quickly.

367
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,942
And it may already
be too late.

368
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:04,579
Troubled, gentlemen?

369
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:10,384
When Caesar conquered
the enemies of Rome and

370
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:12,419
the power that was
his menaced the

371
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:18,592
liberties of the people,
Brutus arose and slew him.

372
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,662
Troubled?

373
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,664
Not at all.

374
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,368
I stand with Brutus.

375
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,338
Tom Hanks: Lincoln
might have remained

376
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,073
in Virginia, on the
battlefront with

377
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,708
General Grant.

378
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,543
He might even have been
present to witness

379
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:37,045
Robert E. Lee's
surrender on April 9th.

380
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,447
But, as fate
would have it,

381
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,449
Secretary of State
William Seward

382
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,317
and his son, Frederick,

383
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:45,687
are victims of a carriage
accident in Washington.

384
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:48,390
<i>[door creaks].</i>

385
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,725
Abraham Lincoln:
William?

386
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,459
William Bell:
Mr. President.

387
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,094
Frederick Seward:
Mr. Lincoln, sir.

388
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,096
Abraham Lincoln:
Frederick!

389
00:20:55,164 --> 00:21:00,535
Is your father able
to tolerate a friend?

390
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:05,641
Frederick Seward:
This way.

391
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,523
Tom Hanks: Seward's jaw
is broken in two places

392
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,091
and his right
arm is fractured.

393
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,461
So on April 9th,
unaware of Lee's surrender,

394
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,931
Lincoln returns to
Washington to visit

395
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:30,767
his injured
Secretary of State.

396
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:34,204
Abraham Lincoln: I think
we near the end at last.

397
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:38,408
Richmond is back in
the arms of the Union.

398
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:42,013
I walked her streets.

399
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,515
I sat in Jeff Davis'
own chair.

400
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,885
<i>[laughs]</i>

401
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:49,821
Miss Fanny.

402
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:50,888
Fanny Seward:
Thank you for coming,

403
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,823
Mister President.

404
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:54,391
Abraham Lincoln: How
could I stay away when

405
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,393
my Secretary of State
is rendered in such

406
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,162
a way as he
cannot but listen?

407
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,797
<i>[laughs]</i>

408
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:05,670
I have worked my own hand
as hard as at sawing wood,

409
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,173
so many others'
hands have I shaken.

410
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,275
I've been to Libby Prison.

411
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:13,712
General Weitzel asked
me point blank how

412
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,814
to treat the defeated
Confederate soldiers.

413
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:19,484
I told him to
let them up easy.

414
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,729
My old friend.

415
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,865
Tom Hanks: It is
close to 10 PM when

416
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,934
Secretary of War Stanton
delivers to Lincoln

417
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,970
the telegram reporting
that Robert E. Lee

418
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:40,606
has surrendered.

419
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:42,674
The next day,
Washington City

420
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,643
is in full celebration.

421
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,779
A crowd gathers in front
of the White House to

422
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:49,683
serenade Lincoln and to
call for him to speak.

423
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:52,986
He politely promises a
speech the next night

424
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,989
and requests that
the band play the

425
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,658
Confederate anthem.

426
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:00,727
He asks them to
play "Dixie."

430
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,273
John Wilkes Booth:
Thank you, Mr. Powell.

431
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,942
James Powell: Payne.

432
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,143
It's Payne.

433
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,878
Not Powell.

434
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:20,883
I ain't goin' by
Powell no more.

435

Abraham Lincoln: Let
us all join in doing

the acts necessary.

437

Tom Hanks: On
Tuesday, April 11th,

438
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:27,924
faithful to his promise,

439
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,592
Lincoln speaks from
the north portico

440
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,127
of the White House.

441
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:33,328
Booth is there.

442
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:36,265
Abraham Lincoln: It is
also unsatisfactory to

443
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,767
some that the elective
franchise is not

444
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,469
given to the colored man.

445
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:43,104
I would myself prefer.

446
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,708
John Wilkes Booth: That
means nigger citizenship.

447

Abraham Lincoln: On the
very intelligent and

448
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:51,414
on those who serve
our cause as soldiers.

449
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,450
Some 12,000 voters.

450
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,719
John Wilkes Booth:
Shoot him.

451
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:59,055
Draw your revolver
and shoot him now.

452
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:00,857
James Powell:
There's people.

453
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:03,926
John Wilkes Booth:
There are always people.

454
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,930
I wonder,
Mr. Powell or Mr. Payne,

455
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:08,365
in spite of your
reputation,

Mr. Herold here does not.

David Herold: Oh, no,
there's no call for that.

00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,639
James Powell: I
got what it takes.

460
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:17,207
John Wilkes Booth:
Now, by God,

461
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:19,009
I will put him through.

462
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:23,647
That is the last speech
he will ever make.

463

Robert E. Lee's surrender

Fireworks and cannon

On April 13th, Booth
visits Grover's Theater

00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,225

a production of

"Aladdin! or His
Wonderful Lamp"

Good Friday.

Booth arranges for
a ticket to the box

co-conspirators that the
plan has changed from

481

kidnapping to murder.

482
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,879
That on April 14th,
Lewis Powell will kill

00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:24,081
Secretary of
State Seward.

484
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,783
David Herold will
accompany Powell and

485
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,451
lead him across the
Navy Yard Bridge

486
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,886
and into Maryland.

487
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:31,456
George Atzerodt will kill
Vice President Johnson

488
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:33,891
in his room at the
Kirkwood House Hotel.

489
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:36,794
And Booth will kill
Lincoln during the

490
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:37,996
performance
of "Aladdin"

491
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:41,466
at Grover's Theater.

492
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,680
<i>[watch ticking].</i>

493
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:57,115
Tom Hanks: With
little more than

494
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,550
24 hours to live,

495
00:25:58,618 --> 00:26:00,185
Abraham Lincoln
rises at 7:00 AM

496
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:02,054
and writes four
brief messages,

497
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,022
including one
instructing acting

498
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,690
Secretary of State
Frederick Seward

499
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,860
to call a cabinet
meeting for 11:00 AM,

500
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:13,263
then joins his family
at breakfast to find his

501
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,431
eldest son, Robert,

502
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,299
just returned
from witnessing

503
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,435
the surrender
at Appomattox.

504
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:20,782
Robert Todd Lincoln:
General Lee,

505
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:22,170
stately, elegant.

506
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:24,306
His uniform spotless.

507
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:28,843
With a jeweled sword
and shining spurs.

508
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,544
And General Grant,

509
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:33,680
so shabby in a
muddy blue uniform,

510
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,115
borrowed
from a private.

511
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:37,050
Abraham Lincoln:
<i>[laughs]</i>

512
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,618
Robert Todd Lincoln:
It, it was great.

513
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:44,758
Oh and here is Lee.

514
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,160
Tad Lincoln:
Papa-day, let me see!

515
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:49,495
Can I see it?

516
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:50,629
Can I have it?

517
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:52,231
Mary Todd Lincoln:
Wait a moment, Tad.

518
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:53,799
Abraham Lincoln:
Now that is the face

519
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,100
of a noble man.

520
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,971
And brave.

521
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,608
Listen to me, Robert.

522
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:04,845
You must lay aside
your uniform.

523
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,748
Return to college.

524
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,383
Read law for three years.

525
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:11,519
And at the end of that
time I hope that we will

526
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:13,155
be able to tell
whether you will

527
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:14,557
make a lawyer or not.

528
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:15,958
Robert Todd Lincoln:
Yes, sir.

529
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:18,360
And I will, sir.

530
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,096
Tom Hanks:
Shortly before 11 AM,

531
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,698
Lincoln sees Secretary
of War Edwin Stanton

532
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,900
at the War Department.

533
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,836
Abraham Lincoln:
Mr. Stanton!

534
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:31,607
Mrs. Lincoln has invited
General and Mrs. Grant

535
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:35,044
to join us at the
theater this evening.

536
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:39,015
And General Grant already
hints that they will

537
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,451
decline in favor of
taking a train to

538
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,386
New Jersey to visit
with their children.

539
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,723
I trust that you have had
no occasion to encourage

540
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,227
this desertion in the
face of entertainment.

541
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,828
Edwin Stanton:
Had I the occasion,

542
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:55,532
I would have seized it.

543
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:59,836
I am sorry, sir, but it
is a fact that rumors of

544
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,806
assassination schemes
are everywhere now.

545
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,408
It remains a constant
subject of concern

546
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,878
between myself
and Mr. Seward,

547
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:09,780
even in the face
of his recovery.

548
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,348
Abraham Lincoln: The
doors to the White House

549
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,084
stand open to
one and all,

550
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,786
day and night,
Stanton.

551
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:20,190
My life is within reach
of anyone, sane or mad.

552
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:24,495
By the hand of a
murderer I can die but once,

553
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:29,467
but to, to go
continually in fear,

554
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:35,539
why that is to die over
and over and over again.

555
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,912
John Wilkes Booth:
Will you be attending

556
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:49,954
the theater tonight?

557
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,689
"Aladdin" is
playing at Grover's.

558
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:52,890
Barber: No, sir.

559
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,258
I'm afraid not, sir.

560
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:56,527
John Wilkes Booth: Pity.

561
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:59,963
There will be some fine
acting there tonight.

562
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,465
Ulysses S. Grant:
The officers could keep

563
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,832
their side-arms.

564
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,667
Abraham Lincoln: And
what terms did you make

565
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:08,203
for the common soldiers?

566
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,642
Ulysses S. Grant:
I told them to go

567
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,344
back to their
homes and families

568
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:20,514
with a promise to not
again take up arms

569
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:22,749
against the United
States of America.

570
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,517
Abraham Lincoln:
Quite simple.

571
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,485
And quite right.

572
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:29,187
Which brings to mind how
very providential it is

573
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:31,322
that this rebellion
was crushed just as

574
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,891
Congress has adjourned.

575
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:37,827
There are men in Congress
who harbor feelings of

576
00:29:37,895 --> 00:29:42,064
hate and vindictiveness
toward the South.

577
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:46,635
But there will be no
persecution when this

578
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,870
war is over.

579
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,438
No bloody work.

580
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:53,743
We must bend every effort
to reanimate the South,

581
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,111
to put her state
governments in order

582
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,980
and to reestablish
the Union before

583
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,817
Congress reconvenes.

584
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:05,754
Still no word from
General Sherman?

585
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:08,957
Ulysses S. Grant: We
are hourly expecting it.

586
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:11,093
Abraham Lincoln: It
will be good news.

587
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,795
General Sherman
will have secured

588
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:15,764
Johnston's surrender.

589
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:19,134
I, I know this
because I have had

590
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:22,705
the dream last night.

591
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,241
I've had it before.

592
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:27,243
It's always
the same and

593
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:30,947
invariably followed
by favorable news.

594
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,182
As Secretary
of the Navy,

595
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,784
it has to do with
your element,

596
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,119
Mr. Welles.

597
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:37,653
Water.

598
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:42,491
I am in some
kind of vessel,

599
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,094
in the dream.

600
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:49,164
And always moving
with rapidity toward

601
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:52,768
an indefinite shore.

602
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:55,504
Tom Hanks: In an aside,
General Grant informs the

603
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:58,073
president that his wife
insists upon them leaving

604
00:30:58,141 --> 00:30:59,475
on the afternoon train.

605
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:02,477
They will not be
attending the theater.

606
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:06,181
Shortly before noon,
John Wilkes Booth stops

607
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,517
at Ford's Theater,
as is his daily custom,

608
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:09,985
to pick up his mail.

609
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,252
Harry Ford: Well,
here's the man who

610
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,454
don't like General Lee.

611
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,688
Here for his mail.

612
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,290
John Wilkes Booth:
I told you, Harry,

613
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:16,792
I don't like the
way he surrendered.

614
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,761
Given his sword by
the Senate in Richmond

615
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,897
and swearing an oath
never to give it up,

616
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,799
he should have died on
the battlefield before

617
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:25,068
rendering his
Southern manhood

618
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,536
to the butcher, Grant.

619
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,971
<i>[chuckles].</i>

620
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,741
That's what I said, Harry
and it's what I meant.

621
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:32,876
Now let's just hope he's
not paraded through the

622
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:35,913
streets as the Romans
did their captives, huh?

623
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,414
Thank you, Raybold.

624
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:38,949
Harry Ford: Well, I'll
be sure to ask the

625
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,338
President his plan
in that regard.

626
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:41,485
John Wilkes Booth:
The President?

627
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,487
You mean the buffoon who
walked into Jeff Davis'

628
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:46,556
house in Richmond, threw
his legs over the chair

629
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:48,792
and spit tobacco juice
all over the place?

630
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,628
<i>[men laughing].</i>

631
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,163
Harry Ford: He
don't chew tobacco,

632
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,432
John or I woulda put
a spittoon in the

633
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,167
Presidential
Box tonight.

634
00:31:57,235 --> 00:31:58,903
A messenger for Mr.
Lincoln called this

635
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,304
morning for tickets.

636
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:02,873
For them and General
and Mrs. Grant.

637
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:04,208
Maybe we'll have
Robert E. Lee

638
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:05,743
and old Jefferson
Davis himself in

639
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,413
another box, both
of them in chains.

640
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:09,581
John Wilkes Booth:
I thought he was

641
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:13,051
attending
Grover's tonight.

642
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:33,105
<i>[singing "Honor</i>
<i>to Our Soldiers"].</i>

643
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:51,255
Tom Hanks: Booth goes
to Pumphrey's stable

644
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,958
to reserve a horse,
then to write a letter,

645
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:55,893
a confession,
an explanation,

646
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,228
a manifesto,

647
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,429
signed by him on
behalf of himself,

648
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:02,567
Lewis Powell, David Herold
and George Atzerodt.

649
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,436
Meanwhile, Mr. and
Mrs. Lincoln take a

650
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,537
carriage ride, alone.

651
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,972
According to
Mary Todd Lincoln,

652
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,640
she has never
seen her husband so

653
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,175
supremely cheerful.

654
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,076
They talk about
the past,

655
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:14,444
about the death
of their son,

656
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:16,346
Willie, three
years before,

657
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,814
about the future,

658
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:20,049
traveling abroad and
Lincoln's plan to

659
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,584
return to his
law practice.

660
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,286
Lincoln tells Mary that
on this particular day

661
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:29,757
he feels that the war
has come to a close.

662
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,559
They end up at the
Washington Navy Yard,

663
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:33,394
where Lincoln summons
a young naval officer,

664
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:35,729
William H. Flood.

665
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:36,997
William H. Flood:
Mrs. Lincoln.

666
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,665
Abraham Lincoln: Mother,
the last time we saw

667
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,967
young Flood here, we
were in Springfield.

668
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,335
I was a lawyer and
he was but knee-high

669
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:44,737
to a grasshopper.

670
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:48,039
His mother was kin
with Governor Carlin.

671
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:49,907
Mary Todd Lincoln: Oh, I
remember Priscilla Flood.

672
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:52,976
Abraham Lincoln: And his
father served with me

673
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,478
in the Illinois
State Legislature.

674
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:59,014
A Democrat, but, uh, a
friend and a good man,

675
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:02,417
despite his fervent
support of my opponent

676
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,152
for the presidency.

677
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,655
William H. Flood:
Sins of the father, sir.

678
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,283
Abraham Lincoln:
Never a sin to stand up

679
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,591
for what you believe.

680
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,127
Now, Flood, tell me,
which is the vessel

681
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:13,495
with the history?

682
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:16,198
William H. Flood:
Well, Mr. Lincoln,

683
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,700
they've all been
mussing around

684
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,202
under fire quite a lot,

685
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:22,605
but I guess you mean
the Montauk over there.

686
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:24,174
She's got the
hardest hitting.

687
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:26,610
Been in the
tightest spots.

688
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:27,777
Abraham Lincoln:
The very one, Flood.

689
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,212
Show her to me.

690
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,015
Mother?

691
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:43,127
Tom Hanks: At 4:30, a
group of Confederate

692
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,262
prisoners of war is
being escorted from the

693
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,832
Navy Yard and up
Pennsylvania Avenue

694
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,833
when Booth encounters
his friend,

695
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:53,136
the actor John Mathews.

696
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:04,748
John Wilkes Booth:
Great God,

697
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,350
I have no longer
a country!

698
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,652
John Mathews: What's
the matter, John?

699
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,153
John Wilkes Booth:
Mathews,

700
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:11,455
I have a favor to ask you.

701
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:13,223
Will you grant it?

702
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,258
I may have to leave
town tonight and

703
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,392
I have a letter here,

704
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,827
which I desire to
be published in

705
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,863
the National
Intelligencer.

706
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,398
Please attend to it for
me unless I see you

707
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:25,234
before 10 o'clock tomorrow.

708
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,370
John Mathews: Why, there
goes General Grant.

709
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:28,705
John Wilkes Booth: Where?

710
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:30,006
Come on!

711
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,908
Tom Hanks: General and
Mrs. Grant will later

712
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,510
recall the horseman
who peered into their

713
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:36,479
carriage twice on its way
to the train station.

714
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:38,682
The actor John Mathews
will be on stage

715
00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:41,585
that evening at
Ford's Theater.

716
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:44,521
The next day he will
burn the letter.

717
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,356
The signed confession
given to him by

718
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:49,024
John Wilkes Booth.

719
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:52,260
Abraham Lincoln has
less than 15 hours to live.

720
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,102
<i>[audience laughter].</i>

721
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,070
Lord Dundreary: You see,
I gave her a draught

722
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,305
that cured the
effect of the draught.

723
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,840
And that draught was a
draft that didn't pay

724
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,242
the doctor's bill.

725
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:11,409
Florence Trenchard:
Good gracious!

726
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:13,378
What a number
of draughts.

727
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:14,646
Florence Trenchard:
You have almost a

728
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,181
game of draughts.

729
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:17,483
<i>[audience laughter].</i>

730
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,918
Florence Trenchard:
What's the matter?

731
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,389
Lord Dundreary: That
was a joke, that was.

732
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:21,723
Florence Trenchard:
Where's the joke?

733
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,091
Lord Dundreary:
She don't see it.

734
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,726
<i>[audience laughter].</i>

735
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:28,664
Florence Trenchard: Why,
anybody can see that.

736
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:37,572
<i>[audience applauding].</i>

737
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:47,716
<i>[orchestra plays</i>
<i>"Hail to the Chief"].</i>

738
00:36:55,392 --> 00:37:01,397
<i>[applause continues].</i>

739
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,572
Tom Hanks: At
roughly 8:30 PM,

740
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,075
the Lincolns arrive
at Ford's Theater,

741
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:14,009
driven by coachman
Francis Burke and

742
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,845
footman Charles Forbes.

743
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,715
Abraham Lincoln:
Mr. Forbes, Mr. Parker,

744
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,917
I hope that you both
might enjoy the play.

745
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:23,787
Tom Hanks: Since
November of 1864,

746
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,356
four officers of the
Metropolitan Police

747
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,826
have been detailed to
protect the President.

748
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:34,030
On this night,
John Parker is on duty.

749
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:37,167
As last-minute
replacements for

750
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,169
General and Mrs. Grant,
Mrs. Lincoln invites her

751
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:41,271
dear friend,
Clara Harris,

752
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,673
in the company
of her fiancé,

753
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:46,877
Major Henry
Reed Rathbone.

754
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:51,645
<i>[audience applause].</i>

755
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,247
Tom Hanks: The famously
self-educated Lincoln

756
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,750
is an enthusiastic
lover of theater.

757
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,586
But during the war
he is drawn to comedy,

758
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:03,156
telling Noah Brooks that
"a farce, or comedy,

759
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,258
is best played;

760
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:09,661
a tragedy is best
read at home."

761
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,462
A last-minute meeting
with Lewis Powell,

762
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,565
David Herold
and George Atzerodt

763
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,533
has just concluded.

764
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,602
The coordinated attack
that Booth outlined on

765
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:22,240
April 13th is to go
into effect immediately.

766
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,108
At 10:15 Lewis Powell
is to kill

767
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,176
Secretary of State Seward

768
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:28,779
in his home on
Lafayette Square.

769
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,715
David Herold will
guide Powell out of

770
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,317
the city via
the Navy Yard Bridge.

771
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,119
George Atzerodt is
to kill

772
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,888
Vice President Johnson

773
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:39,124
at the
Kirkwood House Hotel.

774
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,260
The only change in the
plan is that Booth

775
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:44,263
will not be attending
"Aladdin" at Grover's!

776
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:47,733
Harry Ford:
Hello, John.

777
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,775
Tom Hanks: He will kill
Lincoln at Ford's Theater.

778
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:57,810
Murcott: I am harmless
except to myself.

779
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,045
Florence Trenchard:
Speak on, sir.

780
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:00,213
I hear you.

781
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,415
Tom Hanks: It is
still early in act two.

782
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,517
Booth has calculated that
the appointed time of

783
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:08,321
10:15 will fall at the
beginning of act three of

784
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,556
"Our American Cousin"
and there will be an

785
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:13,626
intermission
between the acts.

786
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,299
Booth retrieves his horse
from Pumphrey's stable.

787
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,783
<i>[knock at door].</i>

788
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,490
John Wilkes Booth:
Mister Spangler,

789
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:47,427
hold this mare for
me 10 or 15 minutes.

790
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:49,496
Mind you, she's a
bad little bitch.

791
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:50,830
Edman Spangler:
I can't, Mr. Booth.

792
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:51,998
It's almost intermission.

793
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:53,833
I gotta shift scenery.

794
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:55,268
John Wilkes Booth:
May I cross backstage?

795
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:56,837
Edman Spangler: You're
gonna have to cross under.

796
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,306
And I can't
keep the horse.

797
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:01,041
Just go with him,
DeBonay and tell Peanuts

798
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,744
to come here and
hold this damned horse.

799
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:06,145
Florence Trenchard:
Mr. Asa Trenchard,

800
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:07,447
our American cousin.

801

962
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:47,735
Is he dead?

963
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:50,437
Someone answer me!

964
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:53,273
Help him!

965
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:55,207
Oh, God.

966
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:56,709
Dr. Charles Leale:
I'm checking for

967
00:47:56,776 --> 00:48:00,412
hemorrhage of the
subclavial artery.

968
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,313
Wait.

969
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,214
I found it.

970
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,381
A hole.

971
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:06,183
And there's a clot.

972
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:11,521
<i>[audience screaming].</i>

973
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,857
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

974
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,125
Dr. Charles Leale:
It's a bullet wound.

975
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,693
Occipital bone here.

976
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,362
Removal of a clot
has relieved pressure

977
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,797
on the brain.

978
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,098
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

979
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,165
Lieutenant Bolton:
Ladies!

980
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,333
Gentleman!

981
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,701
The President is being
attended by physicians!

982
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,289
Please make your way
in orderly fashion

983
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,904
to the street!

984
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,706
Dr. Charles Leale: I'm
opening up his larynx for

985
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:32,073
a free passage of air.

986
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,308
I need you and you
to lift his arms and

987
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:35,976
manipulate them
back and forth.

988
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:39,446
Up and down to
expand his thorax.

989
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:42,081
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

990
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:48,521
Dr. Charles Leale:
Feeble.

991
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:51,291
Respiration not
satisfactory.

992
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,561
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

993
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:03,466
Maj. Rathbone:
Here, here's brandy!

994
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:07,236
Keene: May I
hold his head?

995
00:49:07,304 --> 00:49:11,839
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing]</i>

996
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,274
Tell me!

997
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:15,342
<i>[sobbing]</i>

998
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,446
Tell me, is he alive?

999
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:22,149
Tom Hanks: At 10:35,

1000
00:49:22,216 --> 00:49:24,050
20 minutes after
shooting the President,

1001
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:26,219
Booth arrives at the
Navy Yard Bridge,

1002
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:28,655
his escape route
into Maryland.

1003
00:49:28,722 --> 00:49:30,856
Sgt. Silas T. Cobb

1004
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,725
of the 13th Regiment
Massachusetts

1005
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:35,427
Heavy Artillery
is on sentry duty.

1006
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:36,294
Sgt. Silas Cobb: Halt!

1007
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:37,362
Who goes?

1008
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,596
John Wilkes Booth:
A friend.

1009
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:39,664
Sgt. Silas Cobb:
Name?

1010
00:49:39,732 --> 00:49:41,666
John Wilkes Booth:
My name is Booth.

1011
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:42,734
Sgt. Silas Cobb:
Where from?

1012
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:44,870
John Wilkes Booth:
I'm from the city.

1013
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:46,571
Sgt. Silas Cobb:
Where are you headed?

1014
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,542
John Wilkes Booth:
Down home, Charles County.

1015
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:50,709
Sgt. Silas Cobb:
What town?

1016
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:51,977
John Wilkes Booth: I
don't live in a town.

1017
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:54,346
I live near Beantown.

1018
00:49:54,414 --> 00:49:55,514
Sgt. Silas Cobb:
I don't know where

1019
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:57,016
that place is, friend.

1020
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:58,517
But do you know it's
against the law to cross

1021
00:49:58,585 --> 00:50:00,586
here after nine o'clock?

1022
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:02,255
What is your object to be
in town so late when you

1023
00:50:02,323 --> 00:50:03,557
got so far to travel?

1024
00:50:03,624 --> 00:50:05,091
John Wilkes Booth:
It is a dark road.

1025
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,094
I thought if I waited
'til now I should have the

1026
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:10,931
light of this moon to
help me see my way.

1027
00:50:10,998 --> 00:50:14,768
Sgt. Silas Cobb: Well,
I will let you pass,

1028
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:17,170
but I don't know
as I ought to.

1029
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:19,073
John Wilkes Booth:
Hell, there'll be no

1030
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,477
trouble about that.

1031
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:31,188
Man: Make way.

1032
00:50:31,256 --> 00:50:34,525
Make way!

1033
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:44,905
To the White House.

1034
00:50:44,972 --> 00:50:46,373
We must take him
to the White House.

1035
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,009
Dr. Charles Leale: No,
he will die on the way.

1036
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:50,076
Dr. Charles Taft:
The saloon.

1037
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:51,145
Here, next door.

1038
00:50:51,212 --> 00:50:52,346
Peter Taltavul: No!

1039
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:53,748
No, it should
not be said the

1040
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:55,049
President of
the United States

1041
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:56,851
died in a saloon.

1042
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:59,219
Not even my own.

1043
00:50:59,287 --> 00:51:01,055
Lieutenant Bolton: Doctor,
give me your commands and

1044
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:02,690
I will see to it that
they will be carried out.

1045
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:04,325
Dr. Charles Leale: As I
said, across the street,

1046
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:05,660
to the nearest house.

1047
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:06,594
Lieutenant Bolton:
Make a path!

1048
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:09,664
Let us pass!

1049
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:14,135
Dr. Charles Leale:
Stop, stop!

1050
00:51:16,472 --> 00:51:18,306
<i>[grunts].</i>

1051
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:21,042
Abraham Lincoln:
<i>[gasping breath].</i>

1052
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,345
Dr. Charles Leale:
<i>[grunts].</i>

1053
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:26,481
William H. Flood: The
house opposite is closed.

1054
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,117
Henry S. Stafford:
Here, here!

1055
00:51:29,185 --> 00:51:32,387
Bring him here.

1056
00:51:32,455 --> 00:51:33,855
Dr. Charles Leale:
Go, go, go.

1057
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,290
Man: Clear the way, please.

1058
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,126
Out of the way, please.

1059
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:40,035
Tom Hanks: Lincoln is
taken to a boarding house

1060
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:42,830
directly across the
street from the theater and,

1061
00:51:42,898 --> 00:51:46,534
due to his 6'4" height,
laid diagonally on the bed

1062
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:49,070
of absent boarder,
William Clark.

1063
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:51,139
Shorty after 11:00
PM, Secretary of War

1064
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:53,641
Edwin Stanton sets up
a headquarters in the

1065
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:56,378
back parlor of the house
and establishes relays

1066
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:57,979
between there and
the War Department

1067
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,115
telegraph operators.

1068
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:02,317
He alerts General Grant
and calls him back to

1069
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:05,487
Washington, issues
emergency directives to

1070
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,322
police and military
authorities,

1071
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,691
orders the National
Detective Police,

1072
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,795
to initiate a manhunt
for the as-yet unknown

1073
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:16,432
assassin and notifies
Vice President Johnson

1074
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,067
that the
President is dying.

1075
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,635
And shortly
before midnight,

1076
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:23,836
Chief Justice David
Kellogg Cartter begins to

1077
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:27,773
hear eyewitness
testimony of the crime.

1078
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,375
But the appointed
stenographer cannot

1079
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:32,277
write fast enough.

1080
00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:34,012
General Christopher Augur:
Is there anyone here who

1081
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,149
knows the practice of
shorthand writing?

1082
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:39,183
Albert Daggett: Here!

1083
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:40,551
There's a boarder
here who does!

1084
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,352
General Christopher Augur:
Tell him that his services

1085
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,487
are required here.

1086
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:46,523
Immediately.

1087
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,525
Albert Daggett: Jim,
it's General Augur.

1088
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:53,494
They want you next door.

1089
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:59,367
Corporal James Tanner:
Tell him I'll be right there.

1090
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,279
<i>[clock ticking].</i>

<i>[gun clicks].</i>

1092
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:11,552
Tom Hanks: Minutes after
John Wilkes Booth crosses

1093
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,821
the Navy Yard Bridge,
Sergeant Cobb stops

1094
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,523
David Herold,
riding a gray roan horse.

1095
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:18,992
Herold asks if a rider
has passed here and

1096
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,762
Cobb tells him,
"Yes," and lets him pass.

1097
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:25,731
David Herold's job on
April 14th is to guide

1098
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:27,732
Lewis Powell out of
Washington after killing

1099
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,700
Secretary of State Seward.

1100
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,234
But hearing the
cries of "Murder"

1101
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:32,602
from Seward's house.

1102
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,070
Fanny Seward: Murder!

1103
00:53:34,138 --> 00:53:35,904
He's killing my father!

1104
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:37,339
Tom Hanks: Herold
flees the scene,

1105
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,807
not waiting for Powell.

1106
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:40,475
He catches up with
Booth at Soper's Hill,

1107
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,209
eight miles from
Washington.

1108
00:53:42,277 --> 00:53:44,244
And it's a little after
midnight when they arrive

1109
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:46,779
at a safe house for
Confederate spies.

1110

<i>[banging on door]</i>

1111
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:50,449

God's sake, Lloyd,

1112
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:51,851
make haste and
get the things!

1113
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:55,585
Tom Hanks: A tavern where
weapons have been stored.

1114
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:57,687
David Herold:
Lloyd, the things!

1115
00:53:57,755 --> 00:53:59,622
Tom Hanks: A tavern
owned by the mother of

1116
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,825
Confederate courier
John Surratt.

1117
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:14,401
John Wilkes Booth: I
cannot carry a carbine.

1118
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:15,869
This little
bitch fell on me.

Stumbled while jumping.

00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:18,632
I broke my damned leg.

1121
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,898
I need a surgeon.

1122
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,633
We'll go to Sam Mudd's.

1123
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:22,767
David Herold: But, no.

1124
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:23,966
Hadn't we
oughta get down south,

1125
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,434
cross to the river,
cross into Virginia.

1126
00:54:25,502 --> 00:54:26,568
John Wilkes Booth:
I cannot go on

1127
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:28,534
without a doctor.

1128
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,569
Lloyd?

1129
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:31,603
Lloyd?

1130
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,505
John Lloyd: Huh?

1131
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:35,073
John Wilkes Booth: I am
fairly certain we have

1132
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:39,611
assassinated the
President and Secretary Seward.

1133
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Mind your damn
horse, Davey.

1134
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,816
Let's go.

1135
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,320
Tom Hanks: Meanwhile at
the Petersen boarding house,

1136
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:54,391
Corporal James Tanner,
who has lost both legs

1137
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,359
at the Second
Battle of Bull Run

1138
00:54:56,427 --> 00:55:00,163
and is just 10 days
past his 21st birthday,

1139
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,767
is about to take the
first eyewitness testimony

1140
00:55:03,835 --> 00:55:06,403
in the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln.

1141
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:10,841
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1142
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:40,569
Dr. Ezra Abbott:
Pulse 48, rising.

1143
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,372
Dr. King:
Respiration 21.

1144
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:45,607
Dr. Barnes:
Ecchymosis is setting in.

1145
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,144
Edwin Stanton:
Who are you?

1146
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,713
Corporal James Tanner: Uh,
Corporal James Tanner, sir.

1147
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,948
Uh, you're in need
of a phonologist?

1148
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,216
Edwin Stanton: What?

1149
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,017
Corporal James Tanner:
Shorthand, sir.

1150
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:59,588
Edwin Stanton:
Yes, come here.

1151
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:08,731
Mr. Hill will be asking
questions of the witnesses

1152
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,302
before Chief
Justice Cartter.

1153
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,807
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1154
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,510
Tom Hanks: The
assassination of

1155
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:19,844
Abraham Lincoln
is witnessed by

1156
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:21,812
more than 1,500 people,

1157
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,315
yet no two
accounts match.

1158
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,584
Lieutenant Crawford:
A.M.S. Crawford.

1159
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:28,386
Henry Hawk: Uh,
William Henry Hawk.

1160
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:31,555
James P. Ferguson:
Uh, James P. Ferguson.

1161
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:32,656
Lieutenant Crawford:
I thought at first

1162
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:33,724
he was intoxicated.

1163
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:36,327
There was a
glare in his eye.

1164
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,195
I turned to
Captain McGowan,

1165
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:39,530
intending to say
something in reference

1166
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:40,631
to this man's manner.

1167
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:42,733
James P. Ferguson:
I was looking with

1168
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:45,670
an opera glass to see,
uh, which citizen it was,

1169
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,071
with the President.

1170
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,172
Lieutenant Crawford:
The next instant,

1171
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,073
the shot was fired.

1172
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:50,408
<i>[gunshot].</i>

1173
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,076
Lieutenant Crawford: I
said at once it was the

1174
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,410
president's box and
jumped to the door.

1175
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:55,246
Henry Hawk: I was on stage
at the time of the firing.

1176
00:56:55,313 --> 00:56:56,347
<i>[gunshot].</i>

1177
00:56:56,415 --> 00:56:57,781
James P. Ferguson:
And he put his hands

1178
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:59,984
on the cushion
of the box and

1179
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:01,790
he threw his
feet right over.

1180
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:05,361
And he pulled part
of a state flag off.

1181
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,562
Henry Hawk: And as I
looked towards him,

1182
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,732
he came in the direction
in which I was standing.

1183
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,101
B.A. Hill:
Can you describe the

1184
00:57:11,168 --> 00:57:12,702
man's form that
jumped from the box?

1185
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:13,836
Lieutenant Crawford:
Yes, sir.

1186
00:57:13,904 --> 00:57:15,405
I saw him as he ran
across the stage.

1187
00:57:15,472 --> 00:57:17,440
James P. Ferguson:
As he ran across,

1188
00:57:17,508 --> 00:57:21,544
he looked right
up in my face.

1189
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:24,446
I, I pulled the lady
down behind the banister.

1190
00:57:24,514 --> 00:57:27,683
Lieutenant Crawford: As he
went through the scene he

1191
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:30,151
threw his hand behind
him and the knife

1192
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,853
was up in sight.

1193
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,320
Henry Hawk: He made
some expression when

1194
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:34,421
he came on the stage.

1195
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:38,058
John Wilkes Booth:
The south shall be free!

1196
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,494
Henry Hawk: But I
did not understand what.

1197
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:42,362
James P. Ferguson:
He stopped as he said.

1198
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,464
John Wilkes Booth:
I have done it!

1199
00:57:45,532 --> 00:57:47,066
James P. Ferguson:
Shook the knife.

1200
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:51,402
Lieutenant Crawford:
His face was towards me.

1201
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:53,938
He did not say a
word that I heard,

1202
00:57:54,006 --> 00:57:56,775
but very strongly
resembled the Booths.

1203
00:57:56,843 --> 00:57:58,877
Henry Hawk: I, I believe
to the best of my

1204
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:01,245
knowledge that it was
John Wilkes Booth.

1205
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:05,614
Still, uh, I'm
not positive, uh.

1206
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:14,422
Abraham Lincoln:
<i>[gasping breath].</i>

1207
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:19,667
Tom Hanks: At 4:30
AM April 15th,

1208
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:21,235
Booth and Herold
arrive at the home of

1209
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:24,707
Dr. Samuel Mudd.

1210
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:34,986
Either during
his jump from the

1211
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,454
presidential box
to the stage,

1212
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,723
or as the result of
his horse falling,

1213
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:42,725
Booth has sustained a
clean break of his fibula,

1214
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:46,695
two inches above the
instep of his left foot.

1215
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:52,466
John Wilkes Booth:
<i>[grunts in pain]</i>

1216
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:55,735
Tom Hanks: At the same
time that Dr. Samuel Mudd

1217
00:58:55,803 --> 00:58:57,970
is tending to
John Wilkes Booth,

1218
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,505
30 miles away,

1219
00:58:59,572 --> 00:59:02,307
Abraham Lincoln is dying.

1220
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:05,476
Dr. Barnes: I am
inserting a Nélaton probe.

1221
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,244
Dr. Ezra Abbott:
Pulse 60.

1222
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:11,479
Dr. King:
Respiration 24.

1223
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,448
Dr. Barnes:
At three inches,

1224
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,919
following the
track of the ball,

1225
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:22,024
there's the bone plug.

1226
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:26,294
Driven in from the skull.

1227
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:31,032
I can feel the ball
at, at five inches.

1228
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:37,004
And two inches
further, fragments.

1229
00:59:39,806 --> 00:59:43,272
Dr. Charles Leale:
The orbital plate?

1230
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,574
Dr. Barnes:
Undoubtedly.

1231
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:48,109
Dr. Charles Leale:
Perhaps we should summon

1232
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:51,409
Mrs. Lincoln.

1233
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:05,456
Dr. Barnes:
Barely perceptible.

1234
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,330
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing]</i>

1235
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:22,003
<i>[clock ticking]</i>

1236
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:24,172
<i>[gun clicks]</i>

1237
01:00:26,142 --> 01:00:27,576
Mary Todd Lincoln:
<i>[whimpering]</i>

1238
01:00:27,644 --> 01:00:29,613
It's your Mary.

1239
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:30,581
Mother.

1240
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:33,619
It's your Molly.

1241
01:00:33,687 --> 01:00:35,622
I'm here little Puss.

1242
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:37,190
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1243
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,160
Your child-wife.

1244
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:43,365
<i>[crying].</i>

1245
01:00:47,737 --> 01:00:50,673
Oh, my love.

1246
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,877
Live but one moment
to speak to me once.

1247
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,412
To speak to our children.

1248
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,814
You'd speak to little Tad,
wouldn't you, Father?

1249
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:02,083
You love him so well.

1250
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:06,722
Abraham Lincoln:
<i>[gasping breath].</i>

1251
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:11,058
Tom Hanks: Mary Lincoln
screams and faints.

1252
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,491
And Secretary of War
Stanton orders that she is

1253
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,559
to be removed
from the room.

1254
01:01:16,627 --> 01:01:19,129
As she is led away,
Corporal Tanner,

1255
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,131
transcribing his shorthand
in the back parlor,

1256
01:01:21,198 --> 01:01:23,432
overhears her to say,

1257
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,434
"Oh, my God and
I have given my

1258
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:28,137
husband to die."

1259
01:01:28,205 --> 01:01:30,505
Dr. Charles
Augustus Leale,

1260
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:32,874
the 23-year-old surgeon
who has been by the

1261
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:35,142
president's side
for nine hours,

1262
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,711
has scarcely let go
of Lincoln's hand,

1263
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:39,579
for no other reason than,

1264
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:42,582
"To let him in his
blindness know that he

1265
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:47,153
was in touch with
humanity and had a friend."

1266
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:51,858
At 21 minutes and 55
seconds past 7 AM on

1267
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:55,428
Saturday, April
15th, 1865,

1268
01:01:55,495 --> 01:01:59,664
Abraham Lincoln draws
his last breath.

1269
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:04,234
15 seconds later,
his heart stops.

1270
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:07,003
Robert Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1271
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:09,031
Tom Hanks: The Reverend
Phineas Gurley will recall

1272
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:11,875
that those present remain
motionless and silent for

1273
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:14,977
several minutes after
Surgeon General Barnes

1274
01:02:15,045 --> 01:02:16,912
says, simply.

1275
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,747
Robert Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1276
01:02:18,814 --> 01:02:23,784
Tom Hanks:
"He is gone."

1277
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,222
<i>[clock ticking]</i>

1278
01:02:31,558 --> 01:02:37,228
Edwin Stanton: Now he
belongs to the ages.

1279
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:40,463
Robert Todd Lincoln:
<i>[sobbing].</i>

1280
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:42,231
Tom Hanks: Angels.

1281
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,626
According to Corporal
Tanner, Stanton said,

1282
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:48,062
"He belongs to
the angels now."

1283
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:51,898
But Tanner was unable
to record the moment.

1284
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:55,769
His pencil had broken.

1285
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:32,702
<i>[rooster crows]</i>

1286
01:03:42,279 --> 01:03:45,081
His leg splinted and
with the aid of a crutch,

1287
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:47,116
Booth leaves Dr.
Samuel Mudd's home

1288
01:03:47,184 --> 01:03:51,454
late on the afternoon of
Saturday, April 15th.

1289
01:03:58,263 --> 01:04:00,730
Already, members of the
13th New York Cavalry have

1290
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:02,732
been ordered to southern
Maryland in search of

1291
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,501
Lincoln's killer.

1292
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:08,104
What will soon become
the largest manhunt in

1293
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:11,609
American history at that
time begins with troops

1294
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:13,444
searching scarcely
four miles from

1295
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:16,881
Dr. Mudd's farmhouse.

1296
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:23,922
Lost in the dark and on the
edge of the Zekiah swamp,

1297
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:25,723
Booth and Herold
have promised to pay

1298
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:29,160
tobacco farmer
Oswell Swann $12 to

1299
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:31,662
lead them to the
home of Samuel Cox,

1300
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,764
a leader in the
Confederate underground.

1301
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,199
John Wilkes Booth:
How is it that you

1302
01:04:35,267 --> 01:04:36,367
know Captain Cox?

1303
01:04:36,434 --> 01:04:39,070
Oswell Swann: Oh, we all
know Captain Cox, sir.

1304
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:41,272
He a true man
of the South.

1305
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,574
He a hard man.

1306
01:04:42,642 --> 01:04:44,209
Beat a nigger to
death hisself.

1307
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:45,310
Mmm-hm.

1308
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:47,512
David Herold: You,
you a free nigger?

1309
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,447
Oswell Swann: Oh, we
all's free now, sir,

1310
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,282
thanks to Marse Lincoln.

1311
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,217
Lawd rest his soul.

1312
01:04:53,285 --> 01:04:54,719
But I ain't no nigger.

1313
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:55,853
I's a we-sort.

1314
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:57,088
David Herold: What?

1315
01:04:57,156 --> 01:04:58,256
Oswell Swann: A we-sort.

1316
01:04:58,324 --> 01:04:59,257
You know.

1317
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:00,592
"We-sorta-folk."

1318
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,095
Nigger, injun, white man,
all mixed up, you know.

1319
01:05:04,163 --> 01:05:05,697
John Wilkes Booth: You
have heard about Lincoln?

1320
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:07,965
Oswell Swann: Yas suh.

1321
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:11,337
He in the arms
of the Lawd.

1322
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,751
<i>[pounds on door]</i>

1323
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,988
David Herold: Um,
my friend and I,

1324
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:29,058
we're in need of
some shelter, food.

1325
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:31,360
Not the nigger.

1326
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,629
Samuel Cox: Name?

1327
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:38,502
David Herold: Um, my
friend, he's hurt his leg.

1328
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:50,081
Samuel Cox: You're
John Wilkes Booth.

1329
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:53,518
I think I know
what you have done.

1330
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:02,828
Tom Hanks: They have
arrived at about 1:00 AM

1331
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:04,863
on Easter Sunday.

1332
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:06,465
After talking until dawn,

1333
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:09,334
Cox is sympathetic,
but no fool.

1334
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:11,570
He will put Booth and
Herold in touch with a

1335
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,006
Confederate smuggler who
will get them across the

1336
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:15,941
Potomac and into Virginia.

1337
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:19,011
But Cox will not allow
Lincoln's assassin to stay

1338
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,680
in his home.

1339
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:23,449
So Booth and Herold are
directed to wait in a pine

1340
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:27,887
thicket just across
Cox's property line.

1341
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:30,289
They don't know it yet,
but they will wait there

1342
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:32,859
for the next five
days and four nights.

1343
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:33,960
John Wilkes Booth: Davey!

1344
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:35,195
Don't you know
I can't get on?

1345
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:38,633
David Herold: Help
him on his horse.

1346
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,270
John Wilkes Booth:
<i>[groans in pain].</i>

1347
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:54,057
$12?

1348
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:57,294
Oswell Swann: Yas suh.

1349
01:07:04,936 --> 01:07:06,636
John Wilkes Booth: Thought
you said Captain Cox was a

1350
01:07:06,704 --> 01:07:09,940
man of Southern feeling.

1351
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:11,542
David Herold: You say
anything about this,

1352
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,247
and you won't live long.

1353
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:17,984
Tom Hanks:
John Wilkes Booth

1354
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:19,618
has 10 days to live.

1355

[clock ticking].</i>

1356
01:07:23,336 --> 01:07:25,235
<i>[gun clicks].</i>

1357
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,205
Tom Hanks: On April 17th
Colonel Lafayette Baker,

1358
01:07:29,273 --> 01:07:31,774
the head of the National
Detective Police,

1359
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:33,942
asks Alexander Gardner

1360
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,511
to make copies
of three pictures.

1361
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:42,150
It is the first time in
history that photographs

1362
01:07:42,218 --> 01:07:44,953
have been used on
a wanted poster.

1363
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:47,889
Thanks in part to papers
found in Booth's room at

1364
01:07:47,957 --> 01:07:52,093
the National Hotel,
Lewis Powell and Mary Surratt

1365
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,762
are jailed in Washington
and George Atzerodt,

1366
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:56,997
who simply got drunk and
wandered away from the

1367
01:07:57,065 --> 01:07:59,366
Kirkwood Hotel,
rather than attempt to kill

1368
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:01,467
Vice President
Andrew Johnson,

1369
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,204
is discovered hiding-out
in his cousin's home in

1370
01:08:04,272 --> 01:08:07,341
Germantown, Maryland.

1371
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:09,276
Elements of the
8th Illinois Cavalry

1372
01:08:09,344 --> 01:08:12,046
and the U.S. 22nd
Colored Troops join the

1373
01:08:12,114 --> 01:08:15,417
13th New York Cavalry
in southern Maryland.

1374
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:17,852
And two members of the
National Detective Police,

1375
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,355
Lieutenant
Luther Baker and

1376
01:08:19,423 --> 01:08:21,225
Colonel Everton Conger,

1377
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:24,896
accompany 26 members of
the 16th New York Cavalry

1378
01:08:24,963 --> 01:08:29,000
under the command of
Lieutenant Edward Doherty.

1379
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,674
John Wilkes Booth: Our
cause being almost lost,

1380
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:39,479
something decisive and
great must be done.

1381
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,883
I struck boldly and
not as the papers say.

1382
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,253
I shouted "sic semper"
before I fired.

1383
01:08:47,321 --> 01:08:50,057
In jumping,
broke my leg.

1384
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,228
This night,
before the deed,

1385
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,697
I wrote a long article and
left it for one of the

1386
01:08:55,765 --> 01:09:00,733
Editors of the National
Intelligencer in which I

1387
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:07,506
fully set forth the
reasons for our proceedings.

1388
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:23,958
He or the government.

1389
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,203
Tom Hanks: The first
of Booth's two journal

1390
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,071
entries ends there.

1391
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,173
He is interrupted
by Thomas Jones,

1392
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,576
Samuel Cox's
foster brother.

1393
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,845
Cox has asked Jones to
see to it that Booth gets

1394
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,347
across the Potomac
to Virginia.

1395
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:50,119
In spite of the $100,000
bounty being offered,

1396
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,555
Jones keeps Booth and
Herold hidden and fed

1397
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,390
while government
troops occupy and

1398
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,359
sweep through the region.

1399
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:58,662
Later, Jones will claim
that Booth's singular

1400
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:02,166
desire was for newspapers.

1401
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:04,735
So it is here, in
the pine thicket,

1402
01:10:04,803 --> 01:10:07,001
that Booth reads the
horrific accounts,

1403
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,874
the lurid details,
and bloody result of

1404
01:10:09,941 --> 01:10:12,310
Lewis Powell's attack
on Secretary of State

1405
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:16,181
William Seward.

1406
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:34,398
Fanny Seward:
<i>[screams].</i>

James Powell: I'm mad.

1414
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:17,574
I'm mad, I'm mad!

1415
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,248
Emerick Hansell:
<i>[screams].</i>

1416
01:11:36,663 --> 01:11:37,662
William Bell: Murder!

1417
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:38,596
Stop that man!

1418
01:11:38,664 --> 01:11:41,366
Murderer!

1419
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:44,169
Tom Hanks:
Miraculously,

1420
01:11:44,236 --> 01:11:45,937
Secretary of State
William Seward

1421
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:48,373
is still alive,
as are all of the victims

1422
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,909
of Lewis Powell's
savage attack.

1423
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:52,744
And George Atzerodt's
intended victim,

1424
01:11:52,811 --> 01:11:54,312
Vice President
Andrew Johnson,

1425
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,281
has been sworn in as
the 17th President

1426
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:58,383
of the United States.

1427
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:01,053
But as Abraham Lincoln's
body lies in state

1428
01:12:01,121 --> 01:12:03,156
in the East Room
of the White House,

1429
01:12:03,223 --> 01:12:06,592
John Wilkes Booth lies on
a bed of dirt and pine

1430
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,329
needles and reads the
worst reviews of his life.

1431
01:12:10,396 --> 01:12:13,098
A man who was raised
on Shakespeare is brought

1432
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:16,301
to his knees by
his own hubris.

1433
01:12:16,368 --> 01:12:20,204
In one fell swoop,
with one grand gesture,

1434
01:12:20,272 --> 01:12:22,140
he has changed the course
of American history

1435
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:23,808
and dramatically
jeopardized the fate

1436
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:27,545
of the South that
he loved so dearly.

Tom Hanks: Booth's
tragedy is nearly complete.

1440
01:13:00,051 --> 01:13:01,518
On the night
of April 20th,

1441
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:05,789
Thomas Jones leads Booth
and Herold to a boat.

1442
01:13:05,857 --> 01:13:09,059
The current is strong.

1443
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:10,661
There are naval
patrols searching the

1444
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:13,697
Potomac for the fugitives.

1445
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:25,174
John Wilkes Booth has
less than six days to live.

<i>[gun clicks].</i>

1448
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:52,535
Tom Hanks: On April 18th,
Abraham Lincoln's dream of

1449
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:55,963
an assassinated
president lying in state in the

1450
01:13:56,031 --> 01:14:00,127
East Room of the White
House is fully realized.

1451
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:03,624
On April 21st, Lincoln's
body leaves Washington by

1452
01:14:03,692 --> 01:14:09,785
train to travel 1,654
miles to Oak Ridge Cemetery

1453
01:14:09,853 --> 01:14:13,248
in Springfield, Illinois.

1454
01:14:16,844 --> 01:14:20,037
After one failed attempt,
it's in the early morning

1455
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:23,468
hours of April 23rd that
John Wilkes Booth and

1456
01:14:23,535 --> 01:14:26,131
David Herold finally
cross the Potomac and

1457
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:29,993
land in Virginia.

1458
01:14:32,059 --> 01:14:35,122
As he writes in his diary,
"With every man's hand

1459
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:39,951
against me, for doing what
Brutus was honored for,

1460
01:14:40,019 --> 01:14:42,450
looked upon as a
common cutthroat.

1461
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:45,681
Abandoned, with the
curse of Cain upon me."

1462
01:14:47,213 --> 01:14:49,544
And on April 24th Booth
and Herold arrive at the

1463
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:52,374
farm of Richard Garrett.

1464
01:14:52,442 --> 01:14:55,271
Booth presents himself
as James W. Boyd,

1465
01:14:55,339 --> 01:14:56,739
a Confederate soldier
wounded at the

1466
01:14:56,805 --> 01:15:01,064
Battle of Petersburg and
the family takes them in.

1467
01:15:01,132 --> 01:15:03,497
But the very next day,
Booth is writing in his

1468
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:07,058
diary when word comes
that Union cavalry are

1469
01:15:07,126 --> 01:15:09,955
heading toward
the Garrett farm.

1470
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:12,788
Booth tells Herold
to get his pistols and

1471
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:15,053
the two men flee to
hide in the woods.

1472
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,587
When they return,

1473
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:18,754
Garrett's suspicions
have been aroused.

1474
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:20,219
Tonight they will
not be welcome to

1475
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:21,753
sleep in the house.

1476
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:26,452
Tonight they will sleep
in the tobacco barn.

1477
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,686
John Wilkes Booth:
Tonight I try to escape

1478
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:33,854
these bloodhounds
once more.

1479
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:42,147
I have too great a
soul to die a criminal.

1480
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:47,243
David Herold: I don't
want to die, Booth.

1481
01:15:47,311 --> 01:15:51,606
I don't want
to kill no one.

1482
01:15:51,674 --> 01:15:54,470
John Wilkes Booth:
I do not wish to

1483
01:15:54,538 --> 01:15:58,534
shed a drop of blood.

1484
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:02,864
But I must fight
the course.

1485
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:08,494
'Tis all that's
left to me.

1486
01:16:21,478 --> 01:16:24,742
Tom Hanks: At 2:30 AM on
the morning of April 26th,

1487
01:16:24,809 --> 01:16:26,740
the tobacco barn at
Garrett's farm is

1488
01:16:26,807 --> 01:16:28,370
surrounded by 26
members of the

1489
01:16:28,438 --> 01:16:32,399
16th New York Cavalry.

1490
01:16:37,763 --> 01:16:40,626
Lafayette Baker: We
know who you are!

1491
01:16:41,726 --> 01:16:43,456
John Wilkes Booth:
Who are you?

1492
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:44,987
What do you want?

1493
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:46,354
Lafayette Baker:
We want you!

1494
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:48,352
And we know
who you are!

1495
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,615
Give up your arms and
come out directly!

1496
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,847
John Wilkes Booth:
Well, my boy?

1497
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:57,009
David Herold:
We have no choice.

1498
01:16:57,077 --> 01:16:58,609
John Wilkes Booth:
You God damn coward.

1499
01:16:58,677 --> 01:17:00,940
You would leave me now?

1500
01:17:01,008 --> 01:17:02,875
Go, go on.

1501
01:17:02,943 --> 01:17:05,877
I would not have
you stay with me.

1502
01:17:05,944 --> 01:17:08,809
This is a hard case!

1503
01:17:08,877 --> 01:17:12,340
It may be that I am to
be taken by my friends!

1504
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:13,539
Lafayette Baker:
Be assured,

1505
01:17:13,607 --> 01:17:15,272
we are not your friends!

1506
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,779
John Wilkes Booth:
You have the sound

1507
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:18,069
of a brave man,

1508
01:17:18,136 --> 01:17:20,467
an honorable man.

1509
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,032
I am a cripple.

1510
01:17:22,099 --> 01:17:24,497
I've got but one leg.

1511
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:27,694
If you will withdraw your
men in line 100 yards from

1512
01:17:27,762 --> 01:17:31,158
the door, I will come
out and fight you.

1513
01:17:31,225 --> 01:17:32,725
Lafayette Baker: We did
not come here to fight!

1514
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:35,529
We came to make
you a prisoner!

1515
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:37,167
John Wilkes Booth: You put
any more kindling there;

1516
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,743
I'll put a ball
through you.

1517
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:41,980
I could have picked off
three or four of your men

1518
01:17:42,048 --> 01:17:44,049
by now if I
wished to do so.

1519
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:46,051
Draw off your
men 50 yards.

1520
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,820
Lafayette Baker:
I will not!

1521
01:17:47,888 --> 01:17:50,656
John Wilkes Booth:
Well, my brave boys!

1522
01:17:50,724 --> 01:17:54,394
You can prepare a
stretcher for me!

1523
01:17:56,663 --> 01:17:59,432
Go, go out.

1524
01:17:59,499 --> 01:18:01,734
Save yourself
if you can.

1525
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:03,735
Captain!

1526
01:18:03,803 --> 01:18:05,570
There is a man in
here who wishes to

1527
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:08,572
surrender awful bad!

1528
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,607
Lafayette Baker: Let
him hand out his arms!

1529
01:18:11,675 --> 01:18:16,282
You carry a carbine and
you must hand it out!

1530
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:18,685
John Wilkes Booth:
I declare before my

1531
01:18:18,752 --> 01:18:22,222
maker that this man is
innocent of any crime.

1532
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:24,457
Upon the word and
honor of a gentleman,

1533
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:25,992
he has no arms.

1534
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,528
The arms are mine
and I've got them!

1535
01:18:28,596 --> 01:18:29,996
Doherty: Show your hands!

1536
01:18:30,064 --> 01:18:33,666
Put out your hands!

1537
01:18:37,804 --> 01:18:39,405
David Herold: Booth.

1538
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:42,208
John Wilkes Booth: Go!

1539
01:18:46,446 --> 01:18:50,014
One more stain on
the old banner!

1540

<i>[laughs].</i>

1541
01:18:56,488 --> 01:18:59,290
Make quick work
of it, Captain.

1542
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:00,925
Shoot me through
the heart!

Conger: He's shot himself!

01:19:07,432 --> 01:19:08,566
Lafayette Baker:
No, he did not.

1547
01:19:08,634 --> 01:19:09,901
Doherty: Quick,
get him out!

1548
01:19:09,968 --> 01:19:10,868
Get him out of here!

1549
01:19:10,936 --> 01:19:14,137
Private Parody!

1550
01:19:18,809 --> 01:19:21,537
Man: Pick him up!

1551
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:32,246
Conger: Speak, speak!

1552
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:38,752
John Wilkes Booth:
Tell my mother that I

1553
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:42,421
die for my country.

1554
01:19:42,489 --> 01:19:44,156
Conger: For your country?

1555
01:19:44,224 --> 01:19:47,559
Is that what you say?

1556
01:19:47,627 --> 01:19:50,862
John Wilkes Booth: Yes.

1557
01:19:51,063 --> 01:19:52,464
Conger: Here, get him
away from the fire.

1558
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:53,631
Let's go.

1559
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:54,599
Man: Let's go.

1560
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:55,767
Let's move!

1561
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:56,667
Come on!

1562
01:19:56,735 --> 01:19:57,568
Go!

1563
01:19:57,636 --> 01:19:58,636
Man 2: Got him?

1564
01:19:58,703 --> 01:19:59,703
Set him against
the wall, soldiers.

1565
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,871
Prop him up.

1566
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:03,973
Get him up!

1567
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,910
Doherty: Where's he shot?

1568
01:20:07,978 --> 01:20:09,078
Conger: In the neck.

1569
01:20:09,146 --> 01:20:10,479
I told you, he
shot himself.

1570
01:20:10,547 --> 01:20:12,048
Doherty: Nah,
Corbett did.

1571
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:13,317
Give me that.

1572
01:20:13,385 --> 01:20:15,855
I saw him through
the barn planks.

1573
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:18,590
He claimed he was raising
his rifle against us.

1574
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:23,194
Sergeant Boston
Corbett shot him.

Tom Hanks:
In Washington,

1576
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:30,932
Lewis Powell
and George Atzerodt

1577
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,568
will soon be joined
by David Herold,

1578
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:35,637
and all of them will be
held in custody aboard the

1579
01:20:35,704 --> 01:20:40,641
ironclad monitors USS
Saugus and USS Montauk.

1580
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:43,711
And tomorrow, their
photographs will be taken

1581
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:46,346
and the public will see,
for the first time,

1582
01:20:46,414 --> 01:20:49,382
the faces of the men who
conspired to decapitate

1583
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:52,552
the government of
the United States.

1584

Now, it is the
morning of April 26th.

01:20:56,057 --> 01:20:59,861
And John Wilkes Booth
has only hours to live.

01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,461
<i>[gun clicks].</i>

1588
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,937
Conger: There's
nothing in your throat.

1589
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:17,539
No blood.

1590
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:19,508
Tom Hanks: The ball that
passes through Booth's

1591
01:21:19,576 --> 01:21:21,710
neck severs his spinal
cord between the 4th and

1592
01:21:21,778 --> 01:21:23,879
5th cervical vertebrae,

1593
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:26,648
paralyzing him
from the neck down.

1594
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:32,787
John Wilkes Booth:
K, kill m, kill me.

1595
01:21:35,658 --> 01:21:37,658
Conger: We don't
want to kill you.

1596
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:42,495
We want you to get well.

1597
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:46,736
John Wilkes Booth:
<i>[gurgling, gasping]</i>

1598
01:21:46,803 --> 01:21:50,840
Ha, hands.

1599
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:55,412
Let me, lift them.

1600
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,884
Let me see my hands.

1601
01:22:01,085 --> 01:22:04,855
Doherty: He asked
to see his hands.

1602
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:17,234
John Wilkes Booth:
Useless, useless.

1603
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:25,510
<i>[slow, rasping breath].</i>

1604
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:35,220
Tom Hanks: Shortly after
dawn on Wednesday,

1605
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:39,592
April 26th, 1865,
John Wilkes Booth

1606
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,661
draws his last breath.

1607
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:45,730
His belongings are
wrapped in paper.

1608
01:22:45,798 --> 01:22:48,099
His body is sewn
into a saddle blanket

1609
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,669
and loaded onto wagon,
then a steamer,

1610
01:22:51,737 --> 01:22:57,876
then a tugboat bound for
the Washington Navy Yard.

1611
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,689
Alexander Gardner and
Timothy O'Sullivan board

1612
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:06,428
the ironclad monitors USS
Saugus and Montauk to make

1613
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:09,132
collodion glass plate
photographs of the men who

1614
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,467
conspired first to
kidnap and then to

1615
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:15,172
kill Abraham Lincoln.

1616
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:25,784
George Atzerodt,
who lost his nerve

1617
01:23:25,851 --> 01:23:27,919
and got drunk rather
than attempt to kill

1618
01:23:27,987 --> 01:23:29,521
Vice President Johnson,

1619
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,357
is condemned to die.

1620
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:48,105
Alexander Gardner:
Mr. Lewis Powell.

1621
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:50,073
Have a seat.

1622
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:52,943
Tom Hanks: After his
savage but failed attempt

1623
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:55,580
on the life of
Secretary of State Seward,

1624
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:58,682
Lewis Powell hides in
Washington for three days

1625
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,850
before wandering
into Mary Surratt's

1626
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:03,986
boarding house and into
the arms of the police.

1627
01:24:04,054 --> 01:24:08,386
Alexander Gardner: And
don't you move now, laddie!

1628
01:24:10,785 --> 01:24:12,619
Tom Hanks: Powell is
sentenced to death.

1629
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:27,332
On April 27th,
David Herold is brought

1630
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,235
aboard the USS Montauk.

1631
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:32,470
The young man who
followed John Wilkes Booth

1632
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:35,740
to the bitter end
is condemned to die.

1633
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:52,386
And at the request of
Secretary of State Stanton,

1634
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,722
Alexander Gardner
takes one more picture

1635
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:58,259
on April 27th.

1636
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,562
Lafayette Baker:
Dr. Frederick May,

1637
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:05,366
can you positively
identify the body?

1638
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:09,403
Dr. May: Is there a scar
upon the back of its neck?

1639
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,605
Lafayette Baker:
There is.

1640
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:13,574
Dr. Barnes: Let me
describe it before it's

1641
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:14,908
seen by me.

1642
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,411
It's on the left side and
has the appearance more

1643
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,014
like the cicatrix of
a burn than that of a

1644
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,317
surgical operation.

1645
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:25,886
It was occasioned
when I removed a fibroid

1646
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,388
tumor from his neck.

1647
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:32,894
It is exactly as you
have described it.

1648
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:38,701
Dr. May: Yes, that is he.

1649
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:42,539
That is John Wilkes Booth.

1650
01:25:45,244 --> 01:25:46,610
Alexander Gardner:
Gentlemen,

1651
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:51,748
please stand where you
are and perfectly still.

1652
01:25:56,152 --> 01:26:00,390
One, two, three.

1653
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:03,626
Tom Hanks:
James Wardell,

1654
01:26:03,694 --> 01:26:05,895
one of Lafayette
Baker's detectives,

1655
01:26:05,963 --> 01:26:07,731
takes the single
glass plate and

1656
01:26:07,799 --> 01:26:10,501
delivers it to
Lafayette Baker.

1657
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:12,703
It is presumed that
Baker gives it to

1658
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:15,106
Secretary of War Stanton.

1659
01:26:15,173 --> 01:26:17,406
But no one knows.

1660
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:20,243
Alexander Gardner's
photograph of the autopsy

1661
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:24,081
of John Wilkes Booth
has never been found.

1662
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,651
The trial of the
conspirators is a

1663
01:26:27,718 --> 01:26:29,919
military tribunal.

1664
01:26:29,987 --> 01:26:33,424
366 witnesses testify.

1665
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:37,661
And all of the
defendants are found guilty.

1666
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:39,930
And in attempting to
create a definitive record

1667
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:41,665
of the people and
events surrounding the

1668
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:44,199
assassination of
Abraham Lincoln,

1669
01:26:44,267 --> 01:26:46,435
Alexander Gardner and
Timothy O'Sullivan are

1670
01:26:46,503 --> 01:26:50,539
given extraordinary
and exclusive access.

1671
01:26:50,607 --> 01:26:55,110
On July 7th, 1865, the
sentences are carried out

1672
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:56,778
for the first
assassination of a

1673
01:26:56,846 --> 01:26:59,514
president in the
history of the nation.

1674
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:02,283
And Mary Surratt becomes
the first woman ever to be

1675
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:05,152
executed by the United
States Federal Government

1676
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:08,154
when she joins Powell,
Atzerodt and Herold on a

1677
01:27:08,222 --> 01:27:11,625
scaffold at the old
Arsenal Penitentiary.

1678
01:27:44,561 --> 01:27:47,329
In an interview
10 years later,

1679
01:27:47,397 --> 01:27:50,367
the former President
of the Confederacy,

1680
01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:54,072
Jefferson Davis,
states simply,

1681
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:57,910
"Next to the destruction
of the Confederacy,

1682
01:27:57,978 --> 01:28:00,613
the death of
Abraham Lincoln was the

1683
01:28:00,681 --> 01:28:04,886
darkest day the
South has ever known."

1684
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:11,265
Tad Lincoln learned of
his father's assassination

1685
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:14,669
while attending "Aladdin"
at Grover's Theater.

1686
01:28:14,737 --> 01:28:18,072
He died of heart
failure six years later.

1687
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:21,242
Briefly committed to
an asylum by her only

1688
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:24,844
surviving son, Robert,
Mary Todd Lincoln died in

1689
01:28:24,912 --> 01:28:28,613
Springfield, 17 years
after the assassination

1690
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,247
of her husband.

1691
01:28:31,782 --> 01:28:34,016
John Wilkes Booth's
body was buried in a

1692
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:37,053
storage room at the
old Arsenal Penitentiary,

1693
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:40,556
then in a warehouse
and finally interred in

1694
01:28:40,624 --> 01:28:43,326
Green Mount Cemetery in
Baltimore, Maryland,

1695
01:28:43,393 --> 01:28:46,863
four years after the
killing of Abraham Lincoln.

1696
01:28:47,965 --> 01:28:49,832
10 weeks after the
President's death,

1697
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,201
the Civil War was over.

1698
01:28:52,269 --> 01:28:56,072
And Lincoln's Gettysburg
declaration was realized.

1699
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,975
That, "Government of the
people, by the people,

1700
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:03,009
"for the people, shall not
perish from the Earth."
