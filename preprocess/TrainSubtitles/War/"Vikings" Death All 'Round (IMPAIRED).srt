It's Lagertha. You had better come...

173
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,555
Both of you.

174
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,108
I lost my child.

175
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,250
I knew that I could
never have the child,

176
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,817
no matter what I did.

177
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:52,754
The Seer told me a long time ago

178
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,660
but I was hoping that I
could cheat the fates.

179
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,033
Shh.

180
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,805
It's all right.

Shh.

Just, just go away!

187
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:40,990
Leave me alone.

188
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,258
Your Highness.

189
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,160
Your Grace. Daughter.

190
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,429
How grateful I am that

191
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,899
we can now announce that
you are with child.

192
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:28,967
(ALL APPLAUDING)

193
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,374
The alliance between our peoples,

194
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,043
born of baptism and marriage,

195
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,312
is the only way to safeguard our future.

196
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,881
In the meantime,

197
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,719
what efforts has Your Grace made

198
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,622
to ensure that the pagans
have quit our realm?

199
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,359
I have sent boats down river
to ascertain the truth of it.

200
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,730
It may well be that my brother will
choose to sack and plunder Rouen,

201
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,799
rather than return to his
people empty-handed.

202
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,868
But I have already sent word
to the lords of that town

203
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,238
to prepare their defenses
against such an attack.

204
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:12,341
Above all men, I know how
much I owe both to God,

205
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,644
and to those closest to me,
for our delivery from evil.

206
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:20,816
Now, I would also like
to express the same

207
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,184
to Sire Roland.

208
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,154
Though an underling,

209
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,522
I believe you did far more
than Count Odo to preserve

210
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,358
and defend our city.

211
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:34,595
Therefore, I proclaim you
in turn, Count Roland,

212
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,231
Defender of Paris.

213
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,565
(ALL APPLAUDING)

214
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:51,645
And may you continue to serve
us faithfully as before.

215
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:53,981
I am honored and humbled.

216
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,382
And ready to sacrifice myself

217
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,018
at any moment for Your
Highness's greater glory.

218
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
You may all leave,

219
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,762
content in my good graces.

220
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,305
Except for you, Count Roland.

221
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:22,140
Stay a moment.

222
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:32,017
I want to ask your
permission, Count Roland.

223
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,185
My permission?

224
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,886
But for what?

225
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,221
Why should the Emperor ever
have to ask permission?

226
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,591
I want to sleep with your sister.

227
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,696
I desire her to be my mistress.

228
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,200
Have you asked her?

229
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,171
I would like your permission...

230
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,406
...first.

231
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,244
You have it.

232
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,612
Of course, Your Highness.

233
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,114
I am sure she will think of herself as

234
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,883
the most fortunate woman in Paris.

235
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,287
Wait.

236
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:20,262
There is something else.

237
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,769
Why is my father giving
preference to those people?

238
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:31,339
I don't know.

239
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:33,941
I don't think you understand
the way things work here.

240
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,143
You are too simple.

241
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,145
Simple?

242
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,350
What is simple?

243
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,985
The person who is closest to my father

244
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,787
is the person who has the
most power in Frankia.

245
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,290
And it seems as if he has
suddenly given power

246
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,092
to a young soldier.

247
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,493
But I am Duke.

248
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,362
I have been given great lands,

249
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,831
and the responsibility for the
defense of the entire realm.

250
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,333
Even as you say those words,

251
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,734
they start to sound hollow.

252
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:05,938
Entire realm, great lands.

253
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:07,706
What does it mean?

254
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,409
Roland has actually been
given command of the city.

255
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:13,879
He will always be
closest to the Emperor.

256
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,447
Do not underestimate your father.

257
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,384
Oh, it would be impossible
to underestimate him.

258
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,752
Just as it would be
impossible to understand him.

259
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,422
It's not right that a man
of such humble origin

260
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,259
should take precedence over you, or me!

261
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,761
It's unfortunate, but this
Roland should be removed

262
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,597
before his appetite for power
becomes too pronounced.

263
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,400
Hmm.

264
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,703
What are you doing?

265
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,339
Hmm?

266
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,144
I'm trying to have sex.

267
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,479
I am with child.

268
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,214
So?

269
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,183
You are carrying my child!

270
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,752
This makes me very happy.

271
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,955
So, it's not possible.

272
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,257
No, it's really quite...

273
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,458
Simple.

274
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,427
It's not going to happen.

(GROANS)

276
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:10,265
I told you, this is Frankia,
we do things differently here.

277
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,800
You have to respect me
in my sacred condition.

were better before.

I suppose you should be
congratulated, King Ecbert.

313
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,272
By a clever ruse you have become ruler

314
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,640
of one of the biggest,
richest kingdoms in England.

315
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,544
And all without my help.

316
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,014
Despite the fact that
we are formally allies.

317
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:01,583
No, fortunately, there
was limited bloodshed.

318
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,552
Which is always to be favored.

319
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:06,923
After all, we need our armies to fight

320
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,957
not each other, but the Northmen.

321
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,294
You always have a clever answer.

322
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,931
The fact is, you betrayed me!

323
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:20,869
You told me nothing of your plans.

324
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:24,139
We were to divide Mercia
equally between us.

325
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,739
But you have taken it all.

326
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:28,642
And now it occurs to me

327
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:32,246
your new kingdom directly abuts mine.

328
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,150
So it does.

329
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,688
But surely we are still allies?
