00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,970
Must be some drug.

163
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,205
The drug that keeps them going
is what keeps most of us going.

164
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,832
Faith, good or bad.

165
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,271
The <i>juramentado</i> believes
that when he kills an infidel,

166
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,007
it is a passport to heaven.

167
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,810
But I didn't know
they selected the victims.

168
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,249
I thought they just attacked
the first Christian they met?

169
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,683
I am a Christian,

170
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,515
yet he didn't attack me.

171
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,222
Well, perhaps, I am not a good Christian.

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,724
Good night, <i>señores.</i>

173
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,193
ALL: Good night, Padre.

174
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,061
Well, when you come to think of it,

175
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,365
that Moro went right by
the bunch of us to get to one man,

176
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,165
the Commanding Officer.

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,140
I wouldn't be surprised if...

178
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,839
CANAVAN: Bolo cut?

179
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,881
Do you ever have headaches?

180
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,882
- No.
- Dizzy spells?

181
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,382
No. I'm perfectly all right.

182
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,118
You must have a skull of cast iron.

183
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,285
Bad place for a bolo cut, the nerve center.

184
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,418
I knew a man up in Samoa...

185
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,020
McCOOL: Are you the man
that owns that coconut raft?

186
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,961
What were you doing in the jungle?

187
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,802
Who are these men?

188
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,539
Couple of Moros
who don't belong in the village.

189
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,944
Where did you find them?

190
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,380
Well, we went for a little stroll and we

191
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,941
found them prowling around
on the edge of the jungle.

192
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,749
Lieutenant, you know
the orders about reprisals.

193
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,047
Captain, all I know is that Colonel Hatch...

194
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,592
He gave the orders.

195
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,619
Come in to the office.

196
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,837
Captain, look, give me a squad.

197
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,499
Let us try some
of this <i>juramentado</i> business.

198
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,074
That's what I want to talk to you about.

199
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,379
Gentleman, I've been looking over
Colonel Hatch's notes.

200
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,213
His plan of procedure.

201
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,253
He felt that Alipang would use every effort

202
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,486
to lure us into the bush
before we were ready.

203
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,028
Well, he was right.

204
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,888
That <i>juramentado</i> was
Alipang's first move.

205
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,598
But it won't work.

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,929
We're going to stay
right in our own backyard.

207
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,333
Here's an order Colonel Hatch prepared

208
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,931
forbidding any move into the jungle

209
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,409
until the native troops are fully trained.

210
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,571
He never got a chance to sign it.

211
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,084
How am I gonna get any orchids

212
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,245
if we can't go out in the jungle?

213
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,548
Ask him if we can go a little way.

214
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,224
- Go on. Ask him.
- Shut up.

215
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,828
Well, it's signed.

219
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,072
From now on, it's drill.

Oh, he did, did he?

249
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,847

they could drill without shoes?

Shoes? Oh, yes.

259
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,358
Well, it was just a suggestion.

260
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,901
I happened to be passing by
and they were having an awful time.

261
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,958
In agony.

262
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,199
They've got to get used
to shoes, sooner or later.

263
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,605
Well, don't you suppose
it can be done gradually?

264
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,939
After all, men weren't born with shoes.

265
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,343
Dr. Canavan probably meant it
as a health measure.

266
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,108
Is it a health measure to rig up a dummy

267
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,548
and have men standing around
pulling its nose?

Oh, that.

Oh, that was just
a little applied psychology.

270
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,723
The Filipinos are scared stiff
of this what's-his-name, Alipang.

271
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,020
They jump when you mention his name.

272
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,254
That's why I rigged up that dummy.

273
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,522
Stupid.

274
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,193
You wouldn't think it was stupid

275
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,232
if you'd seen the shaking lineup of men
at sick call

after Hatch was killed.

277
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,098
Sick call is a good excuse to avoid work.

00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,802
Yeah, I know.

279
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,272
And it's true that there was nothing
organically wrong with those men,

280
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,935
but they were sick
just the same, sick with fear.

281
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,809
And when fear becomes
so deep and unreasoning, it's a disease.

282
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,077
It'll be cured
when they learn how to handle a gun.

00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,596
Hey, Doc! Come here a minute, will you?

323
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,406
Look, Doc. One of Swede's orchids
is due for the stalk.

324
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,671
Well, how soon, Larson?

325
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,007
Any day now.

326
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,607
Do you know, I do a lot of this pollinating
in my spare time.

327
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,842
Think it'll have to be a cesarean?

328
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,682
Well, it all depends. What kind is it?

329
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,483
LARSON: It's a <i>Paphiopedilum.</i>

330
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,348
Just a plain <i>Paphiopedilum?</i>

331
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,420
Oh, no, it's a <i>Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.</i>

332
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,890
Oh, that's nothing.

333
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,527
You know, I wanna get a white orchid.
That's why I'm down here.

334
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,403
You gotta go an awful long way
before you run across a white orchid.

335
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,413
(EX CLAIMING)

336
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,333
It's called Cragg.

337
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,703
It fires many bullets at once.

338
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,495
How many they have?

339
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,836
Three hundred.

340
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,865
Bullets?

341
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:12,966
Enough.

342
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,343
One of these guns worth 20 bulls.

343
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,842
If we get them, you be sultan of Mindanao.

344
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,347
We must get them now.

345
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,990
(SPEAKING MORO)

346
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,321
No, no, <i>Tuan.</i>

347
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,217
They must attack us.

348
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,528
But why they wait?

349
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,191
We kill commander.
Why they not send men?

350
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,700
Perhaps when we send the <i>juramentado</i>
to kill the new commander, Manning,

351
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,033
they send men.

352
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,108
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

353
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,269
Oh, Steve!

354
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,337
Aren't you coming down to the landing?
I want you to meet my wife.

355
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,543
Yes, certainly. Go on ahead.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

356
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,643
Right.

357
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,519
Linda, if you believe in marriage,
never say yes to a soldier.

358
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,856
Ever since I've been married,

359
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,329
I've been chasing my husband
all over the world.

360
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,333
I haven't seen him this time in over a year.

361
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,463
I know just how you feel.

362
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,096
I haven't seen my father in over four years.

363
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,835
I hope he recognizes me.

364
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,801
Hey. Hey!

365
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,613
Do you got a box there for me?
Larson. L-A-R-S-O-N.

366
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,146
Bill. Bill!

367
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,175
Bill, look, I got a letter
from a lawyer in Manila.

368
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,446
I wrote to him just to make quite sure.

369
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,147
And they say
they've found the titles to the island.

370
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,211
It doesn't belong to anybody.

371
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,224
I can just move right in.
I don't even have to buy it.

372
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,157
So what I'm going to do...

373
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,558
LARSON: Hey, Bill, Mac.

374
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,597
Look, my orchid seeds arrived
from Battlement Gordon.

375
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,442
Oh, darling.

376
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,850
Oh, George, my ribs!

377
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,719
Oh, bless your ribs.
Bless your heart. Bless you.

378
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,121
As president of the reception committee
of the port of Mysang...

379
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,186
Linda!

380
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,991
Pardon me.

381
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,126
Linda, this is the man
I've been telling you about.

382
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,136
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

383
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,372
Ladies, may I present
Lieutenants McCool, Canavan, and Larson.

384
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,273
This is Mrs. Manning and Captain Hartley's
daughter, Miss Linda Hartley.

385
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,042
- How do you do?
- But, George, where's Captain Hartley?

386
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,106
He should be here now. I just left him.

387
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,947
- Oh, he's right... Will you come with us?
- Yeah!

388
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,714
Yeah, we know, over here.

389
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,722
How long do you
expect to stay, Miss Hartley?

390
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,783
As long as my father will let me.

391
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,522
I know I'm going to like it here.

392
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,621
Larson here spends all his time
in his horticulture,

393
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,859
and the doctor has his hands
full of patients and things,

394
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,334
but I have nothing to do.
I'd love to show you all the sights.

395
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,927
The public library, the art museum.

396
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,767
And we could swim out 10 miles
and see my island.

397
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,967
I'd like to show you
my orchids sometime, Miss Hartley.

398
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,475
No, I'm not at all busy with patients.

399
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,773
I only have two. A couple of rats.

400
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,311
One of them's pretty sick.

401
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,473
What's the matter with him?

402
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,743
Dying of a lonely heart, like I am.

403
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,649
Well, here you are, Miss Hartley.

404
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,278
Here's where you live.

405
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,548
Well, thank you.

406
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,585
Thank all of you.

407
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,310
Linda!

408
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,781
Dad!

409
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,191
How did you... When did...

410
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,858
I couldn't believe my eyes.

411
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,299
Didn't you recognize me?

412
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,463
Well, you've changed.
Where are the freckles?

413
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,837
What did you do
with the skinny legs and your braids?

414
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,502
You see, if I'd waited any longer,
I'd have been an old woman.

415
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,137
After the earthquake at San Francisco,
I just made up my mind.

416
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,840
You'll never know
how much I worried about you.

417
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,904
Even when I knew you were safe,

418
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,313
I wanted to hop the first boat.

419
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,817
And I beat you to it.

420
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,250
Why didn't you write you were coming?

421
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,720
I was too smart. You might have said no.

422
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,614
Oh, you are glad to see me, aren't you?

423
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,783
Glad?

424
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:25,094
Linda, you're the one person
in the world I wanted to see most.

425
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,893
I have the cutest little place
fixed up in Manila.

426
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,558
Right near the Luneta.

427
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,601
Oh, darling,
could you possibly be as happy as I am?

428
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,471
We're going to have to
change our plans a little.

429
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,472
Don't tell me there's been another delay
in your leave of absence.

430
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,606
My leave's off.
I'm assigned here indefinitely.

431
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,644
George, it was all arranged.

432
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
Sorry, Mabel. Can't be helped.

433
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,547
The C.O. Died, and...

434
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,014
Who?

435
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,219
Colonel Hatch. You never met him.

436
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,860
So, you see, that puts me in command.

437
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,896
Well, it was a mighty nice little house,

438
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,366
but I guess we can make this one do.

439
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,336
Oh, George.

440
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,312
Sorry, Mabel.

441
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,814
All the way over
I kept thinking how wonderful it would be

442
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,117
to drop in on you like this,

443
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,715
as if I'd come from just around the corner.

444
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,425
But, Dad, what happened?

445
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,895
Oh, I got it last year.

446
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,930
But it's all right now.

447
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,565
We'll paint the town red.
We'll have a wonderful time.

448
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,735
The boat stops over for four whole days.

449
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,406
Four days?

450
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,800
Oh, no.

451
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,042
This time you don't get rid of me
so easily. I'm here for keeps.

452
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,108
Linda, I'm sorry,
but that's impossible just now.

453
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,447
There's nothing I'd like better,

454
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,647
but you couldn't have
chosen a worse time.

455
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,246
I wouldn't have much time
for you, darling.

456
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,349
You'd be alone most of the time.

457
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,819
I've been alone most of the time.

458
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,123
I know.

459
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,476

462
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,277
Come on. Buck up, old girl. It's your party.

463
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,539
Sorry, darling.

464
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,776
I was just trying to get used to the idea
of going back again

465
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,249
without you.

466
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,681
Buy you a drink.

467
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,049
And tonight, just before I came over here,

468
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,289
the rat that had been
getting polished rice died.

469
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,523
Died of beriberi.

470
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,066
(SCOFFING) No beriberi on my island.

471
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,164
No rats. No mice.

472
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,602
No doctors.

473
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,536
You should see it as I first saw it,
shining in the sun,

a pearl set in turquoise.

475
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,376
A pimple in the Pacific.

476
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,708
Excuse me, Miss Hartley.

477
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,752
I'm officer of the day
and I won't be able to stay for the dancing,

478
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,343
and I thought if you...

00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,410
I...

Here.

481
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,087
Why, thank you, Lieutenant.

482
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,991
Why, it's lovely.

483
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,728
I've never seen one like this before.

484
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,890
It's a <i>Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.</i>

485
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,365
Oh, no, Bill.
It's a <i>Brassocattleya trufuttiana.</i>

486
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,926
Don't let him scare you. It's just an orchid.

487
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,232
Will you wear it?

488
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,704
I'd love to.

489
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:29,933
I brought a pin.

490
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,339
Thank you.

491
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:35,379
I'm breeding a species of my own,
a white orchid,

492
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,248
and, well, I'd like to name it after you.

493
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,715
<i>Orchidaceae linda.</i>

494
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,547
If you don't mind.

495
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,344
Well, I'd be greatly honored.

496
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,888
Well, thanks, that's...

497
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,982
I gotta go now.

498
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,787
I gotta pollinate.

499
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,393
To us.

500
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,127
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

501
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,500
Linda. That's Spanish for "beautiful."

502
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,907
Linda. That's what I'll call my island.

503
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,582
Linda Island.

504
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:13,909
Look.

505
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,048
It's 10 miles off there,

506
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,749
with a beach like swan's down
when you stretch out on it

507
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,723
and gaze up at the powder puff clouds.

508
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,886
And the birds sing,
and your heart sings with them.

509
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,893
Then the sea steals up
and tickles your toes,

510
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,297
which is bad if you're ticklish.

511
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,299
Oh, I see.

512
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,544
How long have you been in the service?

513
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,815
Three years.

514
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,086
I expect to quit next year
and hang up my shingle back home.

515
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,320
I'd never quit if I were in the army.

516
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,554
You like the service?

517
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,496
I think it's the most wonderful career
in the world.

518
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,193
When I was six, my greatest ambition
was to be a top sergeant

519
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,565
in my father's company.

520
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,661
Queer ambition for a girl.

521
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,830
I don't see why.

522
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,000
The happiest time of my life
was when I was a kid at the presidio.

523
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,339
LINDA: Most children had to be satisfied
with toy soldiers.

524
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,901
But I had real ones.

525
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,943
Most of my male ancestors were soldiers

526
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,210
with a remarkable talent for getting killed.

527
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,275
When I was 10,
my father bought me a uniform.

528
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,820
I liked it much better
than any dress I ever had.

529
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,186
I guess I should have been born a boy.

530
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,886
Oh, no.

531
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,459
My great-grandfather
was Wellington's adjutant.

532
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,928
He lost a leg at Waterloo.

533
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,658
My grandfather,
he was only a sergeant major,

534
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,098
he drowned in his own blood
at the Alamo with David Crockett.

535
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,659
- Really?
- My father lies at Chickamauga...

536
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,104
And lies. And lies, and lies, and lies.

537
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,843
Datu, there's something
I'd like you to do for me.

538
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:51,973
Very glad.

539
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,176
My wife's going back to Manila,

540
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,980
and I'd like to give her a little present.

541
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,021
You deal in pearls, and I thought maybe...

542
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,852
I could get you some,
but not before the boat leaves.

543
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,415
Oh, that's too bad. I did want to...

544
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,520
There is a lace peddler outside,
with shawls and scarves.

545
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,392
He may have something
your wife might like.

546
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,230
Oh. Thank you, Datu.

Isn't there anything I can do?

556
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,812
She's all right now.

557
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,079
She'll need some looking after
when she comes out of it, though.

558
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,779
I'll hang around.

559
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,662
She was so happy
when I met her on the boat.

560
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,765
All she could talk about was him

561
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,132
and how she was going to take him
back to Manila with her.

562
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,728
She was so frantic to get here, and...

563
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,476
What brought you here?

564
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,978
An earthquake.

565
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,015
The one at San Francisco.

566
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,582
It was ghastly.

567
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,612
Everywhere people were crying out,

568
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,915
calling for help.

569
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,319
The living and the dying,
all calling for someone.

570
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,862
And suddenly I found myself
doing the same thing.

571
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,121
I was calling to my father.

572
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,997
I hadn't seen him for years,

573
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,297
he was thousands of miles away,

574
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,566
and yet I called to him
as if he really could help me.

575
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,004
Funny, wasn't it?

576
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,939
No. No.

577
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:41,945
People always have to
have somebody to call to

578
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,708
when they're in trouble.

579
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,614
You find that out
when you attend the dying.

580
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,550
If they haven't got somebody,
they usually invent somebody.

581
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,016
Even when they're not in trouble,
people make up people.

582
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,318
I used to do it
when I was a kid, my kid sister and I.

583
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,693
I invented my first patient.

584
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,130
Who was he?

585
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,092

He had a strange new malady.
Nobody knew what it was.

588
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,708
All the specialists in the world
couldn't do a thing for him

589
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,368
till they sent for me.

590
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,238
I cured him. Just like that.

591
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,216
I guess that's what made me decide
on the medical profession.

Larson, round up every Moro
living in the village,

596
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,423
take them to the guardhouse. Go on.

597
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,753
Yes, sir.

598
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,419
McCool, I want a stockade
built around the fort,

599
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,520
and beyond that, barbed wire.
All we've got. Go on.

00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,859
Yes, sir.

Yabo, instruct the guard.

Nobody's allowed inside
without a special pass. Nobody. Go on.

603
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,859
Yes, sir.

604
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,666
Captain, if a Moro can go <i>juramentado,</i>
why can't a white man?

605
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:21,473
There'll be no expeditions, alone
or in groups, under any circumstances.

606
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,571
Those are still the orders.

607
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,417
The Moro that killed Captain Manning
had this around his neck.

608
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,813
All the Moros wear <i>anting-anting</i>
to protect them.

609
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,189
From what?

610
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,257
The Moros aren't afraid
of anything, not even death.

611
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,627
I am not afraid of death, either,

612
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,392
yet you see I wear an <i>anting-anting,</i> too.

613
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,865
It is a symbol of something you believe in.

614
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,438
And if you believe in something, it's so.

615
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,402
That's true.

616

There are more men in here than
there are on the parade ground drilling.

If it keeps up, they'll all be in.

You're right, Captain, but...

626
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,126
Get them out.
There's nothing the matter with them.

Yes, there is.

That Moro that struck Captain Manning
down struck them down, too,

but not with a bolo.

630
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,071
They're down with a disease
medicine can't cure.

631
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,376
They'll be all right
when they learn how to use a gun,

when they're properly drilled.

633
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,680
The trouble is that
you're trying to drill things into them,

634
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,550
when you should be
drilling things out of them.

635
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,318
What good's a gun
when your finger's so paralyzed with fright

636
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,621
that you can't pull a trigger?

637
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,362
Sergeant, get these men out of here.
Have them report for duty.

638
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,269
From now on

640

stops to consider what's inside of them.

- Yeah.

Well, you leave him with me
and I'll turn him in.

(ALL LAUGHING)

801
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,706
You knew what my orders were
about going out in the jungle.

802
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,835
Captain, you ought to frame that pigskin.

803
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,311
Those men have had a shot in the arm,
vaccinated against fear,

804
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,746
and I think it's gonna work.

805
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,443
We've deliberately avoided
making trouble with Alipang

806
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,349
until the troops were properly trained.

807
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,614
Well, you fixed that.

808
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,020
Raiding their camp, capturing a prisoner.

809
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,387
You've got them all stirred up.

810
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,119
In all probability, they'll attack.

811
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,490
No, no, that's not their plan.

812
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,257
Their plan is to kill
every officer on the post first.

813
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,799
Hatch and Manning were the beginning.
I found that out.

814
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,232
I don't care what you found out.

815
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,269
You've been a meddling fool
right from the start,

816
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,804
and now you've disobeyed orders.

817
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,998
I'm warning you.

818
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,769
If you step over the line again,
I'll confine you to quarters.

819
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:46,968
That's all.

820
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,914
That <i>juramentado</i> he captured

821
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,290
must have been on his way to kill you.

822
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,356
I imagine Dr. Canavan saved your life.

823
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,431
Yes. I know.

824
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,937
Next time you're gonna play
those games in the jungle,

825
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,302
why don't you take me with you?

826
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,806
I'm rather good at that sort of thing.

827
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,502
I can start a fire
by rubbing two Boy Scouts together,

828
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,774
and I can even cross a river in a paper bag
when I'm in good form.

829
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,474
I couldn't think of it, Mac.

830
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,540
That would be disobeying orders.

831
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,087
I'll be in in a minute, Mac.

832
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,892
You're leaving today, aren't you?

833
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,467
Well, in case I don't see you...

834
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,873
I was worried for fear I wouldn't get back
in time to say goodbye.

835
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,414
We were all worried, for fear
you wouldn't get back at all.

836
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,717
Goodbye.

837
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,090
Goodbye.

838
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,511
Didn't take me that long
to say goodbye to her.

- Shut up, you ape.

842

All packed, Linda?

843
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,188
I'm not going.

844
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,727
Canavan?

845
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,863
I'm afraid I must insist
that you take the boat, Linda.

846
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:58,774
I'm sorry, Father.

847
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,499
I'm staying here.

848
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,850
We must change our plans, Alipang.

849
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,256
They never come to the jungle to fight.

850
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,360
Yes, they will.

851
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,761
They come to jungle.

Oh, they says the water went down
two feet in the last hour.

00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:33,664
Perhaps there's been a landslide

863
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,068
that made the river change its course.

864
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,469
No, it happened too quickly for that.

865
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,803
Maybe it disappeared
into a subterranean channel or something.

866
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,503
Captain, I just came back from the hills.

867
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,674
I saw many Moros carry bamboo, rocks.

868
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,149
Alipang, he dammed up the river.

The whole post's in an uproar
about a few Moros

are billions of enemies,

Say, what's the matter with your father,
anyway? What's he afraid of?

Afraid?

891
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,057
He acts like a little boy
who's lost his way home

892
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,796
and is scared somebody's gonna
find out about it.

Why doesn't he do something
about the river, and why doesn't he...

894
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,504
Every time you mention my father,
you criticize him.

<i>Tenyente</i> Canavan.

00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,518
When you bring in Moro prisoner,
you said this is our country,

We don't know what Alipang does next.

We want to fight, <i>Tenyente.</i>

We would rather die than live like this.

906

We think maybe you speak
to Captain Hartley.

Come on!

Captain Hartley, now's your chance.

909
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,820
These boys aren't afraid of Alipang
anymore. He's got them fighting mad.

910
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,378
They want to go now
and have it out with him.

911
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,083
- Go where?
- Into the jungle, after him.

912
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,819
That's out of the question.

913
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,190
But listen, Captain,

914
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,923
if these boys are ever gonna lick Alipang,
this is the moment.

915
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,965
We'll lick him by staying right here.

916
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,761
Yabo, take these men back to drilling.

917

Wait! Look here, Captain...

00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:20,901
That's all.

919
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,167
No, that isn't all.

920
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,537
You were sent down here
to train these men

921
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,405
till they were ready to defend themselves.

922
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,535
Well, they're ready now,

923
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,512
and if you can't see that,
you're as blind as a bat.

- What are you waiting for?

00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,845
If this place is the testing ground,

926
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,945
the independence of the Philippines
rests with those boys.

927
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,183
Well, they say they're ready to be tested.

928
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,225
What right have you got
to stand in their way?

929
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,453
You're forgetting yourself.

930
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,963
They're fighting for existence
and nothing's gonna stop them.

931
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,296
And if they let you do it,
they're just plain stupid.

Doctor, there are some sick people
in the village who need attention.

937
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,528
Tell them to boil their water.

938
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,089
Give them Mag Sulph.

939
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,229
Maybe they need a little drilling.

940
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,438
You better get out and look them over.

941
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,803
I'm confined to quarters.

942
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,672
I've decided to suspend
your order of arrest.

943
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,075
And I've decided to remain here

944
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,204
during the rest of my stay
at Mysang. I'm sorry.

945
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,805
If you persist in this attitude,

946
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,612
you will force me
to prefer charges against you.

947
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,412
Fine.

948
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,081
I hope you use your influence
to have me cashiered.

949
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,714
Save me the bother of resigning.

Dr. Canavan.

952

He is sick. Very sick.

Boil your water. Scald all your dishes.

And don't serve any uncooked food
of any kind.

All food for the patients
must be cooked in company kitchens.

- No food shipped in and out of the harbor.
- Yes, sir.

- Yes, sir.

Here's the list of supplies I need.

972
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,125
Cottonseed oil, calamo,

all the canned milk
you've got in the storehouse.

if you held it right-side up?

There's one thing that isn't on that list

977
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,375
that we need more than anything else.

978

Water.

01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,514
- There's the old well.
- It's no good. It's polluted.

980
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,609
That's what started the cholera.

981
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,183
And it's not only drinking water
we need, it's sewage.

The whole village is a mess of pollution.

983

You've got to send somebody
up into the hills to dynamite the dam.

984
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,592
It's sure death to send anybody.

985
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,528
It's sure death here
unless we get running water.

986

It's out of the question.

If we don't get running water
in Mysang pretty soon,

there won't be any Mysang.

Why doesn't he come down

I'm making war with germs
instead of bolos.

I don't think the Filipinos
are afraid of Alipang now.

1066
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,336
They're more afraid of the cholera.

1067
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,639
I wonder what happened to Larson?

1068

He couldn't have lost his way,
he had Mike with him.

Well,

1074
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:29,102

on her feet too long, and fell asleep.

1075
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,600
Sit down a minute, will you?

1076
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,658
I'm pretty busy.

1077
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,671
I know, I want to talk to you.

1078
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,279
Have a cigarette.

1079
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,084
How's McCool?

1080
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,085
Pretty sick.

1081
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,393
What are you going to do about Larson?

1082
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,694
I don't know.

1083
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,063
He never got to the dam.

1084
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,160
No.

1085
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,565
It's a funny thing
about Larson's passion for orchids.

1086
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,145
Big, clumsy, sweet.

1087
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,208
Still, I have an uncle back home,

1088
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,645
a blacksmith.

1089
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,414
He has tremendous hands.
Can bend a horseshoe with them.

1090
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,321
But you ought to see him
in the garden with his flowers.

1091
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,519
Canavan, I'm going blind.

1092
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,864
That bolo cut on the head
hit the optical nerve.

1093
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,994
It's been getting worse lately.

1094
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,866
Why didn't Colonel Hatch order you
to the base hospital?

1095
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,809
He did. I tore up
the medical report when he died.

1096
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,002
So I wouldn't see it.

1097
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,378
What did the report say?

1098
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,316
It recommended retirement,

1099
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,915
but I had other plans.

1100
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,551
Suicide?

1101
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,695
What are you talking about?

1102
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,664
I know, a report would read,

1103
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,962
"Killed in action." Is that it?

1104
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,907
That's better than rotting away
in an officer's club.

1105
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,006
Fact is you're afraid.

1106
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:52,206
Afraid to live. That's much worse
than being afraid to die.

1107
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,607
Dying is easy. One way of running out.

1108
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:55,843
Running out?

1109
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,680
Do you know what failure here means?

1110
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,015
Mysang isn't just an isolated village,

1111
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,551
it's a test.

1112
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,990
If we can hold out here,
the whole job in the Philippines is done.

1113
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,729
Well, I've failed.

1114
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,332
I've got to send for the army.

1115
