1
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:33,809
- You can't bring this in.

2
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:36,588
- Please.
- No fruit or vegetables.

3
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,031
That includes...

4
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:41,510
pomegranates. It's on your form.

5
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,104
- I like to eat the seed
of this fruit.

6
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,536
One each day. For luck.

7
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,966
- I'm sorry, that's not allowed.

8
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:53,293
[Announcement]: For security
reasons, please do not leave

9
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,587
your bags unattended.
Veuillez garder avec vous

10
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,727
vos bagages a main
en tout temps

11
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,204
pour des raisons de securite

12
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,090
- What are you doing?

13
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:04,427
- This way, I don't need
to bring it in.

14
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:09,479
I eat it here,
at the gate of your country.

15
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,522
Look.

16
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:21,157
So, I bring luck in my stomach.

17
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,561
Will you try it?

18
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:39,880
Raffi, the real point of this poem
is that the girlfriend is crazy!

19
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:47,689
'No!' The girlfriend said angrily,
'I want your mother's heart!'

20
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,592
So the boy went and killed his mother.

21
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,103
You know what they say...

22
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,207
There's always
a woman at the heart of it.

23
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,378
As he ran through the streets
with her heart in his hands,

24
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,170
he tripped and fell.

25
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:07,396
His mother's heart cried out...

26
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,966
'My poor boy!'

27
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,075
'Did you hurt yourself?'

28
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,313
- You know what?

29
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:34,753
I completely forgot
you had a party.

30
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:37,056
- I told you she...
The party's not the point.

31
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,292
The fact is, you make
these physical appearances

32
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:40,737
without letting anybody know.

33
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,809
I mean, it makes
perfect sense to me.

34
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:44,954
- Why would I need
to tell anyone?

35
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:46,814
- I'm not saying
you need permission.

36
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,953
Permission for what?

37
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,329
- Celia, just try to understand
her point of view.

38
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,304
Raffi, stop talking about your mother.

39
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,621
Why can't I read her book?

40
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,144
- Just wait till it comes out.

41
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,620
- But you've read it.

42
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,276
- Give me your copy.
- No.

43
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,380
- Why not?

44
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:43,161
I'm part of the family.
- Look, I promised her that I...

45
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,554
- What?
- I wouldn't give you my copy.

46
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,192
- Please.
- Celia, come on.

47
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:01,145
- I'm making it hard for you
to be the perfect son.

48
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,835
I'm sorry.

49
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,271
- I don't get why
it has to be this way.

50
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,400
- Yes, you do.

51
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,627
- I was happier
when you got along.

52
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:17,231
- It wasn't as much fun.
- Says who?

53
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:25,875
- The ghost of the father...
my father, not yours.

54
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,855
Yours died like a hero.

55
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,700
Mine died in a stupid accident,
according to her.

56
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,955
You look after your goals,
Raffi. And l'II look after mine.

57
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,328
- Did you give her my book?

58
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:32,266
- This is too weird for me.

59
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,375
- What is weird, Raffi?

60
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,743
Smoking pot? Or sleeping
with your step-sister?

61
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,359
- I'm old enough to know what...
- What are you telling me, Raffi?

62
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,534
That this is all normal?

63
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,182
That she should continue
to harass me?

64
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:53,384
Tell people that l'm responsible
for her father's death?

65
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:59,272
No one asked her to come here.
She could've stayed in Montreal.

66
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:00,714
- She needed us.

67
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:03,562
- What she needs is to destroy me
the same way

68
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,252
she thinks I destroyed him.

69
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,756
- Mom...
- She will never understand

70
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,251
why I stopped loving her father's.

71
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,551
- Or for seeing someone else?

72
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,789
- I'm not accountable to her.

73
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,313
- I am.

74
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,416
- Why?

75
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,968
- Because I love her.

76
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,410
That's a new twist to the story.

77
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,687
Why do you need to call it a story?

78
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,470
Don't you have anything better to do
at your age than fall in love?

79
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:38,687
My age? You were married at my age!

80
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,332
- Thank you.
- Tony, why don't you say grace.

81
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,047
- For what we are about
to receive, may the Lord

82
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,962
make us truly grateful. Amen.
- Amen.

83
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,810
- Dad?

84
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,402
- Yes.

85
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,596
- Why didn't you say 'Amen'?

86
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,284
- Well, I say it inside.

87
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,174
- Inside where?

88
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,640
- Inside my head.

89
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,495
- Can God hear it
inside your head?

90
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,328
- What do you think, Dad?

91
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,667
- God hears all your thoughts.

92
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,117
- But you don't believe in God.

93
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,297
Grandpa, that's not really
what happened.

94
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,950
- See you.
- Bye, Grandpa.

95
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,699
- Here's the situation, Dad.

96
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,018
Whenever Tony comes over alone,
he's fine.

97
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,500
We play, he laughs,
he's full of joy.

98
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,721
Whenever you're around,
he becomes quiet and withdrawn.

99
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,224
- That isn't true, Philip.
- And we can't stand it.

100
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,963
The more oppression you...

101
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,038
- Oppression?

102
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:08,787
He loves when l'm there.

103
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,025
- The more you bring this heavy
cloud into our apartment,

104
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,428
the more he believes
that the way we live is wrong.

105
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,900
- Now, I have never
told him that.

106
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,973
- You don't need to.
He can feel your disgust.

107
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,802
- Philip...

108
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:23,342
- And where did he get that...
Ali doesn't believe in God?

109
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:27,601
- He asked me why your friend
doesn't say grace with us...

110
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:32,654
- My friend.
- I told him he had his own God.

111
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,447
And that's true.

112
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:37,997
Philip, l'm...

113
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:43,499
l'm trying really hard to...
accept all this. I really am.

114
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,708
- Dad...

115
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:51,634
you're retiring soon.

116
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:54,610
You're gonna have a lot
of time on your hands.

117
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:59,310
Either you make an effort
to change your attitude,

118
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:05,071
or you're not... welcome
at our place anymore.

119
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,167
- Where you coming from?

120
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,732
- Turkey.

121
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,159
- Can you open this?

122
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,515
What are these?

123
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,758
- It's film.
It's motion-picture film.

124
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,802
It's for a movie.

125
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,434
I have, uh...

126
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,288
- This sort of thing is usually
done through a bonder.

127
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,458
- Well, they wanted me
to hand-deliver it.

128
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,928
- Who's 'they'?

129
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,327
- It's very valuable footage.

130
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,393
- Can you open it?
- Well, no.

131
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,398
It's exposed film.
It'II destroy it.

132
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:20,391
- Oh?

133
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,822
- It's for a movie that's
being shot here in Canada.

134
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,221
I had to go to Turkey
to get some process shots.

135
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:27,938
- Process shots?
- Shots that'II be used

136
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:30,341
for digital effects. And plates.
That sort of thing.

137
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,992
- I don't understand.

138
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,298
- There needs to be scenes
of hundreds of people

139
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:37,536
passing through these places.

140
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,613
And it's too expensive
to take actors and extras

141
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:43,133
to the middle of nowhere, so we
shoot empty shots of locations.

142
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,158
It's cheaper
to add people in later on.

143
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:46,627
- Huh.

144
00:15:58,085 --> 00:15:59,645
L'II be back.

145
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:44,319
Arshile Gorky's Studio
New York City, 1934

146
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,874
- Arshile Gorky remains one
of the most influential figures

147
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,656
in modern art.

148
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,960
His most famous painting,
'The Artist and His Mother,'

149
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:18,127
is based on a photograph
that was taken in 1912;

150
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,326
the only image that exists
of the artist's early life

151
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,435
in his native land.

152
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,889
Gorky is seen holding
a bunch of small flowers

153
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,387
as a fragrant gift
to his absent father,

154
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:33,362
the intended recipient
of this remarkable photograph.

155
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,880
- I'm confused.

156
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,050
Had Gorky changed his name
by this point?

157
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,495
- No.

158
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,251
He changed it in his twenties,

159
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,492
after his arrival
to the United States.

160
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,927
- Celia, sit down.

161
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,392
- Gorky looks prematurely solemn.

162
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,041
With almond eyes and oval face,

163
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:54,697
his hair combed neatly
to the side,

164
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,647
Shushan looks bravely
at the camera,

165
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,460
challenging her absent husband...
- Challenging?

166
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,283
Why would you say that?

167
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,724
Isn't it obvious he knew

168
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:07,205
the Armenians were about to be
massacred? He went to America

169
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,002
to prepare a life
for his family.

170
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,760
They wanted to send him
a photograph

171
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,203
to let him know
they're still alive.

172
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,757
There's nothing challenging...
- Gorky never understood

173
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:16,999
why his father did not return.

174
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,556
- Celia, just sit down. Come on.

175
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:23,555
- Aren't you confusing Gorky's
father with your dead husband?

176
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,962
I mean, your first dead husband.

177
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:30,631
The one who was shot
by the police. The terrorist.

178
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,106
- Sit down.

179
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,552
Sit down. We're here
to listen to this lecture.

180
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:37,350
- Let's go.

181
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:56,831
- 'The Artist and His Mother'
is not simply a painted version

182
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,344
of a photograph.

183
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:01,789
The differences underline
the expressive elements

184
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,034
that make this piece
such a powerful

185
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,794
work of art.

186
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:15,620
Gorky's homage to his mother was
bound to take on sacred quality.

187
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:21,792
His experience as a survivor
of the Armenian genocide

188
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,643
is at the root
of its spiritual power.

189
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:32,868
With this painting, Gorky had
saved his mother from oblivion,

190
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,771
snatching her
out of a pile of corpses

191
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,519
to place her
on a pedestal of life.

192
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:13,054
Let me look at you son.

193
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:14,998
You're missing a button!

194
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,820
It must have fallen off...

195
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,537
Hold your hand in front of it.

196
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:21,620
Like this?

197
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,709
Yes.

198
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,631
I'm just so shocked
to see you here.

199
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:10,105
I've seen all your films
and I really...

200
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:12,632
- Please. Please.

201
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,616
- We're the ones
who are overwhelmed by this.

202
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:16,655
I've been writing
this screenplay for five years,

203
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,223
done as much research
as possible

204
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,696
and you come up with this.
- With what?

205
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:23,825
- Well, that Gorky was a child
during the rebellion in Van,

206
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,271
that he was there.
It's amazing.

207
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,986
- My mother
was a genocide survivor.

208
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,942
All my life, I promised to make
a film to tell her story,

209
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,600
how she suffered.

210
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,736
And now,
we are making this film.

211
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:42,068
- I'm not understanding
something.

212
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,621
Is Gorky in your film?

213
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,067
- Not yet.

214
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,759
- As you were speaking,
we got very excited

215
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:51,190
about the idea of working
him in. As another character.

216
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,292
Well, not an entirely
new character,

217
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,331
but a character
we could build on.

218
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:59,982
See, this amazing artist
as a young kid...

219
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,321
It would be great
to have you as a consultant.

220
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:04,973
- You have her photos, a gift

221
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:08,818
from the ashes of all
that has been destroyed.

222
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:10,802
We can open this gift together.

223
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,121
- What's going on?

224
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,399
- Why did you bring up my dad?

225
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,937
Well, he didn't run away.

226
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:51,176
Okay, my mum just had to
distance herself from him.

227
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:54,158
- Huh. To save the family.
- He wasn't a terrorist.

228
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,556
- I didn't say he was.
- You said he was a terrorist.

229
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,174
- Did I? Well,

230
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,132
I suppose you could see it
that way.

231
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:04,045
I mean, he was about to
assassinate a diplomat.

232
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:07,490
- He was a freedom fighter.
Celia, there's a difference.

233
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,143
- Sure, it was
a really cool way to go.

234
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:15,106
A lot better than my dad...
jumping off a cliff.

235
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,805
- Jumping.

236
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,045
- He committed suicide.
- Well, that's new.

237
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,279
I thought the story was my mom
pushed him off the cliff.

238
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,800
- Story.

239
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:27,689
You think l'm making up a story?

240
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,753
- No, it's...
it's not what I meant.

241
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,158
- Raffi, l'm saying

242
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,103
that what happened
to my father matters.

243
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:56,160
I know that no one else cares,
but it matters to me.

244
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,335
- Well, then how
do I make it matter,

245
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,900
what happened to my father?

246
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,900
- You just do.

247
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,372
- How?

248
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,205
- You go there.

249
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:18,300
And you stick it in here.

250
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,529
And you listen to it beat.

251
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:27,931
Beat all night, all day.

252
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,207
That way, you never forget.

253
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:47,868
- Mount Ararat.

254
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,160
When I was a boy,

255
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,214
my mother used to tell me
this was ours.

256
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,215
Even though it was so far away.

257
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:06,331
And I used to dream
of a way to approach it,

258
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,292
to make it belong to who I was,
to who I became.

259
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:14,741
- Marty,

260
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:17,694
this book is the key
to your character.

261
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,986
It's the actual journal
of Clarence Ussher,

262
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,867
published in Boston
and New York in 1917.

263
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:25,820
Every scene in this film

264
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,542
is based on this document.

265
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,587
Think of it.
It is the true story

266
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:32,213
of a man who sees
an entire community wiped out

267
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:33,657
and is sickened by it.

268
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:37,499
So... so you can't play it...
- l've read this book.

269
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:43,064
As well as every available
piece of archival material

270
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:46,511
that so much as hints
at the region or these people

271
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,375
or the Armenian genocide.

272
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,529
I'm currently rereading
the Bible with Ussher in mind,

273
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:56,278
so beyond that,
it's pretty much...

274
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,384
up to my imagination.

275
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,424
And now l'm here
to make a film with Edward...

276
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,407
Saroyan.

277
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:07,511
Okay?

278
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,077
- This painting was very,
very popular even 100 years ago,

279
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,191
when it was painted.
And it's very popular now.

280
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:21,143
People love this painting.
And I think it's because...

281
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:26,290
because it's such a warm, safe
picture of two little kids.

282
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:29,771
We get the feeling that these
two kids in front of the fire,

283
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,049
warming themselves
after their bath...

284
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,627
- How'd it go?

285
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,554
- Think it went great.
- Did you get it?

286
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:39,825
Did he like you?
- I think so.

287
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,299
[Ring!]

288
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,633
Hello.

289
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,489
Yeah. Oh my God!

290
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,108
Oh my God!
- Good news?

291
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,132
- He just got a big part.
In a movie.

292
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,569
- Let me call you right back.

293
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,804
'Cause l'm in a gallery
and I can't really talk.

294
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,623
- Do you play a good guy
or a bad guy?

295
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,682
- I play a very, very,
very bad man.

296
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:05,417
Rah!!!

297
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,184
Rah!

298
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:15,406
Outside the city of Van,
Eastern Turkey, 1915

299
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,024
Just look at them!

300
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:30,280
Nice and comfortable... sipping
their coffee.

301
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:32,968
No idea what's about to hit them.

302
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,458
Let me take a shot...

303
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:50,696
You couldn't shoot a cow!

304
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,666
There's another twenty...
twenty five...

305
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,803
creeping up on us...
And in the front...

306
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,753
one chicken.

307
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,305
Aim!

308
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,424
Fire!

309
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,646
- Leave your weapons outside!

310
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,331
Get him inside.
Get his clothes off.

311
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:01,284
And get him ready for surgery.

312
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,966
To make sure that we get help,

313
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:11,068
l'm sending each of you out to
deliver a copy of this letter.

314
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:12,960
[Armenian]

315
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:18,521
The letter says to Americans

316
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,765
or any foreign consul,

317
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,320
that there are internal troubles
in Van.

318
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,282
[Armenian]

319
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,832
So inform
the American government

320
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,870
that American lives
are in danger.

321
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,376
[Armenian]

322
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,991
- And cut.

323
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:03,062
- That's a cut.
- Okay, everybody.

324
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:12,536
- Everything you see here is
based on what my mother told me.

325
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,574
What is it?

326
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,774
- You wouldn't be able to see
Mount Ararat from Van.

327
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:30,453
- Well, yes, but I thought
it would be important.

328
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:33,784
- But it's not true.
- It's true in spirit.

329
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:37,231
- See what you can do, okay?
And let me know.

330
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:39,891
Okay, I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta get off.

331
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,913
Okay, l'II talk to you later.
Okay, bye.

332
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,351
Sorry, I had a call.

333
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:47,540
- Rouben, Ani's confused
about the mountain, Ararat.

334
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,983
She has noticed quite correctly

335
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:51,023
that it would not be seen
from Van.

336
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:53,104
- Well, we thought
we could stretch things a bit.

337
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,734
I mean, it's such
an identifiable symbol

338
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,141
and given the moment in history
that we're trying to show,

339
00:31:57,273 --> 00:31:58,582
l just...
- So it's something

340
00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:02,486
you could justify?
- Sure. Poetic license.

341
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,779
- Where do you get those?

342
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,799
- Wherever you can.

343
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,236
- So that's my job?

344
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,083
To let you feel better
about distorting things?

345
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:14,636
- The young boy in our film

346
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:19,149
gets sent by Ussher
to deliver a letter.

347
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,391
He gets caught by the Turks.

348
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:24,176
- That's the character
we'd make into Gorky.

349
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,032
- How would you do that?

350
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:29,461
- Okay. By April 1915,

351
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,955
the Turks have completely
surrounded the Armenian quarter.

352
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,867
Within the quarter,
inside these fortified walls,

353
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:39,120
the American mission, run by
a Dr. Clarence Ussher. Okay?

354
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:43,474
Outside, a few hundred men
armed with ancient guns

355
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:46,505
are surrounded
by well-armed troops

356
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,465
with the latest
in European artillery.

357
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:52,271
Miraculously,
through their ingenuity,

358
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:55,183
or their teamwork,

359
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:56,972
they're able to hold
the Armenian position,

360
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,567
but they're completely isolated.

361
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:01,072
They're cut off
from the outside world.

362
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,602
Ussher has to somehow get word
to the outside world

363
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,835
about what's about to happen.

364
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:13,285
And so he hopes
that one of these boys...

365
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:15,943
Gorky, will get through.

366
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:27,690
- So do it.

367
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:30,221
- That's it?
That's all you have to say?

368
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,716
Edward Saroyan is one of the
greatest directors in the world.

369
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,340
- Twenty years ago.
- Yes...

370
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,266
- Whatever.

371
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,147
- Raffi, you know how long
l've been working on this.

372
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:41,961
If it can help Gorky's story
get told...

373
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:43,686
- Go for it.

374
00:33:46,188 --> 00:33:49,320
What?
- Why do you still sleep here?

375
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:53,921
- It's my home.

376
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,718
- Doesn't she want you there?

377
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:00,999
- It's uncomfortable.
It's too humid.

378
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:08,163
- Can we talk about what happened
the other night?

379
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,883
- Sure.
- That's why she wanted to read

380
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:12,992
my book, so she could
humiliate me?

381
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,746
- So fight back.
- Don't be ridiculous.

382
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,044
She knows next to nothing
about art. And l'm certainly not

383
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:20,965
going to respond
to her accusations.

384
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:23,103
- You seem to be doing
a pretty good job.

385
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,963
- What are you talking about?

386
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,038
- Just the way you use history
like a weapon.

387
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:28,963
I mean, talking about
Gorky's mother

388
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,037
as a way of attacking
Celia's issues.

389
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,596
- Celia's issues.
Are you out of your mind?

390
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:36,669
It was a prepared lecture.

391
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:39,740
Raffi, she wants to believe
that I murdered her father's,

392
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,293
that I pushed him off a cliff.
Would I do that?

393
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,796
Would you like to believe
that your mother is a killer?

394
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:47,965
Is that remotely possible
to you?

395
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,796
- Her new theory
is that you made him jump.

396
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:59,517
- How?
- She thinks

397
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,594
the whole last chapter
of the book is a...

398
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:03,619
a way of admitting guilt.
- Oh, I see.

399
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:05,536
The idea being since Gorky
committed suicide,

400
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,976
her father's must have as well.

401
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,179
- It's easy to make fun of her.

402
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,834
- Not as easy as you think.

403
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,054
Raffi,

404
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:20,569
she wants her father's' death to
be more meaningful that it was.

405
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:22,397
It gives her a cause.

406
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,239
- We all know how dangerous
those can be.

407
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,085
- She has no right
to compare it to a man.

408
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:32,314
Your father died
for something he believed in.

409
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,458
- L just wish I had some idea
of what that was.

410
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:14,899
- This film was shot in Toronto
almost a year ago.

411
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:16,890
- Yeah, that's right.

412
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:18,906
- And now you're coming back
from Turkey

413
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,692
with these cans of footage?

414
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,954
Well, this tells me
you worked on this film

415
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:42,609
as a production assistant
and driver.

416
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,238
This is a letter
of recommendation

417
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,034
for future employment.
It doesn't explain

418
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:49,101
why you're returning
from Turkey months later.

419
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,534
- There was some stuff
they wanted to add in Turkey.

420
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:54,224
They added a character.

421
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,049
They?
- Well, the director.

422
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:59,444
And the writer. And my mom.

423
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,101
- Your mom?

424
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:04,434
- Yeah.
She's an art-history professor.

425
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:06,606
She was a consultant
on the film.

426
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:08,912
She, uh, she got me the job.

427
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,598
- So who's this new character?

428
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,765
- Arshile Gorky. The painter.

429
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,356
- Turkish painter.
- Armenian.

430
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,801
- Now why did you

431
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,299
go to Turkey
to shoot an Armenian painter?

432
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:24,111
- Well, that's where he's from.
He was born there.

433
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:30,768
Armenia was historically part
of Eastern Turkey. Anatolia.

434
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:33,648
- And they sent you alone?

435
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:35,339
Without a crew?

436
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:38,124
- Well, they wouldn't have gotten
permission to send a crew there.

437
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,199
- Why not?
- Well, it's not that easy

438
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,759
to shoot a story about
the Armenian genocide in Turkey.

439
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,318
It's politically... sensitive.

440
00:37:45,457 --> 00:37:46,886
- In what way?

441
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:50,287
- Because the Turkish authorities
don't want to admit it happened.

442
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:55,305
- Oh. Why not?

443
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,946
- Well, you'd have to ask them.

444
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:07,151
- So, uh,
what's this story about?

445
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,426
- It's very good.

446
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,492
Yourfather's very good.

447
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:30,889
- Effendi.
- Yes.

448
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,875
- Can we discuss a payment?

449
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,469
- Do you know what I think of

450
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,251
as I look at these faces?
- No, effendi.

451
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:06,916
- I think of what's in their mind
as they stare in your camera.

452
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:11,652
Their desperate need
to be remembered.

453
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,369
For what, we may ask.

454
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:20,282
Payment is a gesture
of thanks, no?

455
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:22,843
- Yes, effendi.
- So let us examine

456
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:26,691
what it is that you have to be
thankful for.

457
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:32,636
A man of my position has chosen
you to take his portrait.

458
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,666
And this has
brought you prestige?

459
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,627
Honour?

460
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,157
How will you give thanks?

461
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:51,353
You're welcome.

462
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,281
Would you like
to thank me as well?

463
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:01,210
- Stefan!

464
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:10,014
- Anothertime, another means.

465
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:21,336
Very different ways to...

466
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:24,537
express gratitude.

467
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:34,258
- But deliver us from evil.
[Armenian]

468
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,047
Forthine is the kingdom.

469
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:39,091
And the power

470
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,618
and the glory

471
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,098
[both: Armenian]

472
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:45,203
[Both]: Amen.
[All]: Amen.

473
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:10,164
- We have to go.
- God bless you.

474
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,777
Do you remember when we took this
photo to send to yourfather?

475
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:17,712
Yes.

476
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,815
If the Turks capture you,

477
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:25,076
you will never give up yourfaith.

478
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,916
You will neverforget your mothertongue.

479
00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:32,140
If you survive...

480
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,963
it will be to tell this story.

481
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,626
Of what has happened here.
Of what will happen...

482
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,646
We will win, Mother.

483
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,745
Take this picture with you.

484
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,550
You will not forget me.

485
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:51,443
We will win.

486
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:38,567
- Now I want you to remember
that this has to be nailed

487
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:40,007
into the ball of the heel.

488
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:41,663
Not the sole,
'cause there is no bone

489
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,905
in the sole. It'II fall off.

490
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,663
- Ahhh! Ah! Ah!

491
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,923
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahhh!

492
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:15,771
- An appeal for Christian help.

493
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,665
Did your missionary
feel so persecuted?

494
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:20,895
We've invested you Greeks
and Armenians

495
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:23,134
with power and freedom.
You should be

496
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:24,761
thankful!!

497
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:31,805
[Faraway screaming]

498
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,033
This your mother?

499
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:42,427
- Well, she's given you
this photograph

500
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,667
so that you may remember her.

501
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,367
Look at it now.

502
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:51,774
This is a face of a woman
who has raised you

503
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,945
to feel superiorto us.

504
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:57,342
She's taught you that Turks
are vengeful and ignorant.

505
00:44:57,472 --> 00:44:59,577
That we're bloodthirsty.

506
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:10,259
Now l'm going to teach you
something.

507
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:15,549
What is about to happen to
your people is your own fault.

508
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:19,540
For as much as you talk about
your prophet Jesus Christ

509
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,939
in the depths of your souls,
you believe in nothing...

510
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,972
but commerce and money.

511
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:31,095
My streets overrun with
your markets and moneylenders.

512
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,730
Your greed has led us
to corruption and ruin.

513
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,584
Now you yourselves
will be ruined.

514
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:49,464
Get this back
to your American missionary.

515
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:50,936
Pick it up!!

516
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:56,660
You take that back
to your American missionary.

517
00:45:56,794 --> 00:45:59,510
He must sign it. Otherwise,
he must accept 50 of my soldiers

518
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:03,056
in the mission compound.
You understand?

519
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,654
- You said that this character

520
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:07,640
gave something to the boy
to take back to the missionary

521
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:09,491
for him to sign.
- It was a document

522
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:12,209
stating that Ussher
refused Turkish protection.

523
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:14,733
- But that's obvious. He's was
helping protecting Armenians.

524
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,180
- Exactly.

525
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:19,028
Actually, Ussher and Jevdet Bey
had met a few times before.

526
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:22,868
He tried to stop him
from carrying out his plans.

527
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,657
- What plans?

528
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,019
- For genocide.

529
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,972
Over a million people
were killed.

530
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:34,378
An ancient civilization
living on ancestral lands.

531
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:38,641
It was systematic
and fully planned.

532
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,489
The entire Armenian population
of Eastern Turkey

533
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,987
was eliminated.

534
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:24,041
- Now I need permission to put
50 soldiers with supplies

535
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,834
in your mission compound.

536
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:29,125
- Why?

537
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,172
- Well, to protect you,
of course.

538
00:47:35,694 --> 00:47:39,589
- We're underthe protection
of the United States of America.

539
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:46,054
- The United States of America.

540
00:47:49,581 --> 00:47:53,672
They're so far away.

541
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:58,408
- It won't be safe to send
so many Turkish soldiers

542
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,644
into the heart
of the Armenian quarter.

543
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:04,388
It's bound to cause trouble.

544
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:10,720
What danger are you trying
to protect us from?

545
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:23,110
- Lf you have a problem
with taking my soldiers,

546
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,233
you must sign this statement

547
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:31,110
that you refuse the protection
of the Turkish government.

548
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:38,750
[Raffi]: Lf Ussher
signed the document,

549
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,637
it would be like giving
the Turks permission

550
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:44,516
to slaughter the Americans
in the compound.

551
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:45,988
The same way

552
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:48,508
that they were massacring
the Armenians outside.

553
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:50,108
- You've lost me.

554
00:48:50,246 --> 00:48:53,246
- Well, it was the same document
that he'd presented to the boy.

555
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,388
If the United States government
ever made an inquiry

556
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:57,532
into the incident,
that statement,

557
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:59,644
the document the Turks
wanted Ussherto sign,

558
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:02,814
would affirm that the Americans
were offered protection

559
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:04,704
but that they refused.

560
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,527
- And if he let them in?

561
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,482
- Well, the Turks would use it
as a strategic point.

562
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:11,546
With that many soldiers and
artillery based in the mission,

563
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:13,659
they'd have a foothold
in the Armenian quarter.

564
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:16,610
- A Trojan horse.

565
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:19,489
- Right.

566
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,561
- So what did he do?

567
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:26,683
- Our premises are part of
the United States of America.

568
00:49:26,817 --> 00:49:28,760
They're extraterritorial
by treaty right.

569
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:30,207
Completely neutral.

570
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:33,752
And we will preserve
this neutrality to the last.

571
00:49:38,848 --> 00:49:40,987
[Armenian]

572
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:13,876
Stop! Levon stop!
What are you doing, brother?

573
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:16,527
Levon, you'II be killed.
Come back, Levon!

574
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:01,512
- They were heroes.

575
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:03,982
What happened in Van
in April 1915

576
00:52:04,113 --> 00:52:06,381
was an amazing act
of self-defence.

577
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,012
We hadn't done anything
like that

578
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:12,612
since we held back the Persians.

579
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:14,923
- And when did you hold back
the Persians?

580
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:16,811
- 451.

581
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:21,608
- 451.

582
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:25,703
- Well, like I said, we, uh...

583
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,725
we go back.

584
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,276
- Could you come back
to the office please, sir?

585
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:42,277
- See, I don't know why
l'm wearing this sword.

586
00:52:42,444 --> 00:52:44,899
I didn't have it in the movie,
so it's kind of ridiculous.

587
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,645
This is so tight, I can't...
Does it have to be so tight?

588
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:56,487
- I wanted to thank you.
- Are you kidding?

589
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:59,073
- All right, we'II just take it
from the top here, all right?

590
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:04,456
- This was... this was
a huge break for me.

591
00:53:04,586 --> 00:53:06,691
I mean, you're one
of my favourite directors.

592
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:08,515
I want to thank you.

593
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:12,998
Can I...
can I ask you something?

594
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:17,635
Did you cast me just because
l'm half Turkish?

595
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:19,524
- No.

596
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,044
It's because I thought you would
be perfect forthe part.

597
00:53:22,183 --> 00:53:24,572
- But being Turkish didn't hurt.

598
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:27,525
- Ah, didn't hurt, no.

599
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:32,030
- You know, you never asked me
what I thought of the history.

600
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,955
- What is there to think?

601
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,240
- Whether I believed it happened.

602
00:53:38,374 --> 00:53:40,642
A genocide.

603
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:43,620
- Well, l'm not sure it matters.

604
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:45,570
- I don't want
to take up yourtime,

605
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:48,570
ljust...
The thing is, when I...

606
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,017
play a part,
it's supposed to...

607
00:53:50,149 --> 00:53:51,904
come from here.

608
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:54,719
Not here. All right?

609
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:57,535
'Cause I was doing some research
and, uh...

610
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,936
I think the Turks
had a real reason to believe

611
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:02,041
that the Armenians were a threat
to their security.

612
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,856
I mean, their eastern border
was threatened by Russia

613
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:08,474
and, I mean, if they believed
that the Armenians

614
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,103
were gonna betray them...

615
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:12,413
So this was... this was war.

616
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:14,650
Populations get moved around
all the time. So...

617
00:54:14,786 --> 00:54:16,094
- Then again,

618
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:19,040
thank you for your work.

619
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:22,652
- Ali, we're ready for you.

620
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:32,926
- I got your car around back.
Drive you home.

621
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:41,346
Mr. Saroyan!

622
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,740
- Yes?

623
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,429
- Why didn't you answer him?

624
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:49,382
- Because he's having regrets
about playing the part.

625
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:53,374
I can understand. He will
receive angerfrom his people.

626
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:56,578
- But he thinks Turkey was
at war with Armenia.

627
00:54:56,712 --> 00:55:00,008
Doesn't it botheryou
that he doesn't get the history?

628
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:03,684
- No, not really.

629
00:55:03,818 --> 00:55:07,266
- I mean, why didn't you explain
to him that we were citizens,

630
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:09,312
we were Turkish citizens.

631
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:11,174
We had a right to be protected.

632
00:55:13,804 --> 00:55:16,139
- Are you driving him home?

633
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,250
- Yeah.

634
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:19,910
- Huh. Take this.

635
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:25,899
Buy him a bottle of champagne.

636
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,414
Let him think
that he has done something...

637
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:32,039
special?

638
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:33,737
- Something special.

639
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:40,462
- L'm sorry, Mr. Saroyan,
I don't think I understand.

640
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:44,042
- Young man, do you know
what still causes...

641
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,212
so much pain?

642
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:54,156
It's not the people we lost,

643
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:55,854
orthe land.

644
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,293
It's to know
that we could be so hated.

645
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,051
Who are these people,

646
00:56:08,184 --> 00:56:10,421
who could hate us so much?

647
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:18,553
How can they still deny
their hatred?

648
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:20,275
And so hate us...

649
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,785
hate us even more?

650
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:57,112
- That was a good scene.

651
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,680
- Thanks.

652
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:04,160
- Must be really weird to get
into that... head space.

653
00:57:04,293 --> 00:57:06,595
- Yeah.

654
00:57:06,725 --> 00:57:09,146
- I mean, I was raised with
all these stories, you know.

655
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:11,588
Evil Turks and everything, so...

656
00:57:11,718 --> 00:57:14,653
l'm a little hardened to it all.

657
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,541
But what you did today,
I mean, it, uh...

658
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:19,777
It made me feel
all that anger again.

659
00:57:19,912 --> 00:57:21,734
- Hey, thanks.

660
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:26,563
So I take it you're, uh...

661
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,126
Armenian.

662
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:30,819
- Well, yeah. Yeah, that's what
I meant when I said I was,

663
00:57:30,954 --> 00:57:33,704
you know, raised to feel
out of hatred to...

664
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:37,065
the person you're playing.
- Right. Right.

665
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:38,657
- You really pulled it off.

666
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:40,738
- Well, it'd be kind of hard
to disappoint you.

667
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:42,982
- What do you mean?
- Well, you were kind of prepared

668
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:46,281
to hate my character...
you said.

669
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:48,105
- Well, sure.

670
00:57:48,238 --> 00:57:50,181
But l'm also kind of suspicious
of stuff

671
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,937
that's supposed to make me
feel anything. You know?

672
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:58,828
When I was watching it,
like even though I know

673
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,066
you were supposed to make me
feel like hating you,

674
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:04,911
l... I resisted it. But, uh...

675
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:07,628
But then, I mean, by the end
of the scene, ljust... I...

676
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,422
- You felt like killing me.

677
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:13,585
- Yeah.

678
00:58:19,189 --> 00:58:22,703
My dad was killed trying to
assassinate a Turkish diplomat.

679
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:29,393
It was almost 15 years ago.

680
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:32,211
I could never understand...

681
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:34,198
what would make him
want to murder...

682
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:37,525
what he had to imagine that
Turkish ambassador represented.

683
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,110
But today, you gave me a sense

684
00:58:45,243 --> 00:58:47,381
of what was going on
in his head.

685
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:51,637
I wanna thank you.

686
00:58:54,972 --> 00:58:57,013
- Well...

687
00:58:57,149 --> 00:58:58,807
you're welcome.

688
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:20,153
- Shit.

689
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:32,156
- What's this?

690
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:34,661
- It's from Edward.
He wanted to give it to you.

691
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,513
And thanks.

692
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:40,422
- Now, was this before or after
my conversation with him?

693
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:44,447
- After. I guess he wants to show
there are no hard feelings.

694
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:47,170
- Ah.

695
00:59:47,305 --> 00:59:49,639
Okay. Thanks.

696
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:53,962
- Were you serious
about what you told him?

697
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,399
- What?

698
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,952
- That you don't think
it happened?

699
00:59:58,091 --> 01:00:00,197
- What, the genocide?
- Yeah.

700
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:05,222
- Are you gonna shoot me
or something?

701
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:11,782
Look, I never heard
about any of this stuff

702
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:15,214
when I was growing up.
You know?

703
01:00:15,342 --> 01:00:17,482
I did some research
forthe part.

704
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,201
From what I read,
there were deportations and...

705
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:24,966
Lots of people died.
Armenians and Turks.

706
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:26,479
It was World War I.

707
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:31,148
- But Turkey wasn't at war
with the Armenians.

708
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:34,829
I mean, just like Germany
wasn't at war with the Jews.

709
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:38,990
They were citizens. They were
expecting to be protected.

710
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:42,770
That scene you just shot was
based on an eyewitness account.

711
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:46,830
Your character, Jevdet Bey, the
only reason they put him in Van

712
01:00:46,965 --> 01:00:48,973
was to carry out
the complete elimination

713
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,419
of the Armenian population

714
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,438
in Van. There were telegrams,
there were communiquTs.

715
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:56,277
- Look, l'm not saying
that something didn't happen.

716
01:00:58,039 --> 01:00:59,567
- Something...

717
01:00:59,704 --> 01:01:01,909
- Look, I was born here.

718
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,743
So were you. Right?

719
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:09,972
- Yeah.

720
01:01:10,107 --> 01:01:12,857
- This is a new country.

721
01:01:12,988 --> 01:01:18,805
So let's just drop the fucking
history and get on with it.

722
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,494
No one's gonna wreck your home.

723
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:23,932
No one's gonna destroy
yourfamily.

724
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:27,195
Hmm?

725
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:31,550
So let's go inside and uncork
this thing...

726
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,054
and celebrate.

727
01:01:34,592 --> 01:01:36,021
Hmm?

728
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:47,361
- Do you know what Adolf Hitler
told his military commanders

729
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:49,018
to convince them

730
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:50,978
that his plan would work?

731
01:01:54,788 --> 01:01:57,538
'Who remembers the extermination
of the Armenians?'

732
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,339
- And nobody did.

733
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:11,458
Nobody does.

734
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:29,442
[Announcement]:
For security reasons,

735
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,330
please do not leave
your bags unattended.

736
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:33,574

pour des raisons de securite
- Roll up your sleeves.

739
01:02:39,183 --> 01:02:41,484
- Why?
- Please, roll up your sleeves.

740
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:49,770
- I don't take drugs.

741
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,196
- Can you open that bag, please?

742
01:02:58,162 --> 01:03:00,912
The numberyou gave me
has been disconnected.

743
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,090
- They must've closed
the production office.

744
01:03:02,227 --> 01:03:04,749
- Then who's paying your bills?
- What bills?

745
01:03:04,884 --> 01:03:07,372
- The cost of yourtravel.
- L'm paying for it myself.

746
01:03:07,508 --> 01:03:09,232
- I thought this was
forthe film.

747
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,675
- It is.

748
01:03:10,805 --> 01:03:12,463
- Then why wouldn't they
be paying for it?

749
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:14,987
- Because...
they don't know I went.

750
01:03:17,846 --> 01:03:21,776
They didn't want to shoot there,
so I... I went myself.

751
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:25,207
I found myself a cameraman and
we went to shoot this material.

752
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:29,650
I thought the director might
need some extra shots,

753
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:31,247
stuff that he could
cut in later.

754
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:34,169
- And what about the digital
effects, the people marching?

755
01:03:34,298 --> 01:03:37,233
- Well, that can still be added
if that's what they want to do.

756
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:41,338
- Can you play one of these
on this?

757
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:44,284
- Yeah.
- Could you put it on, please?

758
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:47,156
- Kind of personal.

759
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:51,450
- Then let's go
somewhere private.

760
01:03:56,735 --> 01:03:58,907
- 'L'm here, Mum.

761
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,927
Ani.

762
01:04:01,056 --> 01:04:04,603
In a dream world, the three
of us would be here together.

763
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:06,712
Dad, you and me.

764
01:04:08,674 --> 01:04:12,155
I remember all the stories
I used to hear about this place.

765
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:15,041
The glorious capital
of our kingdom.

766
01:04:15,172 --> 01:04:17,409
Ancient history.

767
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,061
Like the story that Dad
was a freedom fighter-

768
01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:23,940
fighting for the return
of this, I guess.

769
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,858
And then he died.

770
01:04:27,878 --> 01:04:29,701
And now something in me
died too.

771
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:36,708
What am I supposed to feel
when I look at these ruins?

772
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:38,815
And do I believe
that they're ravaged by time,

773
01:04:38,952 --> 01:04:40,262
or do I believe

774
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:43,013
that they've been
wilfully destroyed?

775
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:46,659
Is this proof of what happened?
Am I supposed to feel anger?

776
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,457
Can I ever feel the anger
that Dad must've felt when-'

777
01:04:52,587 --> 01:04:53,897
- When he tried to kill

778
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:55,622
a Turkish diplomat?

779
01:04:57,932 --> 01:05:00,715
- How did you know?
- You gave me your passport.

780
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:03,366
Files are kept.

781
01:05:03,502 --> 01:05:09,034
You have to be
the son of a... terrorist.

782
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,858
Will you turn that back on,
please?

783
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:21,322
- 'He tried to kill that man.

784
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,972
Why was he prepared
to give us up for that?

785
01:05:25,107 --> 01:05:28,752
Mom, what's the legacy
he's supposed

786
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:30,477
to have given me?

787
01:05:30,612 --> 01:05:32,817
Why can't I take any comfort
in his death?

788
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:40,747
When I see these places,
I realize how much we've lost.

789
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:45,142
Not just the land
and the lives,

790
01:05:45,271 --> 01:05:47,344
but the loss of any way
to remember it.

791
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,302
There is nothing here
to prove

792
01:05:49,432 --> 01:05:51,288
that anything
ever happened.

01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:03,232
- Excuse me, please don't get
too close to the paintings.

795
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:07,135
- I like looking at the details.

796
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:13,125
Do you know anything
about this artist?

797
01:07:13,259 --> 01:07:15,780
- Not really. I mean, I picked up
a little from that lecture

798
01:07:15,915 --> 01:07:17,290
the other night.

799
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,646
The one you left.

800
01:07:20,781 --> 01:07:24,130
- What do you remember
from the lecture?

801
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:25,928
- How much he suffered,

802
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:27,687
losing his family.

803
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:34,695
His mother dying of starvation
in his arms.

804
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:41,034
- When you look at this painting,

805
01:07:41,169 --> 01:07:42,663
can you understand?

806
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:45,933
- Understand what?
- That he would kill himself.

807
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:52,201
His home was lost,
his family destroyed,

808
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:54,543
neverto be seen again.

809
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:55,985
This painting

810
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:57,458
shows his pain.

811
01:07:58,997 --> 01:08:00,492
So much pain.

812
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:04,334
He couldn't stand it.

813
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:31,960
[Armenian music playing]

814
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:11,422
- What do you think?

815
01:09:11,557 --> 01:09:13,151
- I haven't finished it.

816
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:15,839
- What you've read so far.

817
01:09:15,974 --> 01:09:18,561
- Rouben...

818
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:20,669
l'm not the best judge
forthis kind of thing.

819
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:22,596
L've never read a script before.

820
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:25,598
- Did you get to the part where
Gorky rushes into the street

821
01:09:25,736 --> 01:09:27,329
and grabs the rifle
from the wounded Turk?

822
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:28,773
- Yes.

823
01:09:28,905 --> 01:09:31,873
- I know Edward's style
is a bit overthe top, but...

824
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:33,765
- It's really...

825
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:36,517
It's very... good.

826
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:42,662
Listen...

827
01:09:42,796 --> 01:09:46,921
maybe l'II get more excited
when I actually see it.

828
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:48,428
It's...

829
01:09:48,557 --> 01:09:50,533
it's difficult for me to...

830
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,196
imagine these things

831
01:10:04,593 --> 01:10:07,015
Go retrieve the rifle! Run! Run!

832
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,994
As a boy involved
in the heroic defence of van,

833
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:28,239
Gorky was witness to one
of the most courageous moments

834
01:10:28,373 --> 01:10:29,836
in Armenian history.

835
01:10:41,944 --> 01:10:43,603
But the years
which were to follow

836
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,812
would see him lose a home,
his people,

837
01:10:45,914 --> 01:10:48,019
and most dramatically,
his beloved mother.

838
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:50,938
In his most famous painting,
Gorky leaves

839
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:52,377
his mother's hand unfinished.

840
01:10:52,507 --> 01:10:54,482
As if the history
of its composition,

841
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,615
like that of his people,
had been violently interrupted.

842
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:03,769
The earthly sensuality of
the mother's touch is no more.

843
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:06,585
Only pure, burning
spiritual light remains.

844
01:11:06,718 --> 01:11:08,693
- Excuse me.

845
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,384
You said before that Gorky
worked on that painting

846
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:12,828
10 years.

847
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,514
- That's right.
- Is it possible

848
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:20,352
to work on something that long
and leave it unfinished?

849
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:21,791
- The painting is finished.

850
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:23,777
The unfinished hands
of his mother

851
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:25,433
were left purposely that way.

852
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:26,880
- Yeah, but...

853
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:29,019
don't you think he finished
his mother's hands

854
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:32,058
and after,
decided to erase them?

855
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:34,586
That he needed to destroy
what he made?

856
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:41,313
Can we talk about his suicide?

857
01:11:44,124 --> 01:11:45,499
- No.

858
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:47,735
- Why not?
- Because it was not

859
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,912
what I had intended
to read today.

860
01:11:50,049 --> 01:11:53,597
- L'm just curious about the way
you described the suicide

861
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:57,050
in your book. You... you make it
sound as if Gorky was obsessed

862
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,297
with memories of the genocide,
but you don't talk about...

863
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:01,374
...coming to this event.
- Okay, okay. Ljust want

864
01:12:01,512 --> 01:12:02,942
to talk about the suicide.

865
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,546
What's yourfucking problem?

866
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:08,005
- You... you said something
to my father.

867
01:12:08,526 --> 01:12:09,901
Like what?

868
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,591
- That you were having an affair.

869
01:12:12,112 --> 01:12:15,017
Don't get involved in things
that don't concern you.

870
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:16,780
Did you intend to destroy his life?

871
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:18,736
What are you talking about?

872
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:21,999
My father left my motherforyou...

873
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,687
my father gave up everything foryou.

874
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:30,738
I have nothing to apologize for.

875
01:12:30,876 --> 01:12:32,055
My father loved you.

876
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:36,086
My father was suffering, if he knew
that you were having an affair...

877
01:12:36,225 --> 01:12:40,188
I have no doubt that he would
have killed himself.

878
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:46,501
Yourfather died accidentally.
He tripped, and fell.

879
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,760
I don't have any other way
of explaining it.

880
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:57,701
It's a question of time.

881
01:12:57,839 --> 01:13:00,208
There's no rush to separate...

882
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:09,329
Listen, I didn't see him fall.

883
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:15,216
You didn't see him fall, oryou don't
want to think you saw him fall.

884
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:19,549
I don't remember anything but the
fact that he slipped and he fell.

885
01:13:21,536 --> 01:13:23,807
I can't remember it the way you want me to.

886
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:26,493
And even if I could remember what you
want me to remember...

887
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:28,035
...I wont.

888
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:30,108
I don't need to.

889
01:13:31,431 --> 01:13:32,479
Do you understand?

890
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,063
- Hey! Hey, no!

891
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,305
Let go. Let go.

892
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,159
- She was carrying a knife.

893
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:35,601
- Yes.

894
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:38,483
- So there was a certain degree
of premeditation?

895
01:14:38,613 --> 01:14:41,517
- It was a pocketknife,
something she always carries.

896
01:14:41,655 --> 01:14:44,625
- Because she never knew
when she might need it.

897
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:46,967
- What do you mean?
- L'm talking about her job,

898
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:48,922
what she did for a living!

899
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,956
Oh, yes, I know
all sorts of things.

900
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,031
When she was arrested,
the police discovered

901
01:14:55,169 --> 01:14:58,106
she'd dealt drugs, as well as
various credit frauds

902
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,350
on the Net. You were questioned
about your involvement;

903
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:02,428
she insisted you had nothing
to do with it.

904
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,022
It's all on yourfiles.
Was that true?

905
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:07,878
- What?

906
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,800
- That you had nothing
to do with it?

907
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:13,065
- L... I knew about it.

908
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:15,686
- Well, you didn't tell anyone?

909
01:15:15,822 --> 01:15:17,318
- No.

910
01:15:17,456 --> 01:15:19,825
- So you didn't have a problem
with the fact that your sister

911
01:15:19,954 --> 01:15:22,509
was dealing in drugs?
- Step-sister.

912
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,400
- Ah, yes, step-sister.

913
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:27,885
Most people are...

914
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,287
obvious about the crimes
they commit.

915
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:37,116
By the time I get them
to this room,

916
01:15:37,245 --> 01:15:39,931
it's just a matter of time
before...

917
01:15:40,064 --> 01:15:41,975
it all comes out.

918
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:43,423
- What?

919
01:15:43,554 --> 01:15:45,017
- Their shit.

920
01:15:45,156 --> 01:15:47,229
- I don't understand.

921
01:15:47,364 --> 01:15:50,083
- My job becomes pretty simple,
really.

922
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:51,743
I sit where you are,

923
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,434
I watch them on this toilet,

924
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:56,873
waiting forthe truth,

925
01:15:57,004 --> 01:16:01,230
the compressed tablets
of heroin.

926
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:03,269
Sometimes they get so nervous,

927
01:16:03,408 --> 01:16:07,501
the body acid breaks the package
and they overdose.

928
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:10,865
But that can take hours.

929
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:14,612
I sit and wait.

930
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:17,397
It's usually pretty silent.

931
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:20,182
They have time to think.
So do I.

932
01:16:20,315 --> 01:16:22,870
You know what goes through
my mind, Raffi?

933
01:16:23,005 --> 01:16:25,276
I wonder if I should
feel sorry forthem.

934
01:16:25,407 --> 01:16:27,776
They're usually kids
around your age;

935
01:16:27,905 --> 01:16:29,914
l'm about to destroy
their lives.

936
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:32,026
I know they're sorry
for what they've done

937
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:33,856
and they'II never
go through it again.

938
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,511
But the action has been taken.
It's too late.

939
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:40,384
- I had to go there.

940
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,478
- I have no doubt about that.
Aflame was lit in your heart.

941
01:16:45,613 --> 01:16:48,364
You thought things
would be clarified by...

942
01:16:48,495 --> 01:16:52,043
going there.
They weren't.

943
01:16:52,177 --> 01:16:54,219
You lost meaning.

944
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:56,845
And people are vulnerable
when they...

945
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:58,640
Iose meaning.

946
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:02,709
They do stupid things.

947
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:05,047
- I didn't lose meaning.

948
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:10,329
It's more like the meaning
of things changed.

949
01:17:13,441 --> 01:17:14,651
- What are you doing?

950
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:19,075
- There's something
I need to read to you.

951
01:17:21,926 --> 01:17:23,334
- Ani, you're being ridiculous.
Her attacking the painting

952
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:24,672
had nothing to do
with this film.

953
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:27,427
- I won't go on with this.
- You need to. We all do.

954
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:30,466
- What does this mean to you?
- L'm sickened by it.

955
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,875
- Because you feel responsible?
- No, of course not.

956
01:17:33,006 --> 01:17:34,862
L'm sickened because people
shouldn't do those things.

957
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:36,651
- What, attack works of art?

958
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:40,365
- What's your point, Ani?
- Rouben, you're sickened

959
01:17:40,499 --> 01:17:43,185
because that painting
is a repository of our history.

960
01:17:43,317 --> 01:17:46,581
It's a sacred code,
that explains who we are

961
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:48,720
and how and why we got here.

962
01:17:58,624 --> 01:18:01,975
- Excuse me, you can't cross set.
We're rolling.

963
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:06,816
We have an intruder on set.
- Okay.

964
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:08,838
We'II handle it from here.
- Oh, clamp, clamp.

965
01:18:08,967 --> 01:18:10,911
- What is she doing?
- Oh, look at this.

966
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,553
- It took us hours
to set this up.

967
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,002
- I need to talk to you.

968
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:19,043
- Better be paying me
for overtime.

969
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:21,322
- Please, we're shooting a scene.

970
01:18:21,456 --> 01:18:24,393
- All right, no. We're cutting.
- What is this? Godammit!

971
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,287
We're surrounded by Turks.

972
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:33,588
We've run out of supplies.
Most of us will die.

973
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:38,579
The crowd needs a miracle.
This child is bleeding to death.

974
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:42,427
If I can save his life, it may
give us the spirit to continue.

975
01:18:45,312 --> 01:18:46,742
This is his brother.

976
01:18:49,668 --> 01:18:51,840
His pregnant sister...

977
01:18:51,972 --> 01:18:54,341
was raped in front of his eyes,

978
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:59,395
before her stomach was slashed
open to stab her unborn child.

979
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:03,210
His father's eyes
were gouged out of his head

980
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,283
and stuffed into his mouth.

981
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:08,041
And his mother's breasts
were ripped off.

982
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,721
She was left to bleed to death.

983
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:17,267
Who the fuck are you?

984
01:19:36,131 --> 01:19:40,444
'-In a field of cinders,
where Armenian life was dying,

985
01:19:40,582 --> 01:19:44,863
a German woman,
trying not to cry,

986
01:19:45,001 --> 01:19:46,889
told me the horrors
she'd witnessed.

987
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,491
I must tell you what I saw

988
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,567
so people will understand
the crimes that men do to men.'

989
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:58,542
It was Sunday morning,

990
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:04,430
the first useless Sunday
dawning on the corpses.

991
01:20:07,353 --> 01:20:11,611
I saw a dark crowd in the courtyard
lashing a group of young women.

992
01:20:15,262 --> 01:20:17,501
And animal of a man shouted,

993
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:22,397
'You must dance,
dance when the drum beats.

994
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:25,402
With fury, the whips cracked
on the flesh of the women.

995
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:29,406
Hand in hand, the brides
began their circle dance.

996
01:20:29,543 --> 01:20:33,060
Dance, they raved.

997
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,814
Dance till you die.'

998
01:20:37,614 --> 01:20:41,807
'...dance with bare breasts, without shame...'

999
01:20:43,378 --> 01:20:46,380
[cracking whips and shouting]

1000
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,971
Then,

1001
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:17,374
someone brought a jug of kerosene.

1002
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,133
'The brides were anointed.

1003
01:21:20,267 --> 01:21:23,564
'Dance,' they thundered.

1004
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:27,492
There is a fragrance sweeter
than any perfume.

1005
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,122
With a torch,
they set the brides on fire.

1006
01:21:30,258 --> 01:21:31,569
And the charred bodies

1007
01:21:31,699 --> 01:21:33,391
rolled to their deaths.

1008
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,256
The German woman
looked at me and said:

1009
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:43,314
'How shall I dig out
these eyes of mine?'

1010
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:46,972
Tell me. How?'

1011
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,732
[Screaming]

1012
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:00,528
This is it, Mom.

1013
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:03,571
The Madonna and child,
on the island of Aghtamar,

1014
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:05,051
where it all began.

1015
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,206
I was there
when they shot that scene.

1016
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:14,138
It was the same day
she attacked the painting.

1017
01:24:14,276 --> 01:24:15,968
The painting based on this.

1018
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:19,431
I left for Turkey a week later.

1019
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,016
- Does she know
you went to the island?

1020
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:24,042
- Who?
- Your mother.

1021
01:24:24,171 --> 01:24:26,114
- No. No, she doesn't.

1022
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,288
- Have you spoken to her?

1023
01:24:29,422 --> 01:24:30,765
- No.

1024
01:24:36,595 --> 01:24:38,286
- People lose touch.

1025
01:24:47,258 --> 01:24:49,267
- There's something
l've been meaning to ask you.

1026
01:24:49,404 --> 01:24:50,746
- Yeah?

1027
01:24:52,799 --> 01:24:54,457
- Aren't there dogs
used forthis sort of thing?

1028
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:56,349
- What sort of thing?

1029
01:24:56,481 --> 01:24:58,752
- Well, if you think
there are drugs in these cans...

1030
01:24:58,882 --> 01:25:00,858
- Yeah, we have dogs forthat.

1031
01:25:05,096 --> 01:25:07,781
- So, uh...
why don't you use one?

1032
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:09,321
- What?
- A dog.

1033
01:25:10,859 --> 01:25:15,881
- A dog would take away
what I like most about this job.

1034
01:25:16,015 --> 01:25:18,155
- What's that?
- The opportunity to...

1035
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:21,193
better understand
how the mind works.

1036
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,973
A dog would come in and bark.

1037
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:27,053
And that bark would mean
only one thing:

1038
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:28,501
That there were drugs
in these cans.

1039
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:32,660
Ruff! You're lying.
I caught you. You're a liar.

1040
01:25:35,772 --> 01:25:37,716
That's what a dog does.

1041
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:39,164
- Right.

1042
01:25:39,294 --> 01:25:42,493
- L'm not saying that
what a dog does isn't important.

1043
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:44,033
But there are...

1044
01:25:44,162 --> 01:25:47,230
other issues involved.
Aren't there?

1045
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,716
Things a dog doesn't have
the capacity to consider.

1046
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:55,362
A dog...

1047
01:25:55,498 --> 01:25:57,987
wouldn't know
he's being retired,

1048
01:25:58,124 --> 01:26:00,493
that this is his last day,

1049
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:03,012
his final interrogation.

1050
01:26:07,186 --> 01:26:09,195
Is someone picking you up?

1051
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:11,242
- No.

1052
01:26:11,381 --> 01:26:13,237
- Good.

1053
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:14,927
Might be worried.

1054
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,319
Even l'm worried.

1055
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:21,786
- About what?

1056
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:23,259
- About you.

1057
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,535
What are we gonna do?

1058
01:26:30,082 --> 01:26:31,906
There's no one I can contact.

1059
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:37,153
There's no way of confirming...

1060
01:26:37,286 --> 01:26:41,480
that a single word that
you've told me tonight is true.

1061
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:47,270
- Everything l've told you
is exactly what happened.

1062
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:26,244
- My mother never told me about
what happened during the march.

1063
01:27:26,376 --> 01:27:30,154
Only one story.
They had a pomegranate tree

1064
01:27:30,284 --> 01:27:31,691
in the garden.

1065
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:34,572
And when they came
to take the family away,

1066
01:27:34,703 --> 01:27:37,574
she grabbed one of the fruit.

1067
01:27:37,713 --> 01:27:40,911
She knew the journey
would be long.

1068
01:27:41,043 --> 01:27:46,513
Every day, she would take out
one seed and eat it.

1069
01:27:46,647 --> 01:27:50,195
She would bite it bit by bit,

1070
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:53,813
pretending that one seed
was a whole meal.

1071
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,291
Try it.

1072
01:28:13,449 --> 01:28:16,932
Now, when I eat
a pomegranate seed,

1073
01:28:17,068 --> 01:28:19,655
it gives me two things:

1074
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,475
Luck

1075
01:28:22,608 --> 01:28:24,648
and a powerto imagine.

1076
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:31,826
[Beeping]

1077
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:39,032
- Hello?

1078
01:28:39,163 --> 01:28:41,816
- Mom. Hi.

1079
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,635
- Raffi?

1080
01:28:44,767 --> 01:28:47,737
Raffi, where are you?
- Ljust got back to Toronto.

1081
01:28:47,873 --> 01:28:50,557
They've stopped me here
at Customs,

1082
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:52,831
with all the footage
I got forthe film.

1083
01:28:54,374 --> 01:28:56,065
They're wondering
what's inside the cans.

1084
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:57,509
- What cans?

1085
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,845
What are you talking about?

1086
01:28:59,977 --> 01:29:02,630
- The stuff I had to shoot
around Van.

1087
01:29:02,763 --> 01:29:05,765
They've stopped me here
at Customs and, uh...

1088
01:29:05,901 --> 01:29:08,140
they want to open the cans,
but they can't. Because...

1089
01:29:09,488 --> 01:29:11,759
Raffi, do you want me to lie?

1090
01:29:11,826 --> 01:29:13,420
- Yes.

1091
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:16,779
I miss you too.

1092
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:22,197
I have so much to tell you, Mom.

1093
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:24,752
I went to Aghtamar.
- Aghtamar?

1094
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:28,122
- I found the mother and child
on the church.

1095
01:29:28,253 --> 01:29:30,743
I had some days free,
so I went to Aghtamar.

1096
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:33,085
Here, l'm gonna hand
you overto the inspector.

1097
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:35,836
I think he wants to know more
about the film this is for.

1098
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,967
- Hello. Are you Raffi's mother?
- Yes, I am.

1099
01:29:40,101 --> 01:29:42,591
- Are you a professor
at the university?

1100
01:29:42,728 --> 01:29:44,485
- Yes, that's right.

1101
01:29:46,154 --> 01:29:47,464
- And you're involved
in this film?

1102
01:29:47,594 --> 01:29:50,825
- Yes, I was hired
as a historical consultant.

1103
01:29:50,957 --> 01:29:53,064
A book I wrote
was used as a reference.

1104
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:55,206
- What was the book about?

1105
01:29:55,343 --> 01:29:58,542
- It was about the life
of Arshile Gorky.

1106
01:29:58,674 --> 01:30:00,650
- Is he the main character
in the film?

1107
01:30:00,787 --> 01:30:02,098
- No.

1108
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:04,783
- What was your son shooting
in Turkey?

1109
01:30:04,918 --> 01:30:08,019
- He had to go to the place
where Arshile Gorky was born.

1110
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,463
- Why?

1111
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:13,044
- To shoot some material.
- And how is this material

1112
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,522
to be used?

1113
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:19,065
- To help show what happened.

1114
01:30:21,154 --> 01:30:23,709
- How did he die?

1115
01:30:23,843 --> 01:30:25,885
- Who?

1116
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:28,357
- Gorky.

1117
01:30:28,487 --> 01:30:31,719
- Why are you asking me
these questions?

1118
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:34,184
- Did he kill himself?

1119
01:30:38,318 --> 01:30:40,522
[Cheering and clapping]

1120
01:30:58,844 --> 01:31:02,010
- Ani, we have to go.

1121
01:31:02,142 --> 01:31:03,900
- Where are you?

1122
01:31:04,032 --> 01:31:05,855
- Where am I?

1123
01:31:05,984 --> 01:31:10,298
- Listen, she's at the premiere
of the film,

1124
01:31:10,436 --> 01:31:13,668
and she'II have to get back
to you, okay?

1125
01:31:13,798 --> 01:31:17,096
- Hello? May I speak
to my son, please?

1126
01:31:19,722 --> 01:31:21,862
- So the film
is completely finished.

1127
01:31:26,959 --> 01:31:30,344
- Please, let me speak to my son.

1128
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,272
Raffi?

1129
01:31:39,096 --> 01:31:40,438
- Yeah.

1130
01:31:40,985 --> 01:31:42,547
Tell me what to do.

1131
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,204
- Sure.

1132
01:31:49,343 --> 01:31:51,166
L'II meet you at home.

1133
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:24,688
- Marty, how are you responding
to the people

1134
01:32:24,824 --> 01:32:27,159
who say this is all
an exaggeration?

1135
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:29,330
- It's, you know...
it's documented.

1136
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:31,257
And really, every word I say

1137
01:32:31,388 --> 01:32:33,462
is directly quoted
from Ussher's own journal.

1138
01:32:33,597 --> 01:32:34,907
- Marty!

1139
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:36,924
- That's where I met them,
right on the train.

1140
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,030
- To Ararat.
- Yeah. They were shooting

1141
01:32:39,169 --> 01:32:40,480
a commercial.
- A commercial?

1142
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:42,782
- I became friends with the
cameraman and I told him

1143
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:45,339
that I wanted to get an image
with this. This.

1144
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:47,846
I wanted to get a shot of Ararat
in the picture.

1145
01:32:47,976 --> 01:32:49,285
- What for?
- Forthe film. I thought

1146
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:51,589
it was something we could use.
- How? The film is finished.

1147
01:32:51,722 --> 01:32:53,032
- I wasn't thinking about that.

1148
01:32:53,162 --> 01:32:55,881
He had to bribe a soldier
to take us up.

1149
01:32:56,013 --> 01:32:58,633
That's a military road, okay?
You can't just go up there.

1150
01:32:58,766 --> 01:33:01,802
That's his voice. You can
actually hear it on the...

1151
01:33:01,937 --> 01:33:04,656
We went up about halfway and
then... We shot this footage

1152
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:06,927
from there. On film.
On this film.

1153
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,096
- Why didn't you tell me
this before?

1154
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:12,272
- I had to tell you
the other story.

1155
01:33:12,407 --> 01:33:13,521
- Why?

1156
01:33:13,657 --> 01:33:17,337
- Because it meant
something to me.

1157
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:33,601
- So this voice on the tape,

1158
01:33:33,735 --> 01:33:35,908
this crew person,

1159
01:33:38,345 --> 01:33:40,868
gave you the film,

1160
01:33:41,004 --> 01:33:42,598
let you use his camera,

1161
01:33:42,734 --> 01:33:44,228
bribed a soldier...

1162
01:33:45,808 --> 01:33:48,078
and then drove you up
Mount Ararat.

1163
01:33:49,618 --> 01:33:50,961
- Yes.

1164
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,761
- Did he ask you to do him
a favour in return?

1165
01:33:55,894 --> 01:33:57,520
- Who?

1166
01:33:57,656 --> 01:33:59,446
- Raffi...

1167
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:06,195
Did he ask you to bring anything
into this country?

1168
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:14,267
- He asked me to bring
those cans.

1169
01:34:32,463 --> 01:34:33,894
- And what's in them?

1170
01:34:35,826 --> 01:34:38,316
- He said it's film.

1171
01:34:38,452 --> 01:34:41,716
- Why did you believe him?

1172
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,703
- Ani.

1173
01:35:33,242 --> 01:35:34,584
Ani!

1174
01:35:46,435 --> 01:35:48,192
[Screaming]

1175
01:36:58,036 --> 01:37:00,340
- Close the door.

1176
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,099
- Can we turn out the light?

1177
01:37:24,647 --> 01:37:25,957
- Why?

1178
01:37:26,088 --> 01:37:28,359
- So the film won't be ruined.

1179
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,979
- You're still convinced.

1180
01:37:32,524 --> 01:37:35,396
- You can feel it in the dark.

1181
01:37:35,534 --> 01:37:39,148
- All right, Raffi.
Turn out the light.

1182
01:37:58,014 --> 01:37:59,902
Forthe last time,

1183
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:02,848
what do you think is in here?

1184
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,321
- Film.

1185
01:38:05,955 --> 01:38:08,413
That's what he told me.

1186
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,623
That's what I need to believe.

1187
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:13,127
- And what would happen
if you didn't believe it?

1188
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,220
- L'd be a criminal.

1189
01:38:17,355 --> 01:38:20,424
- And what would you say
if I told you it was heroin?

1190
01:38:20,558 --> 01:38:22,763
- It isn't.

1191
01:38:22,895 --> 01:38:25,417
- What makes you so sure?

1192
01:38:25,553 --> 01:38:27,496
- You'd turn the light on.

1193
01:39:31,135 --> 01:39:33,656
- Sir? The arrivals?
The international arrivals?

1194
01:40:56,986 --> 01:40:58,580
- You let him go?

1195
01:40:58,715 --> 01:41:00,058
- Yep.

1196
01:41:02,046 --> 01:41:04,348
- But what was in the cans?

1197
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:06,455
- Would you believe me
if I told you?

1198
01:41:06,592 --> 01:41:08,634
- What do you mean?

1199
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:10,112
- Heroin.

1200
01:41:11,652 --> 01:41:13,311
- No.
- Film?

1201
01:41:16,135 --> 01:41:18,046
- But I don't get it.

1202
01:41:18,185 --> 01:41:20,904
You did check the cans.
- Yeah. One.

1203
01:41:22,571 --> 01:41:23,881
- What was in it?

1204
01:41:24,013 --> 01:41:27,594
- Ah, it doesn't matter,
for Chrissake.

1205
01:41:27,727 --> 01:41:29,517
- Dad!

1206
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,150
- I trusted him.
- But he was lying to you

1207
01:41:35,285 --> 01:41:36,594
all night. He...

1208
01:41:36,725 --> 01:41:38,515
He changed his story.

1209
01:41:38,647 --> 01:41:42,577
- The more he told,
the closer he came to the truth.

1210
01:41:42,714 --> 01:41:44,537
Till he finally told it.

1211
01:41:46,876 --> 01:41:49,081
I couldn't punish him
for being honest.

1212
01:41:49,214 --> 01:41:51,703
- But he was smuggling drugs.

1213
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,532
- He didn't think he was.

1214
01:41:53,665 --> 01:41:56,350
- How do you know?

1215
01:41:56,483 --> 01:41:58,939
- He didn't believe
he could do something like that.

1216
01:42:03,016 --> 01:42:04,358
- Dad...

1217
01:42:08,812 --> 01:42:10,701
what came overyou?

1218
01:42:14,031 --> 01:42:15,755
- You did, Philip.

1219
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:21,714
I was thinking of you.

1220
01:42:33,469 --> 01:42:34,484
- How are you responding
to the people

1221
01:42:34,557 --> 01:42:36,020
who say this is all
an exaggeration?

1222
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,429
- This film is the kind of film-
- You have a visitor.

1223
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,317
...you can do only once
in your lifetime.

1224
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:44,030
Because it tells a story
which is a true story...

1225
01:42:58,863 --> 01:43:01,516
- Arshile Gorky was born
in a small village

1226
01:43:01,649 --> 01:43:05,132
on the shores of Lake Van.

1227
01:43:05,267 --> 01:43:07,308
From the shores of this village,

1228
01:43:07,444 --> 01:43:10,315
the island of Aghtamar
was in plain view.

1229
01:43:10,454 --> 01:43:12,343
Gorky, as a child,

1230
01:43:12,471 --> 01:43:14,164
would go to this island
with his mother,

1231
01:43:14,297 --> 01:43:16,502
who would show him
the detailed carvings

1232
01:43:16,634 --> 01:43:18,130
on the walls of the church.

1233
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:23,131
- Why are you showing this to me?

1234
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:25,818
- This is the origin,
from the memory of this place,

1235
01:43:29,443 --> 01:43:32,959
right to the photograph,
to the sketch,

1236
01:43:33,094 --> 01:43:34,405
to the painting.

1237
01:43:34,535 --> 01:43:36,510
You told me to go there.

1238
01:43:36,648 --> 01:43:39,203
I had to put something in my
heart. If that was gonna happen,

1239
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:41,761
it was gonna happen here.

1240
01:43:43,725 --> 01:43:46,247
That I was prepared
to throw my whole life away.

1241
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:53,355
And last night,
as we were sitting in that...

1242
01:43:53,492 --> 01:43:55,827
dark room,

1243
01:43:55,957 --> 01:43:57,813
as I heard him open the can,

1244
01:43:57,943 --> 01:44:00,792
I felt it.

1245
01:44:00,921 --> 01:44:02,930
- You felt what?

1246
01:44:04,491 --> 01:44:07,286
His ghost.

1247
01:44:07,422 --> 01:44:09,791
The ghost of my father.
