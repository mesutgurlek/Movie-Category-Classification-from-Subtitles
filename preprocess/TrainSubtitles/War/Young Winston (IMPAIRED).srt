It means what it says.
Mensa: a table.

246
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:34,681
Mensa is a noun
of the first declension.

247

There are five declensions.

Yes, sir.
But what does it mean?

250
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:47,357
I have told you.
Mensa in Latin means "a table".

251
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:49,196
But it means
" O table" too, sir.

252

And what does " O table" mean?

253
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,360
"Mensa: O table"
is the vocative case.

O table.

255
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:01,755
You would use that in addressing a table,
in invoking a table.

256
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,718

What can I do for you, ma'am?

314
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:02,595
Actually, I want to talk to you
about the election.

315
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:06,234
My husband, Lord Randolph Churchill,
is standing for this constituency.

316
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:09,762
And I'm helping
him to get elected.

317
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:12,993
Oh, uh...

318
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:15,912
Ma'am, in this constituency

319
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,996
in effect, we vote as we please.

320
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:23,919
And we don't like people coming round
asking us for our votes.

321
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:28,475
Furthermore, I never discuss
politics with women.

322
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,635
Even ladies, ma'am,
begging your pardon.

323
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:33,113
In... In... In... In effect.

324
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:36,674
But I want your vote.
How am I to get it if I don't ask for it?

325
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,880
Indeed.
Well, that's a point.

326
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,434
Quite so. You...
You have a point there, ma'am.

327
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:45,437
It is a point,
but it's no use.

328
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:48,357
I'm a life-long liberal.

329
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:52,517
Besides, I don't hold with lordships lolling
about the House of Commons.

330
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:55,357
No. Horses for courses, I say.

331
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:58,721
Lords for lords, commons in
the Commons, in effect, ma'am.

332
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:01,114
But my husband doesn't loll.

333
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:04,037
He never lolls.
He works very hard.

334
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:06,672
That's why he isn't here
and I am, in his place.

335
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:08,197
In effect.

336
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:12,876
Oh, and what time, may I ask,
does His Lordship arise in the morning?

337
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,354
Most days, about 11.
You see, the House sits at night.

338
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:20,233
Sometimes very late.
He st... He stays in bed till 11?

339
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,283
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am

340
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:26,562
I could never vote for a man
who lies abed until 11:00.

341
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:30,516
That is the end of it,
ma'am. Good day.

342
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,481
Good day.

343
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:42,923
Just a moment.

344
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,679
Doesn't get out of bed
till 11, does he?

345
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:54,278
Well, ma'am, looking at you now,

346
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:57,880
it's a wonder to me
he bothers to get out at all.

347
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:00,393
Good day to you,

Good evening.
Welcome home, milady.

350
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:12,397
JENNIE: Thank you, Evans. Betty,
Marlene. Is Lord Randolph in?

No, milady.
Oh. Where's Everest?

352

I'm here,
Lady Randolph.

353
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:20,393
If I might speak to you?
Now, please.

354
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,002
When did this happen?

Have you called the doctor?

We shall be taking him
out of that place.

Won't we, milady?

INTERVIEWER: Ladies and gentlemen,
Lord Randolph Churchill,

359
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,403
Secretary of State for India.

360
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,283
Lord Randolph. Many people
give you the major credit

361
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,878
for the return of the Conservative Party
to power.

362
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:17,842
Yet there is a rumour that
you tendered your resignation

363
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,995
to the prime minister,
Lord Salisbury.

364
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:23,952
I trust I am not here to exchange gossip
or to encourage a rumour.

365
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:27,639
INTERVIEWER: But you will not deny there
is friction between yourself and Lord Salisbury.

366
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:30,523
I refuse to discuss
that any further.

367
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,596
To put an end to it,
let me say

368
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:37,963
that I have never run away from a fight
when I believed it necessary.

369
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,684
But I am and always will be
loyal to the Tory Party.

370
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:42,877
Mind you...

371
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,322
some of my friends in my own party
have a great lesson to learn.

372
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,759
The Tory Party
will never remain in power

373
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:53,803
until it gains the confidence of the minorities
and the working classes.

374
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:58,037
Because the working classes are quite
determined to govern themselves.

375
00:32:58,204 --> 00:33:01,401
INTERVIEWER: Ah, yes. Your theory
of Tory democracy.

376
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:04,716
It is said that there are
few who take it seriously.

377
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:05,953
Really?

378
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:08,001
Yes. After all,
as an aristocrat

379
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:11,793
it's difficult to accept you
as an advocate of democracy.

380
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:13,920
Many people think
you use it as a device

381
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:18,157
to make yourself prime minister
in Lord Salisbury's place.

382
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,841
Do you?

383
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:24,440
Not at all.
Good.

384
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:28,432
Recently, you've expressed strong views
on the state of the Irish question.

385
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:33,439
Ah, well...
The Irish question...

386
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:36,118
That, I'm afraid,
will never be solved.

387
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,883
Quite.

388
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:41,593
Now, Lord Randolph,
on a more personal note,

389
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:44,961
you and Lady Randolph,
the former American heiress Jennie Jerome,

390
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,955
are leaders of society.

391
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:50,480
Your racehorses are most
successful, you entertain lavishly,

392
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:54,239
and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
attends your dinners frequently.

393
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:55,837
And Lady Randolph
and you

394
00:33:56,004 --> 00:34:00,156
are identified with all that is new
and fashionable.

395
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,599
Your splendid home
here in Connaught Place

396
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:06,313
is one of the few
to have electric lighting.

397
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:10,716
How do you find it?
Do you prefer it to gas?

398
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:13,712
Well, it's all rather
up-to-date, I suppose.

399
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:16,637
That thing in the cellar...
I think you call it the dynamo.

400
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,760
...is rather noisy.

401
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:22,280
The lights will keep going out
always at the wrong times.

402
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:25,675
No, I don't think that electric light will
ever replace gas.

403
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,914
At least, not in private houses.
No, no.

404
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,042
I believe, Lord Randolph,
you have a son.

405
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:34,002
What? Yes, actually.
Two.

406
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,803
Two sons,
Winston and Jack.

407
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:40,240
No doubt, they're very
proud of their father.

408
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:41,404

CHURCHILL: I had scarcely passed
my 12th birthday

414
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:58,196
when I entered the inhospitable
regions of examinations,

415
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:00,600
through which,
for the next seven years

416
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,675
I was destined to journey.

417
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:05,836
These examinations
were a great trial to me.

418
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:14,676
I should have lik ed to be ask ed
to say what I knew.

419
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:18,678
They always contrived
to ask what I did not know.

420
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:22,041
This sort of treatment
had only one result:

421
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,002
I did not do well
in examinations.

This was especially true

424
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:43,003
of my entrance examination
to Harrow.

425
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:47,878
I wrote my name
at the top of the page.

00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:53,073
I wrote the number
of the question: one.

And after much reflection,
I put a brack et around it.

428
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,594
But thereafter, I could not think
of anything connected with it

429
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,119
that was either
relevant or true.

430

Incidentally, there arrived
from nowhere in particular

00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,036
a blot and several smudges.

CHURCHILL: It was from these slender
indications of scholarship

437
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,679
that Mr. Welldon, the headmaster

438

drew the conclusion that I was worthy
to pass into Harrow.

439

It is very much to his credit.

capable of looking
beneath the surface.

upon paper manifestations.

I beg you not to send it

to leave the government at this time,

468
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,877
on this issue of the budgets for the army
and navy would be a tragic error.

You must not do it.

I'm pledged to economy
up to my eyes.

00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:56,683
How can I accept this flagrant misuse
of public money?

474
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:59,278
May I say that public money
has been wasted before

475

and the nation
has survived.

Then why do you feel it
necessary to resign?

479
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,118
Because in addition to being
leader of the House of Commons,

480
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,752
I'm also chancellor
of the exchequer.

I am responsible
for the country's money.

Why resign? In protest?

483
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:24,800
The country will not
be grateful. After all,

484
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:27,239
isn't this a matter
of national defence?

At once. Now.

Forgive me, but it is a matter
of some importance.

ugly and tiresome at his age.

To the best of my memory,
I was always fairly presentable.

You were right, of course.

Nonsense.

Well, if you ever spoke

the world of politics can be
very difficult sometimes.

And I have my share
of problems these days.

are misjudged.

Things I say are
often distorted.

Perhaps that's why
I'm so often bad-tempered.

Oh, no, Father. You're a great man.
Everyone knows that.

to younger people, to children.

They forget what it was like
when they were children.

And sometimes,
when they're bad-tempered,

than they think they are or mean to.

of figure in politics?

widow of
Lord Randolph Churchill,

1029

You play, if I may say so,

It has been said that you could appear
on the concert stage

Thank you.

It has also been said,
no doubt with malice,

1035

that you interest yourself a great
deal in your son Winston's affairs...

between your efforts
on his behalf now

and your neglect of him
when he was a child.

Neglect?

That is vicious and hurtful.

My son never lacked
a mother's love.

Naturally, when he was a child, he went off
to school. The very best of schools.

1047
01:17:18,924 --> 01:17:21,358

You are at liberty to think so.

But if you are insinuating
the slightest impropriety...

1056
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:53,117
Not at all, dear lady. Not at all.
Please be calm.

1057

the well-known sportsman.

you mean by "linked".

there was gossip, malicious, of course,

1066
01:18:21,724 --> 01:18:24,636
that your marriage to Lord Randolph was,
shall we say, pro forma.

1067
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:26,760
And that in the event
of a divorce, you and Count...

1068
01:18:26,924 --> 01:18:28,516
There was never
a possibility of divorce.

1069
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:30,561
But you and Count Kinsky
are still friends?

1070
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:32,555
Yes.

1071
01:18:37,844 --> 01:18:40,358
Charles was married shortly
before my husband died.

Three weeks before,
in his own country, in Austria.

He has remained
there ever since.

1074

He has great responsibilities
there.

1075
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:51,399
One last question.

1076
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:54,442
What precisely was the nature
of your husband's last illness?

1077
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:59,720
It is well-known.

1078
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:01,602
It was caused by overwork.

1079
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:04,318
Ah, yes. But the symptoms were most
curious, were they not?

1080
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:07,478
I don't know
what you mean.

1081
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:09,919
But surely you were aware
of your husband's symptoms?

1082
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:11,437
I think this has
gone far enough.

1083
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:13,754
But this is of great
interest to the public.

1084
01:19:13,924 --> 01:19:16,916
Is it? Why should it be?

1085
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:19,678
Why should it be of any concern
to what you call the public?

1086
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,553
The public is everyone.
And the public has a right to know.

1087
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:26,602
Why? What right?

1088
01:19:26,764 --> 01:19:28,800
I don't know anything
about such a right.

1089

to some decent privacy!

war correspondent, author,

Thank you,
Mr. Churchill.

1211
01:33:26,884 --> 01:33:29,603
There is gossip that you were detested
in the army...

1212
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:32,039
where it is said you were
known as a medal hunter,

1213
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:35,082
a publicity seeker
and a social climber...

1214
01:33:35,244 --> 01:33:38,042
pushing, aggressive
and scheming.

1215
01:33:41,004 --> 01:33:42,437
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

1216
01:33:42,604 --> 01:33:44,720
I was wondering why
a certain kind of person

1217
01:33:44,884 --> 01:33:47,273
always seems to believe
the worst about me.

1218
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:49,196
At Sandhurst, for example,
I was accused of being

1219
01:33:49,364 --> 01:33:51,673
everything from a horse thief
to a homosexual.

1220
01:33:51,844 --> 01:33:56,474
And I had to sue for libel, and win,
to prove my innocence on both counts.

1221
01:33:56,644 --> 01:33:59,841
As to what you have just said,
I'm sorry to hear it.

1222
01:34:00,004 --> 01:34:02,359
I thought I had served
my country faithfully...

1223
01:34:02,524 --> 01:34:05,163
at some danger to myself.
Yes.

1224
01:34:05,324 --> 01:34:08,521
Some officers have stated that
your criticism of General Kitchener

1225
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:11,152
in your new book, The River War,
was inexcusable.

1226
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:13,599
Have you read the book?
No.

1227
01:34:13,764 --> 01:34:15,641
Then perhaps you should read it.

1228
01:34:15,804 --> 01:34:18,921
My statements concerning
his atrocious treatment of enemy wounded

1229
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,483
were entirely factual.

1230
01:34:20,644 --> 01:34:23,442
As to our victory,
although the enemy had superior numbers,

1231
01:34:23,604 --> 01:34:25,401
they were no match
for a modern army.

1232
01:34:25,564 --> 01:34:28,032
I see.
Your father also had

1233
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:31,799
a weakness for offending
people, did he not?

1234
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:34,114
I wouldn't call it a weakness.

1235
01:34:34,284 --> 01:34:36,434
I would describe
it as his strength.

1236
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:40,035
And I would attribute it to the strength
of his convictions.

1237
01:34:40,204 --> 01:34:43,799
My father was a brilliant man.
He had no time for fools.

1238
01:34:43,964 --> 01:34:45,238
Yes. Actually,

1239
01:34:45,404 --> 01:34:48,953
you were not very well acquainted
with your father, were you?

1240
01:34:49,444 --> 01:34:52,356
Not as well as I should
have liked to have been.

1241
01:34:52,764 --> 01:34:55,403
However, solitary trees...

1242
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:58,397
if they grow at all,
grow strong.

1243
01:34:58,604 --> 01:35:01,755
Indeed.
Something you've read?

1244
01:35:01,924 --> 01:35:04,119
No. Something
I have written.

1245
01:35:04,284 --> 01:35:05,842
In my new book,
The River War.

1246
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:08,723
You really should read it.
There are some good things in it.

1247
01:35:08,884 --> 01:35:10,795
Reverting to your
father's enemies,

1248
01:35:11,004 --> 01:35:14,360
do you imagine they will
welcome you into politics?

1249
01:35:14,524 --> 01:35:16,515
I don't know what you
mean by "enemies".

They were never enemies.

They may have
disagreed at times

but that's the nature
of politics, isn't it?

Lord Salisbury has been very kind to me.
I dedicated my book to him.

for in your father's name?

That's an Italian word, isn't it?
Nothing like that in England, is there?

1261

with David Lloyd George, who is a Liberal?

People who can help you?

and my younger brother.

for parliament, Mr. Churchill?

to the greatest parliament in the world?

What do you have to offer,
other than your ego and your ambitions?

1273
01:36:28,004 --> 01:36:30,234
Only myself.

1280

Is it a crime to be 24?
No, no. Not at all.

1281
01:36:47,964 --> 01:36:51,161
What would you like me
to do? Play games?

1291

If I could, I would say this
to young men all over the world:

" Come on. You are needed
