- Hello, young fellow, me lad.
What you got there?

5
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,845
- Package for Major General Denistoun.
- Retired.

6

Oh. Been chasin' 'im 'alf over

Give that to Major General Denistoun.

10
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:33,928
And this here, kindly hand it to
Mr Quentin Reynolds. Do you know him?

11

Yes. [Sniffles]
He's the American.

12

- Mr Quentin Reynolds?

16
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,412
- Yes.
- Telegram, sir.

17
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,454
- Thank you, son. Excuse me, boys.
- Thank you.

- Oh, thank you, Horace.

21

Well, I'll be damned.
His ears <i>are</i> pierced.

22

That's what we've been
telling you, old boy.

23
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,730
Yes, but a man like Denistoun.
Old school tie. Sandhurst.

24
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:30,364
A general with his ears
pierced like a gypsy.

25
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,128
Why, it's fantastic.
What's the idea?

26
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,887
No one has ever had
the cheek to ask him.

27
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,966
He was in Europe
when the war broke out.

28
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:38,886
Came home
and there they were.

29
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:41,967
Must have been black magic.
He came home a changed man.

30
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,410
Used to be a most
frightful stuffed shirt.

31
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,055
Quite a nice old chap now.
I say, what's the rush?

32
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:50,844
Oh, this. I have to grab
a 5.30 plane for Paris.

33
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:54,564
But look, if either of you boys
get the lowdown on Denistoun's ears...

34
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,045
- drop me a line, will ya?
- Be glad to, if and when.

35
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,091
- Fine.
- Well, so long, Reynolds.

36
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,086
- And thanks for everything.
- So long, man.

37

38
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,604

- Hmm.

39
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:13,768
Right. Right you are.
Righto.

40
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,450
Bit of a mob on that Paris plane, sir,
but I finally wangled it.

41
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,526
5.30, Northolt. The fog's lifted.

42
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:21,446
Oh, you're wonderful, Miggs.
You're beautiful!

43
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,924
I love you, Miggs!
Come, let me give you a kiss.

44
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,044
You'd better hurry, sir.
That is, if you're going to pack.

45
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,773
Thank you, Miggs.

46
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:47,609
- Why don't you ask me and have it over?
- What?

47
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,806
- At least you'll admit you're curious.
- Curious?

48
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:53,125
- Why, curious about what?
- My ears.

49
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,092
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean-

50
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,689
Oh, come, come.
Own up.

51
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:01,450
Well, all right.
But it is odd, you know.

52
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:05,210
What I mean is, they look
like they've been pierced for earrings.

53
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:09,288
Do they really?
By Jove, they probably do.

54
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,525
Well, well.

55
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:15,290
- I was wondering if you'd
mind talking about it.
- Not at all. Not at all.

56
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,367
Then why has it been
top secret for so long?

57
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,685
For the very simple reason
that nobody's ever asked me.

58
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:23,926
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

59
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:25,846
Let's go back a bit.

60
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:29,814
How did you know
that I was thinking about your ears?

61
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:33,968
- How did you know?
- Well, that's part of my story.

62
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,886
There's a woman in it, of course.

63
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,535
A woman of such extraordinary
accomplishments that I-

64
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,768
well, it all started
shortly before war broke out.

65
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,415
I was in Germany. A prisoner.

66
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,451
Before the war? A prisoner?

67
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:49,412
Yes, I was a lieutenant colonel then.

68
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:53,613
And together with a youngster
named Byrd was on a special mission.

69
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,651
Very hush-hush, you know.

70
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:57,851
Not at all in my line, exactly...

71
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,893
except that I spoke
German like a native.

72
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:03,443
We were trying to nail
a poison gas formula.

73
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,847
Something new. An appalling
by-product of Nazi frightfulness.

74
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,846
Anyway, I don't think
I was very good...

75
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:13,166
because the blighters knocked us off
like a couple of sitting pheasants.

76
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,964
And we were being held
for questioning, Byrd and I...

77
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,206
in a farmhouse
not very far from Weimar.

78

<i>They couldn't broadcast a general</i>
<i>alarm for two Englishmen...</i>

147
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,612

<i>the British embassy.</i>

148
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:14,129
<i>Jt would have to be</i>
<i>a private manhunt.</i>

149
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,446
<i>However, sooner or later,</i>
<i>we knew we'd have to scupper the car.</i>

150
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,491
<i>So shortly after dawn-</i>

151
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,406
- Well, here's where we separate.
- Right, sir.

152
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,248
Now listen carefully. First thing
you must do is get rid of that uniform.

153
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:40,690
Get some other clothes. You'll probably
have to steal them, understand?

154
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:43,243
- Perfectly.
- Then make your way to Esbach,
near Freiburg.

155
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,611
<i>Esbach, remember.</i>
<i>And J'll join you there.</i>

156
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:49,926
Now here's the thing.
Whoever gets to Esbach first...

157
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,483
marks the road signpost
to Freiburg with three dots...

158
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,452
and then waits for the other.
Is that clear?

159
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,890
Quite. Three dots
on the signpost to Freiburg.

160
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:59,364
Yes. Then we'll carry on
from where we left off.

161
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:01,923
- Contact Professor Krosigk.
- <i>Yes. How about money?</i>

162
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,006
Loads. Hoff was
absolutely stinking with it.

163
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:06,165
That's good.
Well, good luck to you.

164
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,331
I say, sir.
Thanks awfully, sir.

165
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:13,090
- I mean for everything.
You've been absolutely marvellous.
- Goodbye.

166
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:23,252
Yes, and thanks to Hoff's blunderings,
we've lost a good five hours.

167
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:26,486
Of course the man
is an idiot. Goodbye.

168
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,053
You are, you know,
with all your brains in your belly.

169
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:39,206
Hmm. The car was
last seen near Marbach.

170
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,254
If no further reports come in,
I'm going to assume that the car
has been disposed of.

171
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:48,170
Possibly in a river.
The Neckar, for instance. Come here.

172
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,051
Heavily wooded country.

173
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,812
I think we shall begin from here.

174
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,926
Yes.

Yes. As a matter of fact,

Ah. This is to keep
evil eye away. Good.

Gypsy superstition.

208
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,609
By the way, I thought gypsies
always travelled around in caravans.

You want to know why
I travel alone, huh?

And there's also a good pair
of trousers too. Huh?

218
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,606
And you were going to throw
into the river that bundle.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. You must never throw away

You're not German.

Oh, <i>liebling, liebling,</i>

They know it in the town.
They're searching the forest and the lake.

240
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,411
I never before had gloves.

Hmm.
Beautiful gloves.

00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,734
- That is right.
- What's right?

243
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,851
What you were thinking.

244
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:02,203
That it would be safer
to travel with me.

245
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:05,924
As a matter of fact, I-
how did you know what I was thinking?

246
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,494
- It is there. Yes.
- The wagon?

247
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:14,568
We could travel by day. Back lanes.

248
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:18,125
Gypsy lanes.
They are not watched.

249
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:24,291
How far you think you go
in these German officer's boots, huh?

250
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,014
- I do wish you'd stop reading my mind.
- They always look at your feet.

251
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:30,485
So frightfully disconcerting.
Like being found without one's trousers.

Oh, <i>mein süßer!</i>

Why do you not trust me?

00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,892
Afraid I'll have to.
I've no alternative.

255
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:39,967
Come then, into the wagon.
It is warm.

256
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,290
Good wagon. Not like
others with holes. Come.

- No. Tomorrow...

258
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,569
in the morning, early,
we get rid of it.

"Liddie"? If you don't mind,
I think I'll call you Lydia.

Fine blue and yellow gypsy coat.

00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,370
And boots and razor.

268
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:31,966
Razor belong to
my second husband.

269
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:36,014
Thank you, I-your husband?
Where is he?

270
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:40,008
- He kill a <i>gadze</i> and they hang him.
- Good. I mean, poor fellow.

00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:46,970
Good, huh? Huh?

272
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,846
Here you sleep.
Come, take off boots.

273
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,288
Lydia, what is a <i>gadze?</i>

274
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,733
Someone who is not gypsy.

Couldn't you arrange to sit
on them or something?

285

As a matter of fact,
I'll sleep by the fire.

286
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:49,525
No. Outside, I must watch.
By the river.

287
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:53,403
- What for?
- The Nivashi.

- I beg your pardon?
- The Nivashi and the Pavushti.

- The spirits that live in the water.
- Oh, yes, yes, the pixies.

- No, truly.

come out of river...

You know, you never did
tell my fortune.

764
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:52,168
You get back
to your country... safe.

765
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:55,327
You still know
what I'm thinking.

766
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,328
You are easy, <i>liebling...</i>

767
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:01,883
very easy.

768
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:05,730
What else?

769
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:14,290
You will be famous
and you'll never go hungry...

770
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:17,128
except in your heart.

771
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,010
What else?

772
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:26,410
You have been in danger
of death three times.

773
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:30,124
I can go on
from there myself.

774
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:36,248
You're thinking
I'll be leaving you soon.

775
01:04:38,255 --> 01:04:40,644
How you know?

776
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:45,729
You're easy, <i>liebling</i>, very easy.

777
01:04:50,935 --> 01:04:55,565
Lydia, afterwards...

778
01:04:55,655 --> 01:04:58,727
I mean, when I'm gone...

779
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:02,569
would you go back to Zoltan?

780
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:07,365
- Would that make you unhappy?
- Yes! Yes, it would, very.

781
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:12,165
Oh! What would Zoltan want
of woman whose heart is stone?

782
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:18,093
See? Already it is growing cold.

783
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,284
Oh, Lydia.

784
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,969
I want you to know that
in these last few days...

785
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,967
I've been very happy.

786
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:32,525
Happier than I thought
it possible to be.

787
01:05:32,615 --> 01:05:35,334
And that's very odd because
they've been days...

788
01:05:35,415 --> 01:05:38,725
of danger and uncertainty.

789
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:43,411
I don't suppose I've begun
to realize it until...

790
01:05:43,495 --> 01:05:47,932
until now that my time
with you is almost run out.

791
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:50,245
You are the most wonderful
person I ever met.

792
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,895
<i>Your generosity...</i>

793
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:55,614
<i>and your warmth</i>
<i>and affection...</i>

794
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:57,686
and your loyalty and devotion.

795
01:05:57,775 --> 01:06:01,973
The way you spill over with it.
It's made me feel very good...

796
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:04,364
<i>and very secure...</i>

797
01:06:04,455 --> 01:06:08,084
and very inadequate.

798
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:16,174
Oh, you not know
your sweetness.

799
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:20,851
You say something.
Maybe it is your head you turn...

800
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,211
<i>and smile at me.</i>

801
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:31,323
And then there's beauty
in you like water in sun.

802
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:35,647
And it make my heart
pour down into me...

803
01:06:35,735 --> 01:06:38,886
'til I love you so.

804
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,364

- Go on!
- <i>Liebling.</i>

838
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:37,731
So I asked myself...

839
01:09:37,815 --> 01:09:40,932
why was Byrd seen in
the vicinity of Freiburg?

840
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,848
Not once, mind you,
but three times.

841
01:09:43,935 --> 01:09:46,085
Why is he hanging about?

842
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:48,643
- For whom is he waiting?
- <i>For the other Englishman.</i>

843
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:51,203
- Denistoun.
- Of course, but why?

844
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:53,286
Why meet here?
Why meet at all?

845
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:57,493
In their shoes, I'd be getting out
of the country as fast as I could.

846
01:09:57,575 --> 01:10:00,612
No, they have business here.

847
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:04,210
Business important enough
for them to risk their necks.

848
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:08,527
But what kind of business?
And with whom?

849
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:11,687
With whom, gentlemen?

850
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:14,687
<i>Hmm?</i>

851
01:10:18,855 --> 01:10:21,449
What would you say
to our great humanitarian...

852
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:24,413
that earnest disciple
of brotherly love...

853
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:28,329
the inventor of
our new poison gas?

854
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:31,487
What would you say, my friends...

855
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:34,487
to professor Otto Krosigk?

856
01:10:35,695 --> 01:10:38,209
Yes, Herr Reimann.

857
01:10:38,295 --> 01:10:41,332
Oh, of course you can
come over. Not at all.

858
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:45,852
We shall be delighted.
Well then. Goodbye, Herr Reimann.

859
01:10:49,055 --> 01:10:52,445
- What does Reimann want?
- He's coming over.

860
01:10:52,535 --> 01:10:55,447
I'm worried, Otto.
He suspects you.

861
01:10:55,535 --> 01:10:57,651
- We're being watched.
- Now, come, my darling.

862
01:10:57,735 --> 01:11:00,374
There's nothing
extraordinary in that.

863
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:05,529
Today in Germany, everybody is watched,
even the watchers. Come.

864
01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:09,005
Tonight would you be entertaining
the chief of police...

865
01:11:09,095 --> 01:11:13,327
these Nazi party officials
and elite guard officers...

866
01:11:13,415 --> 01:11:15,929
if you weren't forced to?

867
01:11:16,015 --> 01:11:18,734
- They suspect, Otto.
- Let them.

868
01:11:18,815 --> 01:11:23,013
And if they searched me,
would they ever suspect this, uh...

869
01:11:23,095 --> 01:11:25,563
piece of money?

870
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:27,805
- Let me keep it.
- No, darling, I have got to have it handy.

871
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:31,365
I never know when and where
I may meet... Byrd.

872
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:35,687
And if Byrd doesn't show up?

873
01:11:35,775 --> 01:11:39,529
If they have caught him
and sent someone in his place to trap you?

874
01:11:39,615 --> 01:11:42,812
They won't trap me.
If anyone else but Byrd comes...

875
01:11:42,895 --> 01:11:44,806
I won't have anything
to do with him.

876
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,614
Please, stop worrying, will you? Come.

877

Then you talk to Krosigk. Easy, huh?

884
01:12:09,895 --> 01:12:12,170
No, go back.
Zoltan, it's not safe for you here.

885
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:16,089
Already not safe for me there.

- Wait, Herr Lieutenant.

- This may be very amusing.
- Nonsense!

I killed the two brutes

A war, do you hear?

Had to wait for a report

They were murdered while
tracking down two enemies of the Reich.

- The murderers of my men

966
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:55,768
I once knew a Mr Byrd

- <i>[Reimann] Oh, you admit that?</i>

968

Do you realize the borders are very
closely guarded now that war is declared?

969
01:17:04,255 --> 01:17:06,610
These men most certainly
will be caught...

970
01:17:06,695 --> 01:17:10,529
- and made to talk!
- Talk about what?

971
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:15,643
Who are they? Herr Reimann,
that sounds very melodramatic.

972
01:17:15,735 --> 01:17:18,408
Krosigk, we have reason to suspect...

973
01:17:18,495 --> 01:17:21,328
that they may have
some business with you.

974
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:25,124
Really?

975
01:17:25,215 --> 01:17:28,730
Then I insist that you
post a guard around this house.
