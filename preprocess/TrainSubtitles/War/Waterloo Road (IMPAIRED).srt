(Whistle blows)

2
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,086
# Barrel organ plays

3
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:08,846
(Street vendors shout)

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,331
- Morning, Doctor.
- Morning, Jake.

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,809
- Nice, healthy weather.
- Afraid so.

6
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,330
(Thinks) <i>Mrs Foggerty's medicine. Don't say I...</i>

7
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,012
<i>That's a relief anyway.</i>

8
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:40,125
<i>Not that it'll do the old hag any good.</i>

9
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,689
<i>Why didn't I bring my sweet points out with me?</i>

10
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,326
<i>Ah, well. Only give me indigestion.</i>

11
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,132
<i>Knot. What the devil's that for?</i>

12
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,764
<i>Ha. Remember tying it.</i>

13
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,051
- I beg your pardon.
- OK. No harm done.

14
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:58,086
<i>Americans eh?</i>

15
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,571
<i>Funny how we take them for granted now.</i>
<i>Just as if they were our own boys.</i>

16
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,687
<i>Now, what the devil did I tie that knot for?</i>

17
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,044
(Baby cries)
<i>- Just listen to that child.</i>

18
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,131
<i>Bless my soul, woman, don't bounce it.</i>

19
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,406
<i>Babies! Of course.</i>

20
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,572
<i>The Colters' baby. Buy it a birthday present.</i>

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,093
<i>Toys, eh</i>

22
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:24,447
<i>I've brought a good many babies into the world.</i>
<i>but I never thought I'd forget</i> that <i>one,</i>

23
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,168
<i>having played quite a part in his story, myself.</i>

24
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:34,207
<i>Gosh, I feel that here I'm walking in a battlefield.</i>

25
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:40,092
<i>Here in London the people waged</i>
<i>a whole campaign and won it.</i>

26
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,691
<i>Yes, and there were other battles too.</i>

27
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:46,090
<i>Folks battling with themselves.</i>

28
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,410
<i>Little people like Jim and Tilly Colter.</i>

29
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,694
<i>It seems only the other day</i>
<i>that all this looked very different then.</i>

30
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,935
<i>Winter 1940, 1941.</i>

31
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,127
<i>What days.</i>

32
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,366
<i>What days.</i>

33
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,406
(Air-raid siren)

34
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,928
Take down the blackout, Ruby,
while I light the stove.

35
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,966
OK, Mum.

36
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,892
Oh, well, another day.

37
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,244
<i>Still here aren't we? That's something.</i>

38
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,085
- Any letters for me?
- Any letters for Wilma?

39
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,932
Hold on. You can get them on the counter.

40
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:06,364
- Dole them out will you, love?
- Very well.

41
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,166
Oh, please. You mustn't do that.

42
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:13,894
- That's for Ted Purvis, ain't it?
- Yes, but you're not him. Are you?

43
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,926
That's right.

44
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:20,367
Cup of tea, Ted.
Here's a letter from the income tax.

45
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,327
Mark it "not known" or "lost in the Blitz"
or something.

46
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,764
- Shove it back on the pile quick.
<i>- OK Ted.</i>

47
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:34,170
Don't forget our date, will you, Tilly?

48
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:39,646
- Quarter to one under the clock.
- Yes, all right. Hurry up, Vera.

49
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,732
Hang on a minute, Till.
I'll walk along with you.

50
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,766
Afraid I can't wait, Mr Purvis.

51
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:46,646
- Do come on, Vera.
- All right.

52
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:49,163
Play that on your Aunt Kate's piano, Mr Purvis.

53
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,810
I bet you half a dollar
she'll look round to see if I'm coming.

54
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,891
- Half a dollar you owe me.
- I never took it.

55
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,288
Wise girl.

56
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:01,927
- Surprised at you, Ted.
- What?

57
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,806
Not the type you usually go for.

58
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,210
Oh, I like 'em hard to get once in a while.

59
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,246
M a kes a change

60
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,853
- Shirt.
- Yes, Ted.

61
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:14,326
(Sizzling)

62
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,249
- We bring any down last night, Fred?
- Don't say.

63
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,887
Here's the lodger, Ma.

64
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,573
- Ah, bacon.
- Morning, Tom.

65
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,368
Hello, Mrs C. Morning, Tilly.
How's the loving couple?

66
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,851
Meeting only to part, as usual.
Fred's off to bed and I'm off to work.

67
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:32,012
When it's not that, it's the other way round.
Talk about romance.

68
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:34,853
- Why not try and get on the same shift?
- No use asking Fred.

69
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,250
If I left it to him
we'd never have even got married.

70
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,570
Hardly worthwhile
the way things has turned out.

71
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,207
Here's your breakfast, Vera.

72
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:43,928
What, no bacon?
Suppose the lodger gets my ration.

73
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,250
<i>Get on with it or you'll be late for school.</i>

74
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:48,286
Gertie, Gertie, Gertie, Gertie.

75
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:51,407
(Whistles) Come on, old girl.

76
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:54,606
It's your last day here.

77
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,446
Better make the most of it.

78
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,286
Come on. Hop it, the lot of you.

79
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,693
(Sighs) That's right. Do yourselves a bit of good.

80
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,366
- Off to bed?
- That's right.

81
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,731
Your day off, isn't it?

82
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,094
Yes.

83
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,126
Doing anything in particular?

84
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,166
- Dunno.
- Well, I can guess.

85
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,886
She's got a date.

86
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,804
You shut up and get on with your breakfast.

87
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:32,289
Do you have to talk in front of her,
with her big ears?

88
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:35,213
- Time she was at school.
- Do leave Tilly alone, Ruby.

89
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,213
You know she's been upset
since Jim's leave was put back.

90
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:41,133
- Upset? Pleased, more like it.
- You've no right to say that.

91
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:43,894
<i>I'm not the one to make trouble</i>
<i>but I can't just say nothing.</i>

92
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:46,733
<i>You 've been hinting for days.</i>
<i>Why don't you say what you mean?</i>

93
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,925
Last time Jim was home
you had words all the time.

94
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:51,330
That was... Anyway, that's no business of yours.

95
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,764
- I'm Jim's sister, aren't I?
- And I'm his wife.

96
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:56,613
You wouldn't think so
the way you hang around Ted Purvis.

97
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:57,974
Ruby, leave her be.

98
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,290
I don't happen to be doing
what you'd like to think.

99
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,053
Think I don't know Ted Purvis?

100
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,892
<i>You might give a thought to your husband.</i>

101
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,971
<i>I always have. You can't say I haven't.</i>

102
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:07,812
<i>I couldn't help noticing, that's all.</i>

103
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,607
owe?

104
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:14,524
<i>I'm sick and tired of it. You can't expect me to</i>
<i>shut my eyes to it with the reputation he's got.</i>

105
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:18,124
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>
<i>You're playing with fire and you know it.</i>

106
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,370
- Sorry, but...
<i>- Ruby, please.</i>

107
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:23,486
Tilly, don't take any notice of her.

108
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,924
She can't pretend it's not him she's meeting.

109
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,853
- He's got a silk dressing gown.
- You go to school.

110
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:31,170
- I only want...
- It doesn't matter if I'm late.

111
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:34,127
Any more sauce from you
and back you go to your Aunt Maud's.

112
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,733
She won't have me.

113
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:38,812
- You go to school this minute.
- I haven't finished my fried bread.

114
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:41,972
Fried bread or no fried bread,
here's your school bag, now off you go.

115
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,131
All right, but I shan't learn nothing.

116
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,649
I'm sick of being the youngest in this house.

117
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,686
(Door slams)

118
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,126
(Whistles)

119
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,292
Looks like being quite a nice day.

120
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:03,326
Anyway, Ted Purvis ought to be in the Forces.

121
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,366
He was turned down at his medical.

122
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,771
Sticking up for him, now.
Carrying on like that and Jim away in the army.

123
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,490
I'm not carrying on, though it's enough
to make anyone the way you keep harping.

124
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,571
It's not my fault if someone looks at me twice.

125
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:18,688
No-one gives you a second look, that's all.
Or you'd have landed someone better than Fred.

126
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,613
How dare you talk to me like that?
I was only thinking of Jim.

127
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:25,125
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I don't know how you dare.

128
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,565
Eat your breakfast, Tilly, it'll be cold.

129
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,412
It's all right.

130
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,527
Don't you mind what Ruby says.
She's not herself these days.

131
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,406
<i>Same with most of us, I suppose.</i>

132
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,605
<i>People's nerves aren't what they used to be.</i>

133
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:46,010
<i>- Let me warm it up for you.</i>
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

134
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,489
You must eat. Anything else you fancy?

135
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,326
You go upstairs and have a lie-down.

136
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,014
I'll see if I can find you an aspirin.
How about that?

137
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:56,808
Leave me alone, for heaven 's sake!
I'm fed up, see!

138
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:00,086
- Tilly.
- I'm tired of everybody watching me all the time,

139
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,126
imagining things, getting at me.

140
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,526
Nagging, nagging, nagging!

141
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,173
Jim...

142
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,531
<i>An 'andsome couple I'd call 'em. Not half!</i>

143
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,850
<i>You ought to be getting into the carriage.</i>

144
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,886
Just nice time to kiss the bride.

145
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,206
WOMAN: <i>He's off again!</i>

146
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,167
Oh. This ain't Waterloo, it's heaven itself.

147
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,086
I told you not to have another glass.

148
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,774
If you're hinting I'm sloshed, you're wrong.

149
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,965
That's a pleasure to come when they open.

150
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,813
Come on, lads, kiss the bride. That's right.

151
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:11,846
Very nice, too. Good luck, Tilly.

152
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:13,773
- Can I throw it now?
- No.

153
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,373
(Whistle blows)
- You're off.

154
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,167
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard now.

155
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,888
Come on, young Colter.
You're holding up the railway.

156
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,971
Come on, guard, lock 'em in.

157
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,483
- <i>Lummy, look here.</i>
- A present from the company.

158
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,844
Three cheers for the Southern Railway.
Gertcha.

159
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,250
Have a good honeymoon.
Don't be late in the morning.

160
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,206
If you can't be good, be careful.

161
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,246
Have I said anything?

162
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,933
Stand away now.

163
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:36,966
ALL: Goodbye!

164
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:46,807
I knew a bloke got rumbled
a whole week after his wedding.

165
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,846
That better?

166
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,326
Yeah. Turn around.

167
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,286
OK.

168
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,326
What are you thinking, Jim?

169
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,366
Er... I don't know.

170
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:04,293
I was just... wondering.

171
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,326
What?

172
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:09,526
What are we going to do with this?

173
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:12,812
We could leave it under the seat.

174
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,846
Yeah, I suppose we could.

175
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,726
What were you wondering, Jim?

176
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:20,926
Do you feel the same as I feel?

177
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,246
When I look at you, I mean?

178
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,286
How do <i>you</i> feel?

179
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:29,451
My stomach sort of turns over.

180
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,486
Oh. Does it?

181
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,812
Same with me too.

182
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,846
Honest?

183
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:41,805
- I never knew love went to the stomach before.
- Neither did I.

184
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,846
You live and learn, I must say.

185
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,845
- We must be nearly passing the house now.
- Yeah, that's right.

186
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,732
Any minute now.

187
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,686
Another 50 yards, Till.

188
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,203
There it is, see?
That's the one, next to the end.

189
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,246
It looks good, doesn't it?

190
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,570
Lt'll be lovely having a place of our own.

191
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,685
Pity we've got to wait before we can move in.

192
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,930
They'll soon have it ready for us, Till.

193
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,444
Funny being in the hands of so many people,
isn't it?

194
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:18,974
How do you mean, Jim?

195
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,688
I don't know. Hire purchase for all those years.

196
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,613
Ansells for the furniture and the building society.

197
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,725
Who cares? We'll manage, you'll see.

198
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,130
The Electric Light Company and the wireless.

199
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,847
Maybe a pram sooner or later.

200
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,886
Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:36,208
I suppose we will have to take that into account.

202
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:39,133
I'd like to get my family over
while I'm young, Jim.

203
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:41,735
Then you sort of grow up with them.

204
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,924
- (Laughs)
- What are you laughing at, Jim?

205
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,926
Nothing. Just you...

206
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,966
...Mrs Colter.

207
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,654
<i>It might have turned out that way</i>
<i>in spite of the war.</i>

208
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:05,686
<i>Only Jim...</i>

209
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,133
JIM: <i>Plenty of other people's</i>
<i>had to give things up.</i>

210
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,008
<i>It isn't as if times was normal, Tilly.</i>

211
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,886
<i>Supposing anything was to happen to me.</i>

212
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,244
TILLY:
<i>I'd have someone to remember you by, Jim.</i>

213
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,092
<i>We had all that out when I joined up.</i>

214
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:35,730
<i>We agreed then it wasn't much of a world to...</i>
<i>to bring kids into.</i>

215
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,686
<i>It hasn't exactly improved since, has it?</i>

216
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,454
TILLY: <i>If everyone thought like you,</i>
<i>the world'd just stop.</i>

217
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,213
<i>Good job too, if you ask me.</i>

218
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,325
<i>A woman wants a home and children, Jim.</i>

219
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,366
<i>It's only natural.</i>

220
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:50,169
<i>I wouldn't mind if it was only a room.</i>
<i>So long as it was our own.</i>

221
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:54,128
<i>If you 're fed up living with Mum and Ruby,</i>
<i>come out in the open and say so.</i>

222
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:57,451
TILLY: <i>It's not just that.</i>
<i>Oh, I don't know what I want</i>

223
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,645
<i>You 're right there. The moon, I should think.</i>

224
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,890
<i>Well, I don' look like getting it, do I?</i>

225
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:05,487
<i>I'm sick and tired of this sort of life,</i>
<i>if you want to know.</i>

226
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:08,652
<i>Not doing this and not doing that,</i>
<i>just because of the war.</i>

227
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,209
<i>I've had about as much as I can stand</i>
<i>of your mum and Ruby.</i>

228
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:14,167
<i>If we're going on like this,</i>
<i>I wish I'd never met you.</i>

229
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,886
<i>I'm sorry you had to say that, Till.</i>

230
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,766
<i>I've done my best.</i>

231
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:21,806
<i>If that's how you feel...</i>

232
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,446
Oh, Jim, I never meant it.

233
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:27,526
I hope you didn't mean it.

234
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,050
Why do we have to say things we don't mean?

235
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,727
You don't want to worry about Tilly.
She's all right.

236
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,891
Wants her husband. It's only natural.

237
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:43,010
I don't know what's come over her and Jim.

238
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,888
They never had a quarrel, even, till that last time.

239
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:49,052
Jim's a fine lad. Bit cautious, like.

240
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:53,132
Tilly takes after her dad.
Liked to take chances, he did.

241
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,283
He can't do that, as he found out. Poor bloke.

242
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,847
She'd have taken chances too,
started a home of her own,

243
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:02,648
brought up a family, war or no war.

244
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,686
But Jim...

245
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,843
I expect there's a lot to be said, both sides.

246
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,846
Don't let it get you down, old girl.

247
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:16,285
Yes, but Ruby's written to Jim
about her and... Ted Purvis.

248
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,326
(Low whistle)

249
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,366
(Low conversation)

250
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,248
I've got to get home, sir.
A few hours is all I want.

251
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,206
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:46,611
Never done this before.
I'll report back here as soon as you like.

253
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:51,126
You've put yourself in the wrong by absenting
yourself from your unit without leave.

254
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,804
- I had to come up, sir.
- You should have applied to your CO at camp.

255
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,293
Just couldn't talk about it, sir.

256
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,724
You understand I have no option in the matter.

257
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:02,243
What is the trouble exactly? Family bother?

258
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,452
Hm. There it is.

259
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:08,293
Look here. Your train 's still at the platform.

260
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,969
Can I put you on your honour to go back on it?

261
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,093
Very well, I'm sorry.

262
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:19,811
Corporal, see this man on his train as far as
Clapham Junction and make sure he stays on it.

263
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,846
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

264
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,486
In here. Corner seat.

265
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,965
Well, anything for a break.

266
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:36,006
Fag, Jim?

267
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,773
Thanks, Bob.

268
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,806
Come up to see the girl?

269
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:42,244
- Married already, perhaps?
- Uh-huh.

270
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,286
- Children?
- Nope.

271
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:49,445
You're in tanks, eh?
What was your trade? Motor mechanic?

272
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:52,453
No, I worked here. Locomotive repair shop.

273
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,205
Studying to be an engineer.
Doing nicely till the war.

274
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,973
Hard lines.

275
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,006
It happened to plenty of others.

276
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:05,493
We were going to move into a little house
down the line. Own patch of garden.

277
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,890
It'd have been a change
from the Waterloo Road.

278
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,926
Yes?

279
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:13,286
Nice day, innit?

280
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:26,130
- Here, let me.
- Oh, thank you very much.

281
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:32,174
- That's really very kind of you.
- There you are.

282
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,006
(Whistle screeches)

283
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:50,644
- Anyone sitting here, chum?
- No, that's OK.

284
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,526
Cigarette, pal?

285
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,566
- Yeah, thanks.
- Help yourself.

286
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:16,487
Yeah, me too.
Canadian Red Cap right behind your guy.

287
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,766
Follow me.

288
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,606
- How long have you been playing hooky?
- Since this morning.

289
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,930
Hell, you're only a beginner. Follow me.

290
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,006
I've been absent without leave six weeks.

291
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:42,252
Stick to me. I've got the whole situation taped.
Go ahead.

292
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:47,046
Act normal, fellas. MPs.

293
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,490
Keep your head down and make a dive for it.

294
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:54,884
OK.

295
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,246
Let's beat it out of here.

296
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,293
- OK, go ahead.
- Thanks.

297
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,565
All in a day's work.
Where are you headed for?

298
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:13,254
Waterloo Road.
I guess they're watching all the exits.

299
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:15,684
Is that so? OK, follow me.

300
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,844
I've got my own private exit. Close the door.

301
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,490
Got blitzed in here.
Condemned, they say. Unsafe or something.

302
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:29,809
Hop through there and you're on the street.
You can take care of yourself then.

303
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,813
- OK, thanks a lot, Canada.
- Duggan 's the name. Mike Duggan.

304
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,050
Say, don't get me wrong. I'm no shirker.

305
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,086
Gosh, I joined up for action.

306
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,333
Recruiting day in Toronto.

307
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,445
Bagpipes and the maple leaf forever.

308
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:45,604
What do I get? A whole year of square-bashing
and making daisy chains.

309
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,327
Felt the same myself. Be seeing you.

310
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,492
I stick around here.
Dodging Red Caps gives me an interest in life.

311
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,526
- So long.
- So long. Good luck.

312
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,566
See you in the clink.

313
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,246
(Knocking)

314
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,966
- Jim!
- Hello, Mother.

315
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,606
How are you, Mum? OK?

316
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:18,086
Jim...

317
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:21,486
Why, Mum.

318
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,729
- Now, now, now, there's nothing to cry about.
- I can't help it, Jim.

319
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:29,243
I know, I know. You're just pleased to see me.

320
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,486
There there, you silly girl.

321
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,286
Come on, turn it up.

322
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:38,730
Gawd, you're a fine one, and no mistake.

323
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:41,486
Here. There, that's better.

324
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:43,207
Come on.

325
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:45,246
Give us a smile. Come on.

326
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,968
You would have to take the hankie
I've only just ironed.

327
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,006
That's more like you.

328
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,366
Haven't changed a bit, have you, eh?

329
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,406
(Laughs) Feel better now?

330
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:57,245
I was a bit tired. I'm sorry, Jim.

331
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:59,729
I'll get you something to eat.
You must be hungry.

332
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,335
Never mind about that now.
You come and sit down.

333
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,650
Right here. Where I can keep an eye on you.

334
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:08,330
- Where's Tilly?
- She's got the day off.

335
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,652
- She's out, eh?
- Mm.

336
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,607
- Shopping or something?
- I don't know. I expect so.

337
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:17,610
You know I had a letter from Ruby?

338
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,646
- Yes, Jim.
- What about it, Mum?

339
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,689
I don't know.

340
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,886
- It's not true, is it?
<i>- I don't know really, Jim.</i>

341
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,972
Her and Ruby's been getting on
each other's nerves just lately.

342
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,290
Ruby's got this idea into her head and...

343
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:32,566
Tilly?

344
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:35,209
Tilly? I...

345
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:37,886
(Knocking)

346
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:39,926
I'll go and answer the door.

347
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:42,535
- Just a minute.
- I don't know who it can be, I'm sure.

348
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:44,611
- They may have come for me, Mum.
- What, Jim?

349
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,965
- I didn't wait for a pass. They're looking for me.
- Jim! The police?

350
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:50,529
- Yeah.
- Then they'll have to go on knocking.

351
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:54,045
You haven't seen me.
I don't want you in trouble.

352
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:55,653
- But, Jim...
- Wait a minute.

353
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,684
Jim!

354
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,650
Go ahead and open it. I'll be OK. Go on!

355
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,686
(lnsistent knocking)

356
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:05,407
- Mrs Colter?
- That's right.

357
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:08,253
Sorry to worry you
but we're looking for your son.

358
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,244
- Has he called here yet?
- I haven't seen him.

359
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:12,853
Do you mind if we look around?

360
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,728
- You won't find him here.
- It's just a formality, Mrs Colter.

361
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,050
The constable's got a warrant
if you want to see it.

362
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,086
- I'll take upstairs.
- Right.

363
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,726
Has he done anything wrong?

364
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,367
Absent without leave.

365
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:42,371
He gave me the slip off his train,

366
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,610
so I've got a strong personal interest.

367
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,646
Well, he's not here.

368
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:52,013
<i>Whose room is this?</i>

369
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,046
My lodger's

370
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,689
<i>Corporal!</i>

371
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,930
- Hello.
- <i>Someone up here.</i>

372
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,011
What's the idea, waking me up?

373
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,647
No, no, that's not him.

374
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:10,211
Bad enough with the blitz, without
the police force clumping all over the house.

375
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,246
<i>No privacy anywhere these days.</i>

376
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,889
<i>- A man's not safe in his own bed.</i>
- Sorry, chum.

377
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:17,450
- He don't seem to be here.
- Not a sign of him.

378
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:19,167
<i>Why don't you leave our boys alone?</i>

379
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:22,890
They're doing their bit, aren't they?
Always badgering 'em.

380
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,007
Sorry, but if they did things right
we wouldn't have to do it.

381
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:28,046
OK, we may as well push off.

382
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,212
When your son comes back, tell him to be
a good lad and come and see me.

383
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,246
I told you, he's never been here.

384
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,169
You weren't quite quick enough
with that belt, lady.

385
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:40,649
I don't want to see your boy get into
serious trouble.

386
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,890
Don't forget. He knows where to find me.

387
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:50,326
Oh, that was my lodger's belt.
He's in the Home Guard.

388
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:54,288
Sorry, Mum, but the Home Guard's never been
issued with webbing belts.

389
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,446
Jim! Hurry, Jim.

390
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,486
Get away from that window.

391
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,772
They know you've been here.

392
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,375
Got to find Tilly
before they catch up with me again.

393
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,690
- Where is she, Mum?
- I don't know where she is.

394
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,327
There's one thing I do know.

395
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:16,449
You're not leaving without a bite of something,
not as long as I'm your mother. You sit down.

396
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,492
I've got to see Tilly.

397
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:29,128
- Do I have to change anywhere?
- Not on the 1.10.

398
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,003
- Are there any more trains?
- Just a minute.

399
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,250
<i>Ruby?</i>

400
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:40,370
- Can I have a word with you?
- Kindly take your turn.

401
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,883
- Just a minute.
- Is there a restaurant car on the 1.10?

402
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,493
No, it's been taken off now.

403
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:48,653
Really. The comfort of paying passengers
is quite the last consideration.

404
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,405
I came straight up as soon as I got your letter.

405
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,970
Better know what you were driving at
before I see Tilly. Who's Ted Purvis?

406
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:58,803
You must know him. Used to fight
in the old days at The Ring, Blackfriars.

407
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:01,653
- How far has it gone?
- Excuse me, but I have a train to catch.

408
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:04,971
- I don't know. Not for certain.
- Why'd you write me that letter?

409
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:08,644
- When 's the next train to Basingstoke?
- I didn't want to make trouble.

410
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:12,324
I've been so worried. Heaven knows how many
people I've given the wrong trains to.

411
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,094
- She's meeting him today, isn't she? Where?
- Basingstoke?

412
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,365
- I don't know, Jim.
- Where can I find Purvis?

413
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:20,532
He might be at his pin table saloon.
The Lucky Star it's called.

414
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:22,452
Lucky Star? OK, see you later.

415
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,050
Jim!

416
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:28,088
Young lady, heaven forbid I should intrude on
your affairs with my petty concerns

417
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,171
but I want to go to Basingstoke.

418
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,288
Basingstoke? There's a train leaving now.
Platform 12.

419
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:36,326
- What?!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

420
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,927
(Whistle blows)

421
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,254
Hiya, Till.

422
00:27:57,295 --> 00:27:59,650
- Afraid I'm late.
- That's OK. Woman 's privilege.

423
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,287
I knew you'd turn up, anyway.

424
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:04,008
I only came because
I couldn't let you wait for nothing.

425
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:05,488
Why, what's up?

426
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:08,447
- I'm not going out with you, that's all.
- What's the matter?

427
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:10,770
Nothing, just that I've changed my mind.

428
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,526
- I'd better be going.
- OK.

429
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,244
Thanks for coming along and letting me know.

430
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,286
- Cheerio, Till.
- Goodbye.

431
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:21,246
Which way are you going?

432
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:24,173
- Home.
- I'll walk with you as far as the Lucky Star.

433
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:27,967
- All right.
- We might have a quick one at the Canterbury?

434
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:30,734
- I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
- OK. I get it.

435
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:34,686
(Street vendors shout)

436
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:42,486
(Rifles pop)

437
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:49,011
Tell Ted Purvis I'd like a word with him.

438
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:50,454
He ain't in.

439
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,486
- You sure?
- Course. Why?

440
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,966
- Boss around?
- No.

441
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:07,653
- Told you so, didn't I?
- Where is he?

442
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:08,923
- Out.
- Expect him back?

443
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:10,966
Maybe. What do you want?

444
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:13,086
I'll wait.

445
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,371
There's no use waiting, chum.

446
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:22,246
You just tell me where he is and I won't.

447
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:25,571
- We can't, cos we don't know, see.
- Cagey, aren't you?

448
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,446
Look here, what do you want?

449
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,486
Mr Edward Purvis.

450
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:32,527
(Whispers)

451
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:36,692
You Jim Colter?

452
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,726
Yes, that's right.

453
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,966
(Chuckles)

454
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:44,966
What's so funny about it?

455
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,289
He's asking me...

456
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,447
- Better get out, soldier.
- I'm waiting for Ted Purvis.

457
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,931
<i>Get going now unless you want a roughhouse.</i>

458
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,725
Proper roughhouse, over at the Lucky Star.

459
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,572
Oh.

460
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,606
All right, I'll take a look.

461
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,046
Come on.

462
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,366
What, over there?

463
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:07,730
What's all this about, eh?
I understand there's been a roughhouse.

464
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:11,245
Nothing like that, Officer.
We gave him fair warning, didn't we?

465
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,284
That's right.

466
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:17,011
He puts his penny in that machine there.
The next I know he makes out it's been fixed.

467
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:20,843
Sees me doing this repair job.
"Look, he's fixing that," he says.

468
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,613
<i>As if they need fixing.</i>

469
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:26,489
I'm an old man, I am.
Have I got to be knocked about by drunks?

470
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:31,131
My pal tries to stop him going for the old man
and gets a packet in the derby instead.

471
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:34,690
I come up and push the soldier away,
strictly in self-defence, like.

472
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:37,533
<i>He loses his balance and hits his napper</i>
<i>on this machine.</i>

473
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:40,567
We done our best.
We saw he was out for the count.

474
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,083
Yes. What about you?

475
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,726
Didn't see nothing.

476
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,248
Nasty

477
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,809
Can I use your phone?
We'll have to get an ambulance.

478
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:54,413
Er... no, no.

479
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,685
There's Dr Montgomery a couple of doors away.

480
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,726
- Can you walk?
- Sure.

481
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,366
All right. Give me a hand with him.

482
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,646
Hi. Hey, you.

483
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,606
- Me?
- Don't you want your prize?

484
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:20,567
- Eh?
- You've knocked up 11,000. Highest this week.

485
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,606
Not just now.

486
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,125
You stay in that saloon. I want a word with you.

487
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:31,166
- OK.
- In here, Officer.

488
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,526
Careful of the step.

489
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,891
Here's a chair.

490
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:42,447
I'll soon put that right.

491
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,486
Knocked him a bit silly, I expect.

492
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:46,446
- Bless my soul.
- Hello, doc.

493
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:49,965
- You know him, then?
- Yes, he's one of the lads of the district.

494
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,654
- You say this happened at the Lucky Star?
- Yes.

495
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:55,687
I'll just take his name and number,
if you don't mind.

496
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,684
There might be an assault charge
come out of this.

497
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,968
<i>- You on leave?</i>
- <i>Er... yes.</i>

498
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,006
Got your pass?

499
00:33:06,455 --> 00:33:08,446
- Got your pass?
- Er, Officer.

500
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:10,292
Give him a minute to get his wits back.

501
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:13,133
Besides, I can tell you anything about him
you want to know.

502
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,530
I'm glad to hear you're going to take
proceedings.

503
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:19,648
- It's time these pin-table parasites had a lesson.
- It's him I mean, not them.

504
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:23,005
What? Surely it's obvious he's the injured party.

505
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:26,206
- Look at him.
- The evidence is all against him, you know.

506
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:30,134
These fellas would swear away their
grandmothers for a packet of Woodbines.

507
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,166
It's our duty to bring them to court.

508
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:34,683
If this young soldier's willing to make a charge.

509
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:37,850
Are you?

510
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:42,370
You mean you've no complaint whatsoever?

511
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,286
That's right.

512
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,803
There you are, Officer. If he won't, he won't.

513
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:50,323
As you said yourself,
it would be absurd to charge him.

514
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,093
Nothing much more you can do about it.

515
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:53,693
No, I suppose not.

516
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,885
Look, you leave him to me.

517
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:58,927
You've enough on your hands these days.
I'll patch him up in a jiffy.

518
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:01,933
If there's anything you want to know afterwards,
you come to me.

519
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:04,250
- Oh, thank you, Doctor.
- You know your way out.

520
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:06,286
Right you are.

521
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:13,086
Well, Jim Colter, I gather from your attitude
just now you're playing truant.

522
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,846
- Yes.
- Would you say that was wise?

523
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,767
Hm?

524
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,931
I'd better get you fixed up, I suppose.

525
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:25,046
(Buzz of conversation)

526
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:27,966
Come on. Drink up.

527
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,566
- Have another?
- No, thanks.

528
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,925
- I'd better be going.
- Why not grab a bite here?

529
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:38,170
You're not expected back, are you?
No, but

530
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:39,967
Now, don't get me wrong.

531
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:43,132
You stood me up - OK,
and I'm taking it like a lamb,

532
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:47,327
but you've got to eat sometime and I'm grabbing
a bite here, so why not grab one with me?

533
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,252
- No, Ted, really.
- Why not?

534
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:53,927
- I don't think I ought.
- I know. You've been warned off me, eh?

535
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,812
So's everyone in skirts within a mile of
the Waterloo Road.

536
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,890
Sure, sure. You know what all the old dames
tell their daughters around here?

537
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,369
Ted Purvis'll get you if you don't watch out.

538
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:07,371
I'd like half the chance.

539
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:11,488
You don't think I'll make a pass at you
over George's roast beef and two veg, do you?

540
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:13,526
Go on. What's the harm in it?

541
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:15,613
None, I suppose.

542
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,452
That's right.

543
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:19,292
It would make a change.

544
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:21,326
Well, then?

545
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,246
All right, then, Ted.

546
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,928
- George?
- Hello.

547
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:31,287
- Can I have the table in the corner?
- Of course. Anything for an old customer.

548
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:39,775
Well? What's the matter?

549
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:43,171
If you ask me, the youngsters are having
the toughest time in this war.

550
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,206
What war? I ain't found it yet.

551
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:48,645
Females the problem all round.
Blooming crossword puzzle.

552
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:50,686
That's a great discovery.

553
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,444
La donna è mobile.

554
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:55,486
- What's that?
- Italian.

555
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:57,048
What does it mean?

556
00:35:57,095 --> 00:36:01,646
What's it mean?
It means that women is... mobile.

557
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,686
Who said that? Mr Bevin?

558
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,526
Give me pigeons every time.

559
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,886
Not so blinking whimsical.

560
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:15,131
I haven't seen your mother lately.
Or your sister, for that matter.

561
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,166
- How are they?
- Fine.

562
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:19,126
And the little wife?

563
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,972
Tilly, isn't it?

564
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,006
All right, thanks.

565
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:26,810
War's an unsettling business.
Especially for the womenfolk.

566
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,972
They've more of the beaver instinct in them
than the men.

567
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:34,327
Give them a chance and they'll build a home
out of an old plank and a rusty nail.

568
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,966
And a cradle out of an old orange box.

569
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,926
Keep your head still.

570
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:43,685
Deny it to them, and repressed
and rebellious nature runs amok in a big way.

571
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,126
- Do...
- Yes?

572
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:48,166
Are you going to take much longer?

573
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:50,009
No.

574
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:52,046
Just a patch and it'll be all over.

575
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,687
Not the first time there's been a bust-up
at that Lucky Star place.

576
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,124
I ought to pay a commission
to the fella that runs it.

577
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,131
What's his name? Purvis, isn't it?

578
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,006
- Yep.
- Ever met him?

579
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:04,094
Not yet. Why?

580
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:08,367
Just a perfect example of the type
that's determined to have his cake and eat it.

581
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:10,406
Popular with the local lads.

582
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,812
And lasses.

583
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,811
Why do you keep going on about Ted Purvis?

584
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:18,131
He's a symptom of a general condition.
Head down, please.

585
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:22,372
Hope he's still not having his cake and eating it
when the war's over.

586
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:25,213
- Finished?
- Yes. Your cap'll cover that nicely.

587
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,735
- Do you feel all right?
- Er, yeah. Thanks, doc.

588
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:32,290
You know, Colter, I sometimes think
the remedy's in your hands.

589
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:36,214
- What are you driving at?
- The hands of the people that you represent.

590
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,088
You're making the sacrifices,
you fellows in the Services.

591
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:43,526
You don't want the Ted Purvises of this world
to reap the benefits when it's over.

592
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,452
Or now, for that matter.

593
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:48,055
I don't know who's going to stop them, if not you.

594
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:53,333
- Look, doc, do you know about...
- My dear fellow, I was only thinking aloud.

595
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:57,569
Any fool can punch somebody in the nose.
That doesn't require intelligence.

596
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:00,925
The point is, does it achieve anything?
Does it do any good?

597
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:04,534
I think it would do Ted Purvis a lot of good.

598
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,770
- Thanks, doc.
- There'll be no charge.

599
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:13,248
Feed your pigeons for a couple of months,
one of those sacks would.

600
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:15,684
- I wish I'd known sooner.
- T'ain't too late.

601
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,214
I've given my word now.

602
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,450
But, Tom, you've had pigeons for years.

603
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:22,248
Cheers me up to see them flying off
in the morning.

604
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:24,092
That's right.

605
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,807
It's different now, though.

606
00:38:25,855 --> 00:38:28,050
They'll be a lot better off where they're going.

607
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,404
- I'll give you a hand with them tonight.
- OK.

608
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,446
- So long.
- So long.

609
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,846
<i>Tom?</i>

610
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:48,649
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello, Jim boy, fancy seeing you.

611
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:51,414
- Come up on leave for the blitz?
- Only for the day.

612
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,650
Well, well, this is a surprise.

613
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:58,374
- Have you been home yet?
- Uh-huh.

614
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:01,373
- Seen your ma?
- Mm. Didn't see Tilly, though.

615
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:03,406
Looking for her now.

616
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:06,925
I see. Well, I'll be getting along.
Must get a bit of shut-eye.

617
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:11,844
I suppose you didn't happen to have
run into her, by any chance.

618
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:14,693
- Saw her at breakfast as usual.
- Seen her since?

619
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,726
I wasn't noticing, Jim.

620
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,366
Just having my usual pint.

621
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:21,212
Well, I'll get along.

622
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:25,089
- You've seen her, haven't you?
- I took French leave. I've got to see her.

623
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:27,126
Well...

624
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:32,213
As a matter of fact,
she's in the old Canterbury Arms.

625
00:39:32,255 --> 00:39:33,847
- By herself?
- Listen, son...

626
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:36,090
That's all I want to know. See you later.

627
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:48,364
- Ted Purvis in?
- Table in the corner. Lunching with a bit of skirt.

628
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,891
- Ted Purvis here?
- Just this minute left.

629
00:39:57,935 --> 00:40:00,210
- Know where they went?
- I couldn't say.

630
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:04,407
I've got something for him.
Any idea where he might be at this time?

631
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:07,891
I don't know, I'm sure.
Unless he's dropping in at Tony's shop.

632
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:11,211
- Where's that?
- Ladies' hairdressing, off Wellington Street.

633
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:13,530
Ted often pops in to cart the takings to the bank.

634
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:22,931
- Morning, Corp.
- Morning.

635
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,169
Oi! Colter!

636
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,126
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Duggan.

637
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,211
How are you, stupid?
What are you gonna have?

638
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:30,211
You stay there. I want you.

639
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:33,247
(Gasps and shouting)

640
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:51,086
- Hiya.
- Goodbye.

641
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:54,323
- Look out.
- Sorry.

642
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,569
Hell, he's gone.

643
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:34,694
Good afternoon, young man.
All men of His Majesty's forces welcome.

644
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:37,533
Hope it pleases the girlfriend. Come again, Jack.

645
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,850
Step inside, sir. Don't be bashful.

646
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:42,489
Any particular line you fancy? Take your pick.

647
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,726
<i>There's plenty to choose from.</i>

648
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:50,965
<i>The wife. When I can't sleep</i>
<i>I turn over and look at the pictures.</i>

649
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,887
There's years of tattooing in that, sir.
Calls for a lot of patience. On both sides.

650
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:57,084
Now, what can I do for you?

651
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:59,524
As a matter of fact,
I dropped in to have a look around.

652
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:03,250
We have a nice range to choose from.
Mottoes and emblems of all nations.

653
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:05,809
Females draped or in a state of nature,
as preferred,

654
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:08,892
<i>and a selection of the animal kingdom.</i>
<i>Actual or mythical</i>

655
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:11,244
<i>I used to do a nice fire-breathing dragon.</i>

656
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,846
I had to drop that line owing to the lack of
colouring materials due to the war.

657
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,692
- How's that, eh?
- What?

658
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,726
Oh, take a long time, anything like that?

659
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,406
<i>There's a lot of work in these artistic jobs.</i>

660
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,650
How about something quicker, less showy?

661
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:27,854
What about a bleeding heart,
transfixed by an arrow?

662
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:32,366
Looks a treat on the forearm. Pretty effect
of heartbeats when you move the muscle.

663
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:34,406
Very pretty indeed.

664
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:37,686
Sit down. Have name of a girlfriend underneath.

665
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:40,565
- More like it.
- Very popular line, that.

666
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,412
Cheap but tasteful.

667
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:44,047
Excuse me.

668
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,086
About here is usual.

669
00:42:46,935 --> 00:42:49,051
- This may prick a bit.
- Just a minute.

670
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:51,053
You ever tattooed yourself?

671
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:53,086
- No.
- Now's your big chance.

672
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:10,246
Thought you might like a dance with your tea.
OK? Do you good.

673
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,492
I always seem to be doing
what I never intended, somehow.

674
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,526
It's OK by me.

675
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:17,327
All right, Bill. Call back for us later.

676
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,650
I bought a couple as soon as war broke out.

677
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:22,971
There's going to be a big demand for taxis
before it's over.

678
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,166
WOMAN: <i>We're closed.</i>

679
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,526
I said we're closed.

680
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:48,254
Quite startled me you did.
We don't often get gentlemen around here.

681
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,571
- Afraid we just closed.
- Time for a quick perm, haven't I?

682
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:56,409
- Ted Purvis been here?
- Ted Purvis? Who told you?

683
00:43:56,455 --> 00:44:00,209
The barman at the Canterbury.
He said he usually drops in here about this time.

684
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:02,246
I see. Are you a friend of his?

685
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:05,449
- Yeah, that's right.
- Then you can get out and stop out.

686
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:08,567
Any pal of that dirty, double-crossing cheapskate
can do the same.

687
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:11,846
If he has the nerve to turn up here,
I'll tell him so to his face.

688
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:14,204
Not that his lordship would come here
these days.

689
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:17,167
<i>Got something better to do, he has,</i>
<i>the lying snake.</i>

690
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,372
<i>I thought I told you to get out.</i>

691
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:21,406
Just a minute. I'm no pal of his.

692
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:23,446
<i>Come off it. You just told me.</i>

693
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,492
I'm taking it back.

694
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:29,572
- What is all this?
<i>- Never even met him. But I'm going to</i>

695
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,890
- Oh, it's like that, is it?
<i>- It's like that</i>

696
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,814
What's he done? Sold you a pup,
fiddled your dough or pinched your girl?

697
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:37,846
I listened to that phoney Romeo myself once.

698
00:44:37,895 --> 00:44:40,409
- What you gonna do? Sock him?
- Shouldn't be surprised.

699
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:44,573
With your bare hands? Seems a pity when the
government hasn't called in all the lead piping.

700
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,812
- Do you know where he is?
- Hasn't been here for some time. The rat.

701
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:52,645
I'd like to help you but I've got to get to the
tube shelter or somebody will pinch my place.

702
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:57,326
Look, give me a break, will you?

703
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,809
Tell me the places he goes to and I'll try them all.

704
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:04,968
OK. Now, let's see. Ted might have taken her
to the dogs, only there's no dogs today.

705
00:45:05,015 --> 00:45:07,893
He might be at the pictures
picking up hints from Victor Mature,

706
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:09,926
or at the Alcazar jitterbugging.

707
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:11,647
That about covers his war effort.

708
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,094
- The Alcazar.
- Do you know it?

709
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:15,729
- Yeah.
- Well, I wish you luck. You'll need it.

710
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:19,926
If you're thinking of that medical certificate of his,
it's a phoney.

711
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:24,253
He bought it off a foreign doctor at the docks
for 20 smackers. Strong as a horse he is.

712
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:27,731
- You're cute. Have something before you go?
- Not now, thanks.

713
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:31,654
- I make you a cup of tea.
- Thanks. Can't wait. You're pretty cute too.

714
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:36,485
Oh, well, it was a beautiful friendship
while it lasted.

715
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:39,886
# Lively tune

716
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:53,406
Enjoying yourself?

717
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:55,730
I'd forgotten about places like this, almost.

718
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:59,764
The band and dancing,
seeing people enjoy themselves.

719
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:03,569
You ought to get around more.
This is your life. You're wasting it.

720
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:07,324
- I'm beginning to think you're right.
- Sure. All work and no play.

721
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:10,970
- Any more if you squeeze the pot?
- I think so.

722
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:12,846
Live with your in -laws, don't you?

723
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,487
Yes. Why?

724
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:15,729
Oh, nothing.

725
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:19,734
It's not the same, is it? It's not like being
your own boss, having a home of your own.

726
00:46:21,095 --> 00:46:22,653
Ta.

727
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:24,970
We were going to have all that, Jim and me.

728
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,172
- I don't know.
- Tough.

729
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:32,367
You know, Till, you and me,
in a way, we're the same sort of people.

730
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:34,732
I'd never have thought that.

731
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,290
I started out when I was a kid
fighting six-round bill-openers,

732
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,326
five bob a time and glad of it.

733
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:43,094
You don't want to end up slap-happy
with tin ears.

734
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:46,207
You've got to scream out how good you are,
bu t o n a n act

735
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,646
But it's not the real one.

736
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:51,365
Maybe we want the same things, you know, Till.

737
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:53,167
You remind me of what I've missed.

738
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:55,206
What?

739
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,090
You'd laugh if I told you.

740
00:46:58,135 --> 00:47:01,127
Nice little house, roses in the front garden.

741
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:05,884
Bit of grass, lettuces, tomatoes, home-grown.

742
00:47:05,935 --> 00:47:09,007
It'd be great to have someone like you
waiting for me to come home.

743
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,253
- If you ever did come home.
- There you are. I knew you'd laugh.

744
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:15,729
See, Till, I've never had a home.

745
00:47:16,535 --> 00:47:18,491
Not what you'd call a real one.

746
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:24,087
Or a house, a wife, kids maybe.

747
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:29,254
Hark at me. You must think I'm talking like a fool.

748
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,364
No, Ted, things like that aren't foolish.

749
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,286
Till, I've often wondered about you.

750
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,213
Sometimes I think you're not... happy.

751
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:41,530
- I'm all right.
- If I can help in any way?

752
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:43,606
Strictly as a pal, mind.

753
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:46,414
OK.

754
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:48,244
OK.

755
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:50,286
Dance?

756
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:59,046
Wotcher, Ted.

757
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:02,166
How's it going?

758
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,366
# Slow waltz

759
00:48:17,015 --> 00:48:19,006
- Ted?
- Yeah.

760
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:21,250
Let's sit the rest of this out, shall we?

761
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:22,774
OK.

762
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:24,806
Come and have a drink.

763
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:37,971
By yourself, soldier?

764
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,290
- Yeah.
- Cheer up. You won't be for long.

765
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,326
Here you are.

766
00:48:44,015 --> 00:48:47,928
I wish I didn't have to keep on reminding myself
you're a married woman.

767
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:51,049
Well, wish me many happy returns.

768
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:53,646
- Why?
- It's my birthday.

769
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:56,086
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

770
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:58,603
- It's a fact.
- Well, happy birthday, then.

771
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:01,686
Thanks. It has been.

772
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:12,574
(Drum roll)

773
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:13,764
MAN: Cops.

774
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:16,568
Sorry to break into the fun,
ladies and gentlemen.

775
00:49:16,615 --> 00:49:19,527
We're here to check all identity cards
and leave passes.

776
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:22,135
<i>No-one can leave until they're dealt with.</i>

777
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:24,566
Round up the dodgers, I suppose.

778
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:25,843
Oh, I'm OK.

779
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:30,443
<i>If all of you will form an orderly queue,</i>
<i>we'll soon get this business over.</i>

780
00:49:32,255 --> 00:49:34,564
<i>Civilians line up on the left.</i>

781
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:36,606
<i>members of the forces on my right.</i>

782
00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:40,928
Over there, chum. Forces on the right.
Queue up early and avoid the rush.

783
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:52,727
<i>That's the idea. Thank you, everybody.</i>
<i>Now we'll carry on.</i>

784
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:54,766
All right?

785
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,446
You take the cloakroom.

786
00:50:38,855 --> 00:50:42,245
It's all right, boys, it's only a military cop.
Can't touch us.

787
00:50:42,295 --> 00:50:44,286
I wouldn't. Not with a bargepole.

788
00:51:07,215 --> 00:51:09,206
OK, Sergeant.

789
00:51:10,455 --> 00:51:12,446
Thanks, soldier. Come on.

790
00:51:23,015 --> 00:51:24,209
OK.

791
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:35,685
<i>All blinds down, please.</i>

792
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,966
<i>Draw all blinds. All blinds down, please.</i>

793
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:42,409
<i>Will all passengers please draw all blinds.</i>

794
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:44,571
- Hello, Tom.
(Birds coo)

795
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:48,210
- Sending your birds off, then?
- On the nine o'clock. See them off, will you?

796
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:50,485
- OK, Tom.
- Guard them with your life, cock.

797
00:51:50,535 --> 00:51:52,491
You leave it to me.

798
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:56,053
- Hello, Ruby.
- Fred. Come on early, haven't you?

799
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:59,849
I've got a lovely surprise for you.
Just been up to get my rota shifted.

800
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:02,887
I go on days on Monday instead of nights.
So now you and me...

801
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:04,607
- Fred.
- What's up?

802
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,010
I've done the same. They put me on nights.

803
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,454
Oh.

804
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:11,885
I never thought you'd move.
You'd have to go and muck it up.

805
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:14,451
Puts us back where we started.

806
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:16,770
- That's right.
- Better be getting on duty.

807
00:52:16,815 --> 00:52:18,806
Yes, you had.

808
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,893
- If you ask me, Fred's a bit done.
- I'm not asking you.

809
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:26,812
I never knew such a pair of ears.

810
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:30,086
- What are you doing here?
- Mum said I was to go with you to the shelter.

811
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:31,853
What's up at home, Ruby?

812
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,489
- Why?
- When I asked Mum, she nearly flew at me.

813
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:36,890
"You mind your own business, big ears,"
she said.

814
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:38,653
I'm sick of hearing about my ears.

815
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:41,255
If a bomb sent me stone deaf,
I suppose you'd be happy.

816
00:52:48,575 --> 00:52:50,645
OK, boys. Relax and have a cigarette.

817
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:56,810
- How are you, Matt?
- Well! You old son of a gun!

818
00:52:56,855 --> 00:52:59,608
- Haven't seen you in weeks.
- Where are you fellas going?

819
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,168
Recalled from leave.

820
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:04,048
- Ceremonial drill?
- Looks like the real thing this time.

821
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:07,849
- They don't drag us back from leave for nothing.
- Maybe a raid on jerry, eh?

822
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:10,614
This is what I've been waiting for.
When do you go?

823
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,566
A couple of minutes.

824
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:14,845
- Hold it, fellas, I'll be right back.
- OK.

825
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:19,610
- Private Duggan reporting for duty, Corporal.
- What? Duggan?!

826
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:22,524
So you finally came to your senses, huh?

827
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,805
- OK, come along with me.
- Where are we going?

828
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:26,607
I've gotta go back on that train.

829
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,850
Without an escort? Don't make me laugh.

830
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:31,455
Escort? Say, you can't do this to me.

831
00:53:31,495 --> 00:53:33,451
I've given myself up. I'll miss the show.

832
00:53:33,495 --> 00:53:35,611
Come on. Will the sergeant be glad I...

833
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:49,046
(Train roars by)

834
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:56,326
(Scuffling)

835
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:05,286
- Tilly come back?
- No.

836
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:07,451
Not since she went out this morning.

837
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:10,089
I was hoping that you'd be bringing her
along with...

838
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:12,886
I saw her, Mum. Ted Purvis.

839
00:54:13,975 --> 00:54:15,852
She never saw me.

840
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:18,568
They went off in a taxi and I couldn't get to them.

841
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:20,571
Oh, Jim.

842
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:23,812
There can't be any harm in it. She wouldn't.

843
00:54:23,855 --> 00:54:26,494
- What are you going to do?
- Find her if it takes all night.

844
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:28,730
(Air-raid siren)
- There it is.

845
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,172
Jim, the station shelter.
She's sure to come back there.

846
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,126
We go there most nights.

847
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:37,450
If you go anywhere else, you'll miss her.

848
00:54:37,495 --> 00:54:39,929
May as well start there as anywhere.

849
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,290
We'll go out through the scullery.
They're watching the front.

850
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,486
Alert, ladies and gentlemen.

851
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:54,973
All I could manage, Ted.
One of gin and one of Empire port. OK?

852
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:58,052
Have to be. Thanks, George.
Got a bit of a do on tonight.

853
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,086
- Very nice, too.
- You bet.

854
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,810
Have one yourself with the change.
- Thanks. I will. All the best.

855
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,326
Sorry, Till, but he kept me a bit.

856
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,764
- The siren 's gone, Ted.
- OK. Hang onto me.

857
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:20,294
<i>Evening, doc.</i>

858
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:22,724
Oh, it's you, Mrs Wilson. Going to the shelter?

859
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:24,845
No, to the pictures to see Mickey Rooney.

860
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:27,887
You can't stay cooped up.
You can have too much of a good thing.

861
00:55:27,935 --> 00:55:30,927
In my opinion,
one can have too much of Mickey Rooney.

862
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:32,374
- Oh!
- Sorry.

863
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,487
Beg yours. Dark, ain't it?
Mind, Till, kerb over there.

864
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,492
I'll just drop these bottles in here,
if you don't mind.

865
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:43,526
You'll come up for a minute, won't you?

866
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:45,566
Ted, I've got to get home sometimes.

867
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:48,687
I've asked the boys and girls to drop in,
a birthday party.

868
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,807
- You can't let me down on my birthday.
- I spent most of it with you.

869
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:54,449
No harm in rounding the day off nicely, is there?

870
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,932
- Oh, all right.
- That's the girl.

871
00:55:56,975 --> 00:55:58,966
Just for a minute, then.

872
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:01,006
<i>Where's the Doctor got to?</i>

873
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:03,046
I'm coming, Mrs Wilson.

874
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:07,652
Got quite a nice little joint upstairs
over the old shop.

875
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,773
- Hey-ho.
<i>- Hey, mate.</i>

876
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:16,486
That's right, Mugsy. Help yourself.

877
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:18,127
Well, this is Tilly.

878
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,166
- Hello.
- How do.

879
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:21,807
Make yourself at home.

880
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:23,766
- Where are all the others, Alf?
- Others?

881
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:27,888
I asked some of the boys and girls to drop in.
I expect they've gone to the shelters.

882
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:30,051
Not like them if there's drinks going.

883
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:32,327
<i>Sticking to mother's ruin, Till?</i>

884
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,969
- I think I've had enough.
- You can make this one last.

885
00:56:35,015 --> 00:56:37,210
- Many happy returns, Ted.
- Many what?

886
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:39,723
- Didn't I tell you? It's my birthday.
- But I...

887
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:42,972
What do you think the party's for?
Let's have some music.

888
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:44,414
Okey-doke.

889
00:56:44,455 --> 00:56:46,207
Till, what about a dance?

890
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:51,206
(Dance music on wireless)

891
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,407
Go it, Ted. Go it!

892
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:18,166
(Buzz of chatter)

893
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:22,286
MAN <i>there he is.</i>

894
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:24,326
<i>Late again, is it?</i>

895
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,366
You're always late.

896
00:57:26,415 --> 00:57:28,406
You want reporting, you do.

897
00:57:30,335 --> 00:57:31,814
Hello, Jim. Are you on leave?

898
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:33,846
<i>Never you mind.</i>

899
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:35,886
Seen Tilly?

900
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:37,971
Him neither.

901
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:45,690
Don't go, Jim, it's only just started.
She'll be here in a minute.

902
00:57:49,295 --> 00:57:51,604
(Music plays)
- Talk about Betty Grable!

903
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,646
Tilly, you're good!

904
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:56,368
Little bit of practice and you'll be in my class.

905
00:57:57,095 --> 00:57:59,086
Erm... cigarette?

906
00:57:59,135 --> 00:58:01,126
- Thanks.
- Catch.

907
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:06,246
Hm? None left?

908
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:09,492
That's me all over.
Called in at the pub and clean forgot.

909
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,570
Alf?

910
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:13,925
<i>- Bring a couple of packets from the saloon.</i>
- If you want fags...

911
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:16,250
I think you'll find a carton in the office.

912
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,251
(Distant explosions)
- OK.

913
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,684
May'll show you where... won't you, May?

914
00:58:20,735 --> 00:58:22,726
Right-o.

915
00:58:23,775 --> 00:58:25,766
Oh, half a tick.

916
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:27,806
You may need the keys.

917
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,366
(Distant rumbling outside)

918
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:40,086
(Forceful explosion)

919
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:42,126
The old gun 's going, eh?

920
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,643
(Music volume increases)
- That's better.

921
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:46,686
Well, cheers.

922
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:51,766
(Explosion)

923
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:53,806
Getting noisier.

924
00:58:53,855 --> 00:58:55,846
- Yes.
- Frightened?

925
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:58,090
That's right, what do we care? Fatalist, me.

926
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:02,048
If something's gonna happen, it'll happen.
That's what I always say.

927
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:05,690
The others are a long time, aren't they?

928
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:07,327
Hm? Alf and May?

929
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,684
Give 'em a chance, they've only just gone!

930
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,807
Hadn't you better see?

931
00:59:12,855 --> 00:59:14,846
- They'll be OK.
- Ted.

932
00:59:15,575 --> 00:59:17,452
All right. I'll give 'em a shout.

933
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,367
Alf? May?

934
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:31,246
Where are you?

935
00:59:32,295 --> 00:59:33,694
<i>Alf?</i>

936
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,610
Well, doesn't seem to be any sign of them.

937
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:40,850
Perhaps they couldn't find it downstairs,

938
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:43,693
so they went to get a packet
from the shop on the corner.

939
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:45,726
It's pretty hot outside.

940
00:59:45,775 --> 00:59:47,845
Maybe they've taken shelter somewhere.

941
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:49,487
- Ted?
- Hm?

942
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:51,127
You told them to go, didn't you?

943
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,574
What?

944
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:54,606
Don't be silly, Till.

945
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,646
You did, didn't you?

946
00:59:56,695 --> 00:59:58,686
Get some funny ideas, don't you?

947
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:00,726
Why should?

948
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:03,084
OK.

949
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:05,126
All right, I did.

950
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:08,806
So what?

951
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,653
Honest, Till... you know how I feel about you.

952
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:13,686
I knew you'd told them to go.

953
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,726
You knew?

954
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:17,766
Yes.

955
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,806
You didn't say anything.

956
01:00:19,855 --> 01:00:21,846
And you didn't go.

957
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:23,886
No.

958
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,005
I suppose I should have, but I didn't.

959
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,046
Tilly, you're the tops.

960
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:32,605
Let's have another, eh?
This time we'll drink to you and me.

961
01:00:36,135 --> 01:00:39,013
- I can't stick this.
- You can't go out in this, Jim.

962
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:44,289
- Jim.
- Where's he off to now?

963
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:46,166
You shut up and go to bed.

964
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:50,210
Hello there. How's the head?

965
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,928
- All right, thanks, doc.
- Where are you going?

966
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:54,966
I don't know.

967
01:00:55,015 --> 01:00:57,006
- Look, can you take a hint?
- Sure.

968
01:00:57,055 --> 01:01:00,047
If I were you,
I'd pay another visit to the Lucky Star.

969
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:02,086
- What?
- Now. Right away.

970
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:04,126
- Thanks.
- One moment.

971
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:06,244
Jim...

972
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:11,164
you know, we'd all like to think people
we're fond of suddenly change their characters.

973
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:13,206
- They don't really.
- Sure.

974
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:17,168
That something that we've loved in someone
doesn't vanish overnight.

975
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,206
It's still there.

976
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:22,171
Awfully good thing to remember, that.

977
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:24,410
- Is it?
- Oh, Jim...

978
01:01:24,455 --> 01:01:26,969
I once saw Purvis fight in a Blackfriars ring.

979
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:30,849
He was pretty good, but a wee bit too fond
of a right hook that left him open.

980
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,886
Good luck.

981
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,246
(Explosions outside)

982
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:45,815
- I don't love you, Ted. You know that?
- Never mind.

983
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,564
- This doesn't mean anything really.
- I know, it's just platonic.

984
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:55,012
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now for Bird Of Love Divine</i>
<i>by Haydn Wood.</i>

985
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:00,046
(Giggles)

986
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,086
What's the matter?

987
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,932
I can't help it.

988
01:02:03,975 --> 01:02:05,966
You look so funny.

989
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,006
(Laughs)

990
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,926
Now, stop it, Till!

991
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:12,966
I'm sorry, Ted.

992
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,131
I don't know what's the matter with me.

993
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:17,966
I'm all in a muddle.

994
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:20,006
(Sobs)

995
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:24,566
What is the matter?

996
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,526
What's come over you, Till?

997
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,971
I just can't do that to Jim, that's all.

998
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:36,325
- He'd never know.
- I tried to kid myself this didn't mean anything.

999
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:39,326
Even if you quarrel with someone...

1000
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:44,214
...and you've prayed every night
he'll come back safe when it's over,

1001
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:46,644
you feel if you do anything wrong, he...

1002
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:49,606
...he mightn't...

1003
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:52,013
That's all.

1004
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:54,046
So I'm going home, Ted.

1005
01:02:54,095 --> 01:02:55,084
See?

1006
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:57,091
You left it a bit late, didn't you?

1007
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:59,933
(Explosions continue outside)
- Hey, wait a minute.

1008
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:02,284
I've been tagging along after you all day -

1009
01:03:02,335 --> 01:03:05,327
having lunch, dancing,
giving you a good time all round.

1010
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,685
You lead me up the garden path and walk out?
Do you take me for a mug?

1011
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:11,249
I'm sorry you haven't had your money's worth.

1012
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:13,889
You're cheap, Ted Purvis, that's what you are.

1013
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:16,324
I don't know why I never saw it before but...

1014
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,366
you look cheap, too.

1015
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:20,053
I look cheap?

1016
01:03:22,455 --> 01:03:24,173
Hey!

1017
01:03:26,935 --> 01:03:28,926
Oh, Jim!

1018
01:03:31,695 --> 01:03:34,209
Get your coat on, Tilly, and wait downstairs.

1019
01:03:52,655 --> 01:03:55,647
Come off it, soldier,
I'm just in the mood to sock somebody.

1020
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:57,686
So choose someone in your own class.

1021
01:03:57,735 --> 01:03:59,327
I know my stuff.

1022
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:02,685
Besides, if it hadn't been me
it'd have been somebody else.

1023
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:15,004
Ohh!

1024
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,926
I told you what you'd get, didn't I?

1025
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,966
Come on, get up.

1026
01:04:40,935 --> 01:04:41,845
Uggh!

1027
01:05:00,215 --> 01:05:01,364
(Panting)

1028
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,174
(Whistle of approaching bomb, then explosion)

1029
01:05:37,695 --> 01:05:39,731
(Fire engine bell rings)

1030
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:08,449
Come on. Get going.

1031
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:21,164
Oh!

1032
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:49,406
Ughh!

1033
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:57,692
(Explosion nearby)

1034
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:08,086
Delayed action, couple of doors away.

1035
01:07:08,135 --> 01:07:10,330
Two minutes to clear the street. Anybody...

1036
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:16,485
Fine time to choose that sort of thing.

1037
01:07:18,175 --> 01:07:19,574
Who's that?

1038
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,048
Not Ted Purvis?

1039
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,687
That's right.

1040
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:27,494
That's OK by me, but make it snappy. You've
only got a minute. You'd better get a move on.

1041
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,286
Jim... Jim, quick!

1042
01:07:34,215 --> 01:07:35,614
(Flames crackle)

1043
01:07:38,335 --> 01:07:40,326
Hurry!

1044
01:07:45,135 --> 01:07:48,730
- You know one or two of the answers.
- Yeah, went to night school.

1045
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,366
(Buzz of chatter)

1046
01:08:00,215 --> 01:08:02,206
- Blimey, what a mess, eh?
- Sssh.

1047
01:08:02,255 --> 01:08:05,725
- I'm OK. Just a bit out of condition, that's all.
- Keep still.

1048
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:07,766
I had that chap licked, too.

1049
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:10,932
Fancy falling for an old trick like that.
I certainly asked for it.

1050
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:13,364
- That's right.
- What do you know about it?

1051
01:08:13,415 --> 01:08:15,406
What could I know?

1052
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:17,525
You wouldn't say I'll be marked for life?

1053
01:08:17,575 --> 01:08:19,372
- Scarcely.
- Leave a scar?

1054
01:08:19,415 --> 01:08:21,724
I shouldn't think so. You've a thick skin.

1055
01:08:21,775 --> 01:08:23,367
That's all right, then.

1056
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:26,930
It'd be too bad to spoil the old profile
after ten years in the ring.

1057
01:08:26,975 --> 01:08:28,966
It might be worse. I'm lucky - I always was.

1058
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:32,325
- How did you get this medical certificate?
- How do you think?

1059
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:36,493
According to popular report, you paid
quite a sum to some quack at the docks.

1060
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:38,526
Libelling another medical man?

1061
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:41,009
Dog eating dog, that's what I call it.

1062
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:44,172
I'd have given you exactly the same certificate
for five bob.

1063
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:46,046
What are you driving at?

1064
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:48,973
Only that his diagnosis happened to be correct.

1065
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:51,006
What, that my... ?

1066
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:53,885
<i>Yes. I'm afraid from now on,</i>

1067
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:58,326
<i>wine women and song must play</i>
<i>an increasingly unimportant part in your life.</i>

1068
01:09:00,855 --> 01:09:02,846
Of course, doc. Hey.

1069
01:09:09,335 --> 01:09:11,326
OK. OK.

1070
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:16,326
Are you still cross with me?

1071
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,287
No.

1072
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:21,326
Why not, Jim?

1073
01:09:22,095 --> 01:09:24,086
I don't know.

1074
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,126
- You ought to be.
- I know.

1075
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:28,166
(Snoring)

1076
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:32,564
Perhaps I'm beginning to understand you.

1077
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:35,004
More my fault than yours in the first place,

1078
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,046
- and then...
- What?

1079
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:40,653
Well, I saw the way
you looked at me when I got there.

1080
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:42,686
How did I look, Jim?

1081
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:44,532
I don't know.

1082
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,647
I just knew then and there it was all right,
that's all.

1083
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:49,811
I've been a lot of trouble to you today.

1084
01:09:49,855 --> 01:09:51,846
Not half.

1085
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:53,886
Sorry, Jim.

1086
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:55,926
OK, Till.

1087
01:09:57,495 --> 01:09:59,292
(Rumble of distant bombs)

1088
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:03,933
What? Of course!

1089
01:10:03,975 --> 01:10:07,092
You send that ballast
and we'll get it right by breakfast time.

1090
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:09,126
OK.

1091
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:11,166
(Whistle of approaching bomb)

1092
01:10:11,215 --> 01:10:13,206
(Explosion)

1093
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,246
Another bleeding hole to fill up!

1094
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,646
(Explosion)

1095
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:27,566
(All-clear siren blares)

1096
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,366
(Bird coos)

1097
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:53,327
Blimey!

1098
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,804
Hello, Gertie, old girl.

1099
01:10:56,855 --> 01:10:58,846
Made it home.

1100
01:11:00,295 --> 01:11:04,288
I don't know how you got here,
but now you are here, you're going to stay.

1101
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:12,173
Jim!

1102
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:33,130
<i>What days. What days!</i>

1103
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:43,286
(Baby cries)

1104
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,326
Many happy returns, Jim.

1105
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,288
Look what I got. What do you think of that?
Puff-puff. Goes choo-choo.

1106
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:54,326
I see. I'll put it there.

1107
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,603
(Jim cries)

1108
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:58,044
How many times have I told you?
Don't cuddle him.

1109
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:01,485
The more they're cuddled, the more they cry.
It's a vicious circle.

1110
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,924
Probably explains Hitler. Heard from Jim?

1111
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:06,853
Yes, had an airgram from him yesterday.
He's fine.

1112
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:09,568
Nothing much wrong with Colter Junior, either.

1113
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:12,493
Be a good citizen
if you bring him up like I tell you.

1114
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:15,929
We'll need good citizens when this is all over.

1115
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:19,846
Millions of them.

1116
01:12:19,895 --> 01:12:21,886
The more the merrier.

1117
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:24,608
I wonder what they'll think of
their mums and dads.

1118
01:12:24,655 --> 01:12:27,374
Probably never understand
why they allowed all this.

1119
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,406
And yet maybe they'll have to admit,

1120
01:12:30,455 --> 01:12:32,844
that taking it all in all...

1121
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:35,965
...they didn't come through so badly.

1122
01:12:37,615 --> 01:12:39,412
Well, Jimmy, my boy...

1123
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,013
you've got the future.

1124
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:43,046
<i>It's all yours.</i>

1125
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:45,086
(Gurgles)
