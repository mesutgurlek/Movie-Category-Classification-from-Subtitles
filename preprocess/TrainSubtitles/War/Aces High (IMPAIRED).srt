2
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,465
(band playing)

3
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,523
(all cheering)

4
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,040
(indistinct talk)

5
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,740
Let us pray.

6
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,621
(aeroplane firing gun)

7
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,129
(explosion)

8
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,644
I've got one thing in particular to say to you.

9
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:49,647
Just one thing we've talked about before.

10
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,733
One thing that gives us peace of mind

11
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,652
even amidst the struggle
that we find our country in.

12
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,947
It's a Christian thing and a British thing.

13
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,243
It's what the Bible teaches.
It's what the Christian martyrs suffered for.

14
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,163
It found root in England,

15
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:10,460
and not only began to fill the land,
but became the heritage of Empire.

16
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,171
It's the story of the crusaders,

17
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:17,008
the downfall of the Armada,
the destruction of Napoleon,

18
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:21,012
and now the thing
that will scatter our enemies again.

19
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,223
The thing is this.

20
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,852
Playing the game for the game's sake.

21
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,398
Gresham needs no introduction.

22
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,525
(all applauding)

23
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,533
(aeroplane firing gun)

24
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,183
(aeroplane engine starts)

25
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,565
(indistinct shouting)

26
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,175
(aeroplane firing gun)

27
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,627
I have joined the Royal Flying Corps.

28
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,421
It's our new weapon to punish the Hun.

29
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,633
And we're giving them a good beating.

30
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,301
We are caning them.

31
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,930
And you will want to cane them too
when your turn comes.

32
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,642
I only hope it isn't all over
before you get the opportunity.

33
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,602
(applause)

34
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,492
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

35
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,369
- Good-bye!
- Good luck! Cheers!

36
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,395
Hello?

37
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,818
Hello?

38
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,077
Hello?

39
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,933
Yes, please, sir? Can I help you, sir?

40
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,978
Yes. I'm Croft. Second Lieutenant Croft.

41
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,690
- You're the replacement, sir?
- Yes.

42
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,985
- Just you, sir?
- That's right.

43
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,864
- I'll show you to your billet, sir.
- Thank you.

44
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,118
I'm Bennett, sir.

45
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,996
If there's anything you want, sir, you ask me.

46
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,748
I'm the best corporal, sir.

47
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,710
I expect you could do with
a little light refreshment, couldn't you, sir?

48
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,962
- Yes, please.
- Tea and biscuits, sir.

49
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,215
In the mess in 10 minutes.

50
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,146
Sorry about that, sir.
It should have been sent on, sir.

51
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,486
- See you in the mess, sir.
- Yes. Thank you.

52
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:18,906
(door closes)

53
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,271
I'm Croft.

54
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,234
Are you?

55
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,738
Where is everyone?

56
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,951
Flying. Whizzing around in circles.

57
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,286
Oh.

58
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,386
I hope you like Rich Tea, sir.

59
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,889
I wangled some Bourbon,
but they got nicked.

60
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,475
- Is Rich Tea all right, sir?
- Yes. Of course.

61
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,560
Grit biscuits.

62
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,188
If there's anything else you want, sir,
just call.

63
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,319
Shall I pour?

64
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,321
Yes, dear. You pour.

65
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,413
- You're not up today, then?
- Hmm. So it appears.

66
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,883
- Neuralgia.
- Oh, dear!

67
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,097
Oh, just in time for tea.

68
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,773
- You must be Croft.
- Yes.

69
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,691
Well, I'm very pleased to meet you.

70
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,944
- My name's Sinclair.
- How do you do?

71
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,113
- You've met Crawford, I take it?
- Well, not exactly.

72
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,074
Croft. Crawford.

73
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,704
Welcome to Saint Urbain.
Not much of a place, I'm afraid.

74
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,966
- Have you had much experience with S.E.5s?
- Well, about four hours.

75
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,134
Oh, you'll be all right then.

76
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,887
Mine's an Avro.

77
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:50,099
We've been doing some alterations
on the windscreen.

78
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,434
- Do you want to look over her?
- Oh, yes, very much.

79
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,478
"Oh, yes, very much."

80
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,148
Two weeks.

81
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,569
That's how long you're lasting now. 14 days.

82
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:04,989
So I wouldn't be so, "Oh, yes, very much,"
if I were you.

83
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:13,455
That's just a piece of impartial advice.
Take it or leave it. Please yourself.

84
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,001
I'm afraid all the planes
are out on patrol except...

85
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,837
- Except mine.
- Except Crawford's, of course.

86
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,547
Help yourself.

87
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,882
- Climb all over the bloody thing.
- Oh, thanks.

88
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,604
- Gresham is the CO here.
- Yes, I know.

89
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,815
Incredible stroke of luck.

90
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,235
- Oh, you know him then, do you?
- We were at the same school.

91
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,112
- Oh.
- (man whistling)

92
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,535
How near the front are we?

93
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:54,038
Oh, about 10 miles due east of here.

94
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,082
It seems terribly quiet.

95
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,627
Don't worry about that.
It gets much noisier in the Ypres sector.

96
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,295
If the wind's right. (chuckles)

97
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,929
- How do you like my old bus?
- Marvellous.

98
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,683
As a matter of fact,
it wasn't really a stroke of luck.

99
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,437
- What? Oh?
- Well, me being here with Gresham.

100
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,773
No. I asked to come.

101
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,150
Pulled strings and that.

102
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,987
I know you shouldn't, but Gresham's a...
Well, you know.

103
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,114
He was my House Captain.

104
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,328
You know, you mustn't expect him to be...

105
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,875
- Well, he's bound to have changed.
- Oh, yes.

106
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,589
Come on. I'll show you Crawford's.

107
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,303
We had Pups before.
We're damn lucky to get these.

108
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,305
Everybody's after them.
Isn't that right, Joyce?

109
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,848
Yes, sir.

110
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,642
Go on, climb aboard.

111
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,603
We also got a couple of FEs

112
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,147
and Gresham has a Nieuport
he absolutely swears by.

113
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,566
I can't wait to get up.

114
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:13,075
I expect he'll want you to go up with him,
get to know the landmarks and so on.

115
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,576
(laughs)

116
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,370
It sounds like the patrol is coming in, sir.

117
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,195
(indistinct shouting)

118
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,991
Let's go up and see him.

119
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,911
- Shall we?
- Mmm? Oh, yes, of course.

120
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,467
- You all right, sir?
- Fine.

121
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,927
I think we've been hit on the starboard side.

122
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,263
Better check to see if these lines are working.

123
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,848
Right, sir.

124
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:19,892
(indistinct talk)

125
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,687
(Gresham) Sergeant.
(Man) Sir.

126
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,064
- We seem to have been hit on the strut.
- (Croft) Gresham.

127
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:29,151
- I think we should repair this one...
- Gresham.

128
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,653
- It may need replacing.
- (Man) I'll re-rig it, sir.

129
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,491
It's Croft.

130
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,664
Sinclair. Sinclair.

131
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:47,836
We lost Dickson. He went down
somewhere behind Grand Corps.

132
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,380
You better ring Divisional HQ.
He may be all right.

133
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,757
Right away.

134
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,802
- Have those spares arrived yet?
- I'm afraid they haven't.

135
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,930
- (Gresham) But they promised.
- Well, there's still time.

136
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,265
- I know, but they promised.
- It's not 5:00 yet.

137
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,100
I'll phone them now.

138
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,479
(indistinct shouting)

139
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,442
- Who are the replacements?
- Only one.

140
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,538
(phone ringing)

141
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,834
Look, send him somewhere else, can't you?

142
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,461
Oh, I think that would be most irregular.

143
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,965
Come on, Uncle. We're all bloody irregular.

144
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,051
That's damned unkind.

145
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,053
He thinks an awful lot of you.

146
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,889
Oh, yes, I'm his bloody hero.

147
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,100
Well, that's only natural.

148
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,770
Maybe, but how long does it go on for?
And when does it stop?

149
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,856
This damn thing's gone again.

150
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,609
And how many squadrons
are there out here right now, 200?

151
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,113
And he arrives right here.
A bloody coincidence!

152
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,077
- You should be pleased.
- I am.

153
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,079
He's an awfully nice fellow.

154
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,707
Look at this.

155
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,003
Notice anything?

156
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,589
That's his sister.

157
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,511
- Oh, my God.
- She thinks I'm bloody wonderful, too.

158
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,223
If only she knew
I couldn't get inside a cockpit,

159
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,101
let alone fly a plane,
unless I was completely plastered.

160
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,146
- Now, look here, old chap.
- Oh, come on, Uncle.

161
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,482
John.

162
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,114
- Why don't you put in for some leave, hmm?
- And go where?

163
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:43,160
Go home and breathe whisky in her face?
Pretend I've got neuralgia?

164
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,287
No, thanks.

165
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,497
I'll stay here and look after him.

166
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,376
Well, that's what we're here for, isn't it?
Looking after him and people like him.

167
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,420
All right?

168
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,424
You're all so damn young.

169
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,771
- (men laughing)
- (playing piano)

170
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,691
- You know where I'm going after this?
- Where?

171
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,110
You want to know? I'll tell you.
To the hangar.

172
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,862
- And you know why?
- Why?

173
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,490
To check my ammunition,
run the engine, try the controls.

174
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,784
No offence to the mechanics
they're splendid fellows, all of them,

175
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,287
but they don't have to go up
in the sodding things.

176
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,289
Oh, come off it, Thompson.
You'll unnerve him.

177
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,125
Oh! I am just telling him.

178
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,379
What makes me carry on when others falter.

179
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,840
Why I'm still here.

180
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,677
The MC, I have not got.

181
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,555
- But the CMD, I have. CMD?
- Oh.

182
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,684
(all) Confidence in Mechanical Details.

183
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,394
(Thompson) Oh, thank you.

00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:33,497
- Have you had a drink, Croft?
- Yes. Thank you, sir.

209
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:37,667
- Incredible coincidence, you being here.
- Yes, wasn't it?

210
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,670
- How many hours have you put in?
- Fifteen.

211
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,258
- Four of them on S.E.5s.
- Oh, we'll soon knock that up.

212
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,095
Yes, starting tomorrow at daybreak.

213
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,347
Excuse me, sir. Some bad news, sir.

214
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,433
It's the sugar, sir, for the custard.

215
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,978
It's the depot, sir.
They sent 200 pounds of salt in error, sir.

216
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,147
Make the custard anyway.

217
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,484
- Without sugar, Bennett.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,742

Signals for you.

221
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,706
- Can you send the steward here?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,883
Dickson didn't make it, I'm afraid.

223
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,010
(soldier) Poor old Dickie.

224
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,850
It was all burned up when they reached it.

225
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,395
And so was Dickson. All burned up.

226
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,731
More port anyone? Uncle?

227
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,191
Yes, thank you.

228
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,569
What a pity.

229
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,071
- Why won't they give us parachutes?
- (all laughing)

230
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,407
Because we'd all be leaping out.

231
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:54,077
The sky would be absolutely littered
with shiny little bits of silk.

232
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,913
Yes, I'm afraid they don't have
an awful lot of faith at GHQ.

233
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,626
Rather than save experienced pilots
by giving them parachutes,

234
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,754
they prefer sending school boys
with 15 hours flying.

235
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,591
I suppose they think it looks better.

236
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,634
All those little burning aeroplanes.

237
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,929
Fine minds they have at GHQ.

238
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
(all) GHQ.

239
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,603
- About tomorrow, Croft.
- (Croft) Yes, sir?

240
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,855
Crawford and I will be taking you up
for a look around.

241
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,191
You want to get all the hours you can.

242
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,859
I suggest you get an early night.

243
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,862
Right. (clears throat)

244
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:30,780
(all humming)

245
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,412
- (Croft) Thank you, sir. Good night.
- (soldier) Good night.

<i>(Gresham) Crawford and I will be</i>

God, let me go home!

259
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,465
Croft won't let you down, you know.

260
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,810
All these months he's wanted
to be out here with me.

261
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,313
Well, he's in for a few surprises.

262
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,231
Oh, come on, come on. (chuckles)

263
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,818
I don't think he'll be disappointed.

264
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,403
Oh, no?

265
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,322
And what do you think he'll be
writing in his letters

266
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,073
- to Katherine about me?
- Oh.

267
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,826
That I look twice my age
and get drunk every night.

268
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,588
Look here.

269
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,592
Wouldn't you rather I went up with him?

270
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,511
Don't forget, I'm the House Captain.

271
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,475
- Good morning.
- (Sinclair) Good morning.

272
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,436
- All ready? Raring to go?
- Ready.

273
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,023
Before I left, Katherine gave me this
to give to you.

274
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,902
Thank you.

275
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,780
See if you can find Crawford, will you?

276
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,672
(Croft) Crawford, are you ready?

277
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,010
- Crawford.
- Get out!

278
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,845
- But Gresham says...
- This is my room!

279
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,348
I'm sorry.

280
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,809
- (door shuts)
- Go and tell Sir

281
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,936
that Crawford's in a frightful funk.

282
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,231
You kill some Huns for me.

283
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:57,987
(Croft panting)

284
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,031
He doesn't seem to want to come.

285
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,040
- Cup of tea, sir?
- Uh, no, thank you, Bennett.

286
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,917
Uh, give Mr Thompson my compliments

287
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,128
and ask him if he'll be kind enough
to join this patrol?

288
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,088
Yes, sir.

289
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,090
- Uh, Bennett.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,342
- With my apology.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,054
(knocking on door)

292
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,598
Yes.

293
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:28,935
What is it, Crawford?

294
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,230
(indistinct talk outside)

295
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,984
I can't go up this morning, Gresham.
It's this neuralgia.

296
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,611
We're waiting for you.
The planes are being armed.

297
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,031
I can't see half the time. It's right in my eye.

298
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,742
It's very useful, this neuralgia.

299
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,911
It can't be diagnosed, I understand.

300
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,372
I've got to see the MO.

301
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,332
I'm no use to you here.

302
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,168
- I'll go this morning.
- No, you won't.

303
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,713
- But I've got to.
- You're not going to. That's an order.

304
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,839
All right?

305
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,385
(door shuts)

306
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,681
Now, Joyce, what about those
fishtail clips for number one?

307
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,641
Not arrived yet, sir.

308
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,019
- Well, chase them up. Will you?
- Yes, sir.

309
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,793
Well, you can't go up alone, Uncle.

310
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,801
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thank you. See you later.

311
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,017
- Contact.
- Contact.

312
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,937
(aeroplane engine starts)

313
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,857
Keep close to me all the time.

314
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,693
When you get to 6,000 feet, test your guns.

315
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,696
And don't try anything fancy. Understand?

316
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,176
CMD!

317
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,597
- Contact.
- Contact.

318
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,058
(aeroplane engine starts)

319
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,978
- Shaky.
- Yeah, they're getting worse.

320
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,813
Very shaky, I thought.

321
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,153
Poor sod.

322
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,669
(firing machine gun)

323
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,129
(explosions)

324
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,047
(firing machine guns)

325
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,604
(engine sputtering)

326
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,349
(plane approaching)

327
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,861
(Man) Details two and three, stand by.

328
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,904
Come on, get on with it.

329
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,119
- Got one of them on the ground.
- (Sinclair laughs)

330
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,788
Got my very own Hun, on the ground.

331
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,377
Well, get the lorry. We'll go and pick him up.

332
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,379
Whoo!

333
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,467
- Croft's not back yet.
- I must have knocked his engine out.

334
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,969
He was standing there as bold as brass.

335
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,639
Thank you.

336
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,808
Oh, come on, let's go and pick him up.
Before they cart him off.

337
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,643
- It's in the French sector.
- What about Croft?

338
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:58,564
Better phone brigade and tell them to
send over that French liaison bloke.

339
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,483
Otherwise, we'll be all night.

340
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,197
We'll wait for Croft.

341
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,033
When he comes,
he can help me collect my Hun.

342
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:13,662
And number three wants more.

343
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,289
Yes, sir.

344
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,917
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.

345
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,997
- (indistinct shouting)
- (distant explosions)

346
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,501
- Get it moving. Pull him up. Come on!
- (soldiers grunting)

347
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,878
Come on, harder!
You can do better than that.

348
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,923
Come on, now.

349
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,968
(horse whinnying)

350
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,741
- Morning.
- Morning.

351
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,995
Bit lost.
Do you know the way to Saint Urbain?

352
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:40,207
Saint Urbain?
Yes, that's 20 miles to the southwest.

353
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:44,253
Right. I'll need to turn around.

354
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,839
- Could you, um...
- Four men over here!

355
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,591
(distant explosions)

356
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:55,598
- Turn this aircraft around, Corporal.
- (Soldier) Yes, sir.

357
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,893
Thank you very much.

358
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,572
- (Croft) Contact.
- (Soldier) Good luck.

359
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:13,365
(aeroplane engine starting)

360
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:32,009
Right. Come on, you men.

361
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,139
(aeroplane approaching)

362
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:58,702
(birds squawking)

363
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,092
Dreadful landing.

364
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,845
I did it much better in a field just now.

365
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,805
- Over there, somewhere.
- (Sinclair laughs)

366
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:01,765
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.

367
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:05,060
Hey!

368
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,812
Good one.

369
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:12,109
- Thanks, Gresham. That was tremendous.
- Tremendous?

370
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,069
Was it? What was so tremendous?

371
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:16,613
The Hun. The way you sent him packing.

372
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:21,035
Tremendous? Well, where have you been?

373
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:23,871
I'm afraid I got lost.
I dropped down and asked a battery.

374
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,833
You asked a battery?

375
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,378
- And you didn't tell them to contact us?
- I didn't think.

376
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,672
We were almost certain that
you were missing.

377
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:36,216
And all the time
you were chatting with a battery?

378
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,677
- I am sorry. I had no idea.
- No!

379
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,180
No idea.

380
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,809
Go on, report your damage.

381
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:50,773
Croft.

382
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,488
When you've done that,
get out of those things. I'll buy you a drink.

383
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,326
You know, you show too much.

384
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:12,002
- Yes, I know.
- (door shuts)

385
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,505
(distant explosions)

386
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:19,885
Thank you for bringing me, sir.

387
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:43,575
(horse whinnying)

388
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,334
(soldier speaking French)

389
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,367
(speaking French)

390
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:45,387
(speaking French)

391
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,313
- He's gone.
- Gone?

392
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,523
But he's my Hun. He belongs to me.

393
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,984
He can't just disappear.

394
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:00,652
(speaking French)

395
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,866
He's my prisoner for <i>vingt quatre heures.</i>
24 hours, tell him.

396
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,075
Can you explain that?

397
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,455
For 24... <i>Vingt quatre heures!</i>

398
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:14,500
My prisoner.

399
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,752
(speaking French)

400
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:20,881
I shot him down. Tell him.

401
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,966
People are dying here.
They can't play games with prisoners.

402
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,093
You can't have him. He's a prisoner of war.

403
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:27,095
(speaking French)

404
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:31,475
<i>C'est</i> unwritten law. Unwritten law.
Can you explain?

405
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,935
(speaking French)

406
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,021
He doesn't understand, this idiot.

407
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,107
It's an unwritten law.
We get our prisoners for 24 hours.

408
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,443
(speaking French)

409

When you fall,
we will give you a send-off, too. (laughs)

432
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,460
Wait till you fall.

433
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,967
(distant explosions)

434
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:39,014
That's two points for a cannon, I think.

435
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:42,517
- A pretty big barrage going down.
- Well, might as well get used to it.

436
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:44,519
Probably last a week.

437
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:48,482
Oh, damn.

438
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,361
Good try.

439
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:59,034
I don't think you've quite, uh,
mastered the subtleties of this

440
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,036
particular table.

441
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,541
Good shot, Uncle.

442
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,628
Excuse me.

443
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,214
I wondered, what does one do with
letters around here?

444
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:15,300
- Letters for home?
- Yes. Just boring gossip.

445
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,677
- Stick them on the table over there.
- Thank you.

446
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:22,057
- Open.
- Open?

447
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,392
Yes, I have to censor letters.

448
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:25,685
(Croft) Oh.

449
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:29,147
Well, I didn't realise that.
I think I'll just leave it.

450
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,650
- Give me the letter. Give me the letter.
- But it's...

451
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,568
- It's private.
- Don't you understand an order?

452
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,822
- John.
- Don't you John me. Give me the letter.

453
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,915
And go and practise some map reading.

454
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,585
Then maybe you won't have to ask
the artillery to show you the way home.

455
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:05,100
- My go, isn't it?
- No, it's mine.

456
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:13,817
I don't want to read the bloody thing.

457
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,251
Shall I read it?

458
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,880
Do what you like.

459
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,354
Do you want to hear this?

460
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:58,445
"We flew from England,
I'm not allowed to say exactly where.

'Report to 76 Squadron.'

- What about the dent?
- It's high ground, surely.

00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,469
How deep is it there? What's there?
Does anyone know?

477
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,471
Oh, we've had patrols,
but they had to turn back.

478
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,224
- Is it concrete? Is it pill boxes?
- Most certainly.

479
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:12,602
We must have a photograph.
Where is the photograph?

480
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:16,272
There isn't one, sir. Not for that bit there.

481
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:19,025
If the barrage hasn't smashed it,
we could get stuck there.

482
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:20,151
Of course.

483
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:22,904
- The whole thing could stop.
- Could lose a brigade.

484
00:55:22,988 --> 00:55:25,156
Whole thing could stop.

485
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:29,077
I'm sorry, but we must have a photograph.

486
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,455
Difficult job, sir.
During a barrage, very tricky.

487
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:35,000
Of course, it's difficult.
Everything is difficult.

488
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,961
- Yes, sir. But during a barrage...
- So it's a barrage.

489
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,921
It's a barrage!

490
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:43,133
I cannot stop the barrage.
I'm sorry, but I really can't.

491
00:55:43,216 --> 00:55:44,592
Impossible.

492
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:47,053
If we lose a plane, what's that? Two men.

493
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,973
But if we go charging in there
with all that concrete still intact,

494
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:53,393
we could lose a couple of thousand men,
possibly an entire brigade.

495
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,770
- The advance would break up.
- Absolutely.

496
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:58,189
I'm sorry, but there's no option.

497
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:00,859
Yes.

498
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:03,528
- All right. Soon, please.
- Right, sir.

499
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,407
- (distant explosions)
- (birds chirping)

500
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,719
Terrific bike. Thank you.

501
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:29,679
Thank you!

502
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:34,601
I was going to get rid of it.
My wife can't stand the thing.

503
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,811
- But then the war broke out.
- (both laughing)

504
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,897
Stroke of luck, really.

505
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:44,861
(distant explosions)

506
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,078
They say, you can hear the guns in England.

507
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,789
Oh, you can. Where I live.

508
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:00,210
Mind you, that's in the south.

509
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,378
Oh, really? Where?

510
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:07,425
New Forest near Brockenhurst.

511
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,969
- That's incredible.
- Is it?

512
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:13,932
Well, that's where we live.
Not Brockenhurst but not far, Lyndhurst.

513
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:15,266
Oh?

514
00:57:27,237 --> 00:57:29,739
(whispering) Do you fish?
Come and have a look at this.

515
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:40,375
- Don't get them like that in Hampshire.
- (both chuckling)

516
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:16,035
We should be getting back, I suppose.

517
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,079
(exhales)

518
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,170
Mmm?

519
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:31,593
When the offensive starts...

520
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,928
We'll be in the thick of it.

521
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,978
Major Gresham would like to
see you in the office, sir.

522
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:25,939
Thank you, Bennett.

523
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,322
- What's the idea?
- You knock at the door, Crawford.

524
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,574
Are you spying on me?

525
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:39,786
Sit down. Sit down!

526
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,419
- Where were you going?
- It's my car, isn't it?

527
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:51,005
Just answer the question.

528
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:54,175
- To see a doctor.
- And what's wrong with the doctor here?

529
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,346
Gresham, I'm going home.

530
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,182
I've had enough and I'm going home.

531
01:00:02,809 --> 01:00:04,686
That's all there is to it. I'm sorry.

532
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:07,438
There you are. I'm ill.

533
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:09,524
And I'm going home.

534
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:13,194
- You're staying with us.
- I'm sorry, but I'm on my way.

535
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,446
He'll send you straight back here.

536
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,532
I've been in touch with base, Crawford.

537
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,118
They know all about your complaint.

538
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,541
You've got to let me go.

539
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,876
I can't stand it here.

540
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,211
Please, Gresham.

541
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,505
Gresham, please.

542
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:36,009
Let me go.

543
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,053
If you go out of here,

544
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:42,223
I'll have you court-martialled
and shot for desertion.

545
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,225
Do you understand that, Crawford?

546
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,395
I'll have you shot.

547
01:01:01,034 --> 01:01:02,076
Sit down.

548
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:22,472
I know exactly how you feel.

549
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:29,228
- You do?
- Yes, exactly.

550
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:33,399
Empty. Great vacuum of fear.

551
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:37,278
I'm scared stiff, too, you know, Crawford.

552
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:43,534
Well, if you know
why the hell don't you let me go?

553
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:46,329
If you know what real fear is...

554
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,916
Then for Christ's sake, let me out of it.

555
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,585
And what would happen then?

556
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,797
If everybody just went home,
what would happen?

557
01:01:56,464 --> 01:02:00,760
It's their choice. Those who want to die, die.

558
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,430
And those who want to go home, go home.

559
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:07,600
Stick it out with us, Crawford.

560
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:11,354
I've every intention of coming through this
and so should you.

561
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,444
And I promise, this will go no further.

562
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:24,450
Meet me in the mess in five minutes.

563
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:52,520
Major Gresham sends his apology, sir,
and regrets he won't be joining you.

564
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:09,829
- This is a new thing, is it?
- They're called strategic planning lunches.

565
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,373
They're all the rage.

566
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,916
Driver.

567
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:20,256
There's no doubt in my mind
that she's Lloyd George's mistress.

568
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:22,884
I have it on impeccable authority.

569
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:26,512
How else do you explain his promotion?

570
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:29,474
There's a special office in Whitehall
like a bedroom.

571
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:32,727
- Rubbish.
- I have it on impeccable authority.

572
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:35,146
Mmm, feasible.

573
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:37,064
Just got to have it, I mean. (chuckles)

574
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,775
Some people have to have it
every few hours. Feasible.

575
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:43,112
- I've heard of this complaint.
- Not a complaint. Just a fact.

576
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,405
Not a complaint.

577
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,366
So next to the cabinet room,
there is this bedroom.

578
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,535
Correct. With a private entrance.

579
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:51,579
- (all laugh)
- Oh, a private entrance now!

580
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,581
Correct.

581
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:55,124
(knocking on door)

582
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:06,469
Correct. With a private entrance.

583
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:11,724
Where ladies make themselves available
every single afternoon.

584
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,935
- Correct?
- There's a rota.

585
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,728
(man) Oh, the extravagance!

586
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:18,397
I have it on authority.

587
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:22,068
I'm sure we're all
very interested to know, Silkin,

588
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:24,654
exactly what this authority is.

589
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:28,616
Aren't we?

590
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,494
Agog.

591
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:34,539
I'm afraid I can't reveal my sources.

592
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:36,707
Oh.

593
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,796
It was a lady. I can't go any further.

594
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:46,509
Has this lady, by any chance,
glimpsed inside of the love chamber?

595
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,719
Is she on the rota, Silkin?

596
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,722
- Come on. Spill the beans.
- Out with it, man.

597
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:53,266
Produce your evidence.

598
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,017
Truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

599
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,023
It's my wife.

600
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:12,827
Don't get up.

601
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,913
- Everything all right?
- Yes, sir.

602
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:18,583
- Good.
- There is one thing, sir.

603
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,003
- Well, fire away.
- My report, sir.

604
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:25,047
- Your report?
- About the need for parachutes.

605
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:28,801
Parachutes.
Oh, didn't we get something back on that?

606
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:33,180
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Yes, possession of parachutes. What was it?

607
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:35,766
- Might impair a pilot's nerve, sir.
- Oh, that's right.

608
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,853
When in difficulties
might impair a pilot's nerve.

609
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:42,106
It's a good phrase that.
Sorry, but there you are.

610
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,066
Sit down.

611
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:47,528

01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,060
They're even louder tonight.

635
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:46,397
Yes, it's their final effort.

636
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,984
The offensive begins in three days.

637
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,611
- We'll be busy then.
- Yes.

638
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:58,367
Only, they want some pictures first.

639
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,996
- And that's where I come in, is it?
- Yes.

640
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,207
I'm awfully sorry, Uncle.

641
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:08,002
- Someone has to do it.
- Yes.

642
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:11,130
They asked specially for you.

643
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,757
I'm flattered. (laughs)

644
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:19,555
- The barrage won't be lifted, I'm afraid.
- Oh, good heavens, no.

645
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:22,308
It stinks, doesn't it?

646
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:23,768
Oh.

647
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:28,314
I'll send Roberts and Wade to cover you.
They're good chaps.

648
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,400
Who would you like as your driver?

649
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,613
What about Croft?

650
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,075
Croft?

651
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,954
He only has to fly in a straight line.

652
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:45,790
Yes, that's all.

653
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,625
(indistinct singing)

654
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,335
Why not Croft?

655
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,713
He has to take his chance,
like everybody else.

656
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:54,965
All right, take Croft.

657
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:11,774
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

658
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:16,946
Got a couple of chaps on top,
keeping an eye on us.

659
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:19,490
- Shouldn't take too long.
- No. Quite.

660
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,117
(grunts)

661
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:28,707
(Croft) It's just the hanging around.

662
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:33,420
- Well, I think I'll go...
- I'm glad...

663
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,422
I'm sorry. After you.

664
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:38,050
I was just going to say

665
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,135
I'm glad I'm with you.

666
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:42,596
Me too.

667
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:48,519
Oh, Gresham should be here soon.
It's almost time.

668
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:49,937
OK, sir?

669
01:09:50,563 --> 01:09:53,566
I hope you won't miss lunch, sir.
I've wangled two dozen lamb chops.

670
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,776
I have every intention
of being back for elevenses.

671
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,778
I'll see what I can do, sir.

672
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,532
I think we should be going,
don't you, Uncle?

673
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,201
Yes. I suppose we should.

674
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:11,917
Remember what I said. Keep above 200 feet.
Don't make a song and dance of it.

675
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:14,128
I won't.

676
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:31,061
- (Croft) Contact.
- (Man) Contact.

677
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:33,147
(aeroplane engine starting)

678
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,961
(distant explosions)

679
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,738

680
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:41,734

(knocking on door)

683
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:05,711
Oh, sorry, sir.

684
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:09,923
The recce's back, sir.

685
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:15,387
Thank you, Bennett. Thank you.

686
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,551
Christ! Uncle, we're alive.

687
01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:02,559
Gresham, you never saw anything like it.

688
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:04,394
They must have felt sorry for us.

689
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:07,314
We were sitting ducks. They just...
(imitates aeroplane passing by)

690
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,983
I never want to be that close again.

691
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:04,496
Stephen.

692
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,185
(all shouting)

693
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,234
Leave them alone.
They'll be up on the screen in a minute.

694
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:38,447
♪ Why are we waiting? Why are we waiting?

695
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,991
(Man) Get your hands off, will you? Come on.

696
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:43,660
♪ Why are we waiting?

697
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:46,496
(Man) Put them down.
You'll get your grubby thumbs all over them.

698
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,540
(Man 2) Oh, look at this one. Look, look!

(men laughing)

700
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,754
- Anything more to eat, sir?
- No.

701
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:58,508
- Mr Croft isn't here yet, Bennett.
- I know, sir. I did look in his room, sir.

702
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:00,886
Lights, Bennett. Lights.

703
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:04,556
- He didn't say he wouldn't be here, did he?
- No, sir.

704
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,767
Go and find him and tell me where he is.

705
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:09,186
- Lights, Bennett.
- (Bennett) I'll put them out, sir.

706
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:11,313
Thompson, are you sitting in the stalls?

707
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:13,815
I'll sit where I like. I shan't be moved.

(Man) Boo.

(all cheering)

713
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:28,121
- Why is that lady standing...
- Bottoms up!

714
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:32,459
- What are you doing with your fingers?
- My hands are shaking.

715
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:33,794
Right.

716
01:18:33,919 --> 01:18:34,961
(all cheering)

717
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:38,006
- Ship ahoy, my lovely.
- (Man) What a big pussy!

718
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:39,424
(soldier) Fair game, I'd say.

719
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:41,802
Give me the lion's share of that one.

720
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,430
- Tommy, don't go into a spin.
- Next.

721
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,141
Cheeky!

722
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:50,477
(soldier) Let's see what she's like in the front.

723
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,312
Turn her around.

724
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:55,315
- Well?
- No. It's the same this side.

725
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,483
(all groan)

726
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:10,705
Where you spending your leave, Albert?
Leeds?

727
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,500
- Where else?
- Halifax.

728
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,128
Funny!

729
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:21,299
I've never been to Leeds.

730
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:26,638
- Well, you wouldn't like Leeds.
- Why not?

731
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:30,475
- A dirty place is Leeds.
- Muck hole.

732
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:34,020
Aye. Clean muck right up to here.

733
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:39,401
Been to Venice, Paris, Heidelberg.

734
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:43,363
Never Leeds. I don't know why.

735
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:45,657
- Peckham?
- Where?

736
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:47,701
Peckham.

737
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:51,538
- No, can't say I have.
- Oh, that's funny.

738
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:54,458
- I'd have thought you would have.
- Why exactly?

739
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,042
He's pulling your leg, sir.

740
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:57,252
Oh.

741
01:19:58,378 --> 01:19:59,880
Good one.

742
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:13,894
Fancy a sandwich?

743
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:17,522
- Go on.
- It won't bite.

744
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,066
Thank you.

745
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:29,409
Now for your delight and delectation,

746
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:31,411
I give you that.

747
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:32,746
(all) Ooh!

748
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,832
We're getting fussy, William.

749
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:38,418
More your style really, Tommy.
What I'd call udderish.

750
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:42,589
- I wouldn't say no.
- (Man) You never do.

751
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:44,841
- About Mr Croft, sir.
- Yes?

752
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:48,386
- Apparently, he's in the hangar, sir.
- Thank you, Bennett.

753
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,763
(men whistling)

754
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:52,641
(all cheering)

755
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,614
Is Mr Croft here with you?

756
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:14,162
Did you hear me?
I said do you know where Mr Croft is?

757
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:15,705
Yes, sir.

758
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:28,134
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

759
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:29,928
- Nothing?
- Well, I was just talking...

760
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:31,846
You missed dinner.

761
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:35,392
- Corporal Eliot gave me some.
- Corporal Eliot?

762
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,019
Since when have you been dining
with Corporal Eliot?

763
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,314
- He offered me a sandwich, I...
- Wait outside.

764
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:45,026
Don't finish that. Wait outside.

765
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,045
Thank you, sir.

766
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,679
You make a fool of yourself, being with them.
They laugh at you.

767
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,723
You insult your fellow officers
by avoiding them.

768
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:16,725
Sorry I came here, John.
I've obviously offended you.

769
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,853
Only when you humiliate yourself.

770
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,355
- Now clean up and join us in the mess.
- I can't.

771
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,859
I can't sit there.
How can I when Sinclair is dead?

772
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:32,240
My God. You superior little bastard!

773
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:36,453
You really do believe
you're the only one who cares, don't you?

774
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:37,829
Well, I resent that.

775
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:42,042
I can't tell you how much I resent that,
you prig.

776
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:48,465
He wasn't my House Captain.
He was my friend.

777
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:56,306
That's a very good idea.

778
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:59,142
Oh, Crawford offered to run us into Amiens
for the night. What do you say?

779
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:00,268
(Crawford) But I can't take everybody.

780
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:01,728
(soldier) Nobody's asking you
to take everybody.

781
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,272
- Yes. Yes, let's go to Amiens.
- (soldier) Right.

782
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:05,565
(all talking at once)

783
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:07,192
It's only a five-seater.

784
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:10,236
One thing. Croft will be joining us.

785
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:13,657
All right.

786
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,408
- Full house then.
- (all laugh)

787
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,286
(indistinct singing)

788
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:22,123
(car honking)

789
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,169
(men shouting)

790
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,254
Come on, Crofty!

791
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,256
(men cheering)

792
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:34,803
- Right.
- Come on. Get in there.

793
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:37,263
Come on, get your priorities right.

794
01:23:37,347 --> 01:23:38,932
CO first.

795
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:41,142
(men laughing)

796
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,686
Dive in!

797
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:44,312
(indistinct talk)

798
01:23:45,772 --> 01:23:47,607
There's a table.

799
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,484
(indistinct talk)

800
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,153
(woman singing)

801
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,288
Say <i>bonsoir</i> to the lady.

802
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:14,634
Guys, quality has taken
a bit of a dive this year?

803
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:16,261
(all cheering)

804
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:20,306
Well, chaps, here's to a jolly party.

805
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:21,599
(all cheering)

806
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:23,226
Drink your booze properly.

807
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:25,437
<i>- Santé.</i>
- (men): <i>Santé!</i>

808
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,441
(woman singing)

809
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,571
(all humming along)

810
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:45,540
I have a premonition.

811
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,710
I have a premonition
that Wade here is gonna be sick.

812
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:50,295
Aren't you, Wade?

813
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:51,921
It is distinctly possible.

814
01:24:52,005 --> 01:24:54,340
It is distinctly possible that I may be sick.

815
01:25:13,276 --> 01:25:16,696
- Bravo!
- (Man) Bravo!

816
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:17,864
(all applauding)

817
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:32,587
Hey, she's giving me the eye, that one.

818
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:38,760
I don't want any of them.
I'm waiting for my blonde.

819
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:41,638
She's in hospital.

820
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,766
(Crawford) Oh, no, she isn't.
I saw her half an hour ago.

821
01:25:45,225 --> 01:25:48,895
She must have discharged herself
knowing that you were here.

822
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:50,396
(all laugh)

823
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:54,400
Now, which one should we choose for Croft?

824
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:55,527
Ah.

825
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,904
Choose one, son.

826
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:03,034
I'll bring him back a recommendation.

827
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,328
I'm going on a little trip.

828
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:09,082
Do my duty by the little fellow.

829
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,752
As a reward for so much patience.

830
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:15,505
Well, go on then. Get on with it.
Talking about it doesn't count.

831
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:17,590
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
- Good luck.

832
01:26:17,674 --> 01:26:20,885
Tell us, Croft, laddy, when you had it, last?

833
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:23,096
Yes, come on, Croft.

834
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:26,933
Now speak. Speak, Crofty.

835
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,435
When was your wick last dipped?

836
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,563
As old Shakespeare says.

837
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:33,857
Yes, we shan't tell.

838
01:26:33,982 --> 01:26:39,279
Despite what mummy said to you
it was not made for pissing through. (laughs)

839
01:26:39,404 --> 01:26:40,446
(all laugh)

840
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:56,379
(Wade) Champagne!

841
01:26:57,005 --> 01:27:00,216
(Gresham) Ah, I do believe
Wade has got a little present.

842
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:01,968
Not bad.

843
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:05,221
Mmm, I won't have to force myself.

844
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:07,515
(indistinct talk)

845
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:12,729
(women giggling)

846
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:29,954
- Are you well?
- I'm very well. Very well.

847
01:27:30,538 --> 01:27:31,956
(indistinct talk)

848
01:27:47,555 --> 01:27:49,223
<i>Vive la France!</i>

849
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,142
<i>- Vive la France!</i>
<i>- Vive la France!</i>

850
01:27:52,352 --> 01:27:53,436
<i>Vive la France!</i>

851
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,482
- (speaking French)
- (all cheering)

852
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:09,410
He is <i>tout seul</i>. He has nobody.

853
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,162
(all groan)

854
01:28:13,623 --> 01:28:15,291
Poor Crofty.

855
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:19,045
I look after you?

856
01:28:20,713 --> 01:28:21,756
(all cheering)

857
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:31,599
Crofty, I think you might be lucky.

858
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:34,352
She is not his girl, that officer.

859
01:28:34,811 --> 01:28:37,021
She belongs to his friend who is in Paris.

860
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:40,024
This man is her chaperone.

861
01:28:40,108 --> 01:28:41,985
<i>Comprendre?</i> Understand?

862
01:28:42,068 --> 01:28:43,194
Yes, I think we do.

863
01:28:43,653 --> 01:28:45,363
She is also bored.

864
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,616
When she goes, you go after her... Behind.

865
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,496
Fine. Fine.

866
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:54,956
(Crawford) Crofty!

867
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:09,262
♪ Keep the home-fires burning

868
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:13,891
♪ While your hearts are yearning

869
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:18,187
♪ Though your lads are far away

870
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:22,150
♪ They dream of home

871
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:26,821
♪ There's a silver lining

872
01:29:27,155 --> 01:29:28,197
(laughs)

873
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:31,534
She go!

874
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:39,459
Crofty, off you go.

875
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:42,211
(all laughing)

876
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:49,385
Contact, old boy.

877
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:52,472
- Don't stall.
- Happy landing, Crofty.

878
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:27,256
Shh.

879
01:31:17,557 --> 01:31:19,225
(speaking French)

880
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:23,354
Eighteen?

881
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:25,982
I do not speak English very good. (laughs)

882
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:28,860
I never have no one in here.

883
01:31:30,153 --> 01:31:32,071
You should not be here.

884
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:36,075
It's very dangerous for you here.

885
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:46,419
I have this friend but he's
<i>très loin d'ici à Paris.</i>

886
01:31:58,181 --> 01:31:59,932
Do you want to stay?

887
01:32:01,184 --> 01:32:02,226
Yes.

888
01:32:07,857 --> 01:32:08,900
(laughs)

889
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,196
Oh! You're a pilot!

890
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:19,535
<i>- J'adore les pilotes!</i>
- Yes?

891
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:27,793
You're very <i>très beau, tu sais.</i>

892
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,219
(speaking French)

893
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:02,912
- Is Paisley in, Roberts?
- No, sir. Not yet, sir.

894
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:05,289
- I want everyone in the mess.
- Yes, sir.

895
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:10,670
- Care to inspect the menu, sir?
- Not now, Bennett.

896
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,339
Well, can I take it as all right, sir?

897
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,842
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

898
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:23,015
I'm afraid we've got a rotten job.

899
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,684
Or a wonderful job,

900
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:26,686
- according to your point of view.
- (door opens)

901
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:32,275
Sorry, sir.

902
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:38,197
The offensive is bogged down,
particularly in our sector.

903
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:39,949
And the reason that we're told is that

904
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:42,618
their artillery is knocking out
our communications.

905
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:44,287
And the reason that they can do this

906
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:46,789
is because they've got balloons
spotting for them.

907
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:48,624
So the balloons have got to come down.

908
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:51,877
Now some of you have
had a go at balloons before.

909
01:33:52,003 --> 01:33:54,880
In which case, you'll know
at least two things about them.

910
01:33:55,006 --> 01:33:58,134
The moment that we appear,
they winch them down. That's one.

911
01:33:58,217 --> 01:34:02,305
The other, well, they're murder to get near.

912
01:34:02,388 --> 01:34:05,308
There's nearly always
a regiment of Archie on the ground

913
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:08,144
and two or three patrols up above.

914
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:11,981
So we'll split ourselves into attackers
who'll be armed with tracer,

915
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:14,233
and defenders who'll deal with their scouts.

916
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,903
Now, the thing to remember about them
is not to get too near.

917
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:21,365
They have a nasty habit
of exploding in your face.

918
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:25,411
Right, attackers.
Thompson, Crawford and Croft.

919
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,205
Defenders, Wade, Frampton and myself.

920
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:30,207
We'll leave at first light.

921
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:33,586
(knocking on door)

922
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:35,921
Yes?

923
01:34:36,297 --> 01:34:37,757
(Croft) It's Croft.

924
01:34:38,758 --> 01:34:40,551
All right.

925
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:46,557
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- It's nothing.

926
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,643
I was wondering...

927
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:53,439
Do you want to go into town tonight?

928
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:57,568
I don't think we're allowed to.

929
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:59,153
Risk that?

930
01:35:02,782 --> 01:35:06,952
If I went into town, I wouldn't come back.

931
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:08,829
Ever.

932
01:35:09,246 --> 01:35:11,832
They'd have to shoot me.

933
01:35:11,957 --> 01:35:13,459
You see?

934
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,852
- (Croft) Wait for me!
- (soldier) Hold it, driver!

935
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:36,690
What, no transport tonight then, sir?

936
01:35:36,816 --> 01:35:38,109
- All right.
- Come on, sir.

937
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:40,152
- Away you go!
- In you get!

938
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:50,329
- (knocking on door)
- Can I come in?

939
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:51,497
Yes.

940
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:55,000
I'm buying drinks in the mess.
Would you care to join us?

941
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:57,044
I don't...

942
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:58,838
I don't think so.

943
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:00,673
I'd like you to.

944
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:04,885
You'd like me to, but I won't.

945
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:14,353
- (indistinct talk)
- (woman singing)

946
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,605
Contact!

947
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:03,068
(imitates aeroplane flying)

948
01:37:41,774 --> 01:37:43,275
- He's out of it.
- Shh.

949
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:49,823
Crawford!

950
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,870
Crawford!

951
01:38:00,209 --> 01:38:01,293
(sobbing)

952
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:13,222
Go and put him to bed.

953
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:16,350
Don't tell anyone.

954
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:23,816
- (truck approaching)
- (man singing indistinctly)

955
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:26,819
(indistinct talk)

956
01:38:26,902 --> 01:38:29,405
- (Man) Good night, sir!
- (Croft) Good night!

957
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,492
(Gresham) Enjoy yourself, Stephen?

958
01:38:33,993 --> 01:38:36,328
Yes. Thank you.

959
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:39,415
Fine.

960
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,625
Have a good night's sleep.

961
01:38:41,709 --> 01:38:42,918
Yes.

962
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:45,421
Right.

963
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:48,048
Stephen.

964
01:38:48,674 --> 01:38:51,844
Crawford won't be with us tomorrow,
I'm afraid.

965
01:39:07,693 --> 01:39:09,194

(man whistling)

967
01:39:28,255 --> 01:39:32,760
At this very moment,
those balloons are going up, up, up.

968
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:35,763
And in another hour,
they'll be going down, down, down.

969
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:37,389
You hope. (laughs)

970
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:40,893
(Gresham) Thank you, Bennett.

971
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:45,939
- You're a defender?
- That's right.

972
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:48,901
We'll be safe as houses then.

973
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:52,613
Off you go.

974
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:56,992
Stay close to Tommy.

975
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:59,495
Do what he does, then get away.

976
01:39:59,578 --> 01:40:01,121
Jolly good.

977
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:04,583
Bennett!

978
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:07,920
- Yes, sir.
- Breakfast at 9:00.

979
01:40:08,003 --> 01:40:10,506
9:00 sharp, sir. On the nail.

980
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:17,471
How many for breakfast?

981
01:40:18,305 --> 01:40:19,431
Eh?

982
01:40:24,103 --> 01:40:25,646
Any of them?

Good afternoon.

Sir.

Welcome to 76.

Hours, you chump.

Oh. Fourteen, sir.

1003

Fourteen.

(Gresham) These windows are dirty.

1006
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:31,936
Yes, sir. I'll see to it, sir.

1007

- (Gresham) Does anyone play the piano?
- Oh, I do, sir.

1008
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:42,238
Good. That should liven the place up a bit.

Right. Well, off you go. Dump your stuff.
