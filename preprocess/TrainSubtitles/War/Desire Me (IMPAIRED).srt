00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,407
It's alright, doctor.

8
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,609
You can tell me, I'm not afraid.

9
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,248
Go on, I told you
I'm not afraid.

10
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,783
But you are afraid.

11
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,785
Afraid I'll tell you there's
nothing wrong with you.

12
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,753
However,
I'm not going to say that.

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,323
Because there is
a great deal wrong with you.

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,663
It's my heart, isn't it?

15
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,964
I know.

It-it pounds so that I can't
breathe sometimes.

17
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,870
There's nothing wrong
with your heart, organically.

18
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,507
You're sick,
but not in the way you think.

19
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:25,078
Don't try to soften it,
you see, I know.

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,380
I know that I'm going to die.

21
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,249
You know it because
you want to die.

22
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,651
You're willing yourself to die.

23
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,553
The physical examination
I made of you indicates

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,822
You are free from
bodily illness.

25
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,790
But you don't want to
accept that, do you?

26
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,260
You'd rather have me tell you
that your heart was feeling bad

27
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,394
That you were doomed

28
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,764
Than to tell you the truth.

29
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,267
- The truth?
- It's quite simple.

30
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,636
Something is making you
so desperately unhappy

31
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,572
That you'd die
rather than face it.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,677
Then you don't believe
that I feel pain?

33
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,848
Of course I believe it, that
pain is pretty real, to you.

34
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,583
Oh, yes, the pain is there.

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,017
But it's there only because
something has happened

36
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,886
In your life that you
are not able to bear.

37
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,389
You've tried to forget it
and you've failed.

38
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,124
The pain you feel is proof
of that failure.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,894
And so it becomes a pain
to hide behind.

40
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,365
And you want a doctor to tell
you that you are sick in body.

41
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,868
Because you can't face
the sickness of your soul.

42
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,671
But don't you see,
you'll get no release?

of pills or surgeon's knife

44

You'll find no answer there.

45

- Within yourself.

It'll not be easy.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,990
But I think it's the only
possible help for you

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,226
And for the man who loves you.

51
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,797
The only way I can help him
is by letting him forget me.

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,601
Our life together...

53
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,137

56

Not for either of us.

57
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,850
Because of me, I've tried
to be the way I was before.

but I can't.

for anyone.

When I first met Paul,
in those days I wasn't afraid.

When I get to the beach,
I'll look up.

And there will be our house.

162
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,911
Now, think,
as I always do

163

for a while

want to keep them out"

"If they're enemies,
why then... let them in."

there'd be nothing changed.

It'd been my mothers.

00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,982
She used to teach
the children of Kergat on it

She sent to Paris for it.

00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,623
It was comfortable.

199
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,826

There was a gas jet
that whistled.

about that but...

private pool.'

493
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:13,645
I found it the first summer
I was here.

494
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,747
But the-there's something
about it that I haven't

495
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,816
Told anyone before.

496
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,585
Not-not even Paul?

497
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,986
Not even Paul.

498
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,088
Why not?

499
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,890
I was afraid he might laugh.

500
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,592
At what?
Why?

501
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,295
I don't know whether
I should tell you or not.

502
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,097
I won't laugh.

503
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,032
Well, then...

504
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,934
It's a singing pool.

505
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,704
- Singing pool?
- Yes, and when it sings it...

506
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,139
It tells you things.

507
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,774
Wait and see.

508
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,075
You'll hear it.

509
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,278
If you listen long enough.

510
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,417
There, do you hear anything?

511
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,719
I hear the ocean and the wind.

512
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,721
Nothing more?

513
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,125
There.

514
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,361
There's a kind of music.

515
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,762
Yes.

516
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,764
That's what I mean.

517
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,502
Stronger now.

518
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,305
Shh.

519
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,606
It must be the play
of the wind

520
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,141
And the sound of the sea
through these rocks.

521
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,510
Yes, I expected
something like that.

522
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,513
Makes a kind of... hum.

523
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,250
Sometimes you hear it better
over there

524
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:27,018
And sometimes better here.

525
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,221
Now I know something
Paul didn't know.

526
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,858
Carrot top.

527
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,465
- Marise.
- Yes, Jean?

528
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,333
It's been a good day,
hasn't it?

529
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,001
We've had a good day together.

530
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,203
A fine day.

531
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,940
- I've been almost...
- Happy?

532
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,978
It's been... easier.

533
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,980
Has it, Marise?

534
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,984
Is that wrong?

535
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,919
Tell me.

536
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,288
Is it wrong?

537
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,490
Do you feel that it is?

538
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,827
I don't know, Jean.

539
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,829
I don't know.

540
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,700
[Instrumental music]

541
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,642
There.

542
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,544
Now just try
and tell that those aren't

543
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,145
The best shrimps
you ever tasted.

544
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,781
Ah. It brings Mormant
right back to me.

545
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,451
Mormant or Montparnasse?

546
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,253
All of Paris.

547
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,123
You know, Jean?

548
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,058
It's no fun to cook when...

549
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,727
When you're alone?

550
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,529
Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,230
I'll tell you another thing.

552
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,800
You don't care much about eating
either when you're worried, so...

553
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,302
You don't cook,
you don't eat...

554
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,504
You don't live.

555
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:58,477
- Well...
- That was what you meant.

556
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,679
You're not eating.
Here.

557
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,049
Look at me, Marise.

558
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,653
Now, uh, smile again.

559
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,689
With your eyes too.

560
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,891
You're eyes show
what's in your heart.

561
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,463
There, that's better.

562
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,599
Not good enough,
but better.

[Piano music]

No, Jean.
Not that one.

00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,492
You'll play it for me someday,
Marise.

570

Oh, Jean... oh, put me down.

00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,577
Okay, fine.

00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,979
Oh, put me down...

577
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,948
I had a wonderful day.

578
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,396
(Father Donnard)
'Good morning, Marise.'

579
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,931
Good morning.

580
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,507
Good morning, father.

581
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,245
This is Jean Renaud, father.

582
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,948
He was with Paul in prison camp.

583
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:53,952
Ah, so you've come because
you are Paul's friend.

584
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,186
Hardly, father.

585
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,422
So you knew Paul Aubert.

586
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,691
You were privileged, my son.

587
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,227
He was that rare a thing,
a man liked by everyone.

588
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,663
Rich and poor, wicked and pious.

589
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,633
He was also the best fisherman
in Kergat.

590
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,668
The good women of the town
were quite put out

591
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:13,104
When he brought Marise back
from Paris with him.

592
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,174
Hey, my child?

593
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,709
I see.

594
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,911
For once,
the fisherman was the catch.

595
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,651
Father, may we offer you
a glass of wine?

596
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,856
Please, will you sit down,
father?

597
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,225
Only for a moment.

598
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,229
This is a busy day for me.

599
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,330
And early tomorrow morning

600
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:40,599
I go to the neighboring villages

601
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43.168
'In Giles
for the pardons.'

602
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,536
The "pardons?"

603
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,872
That's what we call
these festivals here.

604
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,874
The people from all over
the countryside journey

605
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,843
Someone-for some by boat
to one of the shrines

606
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,378
To obtain the
intersession of a saint

607
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,081
And bring the blessing of God
into their households.

608
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:58,617
Oh, yes,
I've heard about the pardons.

609
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,085
And afterwards,
they drink a lot of wine

610
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,654
Dance all day
and make love all night.

611
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,357
I don't like
your implication, my son.

612
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:10,261
The church doesn't expect to
change human nature by ritual.

613
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,963
And what's more natural
than friends meeting

614
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,133
And enjoying themselves
after the services.

615
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,669
And making love?

616
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,738
Many couples
are honorably betrothed

617
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,506
At our religious festivals.

618
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,042
And that too
is natural and fitting.

619
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,914
I don't know your plans, but
if you're staying in Kergat

620
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,349
Can I help you
find a place to live?

621
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,252
I'm used to taking care of
myself, thank you, father.

622
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,159
Goodbye, my child.

623
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,094
I'll go a little way
with you, father.

624
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,963
Thank you, Marise.

625
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,670
Goodbye, father.

626
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:52,971
'Marise, wouldn't it be
more sensible'

627
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55.173

[Instrumental music]

629
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,191
I know why you're crying
even if you don't.

630
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,994
- It's because I'm so ashamed.
- Oh, no.

631
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,064
That's not it.

632
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,900
It's because he spoiled
something by coming here.

633
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,635
What did you mean
by acting as if I were...

634
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,871
Your wife,
as if this were your house?

635
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,338
You're trying to make him think
you had the right?

636
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,974
You would have been in my arms
if it hadn't been for him.

637
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,676
Don't say that,
don't think it or I'll...

638
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,177
Or you'll do what?

639
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,179
Tell me to go?

640
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:35,847
- I'm sorry, but...
- Of course you're sorry!

641
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,182
Women love to pity.

642
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,750
Especially men who'll fetch
and carry for them

643
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:39,918
And be tamed as a dog
about the house

644
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,319
But I don't want your pity,
thank you!

645
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,921
- You'll get no more of it.
- That's good!

646
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:45,356
- But before you go...
- Oh, I am to go, eh?

647
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,758
Of course.

648
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,396
Don't you think
you'll miss me, Marise?

649
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,032
Look at yourself. That's the
face of a woman who's alive.

650
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,868
You didn't look like that
the first night I saw you.

651
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,203
Even those tears in your eyes

652
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,505
Are happier
than the one I saw then.

653
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,674
What's made the change?

654

01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,395
Write? I did write as soon as
I could, from the hospital.

1139
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:16,165
- When?
- Two weeks ago.

1140
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:19,435
I had no letter.

1141
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:22,038
No word. Nothing.

1142
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:34,818
Are you in love
with this man, Marise?

1143
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,089
Love?

1144
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:45,061
With what was left of me,
I-I felt sorry for him.

1145
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:53,102
He seemed so lost,
and I was lonely.

1146
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,740
And me? What did
you feel for me?

1147
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:59,943
Paul, I love you.

1148
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,812
But with you gone,
what did anything matter?

1149
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,580
I stopped believing
you were alive

1150
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:07,016
And I promised to marry
another man.

1151
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,853
I'll go away from here now, it's
the only thing for me to do.

1152
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,555
No, you're my wife,
this is your home.

1153
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:17,260
No, not any longer.
Not mine.

1154
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:20,629
I haven't the right.

1155
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:26,269
Paul, Paul,
what'll I do?

1156
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:29,472
'What'll I do?'

1157
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,009
I used to wonder what I'd do
if a thing like this happened.

1158
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:35,211
I thought I'd want
to kill you.

1159
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:40,917
I don't.
Not you, Marise.

1160
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,355
I'd rather be dead,
than hurt you.

1161
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,793
Who is he, Marise?

1162
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:52,962
Tell me, who is it?

1163
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:56,132
No, Paul,
names don't matter.

1164
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,467
I think they do,
who is he?

1165
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:04,908
Renaud,
Jean Renaud.

1166
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:10,780
- How long has he been here?
- A week.

1167
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,982
Perhaps, a little longer.

1168
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,822
Maybe my letter did come.
Maybe Renaud stole it.

1169
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,260
You think Jean
would steal?

1170
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:25,895
He was a thief
and coward in camp

1171
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:28,031
Why shouldn't he be a thief
and coward here?

1172
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:31,835
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1173
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,503
Don't lie to me,
Marise.

1174
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,039
He's in Kergat,
isn't he?

1175
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,774
You wouldn't be so frightened
if he were out of my reach.

1176
01:19:38,842 --> 01:19:40,977
Well, there aren't many
places he can hide.

1177
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:44,713
Wait, Paul, let me go and see,
and let me send him away.

1178
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,615
Why don't you want
me to find him?

1179
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:47,817
Are you afraid for him?

1180
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:51,454
No, for you, Paul,
of what you might do.

1181
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,256
I'll ask him one
question, Marise.

1182
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,893
Just one. Did he know
that I was alive.

1183
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,030
Most people aren't strong like
you, Paul. Most of us are weak.

1184
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:04,901
I told you I couldn't send him
away, but you didn't ask me why.

1185
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,036
And that's important.

1186
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:10,039
He didn't seem
like a stranger.

1187
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:14,911
He seemed to belong here.
He knew about us, Paul.

1188
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:18,214
Things that only you
could've told him.

1189
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:20,816
If I told him
too much about you

1190
01:20:20,884 --> 01:20:22,986
It was only the way a man
might talk about his religion

1191
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:25,188
To another who had none.

1192
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:34,330
You shared our life
with him, Paul.

1193
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:38,734
You shared me.

1194
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:40,269
He was only coming
back to something

1195
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,471
That he believed
was his own.

1196
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,773
You can't kill a man
for believing what's wrong

1197
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,877
When you yourself
taught him to believe it.

1198
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:51,981
Give him a chance.
He is in Kergat.

1199
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:55,118
He'll come here.
Give him a chance.

1200
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:08,965
Alright, when he comes,
I'll ask him one question.

1201
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,168
Just one.

You can either learn and grow

so deformed by life.

That what he did was part
