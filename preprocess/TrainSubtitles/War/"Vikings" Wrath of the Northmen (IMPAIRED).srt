Earl Haraldson:
We will raid east again.

5
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,115
Every year we go
to the same places,

6
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,550
but there is an alternative.

7
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,951
They're my ships

8
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,186
and they go where
I tell them to go.

9
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:15,254
That's the end of the matter.

10

<i>Ragnar: We should sail west.</i>

11
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:18,324
Can't sail across
an open ocean.

12
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:21,194
I have something
that will change everything.

13
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,628
Earl Haraldson:
You keep talking about the west.

14
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:24,030
I believe...

15
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,364
I don't care what you believe.

16
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,820
Don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

17
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,903
Floki: The boat will be lighter
and faster than before.

18
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,705
Do you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

19
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,440
We won't know
that until we try.

20
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,008
We must find a crew.

21
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,910
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

and sought out these young men
<i>to meet you.</i>

43
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,241
All of them have sworn
upon their rings

to keep this meeting a secret.

45
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:20,880
You have done well, my friend,

46
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,815

I could trust you.

Leif: What are we here for?

48
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:27,119
You are here, firstly,

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,888
because you have
nothing better to do.

And with this boat,
for the first time,

57
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:45,905
we can go west.

60

<i>Rollo: Yes, we do.</i>

66
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,128
And I have Ragnar's word
that we will all be equal

67
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,863
and share equally
the spoils of our raid.

<i>Knut: If there are any.</i>

69

Knut.

72
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,009
I promise you, Knut,

73
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,477
I've heard witnesses.

74
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,412
Just stories.

75
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,247

All things begin and end
as stories.

00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,326
Erik:
We have to remember, though,

79
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:44,363
that Earl Haraldson
has ordered us to sail east.

80
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,233
The Earl knows nothing about
our new boat.

81
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,468
He knows nothing about
the new way of navigating.

82
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,905
This is why he refuses
to let us go west.

83
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:54,573
Leif: He could kill us for
disobeying his orders.

84
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,442
(Murmurs of agreement)
Yes, he could.

85
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,914
We can offer you a chance
to shine in battle

86
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,483
<i>and impress the gods,</i>

87
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,818

00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,421
that you have never seen before.

89
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,860
Have you got the balls
to join us?

90
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:17,596
I'll go.

91
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,600
Man: And I.
Man 2: I will go.

92
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,037
Young men: I too! I will too!
And I! I will go!

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,182

94
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,551
Are you coming?

95
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,019
Yes, I want a good story
to tell my children.

Prepare to leave
in the next few weeks,

that doesn't need to know.

106
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,120
In the house of Erik Marteinn.

107
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,390
Was Ragnar Lothbrok there?

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,559
Yes, lord.

109
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,398
Shall we show them the axe?

110
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,435
Nothing would please me more,
but it's too soon.

111
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,538
We need to watch and wait.

112
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,276
Siggy: Only good things
come from watching...

113
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,010
And waiting.

114
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,901
(Quietly)
Were you looking at my wife?

115
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:04,937
Have you slept with her?

116
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,305
No, lord!

117
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,841
I swear on all the gods.

118
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:15,314
If she wants to sleep with you,

119
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,082
then I give my permission.

120
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,720
It will be arranged.

121
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,623

<i>Lagertha: So when do we sail?</i>

Ragnar: I already told you.

126
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,252
I don't want you to come.

127
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,053
Why not?

128
00:06:56,156 --> 00:07:00,192
Ragnar: I need to leave the children and
the farm in the hands of someone I trust.

129
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:03,362
What if the Earl finds out we
have gone without his permission?

130
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:07,199
He might try and claim
our family home.

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,801
This was going to be
the most exciting voyage

132
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,636
of our lives.

133
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,870
(Ragnar continues
washing clothes)

134
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:12,605
To go west!

135
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,381
I have dreamed of it
many times,

136
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:25,417
and in my dreams
we are always together.

137
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,389
What if there is no west?

138
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:36,495
This is the most dangerous
and stupid voyage ever.

139
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:41,166
What if we both die, hmm?

140
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:44,003
Then who would take care
of the children...

141

rollo?!

142
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,576
You have no right to say that!

143
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,852
All right, all right. You go.

144

<i>You go</i>

145
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,595

Olafur: (Whispering) Siggy?

148
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:16,769
Go away!

149
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,376
It's so cold in here,

could sleep with a woman

I didn't think, out of all of

Yes.

Floki: I don't think so.

Well, that's because
he isn't here.

243

He hasn't sent word either.

244

Floki yes, Ragnar
Lothbrok, I am afraid.

344

But not for me.

Thor is beating his hammer.

353

The lightning is the sparks
from his anvil.

354

But he's not angry with us.

355

I understand now.

356
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,952
Why should he be angry with us?

357
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,322
Why should he want to sink
our boat?

358

Don't you understand?
He is celebrating.

What is it, brother Athelstan?

376
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,113
We can all see the signs.

377
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,082
Father Cuthbert: Signs? What signs?
Of what do you speak?

378
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,483
You know as well as we

379
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,686
that judgment day is at hand.

380
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,521
Jeremiah says so!

381
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,623
"And on that day,
the sun shall be darkened,"

382
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,291
and the moon shall
not give her light,

383
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:56,960
"and the stars of heaven
shall fall."

384
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,695
In the name of God,
that is enough.

385
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,164
But it's true!

386
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,299
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,"

387
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,335
and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea,

"having seven heads
and ten horns."

389
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,072
Father Cuthbert:
(Firmly) I will hear no more!

390

<i>You will return</i>
<i>to your dormitory</i>

392
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,345
And when the storm has passed

393
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,480
all shall be well.

394

You will do as I order.

395

Yes, lord.

403

Have you made any recently?

404
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:14,003
No, not recently,

Yes, I forged it.

Let go of her.

Cenwulf:
Hell - and all its devils!

519

<i>Leif: I don't understand.</i>

553
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:18,871
Why do they leave such
treasures unprotected?

554
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:22,208
Is there some spell,
some magic which protects them?

555
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:24,944

If this is their God,
then he's dead.

He is not alive, like Odin,
Thor or Frey.

562
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,327

I've travelled.

571
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,091
We are told to travel,
to take the word of God.

572
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:15,385
Please, don't kill me.

<i>Ragnar: What is that
you have in your hand?</i>

574
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,977
(Shakily) A book...

575
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,780
The gospels of st John,
I... I wanted to save it.

you chose to save this?

580
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,408
Yes.

581
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,646
Hmm. Why?

582
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,142
Why?

583
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,744
Because without the word of God

584
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,713
there is only darkness.

585
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,138
Rollo:
This is a strange place indeed.

586
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,974
We have been everywhere
and we have found no women.

587
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,102
Just these strange men.

588
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,405
Ragnar: I believe they are
the priests of their God.

589

<i>Rollo: Take what you will.</i>

590

This is what we came for.

591
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,980
Why have you not killed
this one?

592
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,249
He is worth more alive...

593
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,817
to sell as a slave.

594
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,419
I would kill him.

595
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,855
We have no room left
on the boat.

596
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,491
Ragnar: I forbid it.

597
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,026
Rollo: How can you forbid
it, little brother?

598
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,762
We are all equals,

599
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,284
and I say he dies.

600
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,571

that much to you, brother?
