1
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,126
THE GUERNICA TREE

2
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,207
Are you going to the Carnival?

3
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,200
Everybody is at the fair.

4
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,414
Everybody is at the Carnival.

5
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,616
Everything goes.
There are no rules.

6
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,220
You might meet somebody
so you won't have to sleep alone.

7
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,421
We are free now.

8
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,414
- Still single at her age.
- All alone in the mountains.

9
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,785
She doesn't see anybody
except for her donkey.

10
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,042
our castle was a well-respected,
sacred place before the Republic.

11
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,023
Look at it now, surrounded,

12
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,016
threatened by that filth.

13
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,630
To think that for all these years,

14
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,999
all these centuries,

15
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,535
our family ruled Villa Ramiro

16
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,805
and its surroundings.

17
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,342
And now our authority

18
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,979
has been abused and defeated,

19
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,782
so defeated that we have to live

20
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,775
Iike exiled people.

21
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,356
I have to release the dogs

22
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,126
into the courtyard of our property

23
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,929
to deter the excesses
of the most vindictive and excited

24
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,098
of all that riff-raff.

25
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,734
The residents of Villa Ramiro
used to be so disciplined.

26
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,036
Look at them now,
marching down the streets

27
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:48,007
to bury a sardine in the middle
of an orgy in some degrading carnival.

28
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,009
They're trying to prove

29
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,013
that contrary to the orders
of our blessed mother, the church,

30
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,482
they would actually eat meat

31
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,552
instead of fish during Lent.

32
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,545
The Republic is to blame
for all of that and so is democracy.

33
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,026
This nation that up until yesterday
was subjected

34
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,529
to the righteous authority
of the aristocrats

35
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,498
is now dreaming
of launching a revolution.

36
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,491
It is corrupted
by demagogy and liberty.

37
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,102
When freedom came,

38
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,905
it also restored
Villa Ramiro's faith in the future.

39
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,042
She blossomed, free at last.

40
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,344
I think that pretty soon
there won't be any discrimination

41
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,481
against races,
politics or religions.

42
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,383
When that day arrives,
dwarves will be men like all the others.

43
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,820
Never lose your serenity,
that's the source of all your strength.

44
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,256
Never lose your zest for life.

45
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,693
We are just passing,
but life isn't.

46
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,095
Nowadays,
evil has no sense of humor.

47
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,966
When I think about the future,
I feel light and I can fly.

48
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,435
There is hope in my heart.

49
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,271
I could only believe in a God
who knew how to dance.

50
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,241
one must be perfect,
like animals are

51
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,343
and that requires innocence.

52
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:01,213
In fact, we only love our childhood
and its masterpiece.

53
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,206
Violence against fascists
isn't an answer, but an end in itself.

54
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
They love war
for the sake of it.

55
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,022
They're unhappy.
They only dream about death.

56
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,826
Unlike them,
I only live for a better world.

57
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,819
Adriano, what I like about you
are all my hopes.

58
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,003
How long are you going to keep on
living devoid of common sense,

59
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,996
this Bohemian lifestyle
that will destroy you?

60
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,233
Furthermore,

61
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,552
your three cousins
just showed their evil streak

62
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,388
by attempting to rape
an eccentric woman.

63
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,381
You must come back
to manage everything.

64
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,395
You are my only son.

65
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,131
Starting today,
you must take over the succession.

66
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,124
We are approaching
times of crisis,

67
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,862
times of chaos,

68
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,211
an era that the bad shepherds
call Revolution.

69
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,147
The scum of Villa Ramiro,

70
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,549
just like the scum
of the rest of the country

71
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,819
is ready to destroy everything.

72
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,812
There are lots of talks about giving
the land to those who cultivate it

73
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,283
and to take it away from us,
the owners.

74
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,332
You must come back
to save the land

75
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,168
and manage everything over here,

76
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,171
before I die.

77
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,173
You cannot refuse.

78
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:38,166
At your age, how can one imagine
that a 40 year old man,

79
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,114
a mature man,
a bright man like you

80
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,583
could keep on living

81
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,120
such a stupid, mediocre life?

82
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,923
Rumors of your exploits
with your surrealist friends

83
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,916
reached us all the way here.

84
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,530
I know that you soiled
the coat of arms of the country,

85
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,523
that you traumatized poor little girls at
their first communion,...

86
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,508
Dear brothers,
your attention, please.

87
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,501
We just received a message
from the Red Cross.

88
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:17,538
All these communion wafers
are poisoned.

89
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,488
...that you provoked the members
of the Spanish Royal Academy...

90
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:26,292
Don Marcelino Menendez Y Pelayo,
father of the Spanish Critic,

91
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,561
- notable forerunner of--
- Academicians to the mental hospital!

92
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,554
...that you made a revolting
and sacrilegeous painting.

93
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,037
You and your friends
are a bunch of hoodlums.

94
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,030
People I consider to be
the scum of society.

95
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,391
Here is what you gave me yesterday
and what I'm giving back to you today.

96
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,427
Now we are even.

97
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,263
What do you mean?
What's in this glass?

98
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,256
A few drops of my sperm.

99
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,605
The lnsurrection against the Republic has
been meticulously planned.

100
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,598
The conspirators are ready for action
and will do so when the time is right.

101
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,090
our men were recruited
all over the Spanish territory.

102
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,393
The richest personalities
of the country such as March,

103
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,729
have decided just like Hitler
and Mussolini

104
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,932
to provide us with all the assistance
we might need.

105
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,102
In Barcelona,
General Goded will rise

106
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,095
and take over Catalonia
and Las Ramblas

107
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,076
A Seuta, le Colonel Yague
with a motorized division

108
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,381
and several African troops
will spring into action.

109
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,698
At Las Palmas, General Franco,
in connection with the aerial base

110
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,691
will take over the operations.

111
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,167
In Pamplona, General Mola
and the Carlists will occupy Navarre.

112
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,410
In Melia, le colonel Segue will rise with
Third Regiment of lnfantry.

113
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:50,091
And here, at the Villa Ramiro,
we will take over with the Falange.

114
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,605
It won't be easy.
The town is infested with Republicans

115
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,707
who seduced the masses
with their demagogy.

116
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,644
Revolutionaries
should be exterminated right away

117
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,280
and the strategic areas
of the city taken over.

118
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,749
These two actions should be
carried out simultaneously.

119
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,486
The Army will be on time
on the 18th at 5:00 A.M..

120
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,688
Either we'll triumph in an hour,

121
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,559
or, if our plans fail,
we will have to face a long civil war.

122
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,061
Villa Ramiro will be a reflection

123
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,054
of what could happen
in all of Spain.

124
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,459
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

125
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,806
How long will the people

126
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:31,243
accept to live
under the powerful ones?

127
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,679
Yes, long live freedom!

128
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,672
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

129
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,167
What's going on?
What do you want?

130
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,570
Cousin, you must join us.

131
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,606
Go on, Rafael.

132
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,841
on the 18th we will all rise.

133
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,877
Then I will go to bed.

134
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,080
Don't you see
what I'm trying to tell you?

135
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,350
on the 18th, we will all rise
against the Republic.

136
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,852
We are going to have
a coup d'état.

137
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,221
Everything has been planned.

138
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,624
The Army is on our side.

139
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,427
I'm pleased to see
you still have balls.

140
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,763
Vipers bites won't stop you
from brandishing your gun

141
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,798
to defend your ideal.

142
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,369
I forbid you to laugh
when you talk about our ideal.

143
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,404
There are many heroes

144
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,540
among the conspirators.

145
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,309
What do I care
about your schemes?

146
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,845
I don't give a damn
about your political stories.

147
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,147
It makes me laugh.

148
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,140
The only heroes left
when we'll organize ourselves in Spain,

149
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,378
will be the deserters.
Good luck.

150
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,561
They are getting ready
to wipe us out.

151
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,864
They are conspiring against us,
we already know that.

152
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,334
But people
will be opposed to it.

153
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,136
Don't repeat this to anyone--

154
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,739
"our Father who art in heaven,
give us this day our daily bread..."

155
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,775
Because the collectivist society
of tomorrow

156
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,145
after having eliminated the ruling classes
will give us all our daily bread

157
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,415
as well as truffled foie gras
every day.

158
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,450
I dread what's going to happen.

159
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,886
I'm afraid it's gonna be
another barbaric period.

160
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,879
Freedom is essential
but ever so hard.

161
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,894
And many only feel a need
to consume.

162
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,929
Unfortunately,

163
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,466
that often means
the elimination of others.

164
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,470
our current civilization
is going to perish.

165
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,740
And either we are at the dawn
of a new barbaric era,

166
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,310
or something really horrible.

167
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,303
Neither the sun, nor death,
can face each other.

168
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,651
We are all walking
on a tightrope,

169
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,720
on the tiniest tightrope.

170
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,623
All it would take would be
to lean over a bit too far

171
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,616
to plummet into illusions
or despair.

172
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,330
Fascism means death.

173
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,323
The man of the party
must become a liar.

174
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,794
Martyrs always bury the truth.

175
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:19,000
Pacifism cannot be a capitulation,

176
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,613
but rather a type of resistance.

177
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,950
You are such an idealist, come with us to
the demonstration, come on.

178
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,943
No, I have to go to school
with my pupils.

179
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,673
[i] Tis the final conflict [i]

180
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,666
[i] Let each stand in his place [i]

181
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,836
[i] The lnternational Union [i]

182
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,308
[i] Shall be the human race [i]

183
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,345
[i] 'Tis the final conflict [i]

184
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,292
[i] Let each stand in his place... [i]

185
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,661
I've been elected by all of you,

186
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,831
to represent Republican order
and equality.

187
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,801
I'm asking you,
residents of Villa Ramiro,

188
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,836
to obey the law

189
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,971
even though you know
they're conspiring against us.

190
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,075
You are asking me for weapons,
but only the army can carry them.

191
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,978
Give us weapons!

192
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,971
Calm down,
I'm begging you, calm down.

193
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,921
We will all rise tomorrow
at dawn in 10 hours.

194
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,457
With General Goded in Madrid,

195
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,526
General Queipo de Llano in Seville,

196
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,430
and Las Recades in the North.

197
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,799
The Republic will be destroyed

198
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,635
before it even knew what hit it

199
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,838
and the whole country
will be in our hands

200
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,674
from the Portuguese
to the French border.

201
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,743
Everything has been planned
around here.

202
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,736
We all know the time and date
and the role we have to play.

203
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,851
This is a list
of all the arrests to be made.

204
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,844
And this is a list
of hasty executions

205
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,657
that are necessary
to terrorize the population.

206
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,060
If necessary we will exterminate
half of the village.

207
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,129
Long live Christ our King!

208
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,122
Long live Christ our King!

209
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,955
Radio Paris here.

210
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,892
It's hard to come across
as impartial and fair

211
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,894
when it comes
to the devastating tragedy

212
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,997
our southern neighbors
are currently going through

213
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,699
The Spanish Civil War
has just begun.

214
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,803
Following the first confrontations
and the confusion that followed,

215
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,471
Spain is divided in two.

216
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,974
Geographically it is divided
by a line that goes through Madrid.

217
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,644
To the east is the Republican
popular front

218
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,180
who is confident
that this budding war

219
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,015
will only be
an unexpected shortcut

220
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:14,008
that will lead them to a world
of justice, equality and tolerance.

221
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,112
To the west, the military, the clergy
and the main landowners

222
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,660
are adamant
about restoring an order

223
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,095
similar to the one established
by the inquisition in its days.

224
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,164
After having uncovered
a fascist plot,

225
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,200
Villa Ramiro is in the hands
if its inhabitants

226
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,535
who have decided to take over
the Count's Castle,

227
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,572
symbol of the tyranny
that enslaved them for centuries.

228
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,775
Mr. the Count--
I mean, Comrade Count.

229
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,945
Whoever isn't on our side
is against us.

230
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,581
open the gate of your castle

231
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,616
and come stand in front of us all.

232
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,587
Come outside
with your servants and your family.

233
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,580
Come outside with your hands up,
come outside.

234
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,740
Vamos.

235
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,733
Vamos.

236
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,785
Fascist

237
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,778
Exploiter Capitalist Fascist."

238
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,915
It's a rather symbolic
demonstration...

239
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,106
What a surprise!
Good morning.

240
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:05,099
it's the first time Count Cerralbo visits the
public school.

241
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,970
Have a seat, please.

242
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,113
Sir, I came to bring you this gift.

243
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,250
- What's the occasion?
- Because of all those rascals.

244
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,352
You mean,
the residents of Villa Ramiro?

245
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,387
For centuries,

246
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,123
you and your family
have treated those people

247
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,793
Iike in the days of slavery,

248
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,961
by denying them their daily bread,

249
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,230
asking them to cut short their life,

250
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,766
gagged so they wouldn't
eat the grape,

251
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,759
dressing them in used burlap,

252
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,507
forcing them to sell their most beautiful
daughters to prostitution,

253
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:13,311
Count of Cerralbo,
I'm against all forms of bribing.

254
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,304
Trust me, an outburst
like the one that occurred this morning

255
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,952
was molded by your own hands
for centuries.

256
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,321
I didn't come here to talk politics.

257
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,524
I came here
to ask you to hide me.

258
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,827
My life is threatened.

259
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,995
A fanatic could shoot me
at anytime.

260
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,766
I beg of you, hide me,
in the name of Christian charity.

261
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,502
I could only do that
as a humane gesture.

262
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,271
Anyway, our side,

263
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,842
I mean, the Falangist side--

264
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,510
Right, your accomplice.

265
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,579
When they'll get here,

266
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,915
they will take in consideration
the fact that you protected me.

267
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,417
Think about it.

268
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,485
of course and I won't be killed
in the arena

269
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,255
Iike my predecessor,
Mr. Nora.

270
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,824
without a fair trial.

271
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,827
I can assure you
nobody will harm you,

272
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,929
you have my word on it.

273
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,599
I'm going to hide you because
it's the humane thing to do, as I said.

274
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,592
But you're wrong to try
to convince me with such low tactics.

275
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,939
Keep your money.

276
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,909
As far as this jewel is concerned,

277
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,112
I'm not used
to wearing gold bracelets.

278
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,181
The Republican government

279
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,351
who is nothing more
than the bastard offspring

280
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,153
born of the liberals' mingling
with the socialists

281
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,322
is about to collapse

282
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,125
thanks to the upheaval
of the Spanish Army

283
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:38,096
that has the support
of the clergy and the ruling class.

284
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,632
Spain, the real Spain,

285
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,268
is about to slaughter
the Marxist dragon,

286
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,261
who's hit the dust
and is now crawling.

287
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,342
Spain is safe!

288
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,335
Villa Ramiro is already
between our hands.

289
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,652
From the Spanish Republic Radio

290
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,987
out of the Madrid Studio.

291
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,623
People of Spain,
stay tuned,

292
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,927
don't turn off your radio.

293
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,063
Traitors against the nation
are spreading rumors

294
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,667
regarding some obscure
criminal plot

295
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,660
organized by a reactionary
and fascist minority.

296
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,675
People are showing up
everywhere to help the Republic

297
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,278
that a small group of fascists
is trying to overturn by force.

298
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,081
our legitimate republic
will know how to resist

299
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,684
this minority of military renegades

300
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,953
kept afloat
by fascism and nazism

301
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,388
to avoid a civil war.

302
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,625
We are adamant about denouncing
an erroneous information--

303
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,618
Villa Ramiro is still Republican.

304
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,032
How come Villa Ramiro
is still standing?

305
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:52,025
The Spanish Civil War is still going on with
its pro-Franco procession.

306
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,938
At Suda de Rodrigo,
a peasant accused

307
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,974
of having disrespected
an object of worship

308
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,967
was cruelly tortured in public
then put to death.

309
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,156
Attention!
Get ready.

310
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,027
Squadron ready to execute the lawyer
Delbosque, traitor against the country.

311
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,529
Get set...

312
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,522
fire!

313
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,478

00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,628
[i] Shall be the human race [i]

318
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,799
[i] 'Tis the final conflict [i]

319
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:17,337
[i] Let each stand in his place [i]

320
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,508
[i] The lnternational Union [i]

321
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,679
[i] Shall be the human race... [i]

322
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,626
In Guernica, under this tree,

323
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,195
the Spanish monarch
and its deputies

324
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,230
swore as was the custom

325
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,100
to respect the specific rights
of its inhabitants.

326
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,569
This is the Freedom Tree.

327
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,562
The Guernica Tree.

328
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,375
...Culture

329
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,489
According to tradition,

330
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,658
the town's children
are going to participate

331
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,661
in the "most beautiful tree
in Guernica" contest.

332
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,864
But don't forget,
blood calls for more blood,

333
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,900
torture calls for more torture.

334
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,893
The chain reaction unlatched
by some fascist minority

335
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,941
is covering our land
with so much mourning.

336
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,344
The lowest instincts of man

337
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,813
spring up and blind his lucidity.

338
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,682
We will fight
for justice and freedom.

339
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,751
We'll keep on fighting

340
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,254
because we gave our all
for the Republic to succeed.

341
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,790
Aristocrats' houses
have been converted into schools.

342
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,561
Charitable organizations gave back
pawned objects for free.

343
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,763
Chalices and convents' fences

344
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,667
have been melted to cast
ammunitions to defend people.

345
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,471
And today, although fights and war
are setting the whole country ablaze,

346
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,340
we are going to ask the orchestra
to play for us all,

347
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,333
"Let's rejoice, victory is near."

348
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,451
What is your name?

349
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:24,444
Tell me yours first.

350
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,719
"Fascism assassinates culture"

351
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,083
In spite of the atrocities,

352
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,852
Iife is returning to normal

353
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:18,055
in the small town of Villa Ramiro.

354
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,724
Although we are besieged

355
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,361
since the bombing
of the city of Guernica.

356
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,354
But we are still holding our own
against the fascist army.

357
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,035
Right in the middle of battles

358
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,203
classes are being offered
to the combatants

359
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:37,196
so there won't be ignorant
among them.

360
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,712
In the hope that the best medicine

361
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,815
against terror and intolerance

362
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,950
will be culture.

363
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,619
Contrary to the saying,

364
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,612
one shouldn't
"love thy neighbor as thyself,"

365
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:58,184
but love thyself as thy neighbor.

366
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,367
Because if we don't love thyself,

367
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,360
we don't love thy neighbor.

368
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,674
The worst enemy you can encounter

369
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:14,667
will always be yourself.

370
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,651
And now we're going to re-enact

371
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,644
the savage bombing of Guernica.

372
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,862
The town of Guernica
was razed by the Nazi air force

373
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:08,432
and the Guernica Tree,
"the Freedom Tree"

374
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,268
miraculously survived
the slaughtering.

375
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,261
It remained untouched like hope.

376
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,095
Villa Ramiro outnumbered
by troops surrounding it,

377
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,442
doesn't seem to accept defeat.

378
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:29,079
According to experts, it doesn't look like
the city can resist any longer

379
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,072
with hunting riffles and stones
against a modern army.

380
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,213
"Free people of the world
are with Villa Ramiro."

381
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:07,206
"Long live democracy!"

382
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,042
Where can I sign up for battle?

383
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:36,035
These are the Third Battalion
barracks, comrade.

384
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,863
- Halt.
- I am Vandale.

385
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,232
- Where are you headed?
- Home, to Villa Ramiro.

386
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,367
- Are you a Commie?
- Let her be.

387
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,569
She's a poor woman
who's got nothing to do with this.

388
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,562
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. Bring her to me.

389
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:13,506
We'll meet again, with no vipers
and no soldiers around,

390
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,420
just the two of us.

391
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,656
- Then--
- Halt!

392
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:23,126
I'm not one to hold a grudge.
Don't go to Villa Ramiro.

393
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,595
We've surrounded the city

394
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,498
and in two days,
cannons will be brought in

395
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,001
in order to eradicate

396
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,971
the last of the rebels.

397
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,964
If you don't take this seriously,
you'll surely die.

398
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,431
Villa Ramiro will fall
any time soon.

399
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,567
It would be ridiculous
to redirect our troops

400
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,737
and try to protect a city that's been
almost completely surrounded

401
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,706
and whose only means
of protection are its walls!

402
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,943
Villa Ramiro is a symbol for us

403
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,313
and we have to defend it
with all we have--

404
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,082
our teeth, our nails,
our guts and blood--

405
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,284
and if that's not enough,

406
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,187
we'll bury those killers
in our own shit!

407
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,090
Goya, you're talking like a poet,
not like a rebel.

408
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,293
I'm just a common soldier
fighting for freedom.

409
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,963
Fighting? How?

410
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,956
By sending the Fifth Company,
the Third Regiment, the Third Column?

411
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,737
They have to know that we are
with them every step of the way,

412
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,672
that they've not been forgotten.

413
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:46,665
They have to know
that Spain is fighting for them.

414
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,103
Telephone communication with them
has been cut off!

415
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,461
I'll fly there.

416
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:08,031
You very well know
we have no planes available.

417
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,400
Don't you worry about that.

418
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,003
I've commandeered one.

419
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,806
The Marquis of Quijo
had a personal plane.

420
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,799
But the sky is permanently infested
with German planes!

421
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,258
Listen, children.

422
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,494
The thought for the day is:

423
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,297
"ldeas that arrive

424
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,532
on the wings of a dove

425
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,169
Iead the world."

426
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,538
You can go
to the demonstration now.

427
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:52,531
Yeah!

428
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,732
Comrade Vandale who has just
arrived from Guernica,

429
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,725
the city razed to the ground,
wants to speak to you!

430
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,717
Listen, all of you
living in Villa Ramiro!

431
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:23,489
It's better to die standing tall
than to live on our knees.

432
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,941
The fascists--

433
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:34,177
the fascists who have
destroyed Guernica

434
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,880
will never destroy
the Tree of Liberty!

435
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,449
They want to take over Villa Ramiro

436
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,252
but Villa Ramiro will
bury the fascism

437
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,245
and despotism
of the privileged!

438
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:52,418
Men, women...

439
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,432
comrades, let us bear arms!

440
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,835
If you don't have a weapon,
steal it from a dead enemy.

441
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,272
If you have nothing,
fight with your bare hands,

442
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,775
throw boiling oil
on the enemies of the people!

443
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:09,212
And let the children help
build barricades!

444
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:13,205
Those who do not have faith in our victory
are nothing but cowards!

445
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,588
Those men...

446
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,581
those men who savagely
crushed Guernica and its inhabitants

447
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,794
in a deluge of iron and fire

448
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:28,787
will not be allowed to rule
Villa Ramiro or Spain!

449
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,961
Let every place,
every house be a fortress!

450
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,442
Let every neighborhood be
an iron barrier against our attackers!

451
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,545
Citizens of Villa Ramiro,
rise up in arms!

452
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,982
The world is looking at you!
¡No pasarán!

453
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,975
They shall not pass!

454
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,885
Comrades, here's
a message for you!

455
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,878
"Spain is with Villa Ramiro!"

456
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,959
"Villa Ramiro is
the symbol of democracy!"

457
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:33,897
"Heroic people
of Villa Ramiro, resist!"

458
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,890
"Villa Ramiro is
the banner of the Republic!"

459
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:05,617
[i] My friends who are in jail [i]

460
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,064
[i] I want to make it clear [i]

461
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,101
[i] My friends who are in jail [i]

462
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,536
[i] I want to make it clear [i]

463
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,372
[i] I'm not in this world [i]

464
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,365
[i] To steal from the poor [i]

465
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,812
[i] I'm not in this world [i]

466
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,805
[i] To steal from the poor [i]

467
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,853
[i] I'm a clandestine [i]

468
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,688
[i] The Civil Guard knows it [i]

469
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,891
[i] I'm a clandestine [i]

470
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,060
[i] The Civil Guard knows it [i]

471
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,095
[i] And if they don't kill me [i]

472
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:43,088
[i] We'll destroy your prisons [i]

473
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,802
[i] And if they don't kill me [i]

474
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,772
[i] We'll destroy your prisons [i]

475
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,442
[i] The injustice ruling this country [i]

476
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,044
[i] Will soon be overturned [i]

477
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,914
[i] The injustice ruling this country [i]

478
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,949
[i] Will soon be overturned [i]

479
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,885
[i] And the people will stand [i]

480
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,388
[i] Like the Tree of Guernica [i]

481
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,991
[i] And the people will stand [i]

482
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,984
[i] Like the tree of Guernica. [i]

483
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,111
Get back there.

484
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,104
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Republic.

485
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,910
They shall not pass.

486
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:23,135
People of Villa Ramiro,
you all know me.

487
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,049
I am Rafael Cerralbo!

488
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,785
Rafael Cerralbo,
I am Vandale!

489
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:32,321
There is no point
in putting up a fight.

490
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:36,314
You have been besieged
by forces incalculably superior to yours.

491
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,163
We are waiting for you!

492
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:44,156
And this time, we have more
than vipers to defend ourselves.

493
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,975
There they are!
Shoot towards the cannons!

494
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,842
General, we have
been overwhelmed.

495
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,411
- That can't be!
- It is.

496
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,347
our weapons have
been destroyed.

497
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,851
Villa Ramiro must fall!
It is the heart of the Republic!

498
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,520
our troops can't raid the city.

499
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,556
The locals are fighting
like wild animals.

500
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,925
But our force is superior!

501
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:26,918
It's easier to stay behind
city walls than attack them.

502
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,823
So we'll send
the German Condor Legion.

503
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,071
- All right.
- And two of Mussolini's divisions.

504
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,874
- All right.
- We have to wipe out Villa Ramiro!

505
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,867
Yes, sir!

506
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:19,431
Fascist troops have decided to put
an end to Villa Ramiro's resistance.

507
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:23,312
The largest concentration of troops
since the beginning of the war

508
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,948
has begun its siege of Villa Ramiro.

509
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:28,150
Franco's army has
been strengthened

510
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,419
by massive numbers
of German and ltalian volunteers.

511
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,989
Battle is taking place
on such unequal footing

512
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,982
that the city will fall in no time.

513
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,352
Let me go!

514
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:27,345
Let's kill him now!

515
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:42,438
Here's Vandale,
our speech fanatic!

516
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:46,431
Whore!

517
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:55,451
Be careful, she bit a priest
and almost ripped his arm off!

518
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:59,444
Rafael Cerralbo
will be very pleased.

519
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:49,620
Turn west!

520
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:59,030
Turn east!

521
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,995
We, soldiers who have
fought for our country,

522
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:23,988
cannot waste our time on so-called
democratic justice measures,

523
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,702
mere criminal methods
used to sabotage

524
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,938
what is just punishment.

525
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:33,108
However, you have
been given the chance

526
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:37,101
to stand trial in accordance
with military code.

527
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:41,884
Which means that
there will be no witnesses,

528
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:45,877
the defendants will not be
at liberty to address the court

529
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:50,148
and sentences will be carried out
without possible appeal

530
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,730
tomorrow morning.

531
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,367
The first defendant is
Antonio Garcia, school teacher,

532
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,669
charged with the murder
of Count Cerralbo.

533
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,905
The evidence I've been
handed is damning.

534
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,908
Moreover, a jacket belonging
to the count was found at the school.

535
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,143
This is a tragic
misunderstanding.

536
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,579
Quiet!
You have no right to speak!

537
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,582
Your lawyer, Captain Ares,
can speak in your name.

538
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,984
- I've never met him.
- I said be quiet

539
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,920
or I'll blow your head off

540
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,913
with this very gun
that defended our motherland!

541
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:27,062
Captain Ares,
as the defendant's attorney,

542
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,965
what do you have to say
in his name?

543
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,635
The unforgivable crime
committed by the defendant

544
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,472
calls for the full rigor of the law,

545
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,465
but I will ask the court
to show clemency.

546
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:56,113
Upon hearing the defense
and reviewing the evidence,

547
01:14:56,625 --> 01:15:00,618
we hereby sentence
Antonio Garcia to death.

548
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,167
Let's move on
to the next defendant,

549
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,670
Angel Castillo, blacksmith,
charged with several crimes

550
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,663
committed during the Communist
upheaval in Villa Ramiro.

551
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:18,436
I am Count Cerralbo.

552
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,950
- Sir, you have--
- How do you dare

553
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,452
interrupt the judicial process?

554
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:27,445
Villa Ramiro's school teacher has
just been sentenced to death

555
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:31,460
for killing Count Cerralbo,

556
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,462
which is outrageous

557
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:37,455
- considering I am Count Cerralbo.
- How is that possible?

558
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:41,236
I haven't killed anybody.

559
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:45,040
Indeed, I am Count Cerralbo.

560
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,033
Not only is this man
not guilty of murder,

561
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:53,048
he hid and protected me.

562
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:57,041
Since he was well-respected
in Villa Ramiro during the upheaval,

563
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:01,078
I was safe from the Communists.

564
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,159
Very well.
You are dismissed.

565
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,152
We will change the sentence.

566
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,290
Guard, please escort
Count Cerralbo out of the courtroom.

567
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,104
We revoke the death sentence

568
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:19,975
pronounced upon Antonio
Garcia for murder,

569
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,968
but considering
Count Cerralbo's allegation

570
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,717
that the defendant

571
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:32,554
had such a good reputation
among the Communists,

572
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:36,558
to the point of being able
to hide one of our men,

573
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,551
we sentence him to death,
not by gunshot but by garrote.

574
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,047
The list of prisoners
to be executed.

575
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,882
- Everything ready?
- Everything.

576
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,318
- You have the muzzles?
- Here.

577
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,187
I don't want to hear
anything subversive

578
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:42,290
Iike "long live the Republic"
or "freedom will prevail,"

579
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,283
or see any kind
of unruly behavior.

580
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:50,388
They won't say a word
with that on.

581
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,869
Sir, this one was
used yesterday.

582
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:57,862
It is still dripping with
the Commie's slobber.

583
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,676
Rafael...

584
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,669
we have arrested Vandale.

585
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:11,053
Wonderful.

586
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:15,046
Make sure those brutes
go to confession before they die.

587
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,794
They are quite stubborn.

588
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,930
Yesterday, a priest had
to kill one with his crucifix.

589
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,200
He was uttering
horrific blasphemy.

590
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,193
Go get the condemned
and prepare for the execution.

591
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,274
As for me...

592
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:36,267
I intend to celebrate
Vandale's arrival...

593
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:40,671
with her, of course.

594
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,743
Go on.

595
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:52,783
Here are the names of those
to be executed in the morning:

596
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,433
Juan Pérez Gonzales;

597
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,836
Antonio Gómez;

598
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,705
Moises Pérez Pérez;

599
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:06,708
Melquisedes Arivas Gómez;

600
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,111
ojelio Verzoza Campillio;

601
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,712
Anacleto Torrez Pereira;

602
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:13,248
Angel Castillo Fuente;

603
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:16,017
Miguel Angel Lopez Terán;

604
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,453
Vicente Posuedo Escudero;

605
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,389
Vicente Gonzalez Ruis;

606
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,325
Jesús Raul Camunior;

607
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:27,318
Luis Pescador de Arroyo.

608
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,776
Pacifism must not be
a mere form of resignation,

609
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,256
but an active act of resistance,

610
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:58,249
a call to life.

611
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,463
"ldeas that arrive on the wings
of a dove lead the world."

612
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,887
This is a public announcement!

613
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,856
By decree of local
military authorities,

614
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,849
all commandeered land will be
given back to its owner;

615
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:09,320
the local school is closed
and will be used as a prison;

616
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:13,201
Sunday Mass attendance
is compulsory;

617
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:17,194
military courts will replace
civil courts;

618
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,575
religious authorities

619
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:24,546
have informed us
that His Holiness the Pope

620
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,539
has declared our fight
against the Republic

621
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:31,419
a Crusade.

622
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:35,412
Executions will take place publicly
every day at the cemetery.

623
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:38,960
A celebration will take place
tomorrow in the arena

624
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,953
to celebrate our victory
in Villa Ramiro.

625
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:59,697
Par ici.

626
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:22,419
Let's go, toro.
Come.

627
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:34,164
Par ici.

628
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,782
Para usted, mi general.

629
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,580
I have plenty of time.

630
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,349
Eventually, you'll tell me
everything you know

631
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:32,342
about the Republican
headquarters.

632
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:37,158
I am ready

633
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:41,151
to tell you everything I know.

634
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,498
I'm listening.

635
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,867
Come closer.

636
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,860
Closer.

637
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:56,211
Can you hear that?

638
01:26:56,211 --> 01:27:00,204
There's a round every night.

639
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:03,585
Soon, you'll beg me
to get you executed,

640
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,420
but I won't.

641
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,413
Not until you have endured
all the forms of torture I know.

642
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:41,189
Did you hear that?

643
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:45,182
You deserve the same fate.

644
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:51,788
This prison is not
very comfortable.

645
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,293
You are mine now.
I can do with you whatever I want.

646
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:01,298
Come here. Let me free you
from your shackles.

647
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:31,085
Attention, please!

648
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:34,555
We are interrupting our program
to read the latest statement

649
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:36,757
coming straight from
General Franco's headquarters.

650
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:40,628
"Citizens, our army has
defeated the enemy

651
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:43,631
and we have reached our goals.

652
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:47,624
The war is over."

653
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:46,020
My name is...

654
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,013
Goya.

655
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:53,060
I am Vandale.

656
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,797
Vandale.

657
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,966
We can't give up.

658
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:02,069
our people must be free again.

659
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:05,006
The Tree of Guernica,
covered in ashes,

660
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:08,999
still stands, like our hope.
