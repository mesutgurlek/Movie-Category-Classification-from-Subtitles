Yes.

655
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:25,441
Would you like me to go, sir?

656
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:32,441
Say a prayer?

657
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,321
Yes, Firebrace.

658
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:44,441
That would be very...

659
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:47,121
Kind. Yes...

660
01:13:48,761 --> 01:13:50,721
If you wouldn't mind.

Captain.

662
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,561
- Get me a souvenir.
- Get it yourself.

663
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:15,041
You're going soft, Jack.
You'll miss breakfast.

664
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:16,961
Save us some.

(MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

666
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:56,801
Another order in today.
Two thousand more coats for the military.

667
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:01,321
The promise of five francs extra in
their pay and they just look at me.

669

We'll break the strikers yet.

671
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:17,361
The strangest thing I've heard today.

672
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:21,761
Someone has been taking
parcels of food to their families.

673
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:27,241
Well, they...

674
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:29,601
They do have some supporters, sir.

675
01:15:30,841 --> 01:15:32,361
One or two sympathetic men.

676
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:35,441
No. This is the oddest part.

677
01:15:36,441 --> 01:15:40,161
It was a woman. Apparently, of some rank.

678
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:46,601
Now, isn't that the strangest thing?

679
01:15:49,281 --> 01:15:51,161
Their children were hungry.

680
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:55,481
I saw them going through
the dustbins in Saint-Leu.

681
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,281
Don't ask me to stop,
because I'll do it again.

682
01:16:00,361 --> 01:16:04,161
- Isabelle...
- Punish the men, not their families.

683
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:12,121
Leave the room.

684
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:21,481
Lisette, I said leave the room.

685
01:16:23,721 --> 01:16:26,001
- It is all your fault.
- ISABELLE: Lisette.

686
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:30,281
We were happy before you came.

687
01:16:30,361 --> 01:16:32,921
Your father is right. Leave the room.

688
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,641
I discounted these rumours, even though
it was your name attached to them.

689
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:46,561
- René...
- Be quiet.

690
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:51,161
<i>Monsieur</i>, if you please,
I would like to be alone with my wife.

691
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:58,321
- Sir...
- No.

692
01:17:03,481 --> 01:17:05,361
Let him stay.

693
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:14,361
I want him to stay.

694
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:36,921
There was another piece of idle talk.
I chose to ignore it.

695
01:17:37,001 --> 01:17:38,881
I'm so sorry.

696
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:43,441
I meant you no harm.

697
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:45,961
This boy...

698
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:48,201
This English boy!

699
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:54,641
In which room?

700
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:58,761
In my own house! Which room?

701
01:18:00,521 --> 01:18:02,761
I pursued your wife, sir. I seduced her.

702
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:05,441
You have never taken
the trouble to know me, René.

703
01:18:05,641 --> 01:18:07,641
- Forgive me!
- Yes, I forgive you.

704
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:10,521
I forgive you for all the wrong
you have done me

705
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,361
and I ask you to forgive me
for all the wrong I have done to you.

706
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,241
You will leave my house now.

707
01:18:17,521 --> 01:18:19,401
Then I'll go with him.

708
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:50,361
You think you will be able to keep her?
