Yeah. Maybe I'm
a little crazy, huh?

He won the Congressional

You know, I had
a famous father too.

He was a baseball player...

too much choice.

the same advice

that I give
all new lieutenants.

Rely on your sergeant's

[PLAYING HARMONICA]

489
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,410
Lock and load!

490
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,721
Okay.

491
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,057
Let's do it.

492
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,103
We're going in hot!

493
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,470
All right, gentlemen,
by the numbers!

494
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,809
Go! Go! Go!

495
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,050
Let's go!

496
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,158
Move it, Horn.

497
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,233
Medic! Medic!

498
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,307
They're leaving us!

499
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,376
They're leaving us!

500
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,811
Come on!

501
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,447
God. Shoot.

502
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,849
Kill them! Kill them!

503
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:22,285
Medic!

504
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,654
Come on, Lawrence!
Keep moving!

505
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,989
Medic!

506
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,662
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

507
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,630
Stay down, lieutenant. Down!

508
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,833
Move out! Move it!

509
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,700
Stay down! Stay down!

510
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,638
Move out! Move it!

511
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,408
Get down. Look out.

512
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,909
Sergeant, get these moving--

513
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,178
Get down!

514
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,412
Keep your butt down,
lieutenant.

515
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,981
Call in artillery.
Let them do it.

516
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:51,982
I'm in command here,
sergeant.

517
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,250
Now, we're taking
that tree line!

518
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,317
Now, follow my orders!

519
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,551
No, lieutenant,
I'm not dying,

520
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,652
neither are these
men aren't dying. Horn!

521
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,355
Get me that radio!

522
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,655
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

523
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,327
Red Leg.
This is Bravo Two.

524
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,529
Fire mission
from Whiskey Delta

525
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,797
add 1-0-0 Mike.

526
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,432
Gooks in the tree line.
Artillery fire. Over.

527
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,936
RADIO:
We're on the way.
First round is smoke.

528
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,604
There it is, sarge.

529
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,673
All right.
Red Leg, Bravo Two.

530
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,876
Drop 1-0-0.
Fire for effect. Over.

531
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,278
Roger, Bravo Two. We copy.

532
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,622
See there, lieutenant?

533
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,824
All you've got to do
is let Arty do the work.

534
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,226
Nobody gets hurt
that way.

535
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,795
You keep up
your fire, Baker!

536
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,231
Keep moving, men.
Come on, Taylor, fire!

537
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,098
Fire!

538
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,073
Where's your weapon,
soldier?

539
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,274
I left it
on the chopper.

540
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,275
You what?

541
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,777
I am not fighting, sir.

542
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,479
You're both going
to get court-martialed

543
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,381
when we get back--
the both of you.

544
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,417
Horn...

545
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,851
you are incredible.

546
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,454
You're just incredible.

547
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,631
How could anybody
survive this?

548
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,968
You'd be surprised.
You'd be surprised.

549
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,472
Man, this is spooky.

550
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,475
No bodies, no nothing.

551
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,210
They move their dead.

552
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,512
They don't
leave nothing.

553
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,188
Blood trail!
I got a blood trail here.

554
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,556
It goes up that way.

555
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,958
All right,
we'll follow that trail.

556
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Keep your eyes open, now.
They're gonna be looking for us.

557
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,162
Lieutenant, call six
and tell them what we're doing.

558
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,965
We've got to figure out a place
to meet the rest of the company.

559
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,167
You seem to be making a lot
of decisions here, sergeant.

560
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,370
I'm just trying to help,
lieutenant.

561
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,107
Bravo Six, this is
Bravo Two. Over.

562
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:00,477
This is Bravo Six.
Come in, Bravo Two.

563
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,711
Bravo Six,
this is Bravo Two.

564
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,080
We're about one click
northwest of the LZ.

565
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,281
We've got
a blood trail.

566
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,850
We're going to follow it
due west. Over.

567
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,718
Due west.
We copy. Over.

568
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,688
This is great.

569
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,090
We're supposed to be
a full company,

570
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,292
and we're stuck
with half a platoon.

571
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,494
Man, the lieutenant
has lots to learn.

572
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,928
He'd better learn fast,

573
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,198
or he's going to get himself
a bullet in his dunce cap.

574
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,468
Six, we've lost
the blood trail.

575
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,702
It completely disappeared.

576
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:36,772
We're requesting
you pick us up at the LZ. Over.

577
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,374
Negative. I want you
to circle around southeast.

578
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,744
The rest of the company
is landing at 223-472.

579
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,115
I say again, 223-472. Over.

580
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,849
Roger.

581
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,185
Rejoin you
at 223-472. Out.

582
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,589
All right, gentlemen.
We're moving out. Southeast.

583
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,390
We're joining
the rest of the company.

584
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,791
All right, let's move.
Move, move, move.

585
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:56,792
Percell, come on.

586
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,994
Taylor, what are you,
a tourist?

587
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,496
Come on. Let's do it.
Come on.

588
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,302
Hey, Taylor.
What?

589
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,437
Tell me something.

590
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,506
Be honest.
Be real honest, okay?

591
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,174
You ever kill anybody?

592
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,375
Where do you
come from, fool?

593
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,943
I just asked a question, man.

594
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,778
Don't ask.

595
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,181
I'll just get
a GTO, man,

596
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:21,651
One that's candy apple red
with four on the floor, man.

597
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,620
Hey, shut up.

598
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,455
Oh, you don't
like cars, man?

599
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,757
No, man. I hate cars.
I like subways.

600
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,560
You know what?
New York, buddy--

601
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,961
Hey, you watch it,
dumb and ugly.

602
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,396
Who are you calling
dumb and ugly?

603
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,631
Hey! Shut up up there.

604
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,175
What have you got?

605
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,543
A wire.

606
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,077
Oh, yeah.
Careful, Zeke.

607
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,880
C-4.

608
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,783
Johnson, you've got
yourself an eagle eye.

609
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,985
It's my tail.

610
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,787
Lieutenant, we've got
a C-4 block here.

611
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,323
The way I see it,
we can either blow it up,

612
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,857
in which case everybody's

613
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,726
going to know we're here
in the vicinity,

614
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,429
or we can disarm it.

615
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,031
Disarm it.

616
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,433
Okay.

617
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,547
God.

618
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,620
It reminds me
of your mama, Baker.

619
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,188
My mother?

620
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,056
Yeah, your mother.

621
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,672
Here she is.

622
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,906
Ain't she pretty?

623
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,575
All right, let's saddle up.
Let's go.

624
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,144
Keep your eyes open.
Move real slow.

625
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,586
Okay, Percell, you're going
to take point for a while.

626
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,887
Johnson, stay
right with him.

627
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,624
Let's go, let's go.
Watch your step, now.

628
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,195
What's the matter?

629
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,064
You don't like
lizards, Baker?

630
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,566
Stop it, man.

631
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,167
Hey, come on,
that was a boss lizard.

632
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,069
Ruiz, get back here.

633
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,437
Ruiz!

634
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,019
Ruiz! Ruiz,
get the hell back.

635
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,588
I saw two gooks, sarge.

636
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,191
Where?
Right there.

637
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,226
They went
into the bushes.

638
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,628
All right. Go back,
get the lieutenant.

639
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,963
Stay low and be quiet.
Okay.

640
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,561
Where are they?

641
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,995
Today's your lucky day,
lieutenant.

642
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,331
Right over the hill there.

643
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,532
That's got
to be the headquarters

644
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,166
for that bunch
we're looking for.

645
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,068
All right.

646
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,570
I'm going
to radio the C.O.

647
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,572
I think we're way in
over our head.

648
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,441
Bless your heart.

649
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,079
Come on, move out.

650
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,581
Stay low. Keep quiet.

651
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,351
Let's go. Move out.

652
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,586
Bravo Six, this is
Bravo Two. Over.

653
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,620
Location, Bravo Two?

654
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,789
Click 406-379.

655
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,725
We've got an enemy camp here,
NVA regulars.

656
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,827
Bingo!
What do you need? Over.

657
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,228
We want artillery.

658
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,563
Come on, move out.

659
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,097
Oh, God.

660
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,733
Look, sergeant.

661
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,369
A wire, sergeant. A wire.

662
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,103
Freeze, Lawrence.
Don't move.

663
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,304
Stay right
where you are, man.

664
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,540
Don't worry.

665
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,042
I'm all right.

666
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,779
I ain't going nowhere.

667
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,783
I think I pressed it
already, sergeant.

668
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,885
Help me.

669
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,355
I think I already
pushed it a little.

670
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,924
Oh, God.

671
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,292
I'll just stay right here.

672
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,094
Just stay still, Lawrence.
Just stay still.

673
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:25,961
Oh, no.

674
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,575
Come on, let's go, let's go!

675
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,810
Keep up our fire!

676
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,965
Come on, Horn!

677
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,603
Bravo six,
this is Bravo Two.

678
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,739
We've got about
five minutes to live here.

679
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,473
We've got about
five minutes to live here!

680
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,609
Now where the hell's
the artillery?

681
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,110
We cannot fire
at this time.

682
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,613
We have ARVN choppers
in the vicinity. Over.

683
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,615
Well, tell them
to get the hell out of there!

684
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,283
Ask about air support.

685
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,619
Air control!
Got any birds in RAO? Go!

686
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,722
Hold on.
I'm checking it out.

687
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,758
Oh, they hell with it, come on.
we can outrun them in the bush.

688
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,125
I've got a better idea.

689
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,527
I'll get over on their flank.

690
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,394
Ruiz! Johnson!

691
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,267
What are you going to do?

692
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,269
I'm gonna take them out,
I hope. Here we go.

693
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,142
Aah!

694
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,644
Medic!

695
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,614
I'm hit, I'm hit!

696
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,148
There's some of them
behind us!

697
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,017
Behind us, yes.

698
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,654
Excuse me, guy.

699
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,656
It hurts, man. It hurts.

700
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,091
You'll be all right.

701
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,127
Just a little flesh wound.

702
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,363
Fire! Lay it down!
Lay it down!

703
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,451
Ruiz...

704
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,253
lay down fire.
We're going to get the flank.

705
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,321
Do it!

706
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,011
Ready? Pins.

707
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:57,513
Go!

708
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,457
Go, Johnson!

709
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,102
Can you get them
from here?

710
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,537
Never miss.

711
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,372
You're beautiful. All right, you
see those long, narrow boxes?

712
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,440
That's just got to be ammo.

713
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,947
Come on, baby.
We've only got one of those.

714
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:31,814
This one's for Mickey.

715
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,606
We found them hiding
in the bunker down there.

716
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,108
We've got maps,
radio equipment, everything.

717
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,609
Real good work, men.

718
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,113
This is just what
division wanted.

719
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,147
Congratulations.

720
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,615
Thank you, sir.

721
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,352
I think the lieutenant
should get a commendation.

722
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,620
Well, thank you, sir,

723
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,288
but here's the man
who deserves the credit.

724
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,289
Oh, no.

725
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,791
You're a fast learner.

726
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,225
Finally got myself
a lieutenant I like.

727
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,427
And I got myself
a good sergeant.

728
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,000
Look out!

729
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,441
Don't shoot.
You'll hit Horn!

730
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,445
[GUNSHOT]

731
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,610
Hey, are you
all right?

732
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,113
I killed him.

733
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,614
I killed him.

734
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,216
What you did
was you saved our lives.

735
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,851
That's what
you're supposed to do.

736
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,286
Do yourself a favor.

737
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,190
Next time,
use one of these.

738
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,126
This war's wrong.

739
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,127
Maybe...

740
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,795
but that's not the point.
