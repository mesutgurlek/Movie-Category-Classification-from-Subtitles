1
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,119
All right, oars up.

2
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,139
Welcome to Rocky Point, boys.

3
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,184
Bring her in.

4
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,461
(men chattering)

5
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:30,909
Another one.

6
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:32,898
Got it.

7
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,649
- What now?
- We go visit an old friend.

8
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:38,561
Come on.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,756
Our target lives in the hamlet
known as Rocky Point.

10
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,907
He's a former resident of Setauket

11
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:50,424
using his wealth and standing

12
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,924
to masquerade as a Tory,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,510
hiding in plain sight.

14
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,013
Today we rein in this traitor

15
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,415
quietly poisoning the countryside.

16
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:08,792
His name is Samuel Culper.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,856
- <i> (door bursts open)</i>
- (screams)

18
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,074
Don't move! Don't move!

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,828
- Don't move!
- (guns cocking)

20
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,331
Caleb Brewster?

21
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,534
Hello, Beekman.

22
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,252
You men will leave with me.

23
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,168
The rest of the unit
will keep their posts.

24
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,561
We shall return after daybreak tomorrow.

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,593
Sir, all this for one man?

26
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:34,929
Kill a Queen's Ranger? Are you insane?

27
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,383
A touch. But I wouldn't worry
yourself about this one.

28
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,118
<i>He'll be dead before
he knows what hit him.</i>

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,293
I imagine it will be quite
the surprise for him.

30
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:45,940
Fall out!

31
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,232
(Robert growls)

32
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:56,885
Ah.

33
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,437
Dead man marching.

I've never spent a night
away from Thomas.

51
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,960
You must think I'm foolish.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,024
A mother's concern is never foolish.

53
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:37,664
In fact, your sensibility
is why I'm here.

54
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,329
I need your help.

55
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,323
I'm doing everything I can
to broker a truce

56
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,125
between Abraham and Major Hewlett.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
- I doubt that can be done.
- But I've done it, Mary.

58
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,162
Nearly, that is.

59
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:02,251
Hewlett has agreed to let you, Abe,
and Thomas leave Setauket unharmed.

60
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:05,504
But Abe has no plans
to honor this agreement.

61
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,425
In fact, he plans to betray it

62
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,508
and murder Hewlett.

63
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:14,980
The major is using me
as collateral against my husband.

64
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:17,266
Forgive me if my sympathy
for him is lacking.

65
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:19,351
I'm not appealing to your sympathy.

66
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:22,620
Abe has no plans to leave
even after the deed is done.

67
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:26,825
He is determined to stay
and continue his work for Washington

68
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,028
no matter how much danger it puts him in

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,794
or you or Thomas.

70
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,225
Reason with him, Mary.

71
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,785
He won't listen to me anymore.

72
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,206
- Perhaps he'll listen to you.
- I believe in Abraham.

73
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,042
And I have faith
that he will protect us.

74
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:45,980
If you don't share that belief, maybe
it's you who should leave Setauket.

75
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,946
Maybe that's what's best for everyone.

Reverend. Morning.

79
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,755
Ah, Benjamin.

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,515
Will you be traveling
along with the camp?

81
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,326
No, no, I'm off to Fairfield.

82
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,660
What, New Jersey?

83
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,380
Yeah, the good Reverend Martin

84
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:23,882
has been ministering to my home
church in my stead.

85
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,251
He hasn't been paid in quite some time.

86
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,754
Riding out after the morning
benediction to see it done.

87
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,889
That means you'll be crossing
through no man's land.

88
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,391
That's far too dangerous.

89
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,728
I can't abandon my duties
because the road is rough.

90
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:38,897
Reverend, you haven't read
the scouting reports.

91
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,067
Tory cowboys hunt
for men traveling alone.

92
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,319
Let me send an escort along with you.

93
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,271
I've made the trip before, my son.

94
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:50,159
Don't worry. I'll be back before
the camp reaches Middle Brook.

95
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,781
<i>Now, let's begin with
the words of salm 23.</i>

"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,371
He maketh me to lie down

<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

100

<i>He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness</i>

101
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,434
<i>for His name's sake.</i>

<i>(door opens)</i>

- Anything?
- Not yet.

108
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:37,382
The men are patrolling
the main route into town

109
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:40,219
and they're to report to me
any news of Simcoe's return.

110
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:42,221
Or lack thereof.

111
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:45,224
I know this is difficult, waiting,

112
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,142
but try not to worry.

113
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,394
I have faith we'll hear the right news.

114
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,013
It's not that. It's...

115
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,450
I never gave you an answer

116
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,904
when we spoke before
about your proposal.

117
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,050
Oh.

118
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,542
I understand. I know
these things take time.

119
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,005
I have considered it.

120
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,248
And I do wish to marry you.

121
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,634
Oh.

122
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,589
But if we are to live
as husband and wife,

123
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,516
it can't be here in Setauket.

124
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,478
But you... you live here.

125
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,821
What's this?

126
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:29,285
It's from my husband.

127
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:31,877
From Selah.

128
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:36,525
He's in Philadelphia now
and wishes to remarry.

129
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:39,361
He's arranged to purchase a divorce

130
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,044
and has asked me to sign.

131
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:45,181
The truth is I received this weeks ago

132
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,171
and I've been busy pretending I didn't.

133
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,624
But now with things as they
are between you and me,

134
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,042
I just... I can't...

135
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,794
He's asking you to assume the fault.

136
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:59,168
And to confess to committing
adultery with Abraham Woodhull.

137
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,352
Well, we will not concede
to this blackmail.

138
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,554
Selah Strong is a traitor to the Crown

139
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,139
and we can petition the magistrate

140
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,890
for a divorce on the
grounds of desertion.

141
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,226
- Judge Woodhull despises me.
- No, not at all.

142
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,228
He holds me in no favor.

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,030
And the truth is I did commit adultery.

144
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,816
And I won't allow
my shame to become yours.

145
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:22,321
Anna, nothing you can do
can cause me to feel shame.

146
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:23,560
Nothing.

147
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,329
If you truly mean that...

148
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,832
you'll go away with me.

149
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:36,501
Where?

150
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:37,751
To your home.

151
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,063
To Scotland.

152
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,508
But you'd still be married.

153
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,422
We'd be guilty of bigamy.

154
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:48,943
That wouldn't follow us
across the ocean.

155
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,900
We can start a new life together.

156
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,487
This is our chance, Edmund.

157
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:59,135
Then we shall seize it.

158

You've strayed from the path, Reverend.

161
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,463
Benjamin. What are you doing here?

162
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,887
We received word
that you were a traitor,

163
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,384
but now I have the proof.

164
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,545
Proof?

165
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,589
Oh, no, this... this isn't what...

166
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,342
- let me... let me explain.
- Explain what?

167
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:10,312
How you were paid
by Royal Governor Tryon

168
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:13,265
and Mayor Mathews to spy on our camp?

169
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,733
- No.
- No?

170
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,768
Well, perhaps
the contents of that letter

171
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,294
can clear things up, eh?

172
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,440
Why not read it to me?

173
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,746
Read the letter.

174
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:39,040
(stuttering) "I write to you
with important information

175
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,927
about Washington's movements.

176
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,349
The main army, consisting
of the Virginia, Maryland,

177
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,434
and Pennsylvania brigades...

178
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:53,463
is moving to Middle Brook

179
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,607
near the Bridgewater Township."

180
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,662
Why?

181
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:02,471
Why do this, hmm?

182
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,034
Why, for politics? For money?

183
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,966
As an act of grace.

184
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:15,327
I minister to the sick
and dying every day.

185
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,927
I see their agony

186
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,783
while I pray for their deliverance.

187
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,002
Washington is a fool.

188
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,004
(gunshot)

189
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,973
(gasping)

190
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,047
<i>(groaning)</i>

191
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,901
(gasping)

192
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,354
Arnold: <i>General Howe left
this place a pigsty.</i>

193
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,357
Holes in the floorboards.
Garbage in the cellar.

194
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,053
Flies everywhere.

195
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,529
I've restored her to her former glory.

196
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,236
As I did Philadelphia.

197
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,701
Hmm, the spoils of war.

198
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,903
She's quite the prize.

199
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,840
I only hope to provide for Peggy

200
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,252
as well as her father has.

201
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:19,212
Benedict, you need not worry
yourself to impress my family.

202
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,264
Oh, I'm not sure I agree.

203
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,517
As the eldest sister, I must assure
our youngest is in good hands.

204
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,054
You must forgive Betsy. She takes her
responsibilities very seriously.

205
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,772
As she should. And I concur
with you, Elizabeth.

206
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,407
I want nothing but the best
for my exoneration.

207
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,030
Exoneration? From what?

208
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,567
From the baseless charges that
Joseph Reed sought to tar me with.

209
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,369
General Washington advised me

210
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,738
to apply for a court-martial to
clear my name once and for all,

211
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,456
and, mercy, was he right.

212
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,875
The slanders were referred to a
committee headed by William Paca

213
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,910
and he saw fit to dismiss them all.

214
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,148
How fortunate for you.

215
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,414
Fortune favors the bold, sir...

216
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,050
- <i> (door opens)</i>
- ...and smiles upon the righteous.

217
00:13:57,085 --> 00:14:00,387
I sent Paca a case
of Bourgogne to thank him.

218
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,049
I'm even feeling generous enough to
invite the Honorable Mr. Reed,

219
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:04,591
-  to dinner tonight.
- <i> (door closes)</i>

220
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,179
Sir, Major Edward Burd has arrived.

221
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,016
- Neddy?
- Neddy.

222
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,319
Arnold: <i>As I said, we
have much to celebrate.</i>

223
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,271
An exoneration and a homecoming.

224
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:21,157
I can't thank you enough, Betsy.

225
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,443
During the darkest days of my captivity,

226
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,195
your letters kept me going.

227
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,664
How long will you be joining us?

228
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,219
Indefinitely.

229
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,701
General Arnold interceded
with Washington

230
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,503
<i>to grant me a furlough from his staff</i>

231
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:37,291
so I might finish
my recuperation at home.

232
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,877
I think you will find
the restorative powers

233
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,296
of the Shippen ladies
to be quite an elixir.

234
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,613
<i>(Neddy chuckles)</i>

235
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:45,587
Neddy.

236
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:49,853
How... when did you manage this?

237
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,690
I will move the heavens for you.

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,980
- (Abe humming)
- (hammering)

239
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,490
It's a shame I can't remember,
isn't it, Sprout, huh?

240
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,799
You know, your grandfather
used to sing that to me

241
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,001
and your uncle before bed.

242
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,586
And you wouldn't think it
to look at him,

243
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,755
but he actually had quite a nice voice.

244
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,008
You want to build the house? Yeah?

245
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,677
Come on.

246
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,762
Come on. Give it a go.

247
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,731
See this nail right here?
Give it a whack.

248
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,149
Go on. There you go.

249
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,151
A little harder, like this.

250
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,187
Right?

251
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,689
There you go.

252
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:44,595
(grunts)

253
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,528
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

254
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,071
There you go.

255
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,311
(clears throat)

256
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,622
Any word on Simcoe?

257
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,377
He set off this morning.
We won't hear for some time.

258
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,144
All right.

259
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,048
But...

260
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,430
whatever happens,

261
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,052
I've just come here to tell you

262
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,438
that you don't have
to worry about the major.

263
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,774
No, we're not talking about this.

264
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,495
You told me to make a choice.

265
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:24,613
I have.

266
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,286
There's no one coming for you, Abe.

267
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,646
You really think I'd do that?

268
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,742
All right, then.

269
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,007
Why don't I have to worry?

270
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,220
Because we're going to be married,

271
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:49,721
Edmund and I, in England.

272
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,675
He'll resign his post here,
then we'll leave from New York.

273
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,394
So you don't have to kill him

274
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,094
because he'll be gone.

275
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,267
What are you doing?

276
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:02,861
Anna.

277
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,438
- I just told you.
- Why?

278
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,107
You wouldn't listen before.
Why should I explain it now?

279
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,409
What about the ring, hmm?

280
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,527
Townsend signals through the "Gazette."

281
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,758
I'm no longer needed.

282
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,869
What about... what about us?

283
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,862
There is no us, Abe.

284
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,006
- You saw to that.
- Oh, I saw to that?

285
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,508
What, are you doing this just to
spite me? Is that what it is?

286
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,427
- No. - You'd marry a man out of spite?

287
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,295
- It's not about spite.
- Well, what is it about, then?

288
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,707
Love?

289
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:37,372
Why...

290
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,228
do you love him?

291
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,894
I love him enough...

292
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,068
to save his life.

293
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,506
(grunts)

294
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:08,444
That's no way to treat a
man of God, Tallmadge.

295
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,983
- (gun cocks)
- No need to move.

296
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:12,842
<i>You're fine there.</i>

297
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,702
Gamble?

298
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,473
So you do know my name.

299
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,906
Spares me the introduction.

300
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,794
Tell me, Major, what did your
lot do with that fool Shanks?

301
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,307
Hang him? Enlist him?

302
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,754
You were the reverend's contact.

303
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,385
So he was working for André.

304
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,054
<i>We were supposed
to meet today, actually.</i>

305
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,890
Looks like you spared me
that introduction as well.

306
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,677
Move to shore.

307
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,203
Slow and steady.

308
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,057
That's far enough.

309
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,332
Turn around.

310
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,045
Now kneel down.

311
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,220
I am an officer in the Continental Army.

312
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,190
Protocol dictates... (grunts)

313
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,752
- (playing)
- (men chattering)

314
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:50,564
I bet you never tell your wife about
the old days, do you, Beekman?

315
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:51,879
<i>No?</i>

316
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,213
When you were the terror of Setauket.

317
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,070
No?

318
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,290
<i>Oh, he used to put cow pies in
mine and Abe and Ben's food.</i>

319
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,043
Used to beat up on us just 'cause
he was bigger and he could.

320
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,410
Well, little Caleb Brewster here,

321
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,501
he ain't so small anymore, is he?

322
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,253
(muffled shouting)

323
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,194
(gasps)

324
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,641
Caleb, please.

325
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,761
Whatever I did, it was a long time ago.

326
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,564
We were young. I was rowdy and...

327
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,933
- And you were an arsehole
and you still are.

328
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,235
- (muffled screaming)
- Caleb:<i> Hey!</i>

329
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,321
- Settle down, you.
- What?

330
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,739
Just trying to have a bit of fun.

331
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,274
Caleb: <i>Yeah, well, I
need you able and ready,</i>

332
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,742
not messing with the ladies, all right?

333
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:37,027
Can't have you going off like last time.

334
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:42,499
It might be a while
before Simcoe gets here.

335
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,785
I've got to pass the time somehow.

336
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,121
You listen here.

337
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,839
I'm only gonna say this once.

338
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,931
I had my chance with
Simcoe before, all right?

339
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,178
But the bastard slipped
through my fingers.

340
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,046
That won't be happening again.

341
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,442
Still not used to all
the quiet in the house.

342
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:18,627
It's so strange not having Thomas here.

343
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,456
I hope Abraham is all right
with him alone on the farm.

344
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:26,577
Perhaps Abraham should have considered
that before he betrayed us all.

345
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,496
- He'll do fine.
- How do you know that?

346
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,467
Because I raised him on my own.

347
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,335
Abe and his brother
after my wife passed.

348
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:35,970
Look how well that turned out.

349
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:40,724
I've heard rumblings there's a
room available at Strong Manor.

350
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,677
When exactly will you be depriving
us all of your presence?

351
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,973
Richard, please.

352
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:47,982
I'll be damned if I let this harlot

353
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,100
speak to me in that
manner in my own house.

354
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,319
You will address her with respect, sir.

355
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:54,238
<i>And if you cannot manage to do that,</i>

356
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,939
<i>then that will be our friendship ended.</i>

357
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,074
Why are you defending her?

358
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,194
Because, sir, she is to be my wife.

359
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:03,197
(laughs)

360
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,037
- Is this true?
- Anna: Yes, it is.

361
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,006
We're to be married as soon as possible.

362
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:17,711
Congratulations. I hope that you
two will find happiness together.

363
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:21,382
Thank you, Mary. She makes me
more happy than you can imagine.

364
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,554
So you've gone hand in hand
with the enemy once again.

365
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,630
- What are you talking about? - Abraham.

366
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,395
You've made some sort of
pact with him, haven't you?

367
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,899
- What?
- I give up my own son as a traitor

368
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,951
to stop my grandson
following in his footsteps,

369
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,928
only now the boy is back with
his father who walks free.

370
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:44,922
Why?

371
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,875
Because he's gifted you this woman?

372
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,910
- <i> (chair scrapes)</i>
- That is enough, Richard.

373
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,712
This has nothing to do with Abraham.

374
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,290
<i>You've only got yourself
to blame on that account.</i>

375
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:57,668
If you'd have told me what you knew sooner,
then none of this would have happened.

376
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,671
(utensils clatter)

377
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,474
Excuse me.

378
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,096
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- (exhales)

379
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:14,749
We're not leaving.

380
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,404
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- What?

381
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
We'll stay here in Setauket

382
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,492
and be married here.

383
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,527
Edmund, please.

384
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,113
I don't care what Richard
or anyone else says.

385
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,450
I love you for who you are

386
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,201
and for all that you are.

387
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,170
And I want the world to know it.

388
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,039
No. No, you can't stay.

389
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,374
We can't stay.

390
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,759
What, because of your reputation?

391
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,879
Because... because of the danger.

392
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,297
B-because of Simcoe.

393
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,798
Yes, and that is being taken care of.

394
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,968
- You don't know that.
- I am done running, Anna.

395
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,772
If not for you, I would have fled as
soon as I came back from Connecticut.

396
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:53,607
But you gave me the strength to stay on.

397
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:57,644
It would be wrong of me to now
encourage you to flee from your home,

398
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:02,116
especially when I'm capable
of keeping you safe here.

399
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:05,013
<i>Now, write your husband</i>

400
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,988
and tell him that you agree
to his terms of divorce

401
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,040
and then we'll be married immediately.

402
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,997
Though we will surely have to
find another magistrate to do it.

403
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:28,509
- (horse snorts)
- <i> (owl hooting)</i>

<i>(metal rattling)</i>

412

- Rangers out back.
- What?

413
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,269
- Sons of whores.
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

414

Back to the shore!

(groans)

422
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,818
All right, next volley,
fire and then we run.

423
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,987
On the way back to the
beach, you, then me.

424
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,322
You ready?

425
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:56,573

00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,635
Don't let him get to the shore!

<i>(gunshot)</i>

Take cover! Look to the rear.

431
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,277
Psst.

432
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,749
<i>(Simcoe whispering)
Flank him, carefully.</i>

433

(rifle cocks)

434
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:56,107
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- Neddy endured deplorable conditions

435
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,027
during his captivity and
braved them with distinction.

436
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,853
Betsy: <i>Do you think
he's here to propose?</i>

437
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:04,639
Oh, Neddy marches to the
beat of his own drummer.

438
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,369
We shouldn't hasten the tempo.

439
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,277
There's no reason why you
shouldn't be married immediately.

440
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:12,697
Long engagements are for milksops
who can't finish the job.

441
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,499
But, sir, I haven't even proposed.

442
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:17,569
I would ask for Betsy's hand, Uncle,

443
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:21,706
<i>but I fear I don't have the means to
support her on a soldier's wages.</i>

444
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,791
If it's money that you're
worried about, then don't.

445
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:25,910
I've arranged for you
to begin a law clerkship.

446
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,162
Is this another favor
to be accounted for?

447
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,574
An appointment.

448
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,398
One granted by Judge Shippen himself.

449
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:35,253
After Neddy's valor on
and off the battlefield,

450
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,555
it's the very least that we can
do to honor his sacrifice.

451
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:40,342
Yes, I'm in need of a prothonotary.

452
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:42,894
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court

453
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,513
would do well to have
a man of your acumen, Neddy.

454
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:47,899
This young man survived
a British prison ship

455
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,350
and Haller's battalion.

456
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,250
I'm quite certain he can handle a desk.

457
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,939
Perhaps you should stop seeing
demons where there are none.

458
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,858
Perhaps you're right.

459
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Esther: <i>So, you two can agree.</i>

460
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,220
The impossible is possible.

461
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,034
Joseph, would you show me that
lovely painting in the foyer?

462
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,202
I want to see all its beauty up close.

463
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,954
Of course. If you'll excuse us.

464
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,131
General.

465
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:16,187
I've always fancied a Christmas wedding.

466
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:19,380
You expect Grandfather to
travel through ice and snow?

467
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,935
Spring is a grand time for a wedding.

468
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,467
Perhaps even summer.

469
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:28,439
The city will be flush and in bloom

470
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,391
and you'll be even more radiant.

471
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,139
I'm not you, Peggy.

472
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,448
I'm not the most beautiful
girl in the colonies

473
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,033
or Father's favorite.

474
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:42,070
Why delay my only chance at happiness?

475
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,595
(clinks)

476
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,577
(clears throat)

477
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,163
I would like to thank
you all for being here

478
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,585
to celebrate the good fortune that
has graced many of us in this room.

479
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,931
After trials and adversities,

480
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:03,975
<i>we all have much to be grateful for.</i>

481
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:05,459
A toast.

482
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:09,147
To young love renewed

483
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,649
and to honor restored.

484
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,602
Hear, hear.

485
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,992
Now, I believe that
Major Burd has something

486
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:23,861
that he would like to... Neddy?

487
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,448
<i>(door opens)</i>

488
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,450
A message for you from camp, sir.

489
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,419
I'll see to it after dinner.

490
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,588
<i>It came with a note from
General Washington, sir.</i>

491
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,590
<i>He expressed that you were
to read it immediately.</i>

492
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,899
Betsy...

493
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,627
Elizabeth.

494
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,630
<i>It seems as if I have
known you my entire life,</i>

495
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,466
<i>which I have, of course.</i>

496
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:48,112
<i>And I have always loved you</i>

497
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,834
as more than a cousin.

498
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,861
Excuse me.

499
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,980
- Sir, if I may...
- Not now, Franks.

500
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,448
Benedict.

501
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,816
Benedict, what's wrong?

502
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,618
Congress has rejected Paca's decision

503
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,787
and referred the charges against
me back to a court-martial.

504
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:08,289
- But I thought you said...
- Reed. It was Reed.

505
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,124
He threatened to split
Pennsylvania from the body

506
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
and they gave in to him.

507
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:14,295
I'm right back to where I started.

508
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,733
Hello, Quarles. How are you?

509
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,319
- Major Rogers?
- Drop it.

510
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:40,855
Hello, boys.

511
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:44,075
Well, this is...

512
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:46,911
unexpected.

513
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:50,164
(laughs) I suppose you
must be used to that.

514
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,700
I could have crept up
on you in broad daylight.

515
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:56,003
The famed Robert Rogers.

516
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,955
I've longed to meet you in person, sir.

517
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,758
<i>Oh, well, you'll just have to
keep on longing, won't you?</i>

518
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:03,544
Because I'm going to make
haste with Quarles here.

519
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:07,465
And I suppose we'll have tea and scones
sometime at Westminster, shall we?

520
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,433
Drop it. Drop it, Brandon.

521
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,854
I'm afraid they don't take
orders from you anymore, Major.

522
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:14,472
We'll see about that.

523
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:18,559
You take one more step to me, I
will cut his throat wide open.

524
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,561
Go ahead.

525
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,280
Rogers: <i>You hear that, boys?</i>

526
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:26,033
That ghost would have you dead.

527
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,236
<i>You think I'd have done that to you?</i>

528
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:31,038
I would die for you boys.

529
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,957
You know that.

530
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:35,042
I would die for you!

531
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,911
Put your guns down!

532
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:40,584
That's all right.

533
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:45,056
We can settle this in the old fashion.

534
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,080
Weapons down, gentlemen.

535
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:54,095
Weapons down!

536
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:57,993
If Major Rogers manages to kill me,

537
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,236
<i>I order you to let him leave unharmed.</i>

538
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:04,739
Or follow him if you so choose.

539
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,526
Get out of here.

540
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:14,916
I am going to carve you up, ginger.

541
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,621
Come on. Come on, boy.

542
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:22,290
Yeah?

543
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:29,597
You're old, fat, and slow.

544
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,048
You're the past.

549
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:49,617
The only thing I can't work out

550
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,037
is why you decided
to return to Long Island,

551
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:57,825
especially after the king
signed a warrant for...

552
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,414
you're Culper.

553
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,585
Oh, that's brilliant.

554
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:10,721
You hid your treachery in plain sight.

555
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:13,057
A mercenary through and through.

556
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:16,811
Playing both sides against one another.

557
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:19,931
A true American.

558
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,188
Are you looking for this?

00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,157
(laughs)

560
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,861
It's a shame, really,
when... when the mind goes.

Find him!

564
00:35:57,136 --> 00:36:00,521
He's got one eye! Find him!

565

Hungry?

570
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:31,916
Where are we?

571
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:34,088
You're on your way to meet Major André.

572

<i>That's the least you could do for me</i>

573
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,843
seeing that you fouled my mission.

574
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,511
I won't talk.

575
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:42,763
You might as well kill me now.

576
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,926
Oh, I'd love to.

577
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,430
Give you a second smile

578
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,238
like I did for your old man Sackett.

579

<i>But I got chastised, you see.</i>

580
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,023
Won't make the same mistake twice.

581
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,330
Though after the major
gets done with you,

582
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,867
<i>I expect he'll have me see you vanished.</i>

583
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,055
After all, you're not in uniform,

584
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,358
so the rules are off the table.

588
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:43,050
Are you sure there's nothing we can do?

589
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,551
No, dear, I'll look after him

590
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,886
and make sure he has all he needs.

591
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,972
You're not intending to stay here?

592
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:51,191
I understand your concern, but
there's propriety to be considered.

593
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,561
It would be improper not to
support my future husband.

594
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,730
He just received word
that his sister is unwell.

595
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,365
Imagine his distress, Father.

596

I'll send the carriage

Yes, and be sure to thank him

As much as we've been in conflict,

602
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,062

the justice he deserves.

Don't I deserve the loyalty

619
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,472
He wouldn't even have an army to
command if it weren't for me,

620
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,307
and yet he deprives me of command.

621
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,725
He deprives me of glory.

622
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:17,141
And now he deprives me of my honor.

could do to them, Peggy.

When the city was occupied,

630

He wanted to end this war.

Said England should make
peace with the colonies.

634
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,624
When the army left for New York, he said

635
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,521
if I came across any Patriots
who thought likewise,

636

<i>I should write to him and let him know.</i>

I listened politely,

to take him up on his offer.
