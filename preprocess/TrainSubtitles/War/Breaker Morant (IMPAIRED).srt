You are aware

You can be quite sure
a quick conviction of these men...

They did the actual killing.

But they were only following
Morant's orders.

01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,513
That's right, just as Morant
was following orders.

You do realize, of course, that when high
command denies that the orders are issued...

have to be observed, sir.

01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,152
What do I say?

934
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,104
I think you know what to say.

935
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,157
- [ Officer] Shall be the truth.
- Shall be the truth.

936
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,908
- The whole truth.
- The whole truth.

937
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,911
- And nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.

938
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,369
Thank you, sir. If you'd like
to take the witness chair, please.

939
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,931
Colonel Hamilton...

940
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,729
last July, Captain Hunt
took two polo ponies...

941
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,900
to Lord Kitchener's headquarters
in Pretoria.

942
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,818
At which time,
you had a conversation with him...

943
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,067
regarding Boer prisoners.

944
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,241
Do you recall that conversation?

945
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,445
I have no recollection whatever.

946
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,201
I have never spoken to Captain Hunt...

947
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:12,079
with reference to his duties
in the northern Transvaal.

948
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,580
- You're a liar!
- Order!

949
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,412
You are under oath, sir.

950
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,963
I am aware of that.

951
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,168
Major Thomas, I trust you'll agree
that closes the issue...

952
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,004
of the alleged orders
to shoot prisoners.

953
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,190
On the contrary, sir...

954
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,359
I regard Colonel Hamilton's denial...

955
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,534
as having no bearing at all
on the defense.

956
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,409
I submit that it is, in fact...

957
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,035
inadmissible evidence.

958
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,250
A conversation
is stated to have taken place...

959
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:03,460
between Captain Hunt
and Colonel Hamilton...

960
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:08,174
which conversation
was relayed by Captain Hunt...

961
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,884
to Lieutenant Morant.

962
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,313
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Captain Hunt had his instructions.

963
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,390
The fact is clear from the evidence...

964
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,774
that Captain Hunt did tell
his subordinates not once...

965
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,652
but several times
that no prisoners were to be taken.

966
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:29,077
This fact is admitted
by witnesses for the prosecution.

967
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:35,785
Captain Hunt's instructions
were entitled to be obeyed...

968
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,336
which goes to remove any suggestion...

969
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,382
of malicious intention
on the part of the defendants.

970
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:47,338
This entire court-martial, sir,
should be dismissed!

971
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,848
Let us pray.

972
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,642
O Lord of hosts...

973
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,017
we entreat thy blessing
for the soldiers of our race...

974
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,439
called to do battle in South Africa.

975
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:02,190
Be thou a strong tower for them
against the enemy...

976
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,691
O thou who doth accomplish thy will...

977
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,240
by war as well as by peace.

978
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:10,694
Order the minds
of statesmen and generals...

979
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,576
that they may ever love
righteousness and equity.

980
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,874
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.

981
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,667
No trams or anything.

982
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:21,042
On a hot day, couldn't even get down
to Saint Kilda for a swim.

983
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,249
- Did you have family readings?
- No.

984
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,084
We did.

985
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,843
I had to sit in a high-backed chair
wearing a white lace collar...

986
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,301
while my father read selections
fro m <i>Pilgrim</i> is Progress.

987
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,768
“How glorious it was
to see the open region...

988
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,099
filled with horses...

989
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,810
and trumpeters and pipers...

990
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,067
singers, players.”

991
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,615
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

992
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,740
Sunday was a good day for chasing
a few tarts around Bathurst.

993
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,196
[ Morant Chuckles ]

994
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,907
- Everyone else was in church.
- N' [ Men Singing ]

995
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,085
I used to whip down the river bank
for a bit of smooching.

996
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,005
Worst thing about dying -
no more girls.

997
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,799
Well, coming up for the home stretch.

998
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,969
- Any news on the other two cases?
- No, nothing.

999
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,513
In my view, everything hinges
on the last one -

1000
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,512
the German missionary.

1001
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,636
Are you sticking with that story?

1002
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,471
Why? What's wrong with it?

1003
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:21,977
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.

1004
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,275
A few hours later,
you leave with a riﬂe.

1005
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,852
In the morning, he's dead.

1006
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,939
And you trot out some fairy tale...

1007
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,529
about shooting game.

1008
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,612
Eh?

1009
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,032
Harry?

1010
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,537
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.

1011
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,840
But refusal will be equivalent
to an admission of guilt.

1012
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,391
Sir, I was in a public house
a few nights ago, sir.

1013
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,889
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,562
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.

1015
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,811
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.

1016
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,149
<i>[ President]
We will proceed, gentlemen...</i>

1017
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,951
<i>with the final one
of the three charges</i> -

1018
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,031
<i>the death
of the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.</i>

1019
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,912
<i>Lieutenants Morant and Handcock
have pleaded not guilty...</i>

1020
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,996
<i>respectively, to inciting
and committing the murder.</i>

1021
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,080
<i>Major Bolton?</i>

1022
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,336
You realize you're under oath,
Corporal Sharp?

1023
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,883
Yes, sir, right, sir.

1024
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,131
This bloke'd say anything
except his prayers.

1025
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,509
On the 23rd day of August last...

1026
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,512
that being the last day
the Reverend Hesse was seen alive...

1027
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,060
you were on sentry duty,
is that correct?

1028
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,933
<i>[ Sharp ]
Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

1029
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,482
Did you - Did you see
the deceased that day?

1030
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,810
What, sir?

1031
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,942
The deceased. The Reverend Hesse.

1032
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,570
Ah, yes, sir, yes.
I saw the deceased that day, sir.

1033
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,401
<i>It was about 10:00 in the morning, sir.</i>

1034
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,781
- Lovely day, sir?
- Whoa!

1035
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,204
We could do with a drop of this weather
in London, you know?

1036
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,577
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah, it gets very foggy there, sir.

1037
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,705
You know, you can't see
a foot in front of your face.

1038
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,129
That's a hand, see? it's a joke.
Silly old bugger.

1039
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,877
I hope you drown
in your communion wine.

1040
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,004
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.

1041
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,757
It was signed by Captain Taylor.
And then he went off, sir.

1042
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:18,386
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?

1043
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,887
No, sir, not again, sir.

1044
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,597
Did you witness anything else
which might affect this court-martial?

1045
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,558
Yes, sir.
About a half an hour later, sir...

1046
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,735
<i>Lieutenant Handcock rode up
to Lieutenant Morant, sir.</i>

1047
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,233
<i>It was alongside a tent line, sir.</i>

1048
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,414
How did Lieutenant Handcock look?

1049
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,919
Like he was thinking, sir.

1050
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,422
Um, like, uh -

1051
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,969
I can't think of the -

1052
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,467
Did he look like he was agitated?

1053
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:02,596
Agitated. Yes, yes, that's it, sir.
Yes, sir, he looked agitated.

1054
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,973
Objection!
Major Bolton is leading the witness.

1055
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,054
I will rephrase the question, sir.

1056
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,317
Tell me, Corporal Sharp...

1057
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,520
how did Lieutenant Handcock look?

1058
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,480
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.

1059
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,191
Is there anything else
that you wish to tell the court?

1060
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,948
No, sir. Uh, yes, sir, yes, sir.

1061
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,534
They, sir -
Lieutenants Morant and Handcock -

1062
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,332
they weren't like real soldiers, sir.

1063
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,035
The troopers would actually call them
by their first names, sir.

1064
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,792
Right to their face, sir.

1065
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,544
Thank you, Corporal Sharp.
That'll be all.

1066
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,593
- Thank you, sir.
- Corporal Sharp.

1067
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,169
Sir.

1068
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,508
Why did you leave the Bushveldt Carbineers?

1069
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,809
I requested a transfer, sir.

1070
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,979
Were you not made to transfer?

1071
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,148
Were you not punished
by Lieutenant Handcock...

1072
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,727
for stealing a Boer's property
while on patrol?

1073
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,866
I can have your charge sheet
brought into the court, Corporal.

1074
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,078
Yes, sir. That's true, sir.

1075
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,952
And have you not been stating
in the hotels of Pietersburg...

1076
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,880
that you would walk barefoot
from Cape Town to Pietersburg...

1077
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:17,459
to be on a firing party
to shoot Lieutenant Handcock?

1078
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:21,263
Uh, I-l might have said that
over a pint, sir.

1079
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,341
You know, it'd only be the beer talking, sir.
Not me, sir.

1080
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,761
You testified previously...

1081
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,688
that you told the Reverend Hesse
not to speak with Boer prisoners.

1082
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,390
- Why was that?
- He was German.

1083
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,101
It was for security reasons.

1084
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,653
But we are not at war with Germany.

1085
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,608
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy
that Germany shows towards the Boers.

that war changes men's natures.
