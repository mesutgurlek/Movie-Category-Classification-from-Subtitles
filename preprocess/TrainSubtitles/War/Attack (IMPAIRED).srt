Fragile Fox, Fragile Fox. First squad.

4
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:33,580
First squad. Over to you, Lieutenant.

5
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,962
How about it, Ingersoll?
Gonna try for that pillbox?

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,637
We can give it a try, but we'll
need support if we get jammed.

7
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,263
They still got you pinned?

8
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,768
- Yes.
- Then we go ahead all the way.

9
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:56,233
But if we get pinned down, we'll need
Captain Cooney to get us outta there.

10
00:00:56,779 --> 00:01:01,571
- Fragile Fox, over and out.
- Heroes. Glory hounds.

11
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:07,781
Got that, Captain? First squad from
my platoon, they're going all the way.

12
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,559
Are your men set to support 'em?

13
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,837
Give me a hand signal. Out.

14
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,652
Höher.

15
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:57,702
Lousy mortar.
They got Ingersoll's squad zeroed in.

16
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,550
They're pinned by machine-gun fire.
Now they're getting it with mortars.

17
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,714
Attack from your side,
take the heat off of Ingersoll.

18
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,508
Fragile Fox One, this is Two.
Let's get the lead out!

19
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:14,183
Over and out.

20
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,021
Cooney, where are you?
You said you'd back them up!

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,782
It's up to you, Cooney. Do you hear me?

22
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,319
Cooney, where are you?!

23
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,491
Fall back!

24
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,469
Cooney! Cooney!

25
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,758
I can't hold.
The machine gun's still got us pinned.

26
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,102
You said you'd back them up!
Come in, Cooney.

27
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,933
Cooney! Cooney! Cooney, over!

28
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:08,149
It's all over, Lieutenant.

00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:12,279

Knock it off!

38
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:40,300
We've been waitin' around here for
two hours and you expect instant coffee.

39
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,510
Jackson, you ain't an orderly orderly.

40
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,681
And that jug is out of uniform.
It ain't wearing any rust.

41
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:51,067
- Fill it up. That oughta make it rusty.
- Very funny. Who's it for?

42
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,986
- Captain Cooney.
- Captain Cooney?

43
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:56,233
Every time Jackson runs an errand,
Cooney tips him a stripe.

44
00:05:56,366 --> 00:06:00,779
- Hurry. He's expecting Colonel Bartlett.
- There's a parlay for ya.

45
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:04,411
When you salute them two,
you gotta apologise to your arm.

46
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,791
- What's with Cooney and the colonel?
- What's the hot dope?

47
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
- You got the inside pipe to Cooney.
- Spit it.

48
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:15,713
We get Christmas in Paris, or do I
climb the walls to get to my pin-ups?

49
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,879
- The captain never tells me anything.
- Baloney.

50
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,800
Jackson, you're a traitor.

51
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,099
Besides, I don't trust soldiers
who shine their shoes.

52
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:28,098
Jackson! Jackson!

53
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:33,023
- His master's voice.
- Mother's calling.

54
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,192
- Coffee, Private?
- Why not?

55
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,563
I already got an ulcer.

56
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,283
Strong, ain't it?

57
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,748
- You called me, Captain?
- Yes, I called. Where are the forms?

58
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,006
- Which forms, sir?
- Which...?

59
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,718
The replacement forms.
They should be at Division today.

60
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:05,466
- Already sent them out, sir.
- Oh. OK.

61
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,808
Did you get the coffee?

62
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,022
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,188
Well, come on, come on!

64
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:20,482
The way they run this army...
Inefficiency, repetition.

65
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:26,369
Huh! I tell you, son, if I ran my business
back home the way they run this army,

66
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,738
I'd be bankrupt in a month.

67
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,791
- One month!
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,963
It'd be a break for the taxpayers
if they'd let some...

69
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,209
let some businessmen
take over for a change.

70
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,916
It's an interesting idea, Captain.

71
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,800
Get that box of cigars
out of my musette.

72
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:52,853
I want Clyde... Colonel Bartlett...
to feel like he was back home.

73
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:58,068
Like we was both back home.
Little ol' Riverview.

74
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:02,655
- Some cigars and a few ashtrays, too?
- Yeah, but nothing fancy.

75
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:07,528
We're just a couple of small-town
boys, the colonel and me. Understand?

76
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,702
We like our pleasures...

77
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,666
simple.

78
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:19,749
- Get a towel, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,506
- John?
- Yes, sir?

80
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,804
Did you get those requisitions
approved for the winter underwear?

81
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,688
Wouldn't you know it, sir?
Only the top parts.

82
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,270
Great. Just great.

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,520
Hi, there, Woody boy.
You all set for the game?

84
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,895
- All ready.
- The colonel will be along...

85
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,070
Where is Costa?

86
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,992
- Joe? Hasn't he shown up?
- No!

87
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,363
He's been getting a little out of line
lately. He's unofficer-like.

88
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,908
I'm sure you're mistaken, Captain.

89
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:02,209
John, you told the lieutenant
he was expected, didn't you?

90
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,385
Yes, sir. I told him this morning.

- Carry on, gentlemen. Corporal.
- Hey! Hi.

94
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,192
Erskine, Woodruff. Is this all?
You in a mind to play three-handed?

95
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:33,074
Costa's been held up.
I'm gonna put a torch under him now.

96
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,411
You do that, son.

97
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,747
And tell him I said
to bring plenty of money.

98
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,622
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,669
Well, Clyde! Glad you could get over!

100
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,802
Sure... Where's that bourbon
you were talkin' about?

101
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,052
Comin' right up.

102
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,518
You, uh, care for a little branch water?

103
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,322
You don't want me
to rust my plumbing, do you?

104
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:22,073
Ø Pittsburgh, mon père faisait ça.

105
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,748
Oh? Il était forgeron?

106
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:31,086
- Costa, where are you?
- I'm in here, Harry!

107
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,971
Yeah. Fabriquer...

108
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,353
Harry, how do you say "railroad tracks"?

109
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,807
- Des rails de chemin de fer.
- All right.

110
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,686
Des rails de chemin de fer.

111
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,278
Oh.

112
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,314
Harry, meet Monsieur Bouisse.

113
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,524
Monsieur Bouisse, Lieutenant Woodruff.

114
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,900
Enchanté. Enchanté.

115
00:10:56,036 --> 00:11:00,745
- This is his shop. It's nice, huh?
- Yeah. Look, you know what time it is?

116
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:05,335
Know how old this shop is? 500 years.

117
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:09,756
- It's been in his family all that time.
- I know, George Washington slept here.

118
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:12,339
Look, Joe, the colonel's here.

119
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,719
If we don't talk to him now,
we might not get another chance.

120
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,887
So he's here.

121
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,639
- All right, Jackson, take off.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,308
Don't worry about
little ol' Erskine Cooney.

123
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,478
- Sit down.
- Yeah.

124
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:36,564
- Well? Did you bring the letter?
- The letter?

125
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,274
- From my father.
- No, I'm sorry, I forgot.

126
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:43,990
- I left it up at headquarters.
- Oh... Well, that's all right.

127
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,122
Just that... he hasn't written to me
very much lately, and...

128
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:51,374
The judge's been busy,
what with elections coming.

129
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,215
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

130
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:57,422
But I reckon he'd be proud
if he could see me now.

131
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,675
Sure. You're a company commander
in the US Infantry.

132
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,264
Well told, I am. And, uh...

133
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:08,647
- when my citation comes through...
- Oh, yes. The, uh, citation.

134
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:13,686
That'll make up for those times
I let him down. You know what I mean?

135
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,861
Oh, excuse me.

136
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,487
You know, I was thinking, Clyde.

137
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,867
Maybe I'll keep it a secret.

138
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,911
Then when I come home,
I'll walk right up to him,

139
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:30,458
I'll put my hand out for a shake,
and when he looks down...

140
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,372
- Huh?
- That's one way of doin' it.

141
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,215
That old man'll just about bust!

142
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,676
Yes, he will. And I aim
to get that citation for you.

143
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,797
But you're gonna have to be patient.

144
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,849
- Sure thing, Clyde.
- These things take time.

145
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:48,677
The right moment comes along,
and I'll slip it through.

146
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,139
- You wanna know something?
- What?

147
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,897
We get back home...

148
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:59,156
I'm gonna go right on
calling you "Colonel". Huh?

149
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,566
Huh? What do you think?

150
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:09,073
I think I'd like that fine.

151
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,248
I'm hard put to recall a bona fide
colonel in our corner of the state.

152
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,840
Joe, I've got a plan for getting
Cooney out of the company.

153
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,963
A lost cause.

154
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:26,015
- Are you gonna listen to me?
- What's to listen?

155
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:31,385
You know Bartlett has political ambitions.
Cooney's old man owns the machine.

156
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:34,606
QED, Erskine can do no wrong.
We got him for the duration.

157
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:40,154
Now you've got that off your chest, listen
to me for a second and shut up, will ya?

158
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:43,151
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

159
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:46,735
All right, now. I'll give it
to you plain and simple.

160
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,639
One is,

161
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,904
at least a part of Bartlet's political
future depends on his war record, right?

162
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:58,207
Two: Bartlett is no fool, right? Huh?

163
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,748
- Yeah, right.
- OK.

164
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:05,546
Three is, Cooney is completely
unreliable and Bartlett knows it.

165
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,382
His next foul-up could be a big one.
Not 14 men, but something big.

166
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,677
Let's face it, this is for keeps.

167
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:15,476
- So what is the plan?
- OK...

168
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:20,937
I'd like to lay it on the line with Bartlett,
suggest that he kick Cooney upstairs.

169
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,443
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

170
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:27,109
He gets the guy stashed away
in a desk job at Battalion or Division.

171
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,281
Worst he can do is get
his thumb caught in a filing cabinet.

172
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:35,242
Our worries are over, Bartlet's worries
are over. All we gotta do is fight the war.

173
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:38,129
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
How about it, huh?

174
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,543
It won't work.

175
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:41,836
Why not?

176
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:46,260
It won't work! And he won't go for
this straight-talk routine.

177
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:50,515
He's a lieutenant colonel,
and you're just a lousy lieutenant.

178
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,215
He'll hit you with
that old, sweet song about

179
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:57,813
"Son, I was in the National Guard
while you was learning your ABCs."

180
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:00,099
They're two of a kind.

181
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:05,027
Huh! I bet Cooney never figured on a war
when he joined that National Guard.

182
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:10,032
Probably figured it was gonna be
all corn pone and chitlins and...

183
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:16,864
and the chance to wear his uniform
to the Saturday fox hunt.

184
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,160
OK, I'll go it alone.

185
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:26,384
Don't go dramatic on me, dogface.

186
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,384
I'll play cards,
if you think it'll do any good.

187
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,970
OK. I tell ya, it's the only way
we're gonna get close to Bartlett.

188
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:41,557
Just remember,
one crack out of Cooney...

189
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,731
Just one.

190
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,522
- COONEY: Five in a row!
- When are leaves gonna start, Colonel?

191
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,777
Soon as we get back
to France and settle down.

192
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,615
You suppose this war might be over
before we re-form?

193
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,451
I hate to disappoint you,
but I wager it will be.

194
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,627
Sure hate to go in any rough stuff
with those green kids they've sent us.

195
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,793
Yeah, those replacements need work.

196
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,587
Don't worry. We'll all go home
with a record we can be proud of.

197
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:12,012
Anybody says Fox Company
isn't tops can answer to me.

198
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,765
I swear, this CO of yours is about
as touchy as a she-bear with cubs.

199
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,933
Yeah, sure is.

200
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,691
What's it gonna be here,
five-card no-draw?

201
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,518
Suits me. OK with the rest of you boys?
Still a 50-franc limit?

202
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,983
Yeah.

203
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,364
Wheel 'em and deal 'em, Lieutenant.
Wheel and deal.

204
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,781
"She-bear with cubs".

205
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,572
What kind of a crack is that?
What do you mean by that?

206
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,042
- BARTLETT: Come on, Erskine.
- Ante up, Joe.

207
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:53,136
This is a friendly game, Costa. I aim to
keep it that way. You're trying to bait me.

208
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,421
Sit down. He didn't mean a thing.

209
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,047
- You think so?
- It was a joke.

210
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,260
Tell him it was a joke, Costa.

211
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,597
I made a joke.

212
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,945
I guess you'll be mixing in some politics
back in Riverview, Colonel.

213
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,201
Oh, I don't know. I might run
for dogcatcher or something.

214
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,577
"Tippecanoe and Bartlett too."
I'm under the gun?

215
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,573
- COSTA: Yeah.
- Cost you gentlemen 50 francs.

216
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,035
I'll just have to bump you, Colonel.

217
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,005
Oh. Well, I'll take a peek.

218
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,587
Expose yourself, Lieutenant.

219
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,051
- Threes and jacks.
- That's a good hand.

220
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,636
But not good enough. Three lovely ladies,
and I'll just rake the pot.

221
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,844
- You ever lose?
- I can't afford to.

222
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,557
- I'm just a boy from little ol' Riverview.
- I won't forget that last session.

223
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,731
Where was that?

224
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:57,199
Oh... that was in that cellar
outside Aachen.

225
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,579
You cleaned us all out that game, too.
I kept bucking you.

226
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,829
BARTLETT: Oh, yeah. You and that...

227
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,501
Lathrop was his name, Colonel.
Lieutenant Ned Lathrop.

228
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,547
That's right. Lathrop.
He was a good man.

229
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:17,845
Too bad about him. What was he doing?
Trying to help the squad that got cut off?

230
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,509
Sergeant Ingersoll's squad
from my platoon.

231
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,929
- Well, he...
- He what?

232
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:31,684
Ingersoll disobeyed orders, trying to take
that pillbox. He overstepped his authority.

233
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:36,361
They were good men.
The best, if you ask me.

234
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,565
Well, I didn't ask you, Lieutenant.

235
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,283
Now, gentlemen,
let's keep this a friendly game.

236
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,740
Same game.

237
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,997
- Anyone could've seen it was hopeless.
- I don't think it was hopeless, Captain.

238
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,294
You can think anything you want.
There's no law against it.

239
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,289
But I'm ordering you to keep
your lousy insinuations to yourself!

240
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,339
- Erskine!
- He has no right to question my honour!

241
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:04,515
- Ingersoll was one of my best men.
- Sit down, Erskine.

242
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:07,642
If you're so friendly with your men,
resign your commission.

243
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,637
You don't want to be an officer.
You're just a snotnosed pup!

244
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:12,805
Cooney!

245
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,563
Come on, come on! Come on, Joe.

246
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:25,618
It's all right, Harry. I'm going.

247
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,575
If you'll excuse me, Colonel.

248
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,421
I'm sorry I blew it, Clyde.

249
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:47,098
Why don't you go outside and walk
around? Maybe that'll cool you off.

250
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:48,803
Yes...

251
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:52,513
I guess I will.

252
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:07,278
I'm mighty sorry
this had to happen, Clyde.

253
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,095
I'll give this to Joe when I see him.

254
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,642
Everybody goes off the deep end
sometime or another, don't they?

255
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:36,231
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:39,477
All the same, I don't think
we should spread this around.

257
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:42,446
- Spread what around?
- That's the idea.

258
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,903
Boys seem a little touchy these days.

259
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:50,953
Yes, sir, they are.

260
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,571
While we're on the subject, Colonel...

261
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,950
There's something that I'd like to say.

262
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,460
Shoot.

263
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,214
Well...

264
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,423
The morale of this company is in what
I consider to be a dangerous condition.

265
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:11,053
Oh? And what do you suppose
brought this about, Lieutenant?

266
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,219
I think it stemmed from
what happened at Aachen.

267
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,728
Oh?

268
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,772
Colonel, I know you
and Captain Cooney are very close.

269
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,472
Maybe I'm sticking my neck out on this,

270
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,984
but the feeling among the men is that
the captain... that he chickened out there.

271
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,653
That your opinion, too?

272
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,821
He had the only reserve.
He might've done something.

273
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:36,999
On the other hand he may have felt
his reserve wasn't strong enough.

274
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,498
Then the facts are hardly conclusive.

275
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:42,498
It's not a matter
of conclusive facts, sir!

276
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:47,630
Colonel, can I talk to you straight?
Rank and all that aside?

277
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:49,801
I don't see why not.

278
00:21:57,271 --> 00:22:02,098
Don't suppose whatever it is you want
to go beyond the two of us. Shoot.

279
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:05,603
Colonel, you know
Captain Cooney better than...

280
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:11,443
...better than any man in this division,
maybe better than any man alive.

281
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:16,780
I know Erskine. Ever since I was
14 years old, a clerk in the judge's office.

282
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,488
You know his good points
and his shortcomings.

283
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,326
- Go on.
- You know he fouled up there at Aachen.

284
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:27,412
He cost the lives of a whole squad.
A good sergeant, a good lieutenant.

285
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,678
Think what he could do
if this company got in a real bind.

286
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:37,047
Come on, son, give me the punch line.
You want me to kick Erskine upstairs?

287
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:40,600
- Yes, sir, as a matter of fact...
- It figures.

288
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,605
And it's not a bad solution. But there's
some points you're not considering.

289
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:49,353
You talked straight to me
and I'm gonna talk straight to you.

290
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:54,945
I'd appreciate your discretion. This is
in confidence between you and me.

291
00:22:55,077 --> 00:23:00,035
Erskine's very important to me. Let's
make no pretence. We both know why.

292
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,033
My staff is small, compact, efficient.
Runs like clockwork.

293
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,084
Between you and me, I got no room
for Erskine over at Battalion.

294
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:11,631
- I thought of Division.
- I send him up to General Parsons?

295
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,429
In what capacity? I mean, specifically.

296
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,974
So you see how it is.
We all got our troubles.

297
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:21,718
I appreciate your concern
for the morale of this company.

298
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,478
I'm just as concerned. More.

299
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:28,101
- I'm responsible for this company.
- Why don't you face the facts?!

300
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:31,520
- A lot of guys are gonna get killed...
- Shut up!

301
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:35,522
You spoke your piece, now I'm gonna
speak mine. You listening?

302
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,283
Yes, sir.

303
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,744
It all boils down to one basic fact.

304
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,699
This company is...

305
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:47,957
Let's just say it's a bit shaky in the morale
department and not too fit for combat.

306
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:49,463
- Correct?
- Correct.

307
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,712
- That's your worry?
- That's my worry.

308
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:54,332
Then you can forget about it.

309
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:58,052
- What's your first name?
- Harry.

310
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:01,930
Stop worrying, Harry.
Cos I got it straight from the top.

311
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,354
It's a hundred to one that
we'll never see combat again.

312
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:10,775
Is that the real word, Colonel?
From the top?

313
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:13,773
From the top. A hundred to one.

314
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,981
(RADIO BUZZES)

315
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,742
- Fragile Fox One.
- This is Division. Colonel Bartlett there?

316
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,912
Yes. Hold on just a minute.

317
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,368
Colonel Bartlett.

318
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:34,205
General Parsons wants to see all
commanders as soon as possible.

319
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,793
- Tell the general I'll be right over.
- Thank you, sir.

320
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:40,799
So, that being the situation...

321
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:46,466
I want you to relax
about Erskine. Ride it out.

322
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:51,562
A year from now, you'll be a civilian again,
adjusting to the problems of peace.

323
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,898
I feel better already, Colonel.

324
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:57,685
That's the ticket, Harry.

325
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:15,171
Can you see me with a shave,
haircut, some toilet water?

326
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,961
You talk like you're the last guy left.
And we don't know if we're going back.

327
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,503
- Colonel's driver told me.
- What does he know?

328
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,588
- All right, there's the lieutenant. Ask him.
- OK, I will.

329
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:31,103
Hey, Lieutenant, about that scuttlebutt.
Is it for real?

330
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:34,231
- What scuttlebutt?
- About us being out of it.

331
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,478
- Don't bet on it.
- I hope they're right for once.

332
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,696
Let's face it, I'm a hero.
I got the blood lust.

333
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:43,065
I'm a glory hound, and when I get...

334
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,526
But you just don't like to fight.

335
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:48,235
That's my problem, Chaplain. I'm yellow.

336
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:53,615
PFC Bernstein, plump fat coward. Can
I get a section eight for being yellow?

337
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:59,127
Most of the guys'd all go to hell in a
bucket for you or Lieutenant Woodruff.

338
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,090
The way things are, this outfit's
got an esprit de garbage pail.

339
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:06,008
- Your French stinks.
- So does the morale.

340
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,050
Beat it.

341
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,056
Yes, sir.

342
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,894
Lieutenant Costa, sir.

343
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:20,776
- Russians!
- He's a regular Cossack. He's real tough.

344
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:25,863
But underneath it all, Snowden,
there beats a heart of solid rock.

345
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,069
Stop the scratching, Bernstein.

346
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:31,821
I'm just checking to see
if I got my dog tags.

347
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,914
Hello, Lieutenant.

348
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:38,917
- I thought I'd find you here.
- So, what happened?

349
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,921
You jerk. Why did you blow up?

350
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,050
Forget that. I saw the colonel leave.
What happened?

351
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:47,878
I talked to him. I told him that
we were in no shape for combat.

352
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,588
- MAN: All right, let's go!
- And?

353
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:54,426
- What's going on over there?
- Never mind. What did he say?

354
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:58,014
He already knew about Cooney,
and he was understanding.

355
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,688
Sure. Understanding.

356
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,524
You'd think those two
were a vaudeville team.

357
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,989
Erskine and Clyde:
Funny sayings, eccentric dances.

358
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:09,738
Just a couple
of little ol' country boys.

359
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,827
Up to their knees in blood.

360
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:16,206
What it adds up to is this:
We've nothing to worry about

361
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,289
as far as Cooney is concerned.

362
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:23,585
The word from upstairs is
it looks like we're out of the shooting.

363
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:29,962
- What if we're not?
- He said it's a hundred to one that we are.

364
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:34,095
What if we have to go back up? The
colonel conned you out of any action.

365
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,931
He didn't con me.
He talked straight sense.

366
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,221
You haven't got it figured. I have.

367
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:44,351
If we go back, I got a solution for Cooney.
A simple one. No channels to go through.

368
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:48,983
- Just a nice, simple solution.
- What? Joe! What would you do?

369
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:53,363
I got it figured.
Just let him goof once more.

370
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:58,581
- Look, don't get any funny ideas.
- I mean it, Harry!

371
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,829
Lieutenant!

372
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:07,130
Get your men on the road
in 20 minutes, sir. Full packs.

373
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,842
- Back to France?
- No, sir. We're going back up.

374
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,759
There's been a big breakthrough.

375
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,474
The paratroopers are already
on their way up.

376
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:21,019
All right. Better get over
and alert the platoon.

377
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:26,059
I want all platoon leaders outside the TP
once their men are on the road.

378
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:27,939
Yes, sir.

379
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,566
Well?

380
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,199
A hundred to one, huh?

381
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,282
Joe! Joe!

382
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:45,037
Cooney is still in command,
for better or worse.

383
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:48,256
And that's the situation.
And I'm the exec.

384
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:52,132
If anything happens to him...
I don't care if it's you or anyone else.

385
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,634
The office makes the man, huh, Harry?

386
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:58,096
Let's wait and see developments.

387
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,338
The section we're concerned with is...

388
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:35,304
Now, here we are. And the...

389
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,172
- May I have your attention?
- Sorry.

390
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,843
Here we are. You got it?
We want this town, La Nelle.

391
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:47,225
You won't need this map till you get there
cos you can see it from the hill.

392
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:49,564
- What does G-2 say?
- Nothing.

393
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:54,818
It hasn't been taken yet.
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.

394
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,609
Right. Will do.

395
00:29:56,742 --> 00:30:00,692
Keep contact with me on the 201.
Maybe the Krauts have pulled out.

396
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:04,448
If they have, walk in.
If they haven't, run them out.

397
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:09,044
- Can we expect any assistance?
- All the other companies are committed.

398
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:12,421
This operation on La Nelle
is strictly Fox Company.

399
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,008
- OK, sir.
- Good luck.

400
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:26,269
Well, Woodruff, looks like Fox Company's
got another tough job.

401
00:30:26,397 --> 00:30:29,184
Hitting the town
from both sides would do it.

402
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:32,187
We can use Weapons
in reserve for the 1st and 2nd.

403
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,566
- I'll take Weapons, you take 1st and 2nd?
- That's sound enough. Jackson!

404
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:40,993
Get Lieutenant Costa over here.
Tell him to bring his platoon sergeant.

405
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,527
- Come on, on the double!
- Yes, sir.

406
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,747
If the first platoon gets pinned,
we can cover them.

407
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's take a closer look here.
Now, supposing...

408
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:59,337
supposing we send a platoon
to probe down the road here.

409
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,089
Nobody there, they walk in.
We follow 'em.

410
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:06,309
If they meet with any resistance...

411
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:11,062
Here. They take this old house,
here in the outskirts, and they hole up.

412
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,402
- I don't know about that.
- Your idea is sound. It's very sound.

413
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:17,770
But it's rigid. It's by the book.

414
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:21,025
This way we hold off
till we see what's what,

415
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,198
then we can hit 'em from either side.

416
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:27,160
And we got a base of fire
right here in the town, if we need it.

417
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,698
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

418
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,621
That would be one method, I suppose.

419
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,380
Hey, Costa.

420
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,215
We've got another
nasty little job to do here.

421
00:31:43,306 --> 00:31:45,345
La Nelle?

422
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:50,634
Yeah. Division wants it occupied.
We got the assignment.

423
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:54,306
There may be Krauts in there.
Most likely not.

424
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,976
Let's just go on the basis
that there are.

425
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:02,239
Here. You take your platoon
right down this road here.

426
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,904
You'll be covered most of the way.

427
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:12,121
- You get there, you outpost the town.
- Sounds nice and neat, Captain.

428
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,204
Now let's go on the basis that
the joint is just crawling with Krauts.

429
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,092
I'm in there with one platoon.

430
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:24,794
What happens?

431
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,429
You take this house here in the outskirts
and you hole up.

432
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,141
We hit them with the rest of the company.
You give us a base of fire.

433
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:34,643
If we need it. Got it?

434
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:38,306
You run into any real trouble,
we'll be behind you.

435
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:40,519
I hope.

436
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:49,489
All right, if you don't like it, I'll get
Lieutenant Miller's platoon to try it.

437
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:55,417
- Are you for it, Harry?
- Joe, I think it should work.

438
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:01,589
Toliver, we'll move the men
down the road in a platoon column.

439
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:05,759
Road's covered till about
400 yards from the house.

440
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:11,510
That last stretch I don't like.
Wide open. Could be trouble.

441
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:15,058
Only thing good about it
is it's downhill.

442
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:16,267
What?

443
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:20,098
If they're dug in, they could
give us a hard, hard time.

444
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:24,730
No use trying to crawl it.
There's no cover.

445
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:27,319
400 yards in battle gear
is too far to run,

446
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,239
so we'll walk the first half
and then we'll kick out.

447
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,658
And pray. What do you think?

448
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:41,170
- It could be a real, real crock, sir.
- Get the men moving.

449
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:43,918
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:53,598
That's a mighty fine platoon sergeant
you got there.

451
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:55,802
The best.

452
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,066
And he's not gonna wind up
in any wringer.

453
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:06,400
Him nor any of the rest of my men.

454
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,195
- What do you mean by that?
- Just this.

455
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:15,153
We can take that house all right
but, boy, I'd hate to get stuck with it.

456
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:20,330
- You get into trouble, we'll back you up!
- I know, I got your word on it.

457
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,829
What do you want,
a contract or something?

458
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,455
All right, come on. Don't worry.

459
00:34:27,926 --> 00:34:31,971
- You'll back me up, Harry?
- You want my word too?

460
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,507
Yeah.

461
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,384
All right, you've got it.

462
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:45,060
Maybe you'd like me to call in Jackson.
Maybe you'd like his word on it, too.

463
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:49,730
I want Jackson standing by
to receive me.

464
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:54,906
And, Cooney... I'm gonna to give you
something to think about.

465
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:58,203
If I ever lose another man
on account of you,

466
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,822
just one,

467
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,541
you'll never see the States again.

468
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,498
That's court-martial talk, soldier.
I got a witness standing right here.

469
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:14,094
Let him hear me too, loud and clear,
so there won't be any misunderstanding.

470
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:19,390
You double-cross me
like you did Ingersoll, you...

471
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:24,476
You play the gutless wonder once more
and I'll come back and I'll get you.

472
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,600
I'll shove this grenade down your throat
and pull the pin.

473
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:46,458
Here he comes.

474
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,541
Let's go!

475
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:55,753
Let's go, boys.

476
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,786
All right, end of the line!

477
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,452
Here's where the turkey shoot begins!

478
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,000
How does it look?

479
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,215
I don't know, sir. It's hard to tell.

480
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:41,259
Hey, soldier,
how'd you like to get relieved?

481
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,549
- What, go down there?
- Sure.

482
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,430
Drop dead.

483
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:50,014
- It looks quiet.
- So does a graveyard.

484
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:52,225
That's right, Lieutenant.

485
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:57,314
You know, there's a cowboy movie
where one joker says

486
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:02,787
"Mighty quiet out there.
Too quiet," he says.

487
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,748
Same thing every time. It's too quiet.

488
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,202
It is too quiet.

489
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:18,758
Squad leaders. Medics.

490
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,423
That's an awful long haul, Lieutenant.

491
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,682
That's the farmhouse.

492
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:32,015
Whether we're running
into trouble or not, we don't know.

493
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:36,609
It's too far and too bare for crawling,
so it's gonna be a track meet.

494
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,228
Stay off of the road. It could be mined.

495
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:41,404
- TOLIVER: Got it?
- We got it.

496
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,736
MAN: That's an awful distance
to run... sir.

497
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,746
We're gonna walk the first half.

498
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,542
- You'll give us the signal?
- That's right.

499
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:54,119
We'll take off in threes,
well spread, on signal.

500
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:59,130
Five-second intervals. That oughta
put us about 10, 12 yards apart.

501
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:03,174
No bunching up, no stopping,
not for anybody.

502
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:06,638
- Medics, are you ready?
- We're ready, Lieutenant.

503
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:12,722
We don't want you at the farmhouse.
Attend to casualties between here and...

504
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,692
Toliver and I lead off. And Willis...

505
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:22,356
- Who's got the radio?
- Right here, sir.

506
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:29,244
- What's your name, soldier?
- Abramowitz, sir.

507
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,411
You go with us, Abramowitz.

508
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,705
- Johnson, you're calling time.
- Sir.

509
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:38,002
Keep your eye on me.
If it gets too rugged, I'll signal you.

510
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,546
I don't want to put
the whole platoon in a wringer.

511
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:45,802
I do this, you hold up
the rest of the men.

512
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:49,304
Yes, sir.

513
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,973
- All right, move out!
- First squad, move up!

514
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:56,477
- Move out in threes.
- Second squad, move up.

515
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:58,896
Come on, boys! Get out there! Let's go!

516
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,441
TOLIVER: More, Abramowitz.

517
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:08,858
MAN: Five, four, three, two, and go!

518
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:14,530
Five, four, three, two, and go!

519
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:20,119
Five, four, three, two, and go!

520
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:24,342
Five, four, three, two...

521
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,137
and go!

522
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:30,962
Five, four, three, two, and go!

523
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:36,770
Five, four, three, two, and go!

524
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,022
Five, four, three, two, and go!

525
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:47,355
Five, four, three, two and go!

526
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:53,116
Five, four, three, two and go!

527
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:58,912
Five, four, three, two and go!

528
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:04,705
Five, four, three, two and go!

529
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,668
So far, so good.

530
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,471
If they're in there,
now's when they'll open up.

531
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,466
Yeah. We're too far out to go back now.

532
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,896
Let's go!

533
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:01,683
Medic!

534
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:07,064
No more, no more!

535
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:10,269
That's it.

536
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:36,503
(SHOUTS)

537
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,457
Cellar.

538
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:06,161
Cellar.

539
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:09,832
Upstairs.

540
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:24,722
(EXPLOSION)

541
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,105
All clear.

542
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,482
I got a stitch.

543
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:49,292
Watch the town.

544
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,461
All clear out back. Is this it?

545
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:02,552
This all that made it?

546
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,010
Yeah.

547
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,207
I'm way out of condition.

548
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:37,459
Real bad shape. My wind's all shot.

549
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,591
You know what the cause is?

550
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,973
Too many cigarettes.

551
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,183
From now on, I'm gonna stay healthy.

552
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,853
- You're healthier than he is.
- That's for sure.

553
00:43:57,987 --> 00:44:01,403
- You're lucky it wasn't uphill.
- He'd have never made it.

554
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:05,530
- Not with all the lead he's carrying.
- That's where I want the lead.

555
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:09,077
- Nowheres else.
- Maybe he's right.

556
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:12,907
Sergeant Kelly got it in the gut.
So did Lucas.

557
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,833
- They got Lucas?
- Yes, sir. I seen him fall.

558
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,173
A medic ran over to him.

559
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:27,678
How about the rest of Johnson's squad?

560
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:30,928
Liegert caught one in the throat.
It looked like...

561
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:34,894
Lucky five of us got here.
They really threw it at us.

562
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,266
It wasn't Wiener schnitzel, huh, Sarge?

563
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:40,355
A German cook can kill you
just as quick.

564
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:44,657
Kelly. Lucas.

565
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:50,776
- You're sure about Liegert?
- Yes, sir.

566
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:54,081
I'm telling you, it's miraculous.

567
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,830
I don't know how I got here.

568
00:44:56,962 --> 00:45:00,959
You know what it is?
It's a miracle, that's what.

569
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:04,008
- All right.
- Absolutely miraculous.

570
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:08,797
Sending one platoon in here like that.
Plain crazy, Lieutenant.

571
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:11,849
How could he ever
dream up one like that?

572
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:22,852
Settle down. Long as we stay here,
we ought to be OK. They won't rush us.

573
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:25,276
How do you know, sir?

574
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:30,199
- Keep watching that town!
- Yes, sir. But how do you know, sir?

575
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,368
I don't know.

576
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:39,955
But analyse it. We're boxed.
They know it.

577
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:45,545
All they gotta do is wait till
we stick up our heads, and... pow.

578
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:49,543
- Just like plucking possum.
- So what do we do, sir?

579
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,681
We sit tight and wait
till the company attacks in strength.

580
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:58,598
Is that what Cooney said?
That he'd back us up?

581
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:01,222
That's what the man said.

582
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,243
Well? What do you think?

583
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,583
Relax. You got here.
That means anybody could do it.

584
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,329
Yeah, maybe. Except Captain Cooney, huh?

585
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:28,925
Take it easy. You don't see
the lieutenant worrying, do you?

586
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,840
- Wanna know what I think?
- What do you think?

587
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:35,472
The only one who ain't worrying
is Abramowitz there.

588
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:39,520
Snowden? The hell with being healthy.

589
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:42,102
- Give me a cigarette.
- COSTA: Shut up.

590
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,028
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
over to you.

591
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:49,692
Maybe he's too far, Lieutenant.

592
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,696
- Hey, Lieutenant!
- What?

593
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,612
- I thought I saw something.
- Where?

594
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,911
- On the road, just back of the steeple.
- What was it?

595
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:01,538
I don't know.
A tank, a turret, something.

596
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,040
- I don't see anything.
- It pulled back.

597
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,005
- That's how it caught my eye.
- A truck?

598
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:09,457
- Yeah.
- Could very well have been a truck.

599
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,083
The way our luck's going,
it's gotta be a tank.

600
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,505
If they got tanks in there,
they'll nail us to the floor.

601
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,969
- You'd make great wall-to-wall carpeting.
- COSTA: Shut up, both of you.

602
00:47:22,564 --> 00:47:25,979
Did you spot him? Ricks, you see him?

603
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,389
No, sir.

604
00:47:28,152 --> 00:47:30,311
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One.

605
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:35,239
In order to get a shot at Bernstein,
he would have to be...

606
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:44,618
Yeah, sure. See? The church steeple. That
sacrilegious son-of-a-gun is in the belfry.

607
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:46,792
How do you know that?

608
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:51,416
Only place he can angle a shot at you.

609
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,303
- Can you see him?
- TOLIVER: Not now, I don't.

610
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:57,594
If you can't see him,
how can you get a shot at him?

611
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,846
Strategy, Bernstein.

612
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:03,474
You step out front and bring me in
what you see by the stoop.

613
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,762
- Out front?
- Move.

614
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:19,653
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
do you read me? Over.

615
00:48:19,786 --> 00:48:22,538
Fragile Fox One,
I read you loud and clear.

616
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,740
Is that you, Jackson? Over.

617
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,160
Yes, sir, it's me. Hold on, Lieutenant.
I'll get somebody. Over.

618
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,885
Captain, it's Lieutenant Costa
on the radio, sir.

619
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:40,056
See what's doing, Woody boy.
Go on, see what he wants.

620
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:43,183
You know what he wants, Captain.

621
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,219
All right, bare a hand here!

622
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:47,845
Get these men in there. Take it easy.

623
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:55,236
- This is Harry. What's the score? Over.
- Where's Cooney? Over.

624
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:02,410
- Harry, the town is heavily occupied.
- Ask him if Berlin's occupied.

625
00:49:02,536 --> 00:49:05,656
Tell him Cooney's
a southern-fried schlemiel.

626
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,249
What?

627
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:14,878
What? They caught us in the open
and they chopped us up. Over.

628
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,293
- You gonna rig a dummy to draw fire?
- You wanna volunteer?

629
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:20,301
- What a screwball idea.
- Yeah.

630
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,265
I repeat: They chopped us up!

631
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:29,058
The medics are picking
them up right now. Over.

632
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,596
Put this on him.
It'll make him look real.

633
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:33,476
They are?

634
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:38,896
- First wounded are already coming in.
- So where's the support?

635
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,487
Tell Cooney we're pinned.
I repeat: We're pinned!

636
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:53,249
Doctor, I have a man in the balcony.

637
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:58,961
Look, you tell him
we're in that little ol' house.

638
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:03,135
Tell him I lost Lucas, Kelly, Liegert,

639
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,884
I don't know how many.

640
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,720
So where's the rest of the company?

641
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:13,846
Where's that support that was
gonna be right behind us all? Over!

642
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:19,775
Joe, hang on. I'll call you right back.
Over and out.

643
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:20,936
Captain.

644
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:24,408
Captain!

645
00:50:26,578 --> 00:50:28,286
- Captain!
- Well?

646
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:30,986
We gotta move.
Joe is pinned. It's our turn.

647
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:35,869
Let's make sure we make the right move.
Let's not get excited, up in the air!

648
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:39,838
- I'll have the company saddle up.
- Hold on there!

649
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:44,344
Maybe there's more to this
than we can handle.

650
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:50,639
Come on.

651
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:54,101
Jackson, I'll take over.

652
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:02,488
What do you mean,
more than we can handle?

653
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:05,899
We're ordered to take La Nelle.
Let's form up and do it.

654
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:11,193
- The thing to do is pull 'em back.
- We can't pull back. They're pinned!

655
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,999
Then let 'em hole up!
We'll call for artillery!

656
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:17,125
Artillery won't do any good.
It takes men to hit the town!

657
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:21,915
Risk a whole company for the remains
of one platoon? Think straight, boy!

658
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:25,714
Think straight? I'm thinking
about the job we've gotta do!

659
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:29,510
If I've made a mistake in judgment,
it was an honest one.

660
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:35,352
Now, listen, Cooney.
I gave Costa my word.

661
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:38,978
So what are you, a boy scout?
Some kind of white knight?

662
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:41,350
I gave him my word.

663
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:47,072
Look, soldier, to be perfectly frank,
I don't give a damn what you gave him.

664
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,117
Great-looking soldier.
He's uglier than Bernstein.

665
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:52,402
COSTA: Hurry it up.

666
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:56,488
Wait a minute. If this sad sack is gonna
die, why don't we make him an officer?

667
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,496
- Make him a general.
- No, a lieutenant.

668
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:04,122
Make him a captain.

669
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,136
- You know who he looks like?
- No...

670
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,221
- TOLIVER: Shove it out, Bernstein.
- I'll take over.

671
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:20,390
All right, sir, go out there
and draw some lead.

672
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:32,906
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, but not enough.

673
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:35,993
- What does he look like?
- A man.

674
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:38,162
Them cruddy Krauts.

675
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:43,629
- A little more, Bernstein.
- More?

676
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:45,794
Come on, Bernstein.

677
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,896
Wow!

678
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:05,354
No more bats in that belfry.

679
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:11,859
- I swear, Toliver, that was shootin'!
- Just like pluckin' possum.

680
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:13,900
Toliver!

681
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:16,740
Get away from that hole.

682
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:20,244
Them cruddy Krauts.

683
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,169
They shoot until you're on top of them.
Then they run out.

684
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,967
"Kamerad. Give me Zigaretten."

685
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:32,879
The trouble with you, Ricks,
is you're bitter.

686
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:36,261
Sure. I hate them cruddy Krauts,
if that's what you mean.

687
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,881
- Probably no more than they hate you.
- Me?

688
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:42,054
- Why should they hate me?
- Cos you're the enemy.

689
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:47,229
What do you mean? I'm an American,
for crying out loud! They're the enemy.

690
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,443
Abramowitz. Jacob R Abramowitz.

691
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:52,610
He's got O-type blood.

692
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:57,901
That's a fine, cruddy note,
calling me the enemy.

693
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:01,322
What do you think you are?
An exchange student?

694
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:03,829
How could I be the enemy?

695
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:06,165
- Ricks!
- Yes, sir?

696
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:13,545
You leave here again,
I'll beat you bloody!

697
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:15,504
Got that?

698
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:42,909
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

699
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,703
Fragile Fox One,
this is Fragile Fox Two.

700
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:50,326
Where's the support? Over!

701
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:05,685
Say it again, Harry.

702
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:10,023
Nice and slow,
so there's no mistake. Over.

703
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,188
Yeah.

704
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,399
We stuck with the lease?

705
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:22,906
Yeah.

706
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:32,414
Kommen Sie out.

707
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:35,215
Raus! Raus!

708
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,167
Come on!

709
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,842
Amerikaner! Freie Menschen!

710
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:47,010
Wir sind so froh, dass ihr hier seid.

711
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:52,434
- I thought you flushed out the cellar.
- I did. They must've been hiding.

712
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:56,100
- Did you look?
- Yeah. No. Who'd have thought of it?

713
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:59,735
Anybody with their head on!
That wouldn't be you, would it?

714
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:04,408
Get down there now and search
the whole place! Every last inch of it.

715
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:06,614
Halt deinen Mund!

716
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,281
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My uncle.

717
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:14,702
Er will mich bald rüberbringen,
nach Amerika. Schwartz.

718
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,459
Die Brauerei. Bitte. Das ist mein Onkel.

719
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,714
Halt's Maul.

720
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:27,177
The mean one's a captain.
It's the same in every army.

721
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,519
Toliver, these boys
are the answer to a prayer.

722
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:46,485
I want it real quiet now.
I'm gonna work on the old guy.

723
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,119
OK, you. In there.

724
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,587
In there. Panzers?

725
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:03,550
Panzers, was?

726
00:57:03,677 --> 00:57:05,337
Come on, sprechen Sie!

727
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:08,176
Otto, ich warne dich.

728
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:11,391
Nicht sprechen Sie, understand?

729
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:13,178
Ich weiß gar nichts.

730
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:15,981
You got the old guy
scared stiff, Lieutenant.

731
00:57:16,106 --> 00:57:17,980
Any mechanised stuff in there?

732
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,484
Was?

733
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,069
Come on, now, sprechen Sie!

734
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,611
Otto, deinen Namen, deinen Rang,
deine Nummer... sonst nichts.

735
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,029
He's making with the Articles of War.

736
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:31,239
They don't apply to us.
Not in a vice like this.

737
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:40,826
This is a.45-calibre automatic, Captain.
Verstehen Sie? Nicht sprechen!

738
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,004
How about it? Panzers?

739
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:49,303
Panzers?

740
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,928
SS, huh? SS?

741
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:54,637
Ich weiß nicht.

742
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:58,304
You won't get it out of him.
Whitey's got him too scared.

743
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:03,315
Namen, Rang und Nummer!

744
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,484
Keep your mouth shut!

745
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:11,241
Panzers? Come on, now!

746
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:15,579
- Das sind...
- Otto, du Idiot!

747
00:58:15,707 --> 00:58:21,496
Du brauchst doch nur zu warten.
Im Dorf, auf dem Kirchturm, überall.

748
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:24,167
Die sind jetzt schon tot.

749
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:26,090
Tot?

750
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:28,293
Ja, so gut wie tot.

751
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:33,474
You know what he says?

752
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,684
He says all they gotta do is wait.

753
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:41,306
He says we're covered from the town.
He says we're "tot".

754
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,479
Dead.

755
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:53,860
Got a lot of firepower
in the town, Captain?

756
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:57,072
Tell me about it.

757
00:58:57,206 --> 00:59:02,580
I take it you are acquainted with the
covenants of the Geneva Convention.

758
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:07,290
Then you must know that
we will tell you absolutely nothing.

(COCKS PISTOL)

760
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:28,858
Nicht! Wartet!

761
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:33,569
Es sind doch wir.

762
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:03,972
Panzers?

763
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:07,640
Panzers.

764
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,811
Erschießen Sie mich nicht.
Ich habe drei Kinder.

765
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:13,068
How many tanks? One? Two?

766
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,857
Wie viele?

767
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:18,573
Acht, zehn. Und SS.

768
01:00:18,703 --> 01:00:19,865
What'd he say?

769
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:24,373
He says the place is crawling
with mechanised stuff. And SS.

770
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:29,254
Ricks.

771
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:35,248
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

772
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:43,345
Woodruff... I can't hear you.
I can't hear you. Over.

773
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,269
Louder, Harry. I can't...

774
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:47,472
Hey, look! A tank!

775
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:55,112
TOLIVER: The guy wasn't lying.
They'll flatten us.

776
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:57,445
What a way to reduce.

777
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:59,402
Woodruff?

778
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,408
Are you receiving me? Over.

779
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,157
OK, get this: Tanks are in here.

780
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:13,663
I don't know how many.
We're pulling out!

781
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:16,503
I repeat: We're pulling out!

782
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,296
Request artillery and smoke cover.

783
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:25,765
Repeat: Request artillery
and smoke cover. Over.

784
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,978
Roger. Fragile Fox Two out. No, wait!

785
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:36,270
I got a message for Cooney. Understand?

786
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:41,776
You tell him I'm comin' back.

787
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,199
Tell him I'm comin' back!

788
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:48,874
COSTA: Start that artillery.
Fragile Fox Two out.

789
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:00,378
B Battery, this is Fox Company.

790
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:05,014
I don't have to draw you
a picture on this one.

791
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:10,555
Keep the house between you
and the town as long as you can.

792
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:16,767
Just let me make one thing clear.

793
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:21,315
I'm not just giving you the word,
I'm giving you the law.

794
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:23,524
I'm giving you an order.

795
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:30,158
Don't stop for anybody. You got that?

796
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,912
No matter who gets it, you don't stop!

797
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:37,211
Get set. You're gonna
run the Kraut in front of you.

798
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:40,293
- He'll slow me up.
- You heard the lieutenant.

799
01:02:40,426 --> 01:02:45,420
- Can't we leave him behind?
- Division Intelligence will need him.

800
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:49,091
Soon as you hear our stuff
coming over, take off.

801
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:01,772
Let's go, Bernstein!

802
01:03:01,905 --> 01:03:04,822
Like I always said,
a fighting army is a running army.

(SPEAKS GERMAN)

804
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:19,540
All right, now. 20-yard intervals.
Don't bunch up.

805
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:26,587
Ricks! Get a move on. Let's get movin'.

806
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:29,342
- You ready?
- Lieutenant, don't rush me.

807
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,597
- Hail Mary, full of grace...
- Go!

808
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,400
My Jesus! Mary!

809

810
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:56,909
Take this.

811
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:59,285
- See you around, Lieutenant.
- Go.

812
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:03,337
Don't you wait around too long
after I'm gone.

813
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,837
I'll still beat you up that hill.

814
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:09,171
- You're talking to a flying Toliver, Joe.
- Yeah?

815
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,344
Get out of here.

816
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,942
Toliver!

817
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,938
The Lord is with thee.

818
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,728
Blessed art thou among women.

819
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,734
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

820
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,445
Amen.

821
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,221
- Lieutenant?
- Where are you hit?

822
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,857
I don't know. The chest or lungs.

823
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,109
Feels like bubbling.

824
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:57,195
Maybe you shouldn't, Lieutenant.
You'll never make it.

825
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,338
Lieutenant?

826
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:19,593
Remember when you hit me back there?

827
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:22,215
- Don't talk.
- You were right.

828
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:24,558
I fouled up...

829
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:28,852
But I understood what you meant.

- These men, sir...
- What?

01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,889
These men...

833
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:09,016

Right in the face.

01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,941
- Yes, sir.
- Shut up.

836
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,443
- Yes, Captain, but these...
- Shut up!

Sergeant Toliver is coming up the street!
He's got a German with him!

840
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:38,921
Well, where'd you get the Kraut?

841
01:07:39,053 --> 01:07:42,753
Brought him back
from that "little ol' house".

842
01:07:46,936 --> 01:07:48,975
Bring him along.

843
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:54,521
- Where's Lieutenant Costa?
- He was the last to run for it.

844
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:59,693
I waited for him in the draw over the crest
of that hill, but he never did show up.

845
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:03,239
- They must've gotten Ricks, too.
- How long did you wait?

846
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:07,069
Long enough for 'em both to show
if they was gonna.

847
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,413
OK, bring him inside.

848
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:43,605
- Division?
- MAN: This is Division.

849

This is Fox Company. We have a prisoner.

850
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:48,693
What about those tanks?

851
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,237
- How many?
- I saw two.

852
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:54,743
Prisoner says there's all kind
of mechanised stuff in there.

853
01:08:54,878 --> 01:08:58,709
Prisoner reports at least two tanks
in La Nelle, maybe more.

854
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,585
- Get the prisoner over to G-2.
- We'll send him by Jeep right away.

855
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,764
Had those tanks started to move
when you pulled out?

856
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:16,767
No, sir. But they sure is shooting now.

How about it, Toliver?
What were Lieutenant Costa's chances?

859
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:51,719
I don't know, sir. It was mighty wide open.
Feels like he just didn't make it.

860
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:55,763
One of the best platoon leaders
I ever had.

You stinking Nazi.

862

- Don't do that!
- That's for Costa, you squarehead!

- Take it easy! He's been cooperating.

- Come on, Toliver, I'll buy you a drink.
- No, thank you.

865
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:27,423
- Thought you were a drinking man.
- Not now, sir.

866
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:32,763
This here's bourbon, Toliver.
This is real Kentucky bourbon.

867
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:37,930
I never heard of a true Southerner
refusing a Kentucky bourbon. Here.

868
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:40,434
No, sir. Thanking you kindly.

869

What's the matter, boy? Come on.

870
01:10:47,154 --> 01:10:52,113
Captain, down where I come from,
we dearly love our whiskey.

871
01:10:52,243 --> 01:10:56,371
But we don't drink with another man
unless we respect him.

872
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:04,706
Well, go dry. Your loss.

873
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,541
I've got transportation for...
What happened to him?

874
01:11:09,677 --> 01:11:13,093
Nothing a little more of
the same wouldn't cure.

875
01:11:13,222 --> 01:11:16,425
- Take him up to Division.
- Crummy, no-good Nazi.

876
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:20,762
- They're hitting some of those houses!
- OK, OK!

877
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:25,059
- Sound like 88s.
- You think so?

878
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,684
- Now we got big trouble.
- They won't attack.

879
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:30,358
We got companies each side.
Sector's pinched off.

880
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,984
It is not! Take a look.

881
01:11:32,116 --> 01:11:36,243
- You don't need to show me no map!
- They're gonna knock us out of here.

882
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:38,611
That leaves two companies out on a limb.

883

Once they've got the crossroads,
we're all up the creek!

Don't get excited!

Sir, them's 88s.

All right, what are
we gonna do now? Huh?

889
01:11:58,433 --> 01:12:01,767
- Round up what's left of your platoon.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:12:02,854 --> 01:12:06,389
- All right, now what? What, Cooney?
- There's only one thing to do.

891
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:09,609
Fall back. Miller's platoon
can hold till we make the woods.

892
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:12,488
- How do they get out?
- We'll cover them.

893
01:12:12,614 --> 01:12:15,401
- They wouldn't have a prayer.
- I'm in command here!

894
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,409
- Face the facts!
- That's what I'm doing!

895
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,706
- What the hell is going on here?
- Clyde!

896
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:27,372
- They've got tanks!
- Don't you "Clyde" me.

897
01:12:27,504 --> 01:12:29,911
- Colonel, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, all right.

898
01:12:30,048 --> 01:12:33,049
- Why aren't you up in La Nelle?
- I tried!

899
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:35,963
- What does that mean?
- I sent a whole platoon in!

900
01:12:36,096 --> 01:12:39,879
That's 40 men. You got 200 men.
You sent in a platoon? What happened?

901
01:12:40,015 --> 01:12:42,471
They got in, but they pulled out.

902
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:45,396
- How many got in?
- Five. Three got out.

903
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,951
- I told them to stay.
- Of course they pulled out.

904
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:51,498
- How many casualties?
- About 10. Five dead. Costa's missing.

905
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:56,419
- He'll be OK. He's got nine lives.
- But, Clyde, I spotted those tanks.

906
01:12:56,548 --> 01:13:00,795
I was all set to go in. I was feeling
them out with Costa's platoon.

907
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:05,222
You were ordered to get in there!
The generals thought you were in there.

908
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:08,634
I told them you were in there.
What will you do now? Pull out?

909
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:11,805
- You can't hold that...
- You'll stick here and hold!

910
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:15,355
- How many tanks?
- There's all kinds of mechanised stuff.

911
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:20,111
A task force is on its way. If the Krauts
get through, the whole battalion gets it.

912
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,278
You hold until you're relieved.

913
01:13:22,408 --> 01:13:26,275
- How long will this take?
- Who cares? I want this position held.

914
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:29,448
- There's something you've gotta do.
- We'll hold.

915
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:32,286
It's about the command of this company.

916
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:36,250
Get outta here, Woodruff.
I want to talk to your captain.

917
01:13:37,548 --> 01:13:38,710
Go on, move!

918
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:50,097
- That's bonded liquor, Clyde.
- I want you to listen to this.

919
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,262
Listen real closely
in case it's news to you.

920
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:57,061
You're commanding this company
only as a favour to the judge.

921
01:13:57,191 --> 01:14:00,774
- He's always wanted a son.
- I don't want no favours.

922
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:06,609
You got one chance. You're in hot water.
You hold this town, I'll cover for you.

923
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:09,779
But you fall back,
I'll show you what trouble means.

924
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:12,664
- I'll hound you into Leavenworth!
- You can count on me!

925
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,622
No, I can't! So it boils down to
what scares you most, me or them.

926
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,959
Listen to this!

927
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:22,173
You foul up, so help me
I'll crucify you!

928
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,093
You know what? I couldn't care less.

929
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:33,265
You know that?

930
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:36,680
You're so big. Why don't you relieve me?

931
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:45,857
Yeah. Go on, send me back.

932
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,278
Make no nevermind of me.

933
01:14:48,408 --> 01:14:50,650
- How I'd love to.
- All right!

934
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,529
Do it! Do it!

935
01:14:52,663 --> 01:14:56,910
Sure. I send you back, they'll take
a close look at you. Very close.

936
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:59,615
And they'll see me perched
on your shoulder.

937
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:03,751
That's right, Erskine boy.
So here you stay, here you hold.

938
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:05,709
Why will I?

939
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:12,005
- You all through talking?
- How I hate you.

940
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,845
Colonel, you're not gonna
leave him in command here.

941
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,145
I don't care what your opinion
of Captain Cooney is.

942
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:23,524
- He's still in command. Clear?
- Very clear.

943
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:27,187
- Then you know what you have to do.
- I know exactly what I have to do.

944
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:31,154
- You double-talking me?
- I'm not double-talking anyone!

945
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:35,578
If I survive this, I'm going to General
Parsons. I'll tell him the whole story.

946
01:15:35,706 --> 01:15:39,075
About Aachen, about Costa,
about his plan to pull out of here.

947
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:41,665
I just want you to know it.

948
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:55,138
When 10th Armored gets here,
I want that crossroad open.

949
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,984
Come on, Captain. Let's go. We'll set up
at the two houses at the crossroads.

950
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,601
We gotta hold. We gotta hold.

951
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:14,242
We'll hold as long as we can, then fall
back to the church, then the courthouse.

952
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:17,488
- And then what?
- That's the end of the line.

953
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:21,952
Come on, get your gear.
Let's go. Come on.

954
01:16:25,004 --> 01:16:27,210
No, you give me that.

955
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,883
I was soldiering when you were still
a kid. You ain't taking nothing from me.

956
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:35,095
Captain, you won't find
any answers in there.

957
01:16:35,222 --> 01:16:38,638
- Just give me that.
- You can't find courage in a bottle.

958
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:43,145
You can't buy your guts for a dollar.
Who do you think you are?

959
01:16:43,272 --> 01:16:46,606
You're not just careless or a coward.
You're a criminal!

960
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:50,150
A criminal responsible for
the murder of at least 19 men!

961
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:52,319
Give me that!

962
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:53,646
There!

963
01:16:54,825 --> 01:16:58,573
You've got every man in this outfit
thinking the US Army is a mockery.

964
01:16:58,703 --> 01:17:01,953
It's not! Just this tiny,
lousy part of it.

965
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:05,083
From hereon in, it's gonna be different.

966
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:12,422
I'd like to go out there and stop one,
but I haven't even got the guts to...

967
01:17:15,011 --> 01:17:19,839
A man hasn't got the guts to live,
he hasn't got 'em to die.

968
01:17:19,975 --> 01:17:23,426
If you can't live, you can't die.

969
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:27,855
Who wants this? I didn't ask for this.

970
01:17:30,694 --> 01:17:33,611
I'm different, Woodruff.

971
01:17:33,738 --> 01:17:35,778
I'm scared.

972
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:39,985
We're all scared, Captain.

973
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:45,958
I'm scared of... I'm scared of you.

974
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:49,868
I'm scared of Bartlett. I'm scared...

975
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:55,298
I'm scared of my father.

976
01:17:57,262 --> 01:17:59,669
My daddy whupped me! He whupped me!

977
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:03,672
"I'm gonna whup some guts into you, boy!
I'll make a man of you!"

978
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:07,012
"I'm talking to you, boy!
I'll make you a man!"

979
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:09,766
(WEEPS)

980
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:17,439
And I thought that someday... someday...

981
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:26,324
I woke up one morning,
and I was 30 years old.

982
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:32,202
I knew that little ol' someday
was never gonna come.

983
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:37,007
Never gonna be no someday.

984
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:40,716
Never gonna...

985
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:55,726
You stay here, Captain.
I'll take care of things.

986
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:05,781
- Where is he?
- Joe. Where...? How did you get back?

987
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:11,157
Where's Cooney?
They said he's here. Where?

988
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,376
- Back there?
- Joe, listen to me.

989
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:21,380
Now, don't foul yourself up.

990
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:25,386
- Get outta my way.
- No.

991
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,762
Liegert's dead! Lucas is dead!

992
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:32,143
Ricks is dead! A boy I never
even talked to is dead!

993
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:35,806
All on account of him!
That's one account I'm gonna square!

994
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:39,726
You can't do this! He's...
I don't know. He's psycho. He's...

995
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:41,902
I'm gonna count to three...

996
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:46,658
You kill him, you'll go back to Battalion
under guard. I'll see to that.

997
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:50,914
- Listen to me for once!
- Why should I listen to you?

998
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,453
You're mealy-mouthed.
You double-crossed me!

999
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,132
- You gave me your word!
- It wasn't that simple.

1000
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:03,128
OK, if you want it this way! One...

1001
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:06,841
Harry, I'll shoot you if I have to!

1002
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:08,799
Two...

1003
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:14,721
- One of those big Kraut tanks!
- Where?

1004
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:19,600
It's firing point-blank into the house
where Toliver and the other guys are.

1005
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:23,602
- All right, Joe, how about it?
- Those guys don't have a chance!

1006
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:29,866
Lieutenant Costa...

1007
01:20:31,121 --> 01:20:33,244
I thought you were dead.

1008
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:39,582
- Which house is it?
- At the end of the street.

1009
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:48,762
Can you make it on that leg there?

1010
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:52,305
I'll make it. There and back.

1011
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:26,628
Them ever-loving momsers
are trying to kill us.

1012
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:31,884
- We gotta get down that cellar.
- Toliver, you got a mind like a steel trap.

1013
01:21:35,017 --> 01:21:36,809
Argh!

1014
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:39,971
(GROANS)

1015
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,113
- You all right?
- (GROANS)

1016
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:43,073
Lieutenant! Hey, Joe!

1017
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,292
- I'm glad you...
- Where are the others?

1018
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:55,800
Snowden's in the cellar.
Bernstein's here.

1019
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,552
I think he's got himself a busted leg.

1020
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:04,348
- Get them below, out of the way.
- Look out. Here comes another one!

1021
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,168
Argh!

1022
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:06,801
(SCREAMS IN AGONY)

1023
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:25,568
He yells nice and loud, don't he?

1024
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,194
You know I do, you grease monkey.

1025
01:25:37,214 --> 01:25:40,749
Whoever thought
I'd be glad of a busted leg?

1026
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:44,087
You know what this is, don't you?

1027
01:25:44,221 --> 01:25:47,886
It's a one-way ticket, stateside.

1028
01:25:48,016 --> 01:25:50,092
Want your plugs changed, too?

1029
01:25:51,103 --> 01:25:55,729
No, thanks, Sarge.
But you can check my windshield.

1030
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:57,980
It's getting a little misty.

1031
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:04,983
Come on! They're breaking through.
We're falling back to the church.

1032
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:07,033
(GUNSHOT)

1033
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,449
Don't leave me here. Those guys are SS.

1034
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:19,003
- We'll get you some kind of stretcher.
- Them SS don't take wounded prisoners.

1035
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:22,215
Especially when their name is Bernstein.

1036
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:25,427
- What we need is Superman.
- You know it, Snowden.

1037
01:26:25,554 --> 01:26:29,967
- Or even that Joe Costa.
- Yeah, Costa. I wonder where he is.

1038
01:26:34,605 --> 01:26:39,349
You're yellow, all of ya! We're holding
for Clyde! Come out, you cowards!

1039
01:26:39,483 --> 01:26:43,896
Yellow! Come out! I'll fight ya!
Come out, wherever you are!

1040
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:47,149
We're holding for Clyde!
We're holding the town!

1041
01:26:47,283 --> 01:26:52,739
Come on! I'll fight! Come on!
You're yellow, yellow, yellow!

1042
01:26:57,168 --> 01:26:59,789
Come on, snap it up, will ya?

1043
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,376
- What happened to him?
- I busted my leg.

1044
01:27:02,506 --> 01:27:06,290
- Carry him. Come on, they're coming.
- We're trying to rig a stretcher.

1045
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:10,425
Hurry it up. You'll be all right, Bernstein.
I'll get up to see if it's clear.

1046
01:27:10,556 --> 01:27:12,549
- Come on.
- Try it.

1047
01:27:12,683 --> 01:27:17,808
You take it easy, you guys. I'm the only
guy in the world who could do this.

1048
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:19,730
- Do what?
- Crap out on a seven.

1049
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:24,234
- What do you mean?
- I bust my leg. That's a natural, right?

1050
01:27:24,362 --> 01:27:28,110
- Stateside for certain.
- So I win, so I pick up the chips.

1051
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,028
And what are we playing for?
A drop-dead pill.

1052
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,699
I almost wish I wasn't wounded.

1053
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:40,703
WOODRUFF: Come on, hurry it up.

1054
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:43,872
What's going on here?
Where are you men going?

1055
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:48,418
- Nobody's running out! We're holding!
- We'll hold at the church and courthouse!

1056
01:27:48,551 --> 01:27:52,086
We weren't told we were!
You ain't telling me, I'm telling you!

1057
01:27:52,222 --> 01:27:54,428
- WOODRUFF: He's nuts.
- Get back!

1058
01:27:54,557 --> 01:27:56,680
Cooney, you're blocking progress!

1059
01:27:59,562 --> 01:28:03,607
Get back there! You're yellow!
All of you! Get back there!

1060
01:28:03,733 --> 01:28:07,565
Too late. They're all around the place.
Get back down.

1061
01:28:10,282 --> 01:28:14,196
Geradeaus. Die erste Kompanie
zu den rechten Häusern.

1062
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:18,076
Ich soll auf
die amerikanischen Panzer aufpassen.

1063
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,958
Wo willst du denn hin?

1064
01:28:22,085 --> 01:28:24,327
Ich wollte mal im Keller nachgucken.

1065
01:28:24,462 --> 01:28:26,122
Dass du dich besaufen kannst?

1066
01:28:26,256 --> 01:28:27,964
Nur nachsehen, das ist alles.

1067
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:31,341
Mach dir keine Sorgen,
da ist kein Schnaps mehr übrig.

1068
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:37,174
Wenn noch welcher da wäre,
würde ich ja selbst runtergehen.

1069
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:39,100
Komm.

1070
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:04,452
We're cut off here.

1071
01:29:04,585 --> 01:29:06,743
I'm aware of that, Captain.

1072
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:11,671
The way I see it, we're trapped.
This situation's hopeless.

1073
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,004
- Sh!
- There's only one thing to do.

1074
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:17,675
- And what's that?
- Surrender.

1075
01:29:17,806 --> 01:29:22,267
- The Geneva Convention...
- Listen. They don't even know we're here.

1076
01:29:22,394 --> 01:29:26,724
As officer in charge, I'm still
the one giving the orders...

1077
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:29,265
- You're sick.
- ...and don't you forget it!

1078
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,106
- (YELLS)
- Shut up!

1079
01:29:32,237 --> 01:29:36,567
If the SS can't march Bernstein back,
you know exactly what they'll do.

1080
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,907
I'm doing the officer-like thing.

1081
01:29:40,245 --> 01:29:42,285
I'm trying to save lives.

1082
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,526
Oh...

1083
01:30:14,404 --> 01:30:15,566
Cooney.

1084
01:30:28,459 --> 01:30:32,327
- Joe.
- Your arm, Joe.

1085
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:41,220
Please...

1086
01:30:44,058 --> 01:30:46,098
Dear God...

1087
01:30:47,687 --> 01:30:52,734
just one minute... more.

1088
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:09,271
OK... Cooney.

1089
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,994
Time...

1090
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,957
Time to settle up.

1091
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:40,390
God...

1092
01:31:47,653 --> 01:31:49,776
give me the strength...

1093
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:56,739
just... just to do this.

1094
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,447
I gotta...

1095
01:32:01,207 --> 01:32:03,366
I gotta...

1096
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,127
I gotta...

1097
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:23,270
Please, God. I pray...

1098
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:46,493
(COONEY SNIGGERS)

1099
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:21,534
Father, may I go to hell...

1100
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:25,828
before I...

1101
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,189
(SPEAKS YIDDISH)

1102
01:33:54,194 --> 01:33:57,065
He didn't mean what he said, God.

1103
01:33:57,197 --> 01:33:59,237
He didn't mean it.

1104
01:34:00,826 --> 01:34:02,949
- Amen.
- MEN: Amen.

1105
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:07,660
I didn't know one man
could bleed that much.

1106
01:34:14,422 --> 01:34:18,502
Well, that being over, I think
we'll just carry on as planned.

1107
01:34:20,219 --> 01:34:24,431
You take one more step up those stairs,
and I'll kill you.

1108
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:30,645
Hold on, boy.
Let's not fly off the handle here.

1109
01:34:34,942 --> 01:34:37,184
Let's calm down.

1110
01:34:38,946 --> 01:34:41,318
Who said anything about the stairs?

1111
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:47,658
I was just... I was just
thinking of the welfare...

1112
01:34:49,165 --> 01:34:51,407
Get over there!

1113
01:34:54,462 --> 01:34:57,582
Now who's runnin' the show, eh?

1114
01:34:57,715 --> 01:35:00,586
I'm still in command here.

1115
01:35:00,718 --> 01:35:06,721
And the first wisecracker that gets out
of line is gonna get it right in the head.

1116
01:35:07,683 --> 01:35:10,934
How about it? Any takers?

1117
01:35:16,691 --> 01:35:18,234
No.

1118
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:29,328
Captain!

1119
01:35:48,473 --> 01:35:52,850
- Hey, the noise. What about the Krauts?
- Take a look.

1120
01:35:59,401 --> 01:36:02,152
Good shot. From the hip.

1121
01:36:10,954 --> 01:36:12,579
Sergeant...

1122
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:19,709
if we ever get out of here,
place me under arrest.

1123
01:36:22,047 --> 01:36:25,630
I don't see no Krauts at all, sir.
I'll check outside.

1124
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:31,679
- Did you hear me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1125
01:36:31,807 --> 01:36:36,386
- The Krauts got the captain.
- Absolutely.

1126
01:36:41,775 --> 01:36:46,651
They got him coming through the door.
I seen it. Jackson here seen it, too.

1127
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,232
That's right, I seen it... saw it.

1128
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:56,406
If ever a man needed killing, it's that
no-good putrid piece of trash lying there.

1129
01:36:57,975 --> 01:37:01,558
He's gone, Lieutenant.
Let's just all forget about it.

1130
01:37:01,687 --> 01:37:06,185
Now, look here, son...
I mean, Lieutenant.

1131
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:12,943
What's happened here...
I mean, what's really happened,

1132
01:37:13,073 --> 01:37:15,861
and how it's gonna
sound in a court martial...

1133
01:37:15,993 --> 01:37:18,401
Them's two different things.

1134
01:37:18,537 --> 01:37:21,241
Those armchair officers
will railroad you.

1135
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:24,290
I got faith in justice, Lieutenant,
but the army,

1136
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:27,868
well, it just got no sentiment.

1137
01:37:28,004 --> 01:37:33,343
Speaking of justice, shooting him was
about the most just thing I've ever seen.

1138
01:37:33,468 --> 01:37:35,591
He was about to get us all killed.

1139
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:41,390
Some sharp operator bucking for his
majority will make you look like a maniac!

1140
01:37:45,313 --> 01:37:49,856
Supposing Costa had done it...
had lived long enough to do it.

1141
01:37:49,984 --> 01:37:52,440
You wouldn't have turned him in.

1142
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,904
- Costa didn't do it. I did it.
- That so?

1143
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:35,270
Now who killed him? You or me?

1144
01:38:35,404 --> 01:38:38,855
Or me? Or Jackson there?

1145
01:38:40,784 --> 01:38:42,990
He was already dead.

1146
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,034
How do you know, Lieutenant?
You can't be sure.

1147
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:54,004
Man, he sure caught a storm of lead
at the top of them stairs, didn't he?

1148
01:38:54,131 --> 01:38:58,923
Yeah, six fat Huns
driving a 1919 Stutz Bear Cat.

1149
01:39:00,095 --> 01:39:01,210
- Tanks!
- No.

1150
01:39:01,346 --> 01:39:04,964
Yes. But they're ours! The 10th
Armored's here! The Krauts are gone!

1151
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,425
Yonkers, here I come!

1152
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:21,772
So long, Joe. You were a real soldier.

1153
01:39:22,409 --> 01:39:24,615
Nice man.

1154
01:39:25,704 --> 01:39:29,405
I sure hope things turn out the way
he would've wanted them to.

1155
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:34,000
Come on, the colonel's on his way over.

1156
01:39:34,128 --> 01:39:37,497
You hear that?
The colonel's coming. You hear me, sir?

1157
01:39:37,632 --> 01:39:41,416
He'll be sorry about how them Krauts
got poor Captain Cooney.

1158
01:39:41,552 --> 01:39:44,470
He'll be mad at them
for what they did to his friend.

1159
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:46,755
The fortunes of war, Lieutenant.

1160
01:39:49,143 --> 01:39:52,061
Lieutenant, how did you get cut off?

1161
01:39:52,188 --> 01:39:56,933
We were trying to get a wounded man out.
They came up faster than I expected.

1162
01:39:57,068 --> 01:40:01,017
Bad judgment. You got a great company.
I asked them to hold and they did.

1163
01:40:01,155 --> 01:40:04,156
- Who is that? Costa?
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:40:04,283 --> 01:40:06,821
Where's your captain?
I want to congratulate him.

1165
01:40:06,953 --> 01:40:09,194
He's over here, sir.

1166
01:40:14,126 --> 01:40:18,539
I'm putting you in command. Don't get
separated from the company again.

1167
01:40:18,673 --> 01:40:22,373
- What happened to him?
- He was shot.

1168
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:23,589
Down here?

1169
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:28,512
He tried to get back to the company,
but only made it to the top of the stairs.

1170
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,969
- Died like a real soldier, did he?
- Yes, sir.

1171
01:40:33,104 --> 01:40:35,309
He certainly did, sir.

1172
01:40:37,607 --> 01:40:40,644
- You hurt bad, son?
- No. A million-dollar wound.

1173
01:40:40,777 --> 01:40:43,980
- Good deal. Give the States my regards.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:48,277
Send out the grave detail and
get this man over to Battalion A.

1175
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:58,167
See you later, Lieutenant?

1176
01:40:58,295 --> 01:41:02,873
I'll notify Battalion and Division
about your being the new CO.

1177
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:06,792
- All right, sir?
- TOLIVER: All right?

1178
01:41:13,852 --> 01:41:14,931
OK.

1179
01:41:16,062 --> 01:41:18,850
See you later.

1180
01:41:32,162 --> 01:41:34,735
You see it personally, Woodruff?

1181
01:41:35,874 --> 01:41:37,119
Yes, sir.

1182
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:41,579
- He was at the top of the stairs, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1183
01:41:41,712 --> 01:41:45,792
- Then he rolled back down here.
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:41:46,717 --> 01:41:51,509
You're a good officer, Woodruff.
I'm glad to see you got this company.

1185
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:56,514
Maybe I'll put through a field promotion
for you. I want a captain in command.

1186
01:41:59,355 --> 01:42:01,846
If that's what you want, sir.

1187
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:05,398
Funny what you were
saying to me before about, uh...

1188
01:42:05,527 --> 01:42:08,943
going to General Parsons
over something or other.

1189
01:42:09,073 --> 01:42:14,613
A man'll say all kinds of things, do all
kinds of things under strain, won't he?

1190
01:42:16,622 --> 01:42:19,742
But I never heard you.

1191
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:22,538
So the old judge wanted a son, huh?

1192
01:42:25,756 --> 01:42:29,006
Looks like he had to lose
one to get one.

1193
01:42:29,134 --> 01:42:31,210
You know what I'm gonna do?

1194
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:34,548
I'll put Erskine through
for Distinguished Service Cross.

1195
01:42:34,682 --> 01:42:38,382
I'll write up the papers and send them
around for your signature...

1196
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,179
Captain Woodruff.

1197
01:42:40,312 --> 01:42:43,098
You have no objection, have you?

1198
01:42:43,231 --> 01:42:46,481
Old Erskine died like a hero, didn't he?

1199
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:55,485
- You're gonna push me too far.
- Woodruff, it's a little piece of ribbon.

1200
01:42:55,618 --> 01:42:58,785
What's that against a rope
around a dead man's neck?

1201
01:43:00,915 --> 01:43:04,580
It's not a dead man's neck, Colonel!
It's mine!

1202
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:07,498
Yes, my neck!

1203
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:11,462
- Don't get excited.
- You played it too far. Way too far.

1204
01:43:11,593 --> 01:43:15,839
Now it's phoney medals for the judge
with my signature on the citation!

1205
01:43:15,972 --> 01:43:20,266
It's not gonna be that way.
I killed him. And that's no simple...

1206
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:24,521
You're high-strung, Woodruff!
You need a couple of weeks' rest.

1207
01:43:26,357 --> 01:43:30,189
Maybe I'll put through a little leave
for you. A couple of weeks in Paris...

1208
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,736
- TOLIVER: Down here.
- Come back a new man.

1209
01:43:37,368 --> 01:43:40,155
There they are. One in each room.

1210
01:43:49,796 --> 01:43:52,881
Come back with your new bars on.
Your own company.

1211
01:43:53,008 --> 01:43:56,258
Life can be very pleasant, Harry.
Even in a war.

1212
01:44:00,974 --> 01:44:04,675
Take a look at me, Colonel.
Take a good look at me!

1213
01:44:06,188 --> 01:44:09,604
I may have pulled that trigger,
but you aimed the gun.

1214
01:44:09,733 --> 01:44:12,687
You set this whole thing up
so it could happen.

1215
01:44:12,819 --> 01:44:16,153
- They'll smell you out on this.
- Nobody will smell a thing.

1216
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:21,358
You got the high hand now, son,
the big cards. You'll play it smart.

1217
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:30,915
Your worries are over.
The captain's gone.

1218
01:44:44,851 --> 01:44:50,771
He was a good man. Don't see no reason
why we can't get a citation for him, too.

1219
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:53,934
- That makes it all OK?
- Get flexible!

1220
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:56,737
You know what a court martial
would do with this?

1221
01:44:56,862 --> 01:44:59,947
So what are you gonna do,
let a dead man destroy your life?

1222
01:45:00,074 --> 01:45:02,647
Understand, there's no hard feelings.

1223
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:06,495
I know you, Harry. You got horse sense.

1224
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:12,286
You won't tell General Parsons a thing.

1225
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,745
You got too much to lose.

1226
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:25,929
See you around, Harry.

1227
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,203
You know what I've gotta do, Joe.

1228
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:36,952
You'd do the same thing.

1229
01:47:06,115 --> 01:47:10,409
This is Fragile Fox One.
I want Division Headquarters.

1230
01:47:10,536 --> 01:47:12,612
MAN: This is Division.

1231
01:47:12,746 --> 01:47:17,871
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff,
White Battalion, 2nd Regiment.

1232
01:47:18,002 --> 01:47:21,418
- I want to talk to General Parsons.
- Will you wait, please?

1233
01:47:21,547 --> 01:47:23,586
Yes, I'll wait.

1234
01:47:28,596 --> 01:47:32,428
General Parsons speaking. Hello? Hello?

1235
01:47:32,558 --> 01:47:34,965
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff.
