01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,231
Don't you ever get up off your knees?

950
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,640
Well, say something.

951
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,720
You're dead.

952
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,756
(CHUCKLES) Really?

953
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,513
Ever seen a ghost smoke Craven A?

954
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,120
How did you know I was here?

955
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,031
I wrote to Bishop Scharmach.

956
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,560
I told you we'd both make it back.

957
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,920
You never said that.

958
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,310
You must have been
too busy praying to hear.

959
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,590
Lorna.

960
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,597
You're so pretty.

961
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,320
You still look like a holy roller.

962
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:21,110
How can you live without lipstick?
I felt naked for the entire war.

963
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,920
Anyway, I happened to be in Sydney
and I thought we might catch up,

964
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,720
maybe go to the pictures sometime.

965
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,120
I hear 'A Streetcar
Named Desire's terrific.

966
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,920
But your mother superior
wouldn't approve.

967
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,240
No, I guess not.

968
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,200
Of course, I could buy the tickets,

969
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,960
sneak you in when
the lights went down.

970
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,120
Then no-one would ever know.

971
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,280
I'm really glad that you came.

972
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,400
Whoever thought
I'd miss a Protestant.

973
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,550
Or that I'd have a nun for a mate.
