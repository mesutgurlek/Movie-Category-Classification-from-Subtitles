163
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

164
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,090
Jesus, Stewie.
You look like shit.

165
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,590
Come on,
let's do this thing!

166
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,600
Maybe he should
sit this one out?

167
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,930
He's good to go, Skipper.
Come on.

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,180
(ENGINES WHIRRING)
(INAUDIBLE)

169
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,820
Let's go.

(INDISTINCT)

171
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,560
Are you in 71 Zulu?

172
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,220
Okay, check
the rudder trim!

173
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,360
The rudder trim?

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,860
Yeah, I griped it yesterday,

175
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,300
but I don't know if
maintenance got to it, okay?

quarters, general quarters.

178
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
All hands to your
battle stations.

179
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,080
Which one was
Lieutenant Kelleher's bunk?

180
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,580
The bottom one.

181
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,060
Jesus!

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,660
Standard operating
procedure, sir.

SOP my ass,
have a little respect!

184
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,530
SKIPPER: Wilbur!

185
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,950
u can't
take this personally. Yo

186
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,710
What if that was
your bunk they were
cutting up?

187
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,920
You can bet your ass
I wouldn't just
stand by and watch.

188
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,290
Like we did last night?

189
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,860
Stewie guzzled
half a bottle of tequila.

190
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,260
Maybe we should
have stopped him.

191
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Yeah, and flushed
Skipper's party

192
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,290
and our chances for TPS
right down the shitter.

193
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,200
I shouldn't have let him fly.

194
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,570
He's a big boy.
He's flown rougher
than that.

195
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,040
We all have.

196
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,330
ADMIRAL LYNCH: Anything in
the maintenance
gripe sheets to indicate

197
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,330
a problem
with the airplane?
No, sir.

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,230
Drugs?

199
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,630
Married?

200
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,740
Wife's pregnant.
Everything was fine there.

201
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,800
What about booze?

202
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,910
We all blew off
a little steam
last night, Admiral.

203

(SIGHING)

204
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,350
You were the best flight
lieutenant I ever had, Duke,

205
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,050
and you are a standout
skipper but you lost

206
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,420
two men and two airplanes
in as many months.

207
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,360
You know
they're gonna be
sending a suit out

208
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,660
from Washington
to get some answers?

209
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,730
Yes, sir.

210
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,970
How's Dan doing?

211
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,470
Still number one, sir.
Good.

212
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,350

Yeah, yeah.

directions to some path

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,410
above the Bay of Napoli.

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,440
Where he
met your mom?
Yeah.

218
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,110
Huh.
She didn't
speak any English.

219
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,920
I think the only Italian
he knew was "pizza."

and on a plane to Omaha.

222

That's how it happens,
at least, that's what I hear.

223

When you know it,
you know it.

224

Hmm.

225
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,100
You just ironed those.
Yeah.

You're the one ain't straight.

C'mon, Dano, I got
things in store for you.

229
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,570
Where are you goin'?

230
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,940
WILL: I can't tell you,
it's classified.

231
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,540
CHARLIE: Classified? Come on!
Mmm-hmm, absolutely.

232
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,580
You don't have
that clearance, Officer.

233
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,980
You mean
he's not tall enough?

234
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,510
(LAUGHS)
CHARLIE: Okay, that's
not necessary.

235
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Yeah, that's not
called for.

236
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,820
Hey, you can get in
tight spaces. I can't.

Oh, my God. What?

You know, we were passing this
little jewelry store

242
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,790
and the cab just stopped.

Congratulations!

Congratulations, Dan.

Wouldn't she have known
if something was
bothering him?

Since when?
We're always
the last to know.

Could Stewie
have ejected?

Aw, I hate to
interrupt this beautiful
Neapolitan blizzard,

but we just got word
from Pax River.

We're down to two TPS slots
for the entire air wing.

I'm ever gonna fly
is the DC to Boston.

258
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,420
Because you had a bolter
yesterday? Big deal.

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,870
I'm telling you what,
Iron Man, my dick

262
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,540
was so hard a cat
couldn't scratch it.

263
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,970
I'd recommend keeping
your little head on deck

264
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,570
and your big head in
the cockpit, Boner.

on your six

I was, after
I nailed Stephensen.

269

I called
"Exit, hard left,"
didn't I?

270
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,020
I didn't hear that.

271

Well, you gotta
get your thumb out of
your ass and listen up.

about this place?

The building superintendent
belongs to our parish.

We used to come up
here and watch fireworks.

So what came first,
the guitar or the sax?

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,620

I played sax?

until she skipped town
with his brother.

have any kids?
No. You?

them up there.

00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,210
What about it?

477
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,800
Word has it his wife
was spreading her legs
while he was gone.

478
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,470
I wouldn't know.

479
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,610
So, Lieutenant Kelleher
had drunk too much
the night before.

480
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,170
I...
And if Lieutenant Marshall
finds out

481
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,940
his wife's cheating on him...

482
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,340
You know, you've been
the scheduling officer
for the past four months.

483
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,910
Shouldn't you have taken
them off the flight?

484
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,550
MAN ON PA: Lieutenant Lynch,
report to the flag mess.

485
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,160
Sorry, John. My dad.

486
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,720
Of course.

487
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,090
Oh, by the way,
heard you had a wild time

488
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,400
in the Big Apple
the other night.

489
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,930
Not really.

490
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,280
Cokely asked me
where we went last night.

491
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,840
You didn't
say anything, did you?

492
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,210
No way.

493
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,120
MAN ON PA: Navy departing.

494
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,120
I need some advice.

495
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,720
So talk to me.

496
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,660
You can't be objective.
Why not?

497
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,230
Because you thought I lit up
the Empire State Building.

498
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,640
Hey, ladies,
debriefing last night's
secret mission?

499
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,710
I'm pullin' chocks.
Catch ya later, Wilbur.

500
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,990
I saw the eye contact
between you and lover boy
just now.

501
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,620
You guys got laid
in New York, didn't you?

502
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,360
I've gotta get
some more shots
for the newsletter.

503
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey, I'm not lettin'
you off that easy!

504
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,770
I need your help
with the copy!

505
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,540
Keep it short and sweet.
Stick to the facts.

506
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,170
Join the Navy
and see the world, huh?

507
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,480
Pass you by.

508

five afterburner!

cannot hide!

Trumbo.

MATT: Where the hell is he?
WILL: Right up your ass,
big boy.

513
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,770
DAN: Trackin' for guns.
I've got a lock.

514
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,540
WILL: Yes! Goliath falls!
MATT: Fight's off!

515
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,980
DAN: No way, you're mine!

516
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,910
MATT: I repeat fight's off.
I'm headed back to mother.

517
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,150
SKIPPER: Holy shit.
Now that's a first.

518
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,920
What's a first?

519
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,180
Jesus.

520
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
You scared the
bejesus out of me.

521
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,550
Sorry. Did Dan just
nail Blackwood?

522
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,860
Yeah. What can I do
for you, John?

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,730
Nothing, nothing. I was
just hanging out.

524
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,800
You wouldn't know where
I could get one of these?

525
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,330
Squadron issue only.

526
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,970
Oh, right.

527
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,010
Look, I'll talk to
the supply chief.

528
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,580
Thanks.

529
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,720
Deal with it, I was right
on your tail, Wilbur.

530
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,620
No way, Boner, I'd shaken
you long before...

531
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,050
No, no, no!

532
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,120
What happened up there,
big guy? Lose your balls?

533
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,230
Hey, hey, hey! I ever tell
you guys about the time

534
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,370
me and my cousin had a date
with a pig? Wilbur?

535
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,600
See, I got this cousin, Larry,

536
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,700
lived in Colorado and every
time he'd visit, see...

537
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:28,080
Wait. Hey, we had this
600-pound sow named Debbie,

538
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,380
we used to take turns holdin'
her while the other one

539
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,910
hid the sausage.

540
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,880
You're so full
of shit, Boner.

541
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,650
Anyway, one time...

542
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,750
Actually, it was the last time
cousin Larry ever visited,

543
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,090
see I was goin' to
town on Debbie

544
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,690
and he was holdin'
her in the corner

545
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,390
in the pen in the
back of the barn

546
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,200
and all of a sudden his
face just goes all long

547
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,570
and white as a ghost.
So I get up, turn around

548
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,700
to see what he's
lookin' at,

549
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:59,170
and there's my momma
in her hair curlers

550
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,680
and her old pink bathrobe
just staring at us.

551
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,110
I don't know who went down
first, but we all did.

552
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,450
Yep, we all went
down in the end.

554

Boner, you're stranger
than fiction, man.

555
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,790
You should meet
my cousin, Larry.
(LAUGHING)

556
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,790
C'mon, Wilbur, squeal
like a pig for me.

I'll fucking kill you.

558

WILL: Goddamn it, Charlie,
you piece of shit.
I'm gonna fart on you!

559
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,100
Hey, I'm sorry if I pushed
you too hard out there today.

560
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,240
Forget it.
No, I mean,

561
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,470
I could've rolled out...

562
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,570
Give it a rest, okay!
I fucked up.

563
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,310

start hearing their warriors
sniveling, all right?

00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,960
These just came in
from Washington.

567
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,870
Holy shit.

568
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,010
We got it. We're in!

569

Whoo!

570
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,080
Congratulations, boys.

571
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,960
Sorry, man.
Them's the breaks.

I can't believe it.

Good shit, dude.

Wilbur!

575
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,030
Don't tell me,
they're sending a
monkey in my place.

576
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,570
No. It's your father.

577
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,340
What happened?

578
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,440
He's at Norfolk
General Hospital.

579
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,110
He had a heart attack.

MAN ON PA: All hands
report to battle stations.

It's not that simple.

She's got the number one
aviator in the fleet.

she want?

have anything to do with this.

Please.
Okay.

633
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Bye.

634
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,500
How's Wilbur's dad?

635
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,440
Stable.

636
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,840
Where's your fiancee?

637
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,750
We decided to
take a break.

638
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,920
You okay?
Yeah.

639
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,520
I was hoping
you'd come.

640
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm gonna give
this to Wilbur.

641
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,190
All right.

642
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,100
Happy birthday, Wilbur.

643
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,810
Thanks, man.

644
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,110
Excuse me.

00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,910
Thank you.

Ah, fuck.

How do you fit
four queers on
a bar stool?

we'll see you soon.

I hope you're driving?
Yes.

You have fun?
I always have fun.

You bastard.

something...

Is everything okay
with you and Nance?

it's like to fall
for another man.

can do this. We can.

some sacrifices.

things behind.

things is yourself?

all over Lieutenant Lynch.

What exactly
were they doing?

733
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,190
They were dancing,
quite close.

Um...

735
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,420
They had their
shirts off.

736
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,990
And...

737
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,530
They were touching.
It was...

738
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,630
It was of a sexual
nature, sir.

739
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,400
Was anyone else there
besides Blackwood?

740
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,970
Yes, sir. Lieutenant Trumbo
was also there.

Lieutenant Trumbo?
Yes, sir.

Listen.

744
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,550
If you can think
of anything else,
I wanna know.

745
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,720
Yes, sir.
Good.

has improved,

has deteriorated
considerably, Bill.

a position that

be on the road at night.

Yo, come here. All right,
turn and face, let's go.

00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,030
What you got?
Huh?

761
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,770
See, you gotta
be more ready.

it's in your face.

about that?

Ah, you're goin' nowhere.

766
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,210
Careful!

be careful?
Look no hands, Mom.

a basketball.
Oh yeah? Cool.

We need to
get a hoop.
I guess so.

Yeah, where'd you go?

776
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,080

Can we finish
The Space Shuttletoday?

780
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,560
Sure. After you take
a nap, okay?

781
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,830
But right now I just
want you to dream

782
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,560
of rockets and spaceships

783
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,700
and all the beautiful
stars, okay?

784
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,130
Sleep tight, mister.

785
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,550
Another TPS slot opened up.

The same class you and
Will are headed for.

01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,160
What do you think?

789
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,330
Go for it.
You think so?

790
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,600
Absolutely.

791
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
Man, we're gonna set
that town on fire!
Shh.

792
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,000
What? Oh.

793
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,610
Um...

794
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,840
I'm staying here.

795
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,020
I'm going back on
tour with 53.

01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,820
What?

797
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,790
I won't see you anymore.

798
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,630
Look, we had a drunken
night in New York,

799
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:45,070
so let's just chalk it up to
experience, what d'you say?

800
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,470
I've got your number,
remember?

801
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,680
It's the same as mine.

802
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,040
What about your wife?

803
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,480
You said
you wanted a family...

804
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:53,880
Yeah, I do!

805
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,080
But that's not what's
happening here! Not now.

806
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,630
I've made up my mind.

807
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,130
Shit, wait,
wait, wait.

808
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,900
What?
I've gotta move my
gear back to the BOQ.

809
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,930
The Q?

810
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,940
Tammi and I split.

811
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,470
No more.
I'm on duty.

812
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

813
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,510
I promised Attie
that I would spend

814
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,020
some time with him
this evening.

815
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,980
Right, and I've gotta
fly the avionics hop

816
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,990
with Will and Boner.

817
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,390
Well, then maybe we
could grab a late dinner?

818
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,790
I mean, you can
crash at my place
after the hop.

819
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,630
The key's above
thor.

820
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,860
There's beer in the fridge.

821
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,170
All right.

822
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,100
I've been working
on something, too.

823
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,040
Maybe you wanna
give it a listen or...

824
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,010
Sure.

825
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,120
Above the door?
Yeah.

826
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,340
SKIPPER: John, your
assumptions are based
on the accusations

827
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,900
of an insubordinate
sailor who...

828
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,070
Who knows more about
your men than you do!

829
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,740
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

830
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,050
Okay, the CNO'S
son is the target of

831
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,250
a gay cell which is destroying
the cohesion of your squadron!

832
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,790
A gay cell?
Yeah.

833
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,890
Blackwood. Trumbo. And
that's just for starters.

834
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,260
You are a safety
specialist, John.

835
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,290
A fucking civilian. Okay?

836
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,130
You don't have the
authority to do shit.

837
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,540
Special Agent John Cokely,
NCIS.

838
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,340
That enough authority for you?

839
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,740
JOHN: How's a buff guy
like you still single?

840
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:13,810
Buff?
Why, thank you!

841
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,110
Guess I just haven't
been lucky enough

842
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,650
to meet the right
person yet.

843
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,850
Ah, but you like girls,
don't you?

844
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,850
Girls?
Mmm-hmm.

845
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,290
I liked girls when
I was a kid.

846
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,430
I like women now.

847
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,030
Get your clothes on,
Trumbo.

848
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,000
I would,
but you're standin' in
front of my skivvies.

849
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,840
Yeah, well,

850
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,940
Petty Officer Gorden told us

851
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:43,610
he saw you in a gay
club in New York.

852
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,880
Really?
Really.

853
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,320
You have anything to
say about that?
(SIGHING)

854
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,890
Well, I do remember
a lot of men

855
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,050
dancin' with men.

856
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:58,760
Were they homosexuals?

857
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,830
What exactly was
Dan doing there?

858
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,660
Was he there?
All right.

859
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,600
Can you explain this?

860
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,100
Whoa.

861
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,170
Well, that's embarrassing.

862
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,640
That's understandable.

863
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,040
When you got...
No, 'cause I can
promise you,

864
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,310
that this makes my johnson
look half its actual size.

865
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,650
Wouldn't you agree?

866
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,150
Dan and his fiancee,

867
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,660
they're still doing
the dirty deed?

868
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,460
"Dirty"?

869
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,190
Are they fucking?

870
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,830
Look, let's just
cut to the chase,

871
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,900
you wanna know what
makes his pecker hard.

872
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,840
Well, I don't know and
I don't give a rat's ass.

873
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,370
As long as he can
cut the Grey Poupon

874
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,610
when the shit
hits the fan,

875
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,940
he can hump a tree
if it revs his engine.

876
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,550
I'd love to sit
here and chat,
but I got a date,

877
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,590
with a very sexy airplane.

878
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,930
We'll be talking
soon though.

879
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,630
Afternoon, Skipper. Sir?
Iron Man.

880
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,970
Why didn't you tell me
you were having problems

881
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:17,970
in your marriage?

882
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,680
Where'd you
hear that, sir?

883
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,680
You... You seeing another
girl on the side?

884
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,650
No, sir.

885
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,920
Look, I'm filling out
fitness reports.

886
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,450
I need to include
something about your wife

887
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,860
or your girlfriend in order
to justify your TPS slot.

888
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,430
Sir?
Cokely is crawlin' up my ass.

889
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,060
Either you're part
of the solution,

890
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,300
or you're part
of the problem.

891
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:48,800
Understand?

892
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,250
Sorry, Boner.

893
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,920
Where's Iron Man?

894
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,530
He went lookin' for you.

895
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,800
Everything cool?

896
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,430
Let's roll.

897
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,970
Okay, try and look ahead
of you, like you're looking

898
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,670
at a player who's gonna
try and stop you, okay?

899
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,440
It's official.
Everything's over cooked.

900
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,280
I don't know what
to say, sweetie,

901
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,750
I mean, he should've
been home an hour ago.

902
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,620
Watch out.

903
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,340
(TRUMPET PLAYING)

904
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,170
(GUN FIRING)

905
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,040
(GUN FIRING)

906
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,110
(GUN FIRING)

907
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,000
DAN: Be sure you give
this to Tammi.

908
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,260
CHARLIE: I will.

909
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Matt's dead.

910
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,280
Tears won't bring
him back.
Will, please.

911
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,220
We'd better get a move on.

912
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,430
I loved Matt.

913
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,460
Of course you did,
honey.

914
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,270
That night in New York,

915
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,370
I didn't forget
you were waiting.

916
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:13,350
I blew you off.

917
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,040
I was watching Attie...

918
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,050
He came by
and we kissed,

919
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,160
and everything just...
No.

920
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,660
We've gotta get home.

921
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,350
Dan! I need you
to come with me.

922
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,430
JOHN: You can circle the
wagons, but

923
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,300
you're always gonna
be surrounded.

924
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,600
Well, well. What's
goin' on here?

925
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,300
Uh. We were just...
Gettin' acquainted?

926
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,140
Did he tell you about his
bailout over Pensacola Bay?

927
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,410
No, sir, I didn't
see anything.

928
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,480
That's 'cause it's
been expunged.

929
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,380
Bird strike.
Five years ago.

930
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,650
He had command of
the aircraft,

931
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,680
took a direct hit
after an unauthorized

932
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,220
touch-and-go from
an abandoned airfield.

933
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,850
He's new at this.

934
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,190
There was an accident report,
a thorough investigation.

935
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,690
The case was closed.

936
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,460
Then, why do you think
you're here, Don?

937
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,360
Dan.
Whatever.

938
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,430
Any ideas?

939
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,230
Not really.

940
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,130
Last week's mishap,

941
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,400
why do you think Blackwood
lost control of his plane?

942
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,640
What makes you
think he did?

943
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,780
You're stalking me?
In my business it's
called surveillance.

944
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,150
What were you
doin' here?

945
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,990
Nothing.
There you go lyin' again.

946
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,290
I'm not lying.

947
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,660
You and Blackwood were seen
in a gay club in New York.

948
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,590
You fuckin' homo!

949
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,660
If you guys thought less
about your dicks...

950
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,160
Secure him!
Step back.

951
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:47,460
Special Agent John Cokely.
Where's my husband?

952
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,300
Maybe you should
take a seat.

953
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,340
My kitchen?
Yes.

954
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:07,950
What do you think they
might be doing there?

955
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,410
Talking?

956
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:21,860
Your husband and
Lieutenant Lynch seem to be
unusually close.

(SCOFFING)

958
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,840
I think I can say with
absolute certainty

959
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,910
that my husband is...
(LAUGHS)

960
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,710
(LAUGHING)

961
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,410
You've got to
be kidding me.

962
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,820
I told you, I didn't
meet up with them.

963
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,050
Do you know where they went?

964
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,720
Sightseeing?

965
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,390
"Sightseeing"? Is that code?

966
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,790
Pink triangles,
rainbow flags?

967
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,930
(LAUGHING)

968
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,300
How much more
of this bullshit do I
have to tolerate?

969
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:04,000
Can you identify the
men in this photo, Will?

970
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:08,470
I'm pretty sure that's
me, Stewie, Dan,

971
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,410
and Boner in
Italy last year.

972
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,280
That is you in
the middle?

973
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,450
We'd been to
the Sistine Chapel.

974
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,890
We were recreating one
of the murals we saw

975
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,150
painted on the ceiling.

976
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,730
And who instigated
the gay orgy afterwards?

977
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,530
We posed for a picture.
That's it.

978
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,600
You do realize, Will,
you are subject

979
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,700
to certain expectations
regarding your conduct?

980
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,170
Gimme a break.
We were on leave.

981
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,940
There was nobody
around for miles.

982
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:43,440
Pensacola bird strike.
Five years ago.

983
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:46,810
Something's fishy 'bout
the post mishap medical.

984
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,380
What are you
hidin', Lieutenant?

985
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:51,080
Says that you waited
in the woods six hours

986
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,020
before the SAR team
located you...
On the beach! We were on...

987
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,120
That you both returned
with hemorrhoids.

988
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,760
Scared your daddy's
gonna find out

989
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,390
that you like gettin'
plugged by men?

990
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,760
You ever punch
out of a plane at
400 miles an hour?

991
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:06,060
Do your homework.
Jet jocks get hemorrhoids.

992
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,300
I'm not gay.

993
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,700
We'll see about that.

994
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:13,640
Your buddy was seen engaged
in a homosexual activity

995
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,410
with Blackwood during your
last port call in New York.

996
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,780
He just confessed, Will.

997
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,330
Looks like they had a secret
life that didn't include you.

998

If you're not back
here by 0700

1003
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,250
Monday morning,
I'll have you locked up

1004
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,780
where nobody will
ever find you.

1005
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,480
Where you goin'?

1006
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,180
Gotta talk to my dad.

1007
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,190
What the hell
are you doing?

1008
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,390
You sure you wanna
throw that away?

1009
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,930
You know, you and Iron Man
weren't the only Navy guys

1010
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,440
in that club.
What were you
doing there?

1011
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,870
C'mon, Dano,
the music's better

1012
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,040
and the people
are more fun.

1013
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,480
Did Cokely question you?

1014
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,480
I did not bilge you, buddy.

1015
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,590
He sure was a
handsome dog.

1016
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,830
Keep it if you want.

1017
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,070
Did you talk to Wilbur?

1018
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,970
He's all right,
he'll come around.

1019
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,070
He's just freaked out
about the accident.

1020
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,550
What really happened
up there?

1021
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:46,690
Wilbur called a rendezvous.

1022
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,720
Matt was on top,

1023
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,460
Wilbur was in the slot.

1024
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,130
I was joining from below.

1025
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,140
And, uh...

1026
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,750
My whole life I've been
waitin' for somebody.

1027
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,190
Can't imagine how much you
must hurt right now.

1028
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,260
Fly safe.

1029
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,590
Well, I thought,

1030
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,960
a candlelight ceremony
in the National Cathedral.

1031
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:06,970
(GASPS) You're kidding,
you can't be serious!
Don't you think it's fitting?

1032
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,740
I told you...

1033
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,340
She's an actress in New York.
She is blonde, gorgeous,

1034
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,010
darling, perfect manners.
They must be a perfect couple.

1035
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,580
They are made in heaven.

1036
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,320
Oh, Romi, I was just,
I was wondering...

1037
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,990
See if you could... I can't
quite... I don't know why.

1038
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:48,040
Can we talk?

1039
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,440
I've already been briefed.

1040
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,760
Daniel.
Admiral.

1041
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,760
I thought you were at
home taking it easy?

1042
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,800
Had enough of that, son.
Full speed ahead.
No other way.

1043
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,530
Yes, sir.
I understand
you're getting

1044
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,170
some heat from
the spooks downstairs.

1045
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,540
Nothing I can't
handle, sir.

1046
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:23,110
Well, I'm gonna
check into it.

1047
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,910
Don't let the bastards
get you down.

1048
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:27,210
Yes, sir. Thank you,
Admiral.

1049
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,760
Gorden says you were all over
Blackwood in that night club.

1050
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,960
He saw us dancing.
Period.

1051
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:52,100
And you don't remember
anybody else in that club,

1052
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,870
other than Blackwood?

1053
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,880
You sure you don't wanna
make this easy for yourself?

1054
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,290
So you break up with your
lady after eight years?

1055
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,320
That must've been difficult.

1056
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,470
She's a lot of things
I thought I wanted.

1057
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,310
Things my family
wanted me to want.

1058
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,290
Life would be a lot simpler if
you'd just accept who you are.

1059
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:47,430
Hell, it took me years, but
I found my peace. Eventually.

1060
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,300
So you're gay?

1061
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,100

Your lack of judgment has put
me in an impossible position.

1101
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:06,400
Yes, sir.
Not to mention the Navy.

Best not to talk
right now, son.

If the press got hold

Given that you had
no intention of

1112
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,430
setting up house

1113
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:34,930
and that you do not identify
yourself in that way

1114
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:37,870
or with that group,
et cetera.

1115
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,110
Sign this affidavit indicating
it was an isolated incident.

1116
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,280
Blackwood coerced you
into the damn place,

1117
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,480
forced you into
lewd behavior...

1118
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,210
That's not true!
The facts are unimportant!

1119
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,820
This is damage control.

1120
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,720
I went there willingly.

1121
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:54,990
We danced together.

1122
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,820
You're a disgrace
to the uniform.

1123
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:58,020
That was it, son?

1124
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,700
No, sir.

1125
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,470
We are warriors paid to
defend this country

1126
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,940
not spill our guts and
frolic in the daisies!

1127
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,480
What the hell are you doing?

1128
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:29,990
Daniel, please,
just sign it.

1129
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,690
No, sir.

1130
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:39,700
Personnel will have my
letter of resignation.

1131
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,970
Daniel!
Sorry, Dad.

1132
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,440
ATTICUS: Mommy?

1133
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,170
Go back to bed, sweetheart,
I'll be up soon, okay?

1134
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,990
For months I've had
the same dream,

1135
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,320
night after night.

1136
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,660
A Casualty Assistance
officer tells me that

1137
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,930
your plane was lost at sea...
I'm a good pilot.

1138
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:19,060
Nothing's gonna
happen to me.

1139
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:31,340
The Honor Guard just buried
your dad next to your mom.

1140
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,280
C'mon, Will, didn't
it destroy you?

1141
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,380
I have my own way of...
Bullshit!

1142
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,180
Bullshit.

1143
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:40,790
I'm so sick of this
sensitive man crap.

1144
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:43,490
Where would this country be
if we fell apart every time
someone died?

1145
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,690
It's part of my job
to keep it together.

1146
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,130
We're about to sell your
parents' home...
(KNOCKING)

1147
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,690
And you... Will!

1148
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,570
Dan.

1149
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,640
Um...

1150
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:05,810
I wanted to catch you
before you left town.

1151
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,780
This is for Attie.
His birthday.

1152
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:13,550
Would you come
in for a while?

1153
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,990
Susan, we gotta get this
stuff out of here,

1154
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,750
there's an open house
in the morning.

1155
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:21,160
Susan, thanks anyway.
No, no, that's okay.

1156
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:22,830
Susan, you're going nowhere.
We gotta pack this stuff...

1157
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,230
Dan, you two can
talk for a while.

1158
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:29,930
How can we talk when he
won't even look at me?

1159
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,340
Yes, he can. Will?
Come on, buddy.

1160
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:35,640
Last chance.

1161
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,710
Say it.

1162
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,240
I know you want to.

1163
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,710
C'mon.

1164
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,280
Say it.

1165
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:47,720
Say it, you
fucking coward!
Faggot!

1166
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:53,160
No, he didn't mean it. Will...

1167
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:56,290
Would you just talk to him?
Please, Dan.

1168
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,930
There's nothing left
to talk about!

1169
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:07,670
Fuck you! I'm the guy
who's always been there!

1170
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,940
I'm your best buddy!

1171
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,910
Then where the hell
have you been?

1172
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:14,780
I've been silenced and
harassed and humiliated.

1173
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,880
My career's in the shit-can

1174
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,080
and I don't have a single
person to turn to.

1175
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,750
What the fuck are you
moaning about?

1176
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,420
What the fuck
have you lost?

1177
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,360
You!

1178
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,200
I lost you.

1179
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,940
Where do I fit in now?

1180
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,280
It was my fault.

1181
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,920
It was just like the birds.

1182
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:55,990
I should've seen him.

1183
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,560
Maybe he should've
seen you.

1184
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,160
I'm done flying, Dano.

1185
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,140
What about all our plans?

1186
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,210
Our kids?

1187
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,910
I tried so hard
to stop it.

1188
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,750
I'll threaten to go to
the media if they don't
reinstate you.

1189
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,420
There's gotta be
some way to fix this.

1190
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,120
No. It's over.

1191
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:33,760
I'm not hiding anymore.
No more lies.

1192
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,160
What are we gonna do?

1193
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,970
I don't know.

1194
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:04,220
What do you want me to say?

1195
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,020
Just tell me what to say.

1196
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:13,260
Say anything.
Ask me anything.

1197
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,870
Just don't stop
talking to me.

1198
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,370
(SOBBING)

1199
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:50,580
Bill Clinton's 1993 promise to end the institutionalized persecution of lesbian, gay and bisexual service members was thwarted by military and political leaders hostile to the new President.

1200
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:58,690
Instead, the controversial Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was adopted requiring LGB soldiers to hide their sexual orientation in exchange for the freedom to serve without being harassed or pursued.

1201
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:08,740
The deal was largely ignored by military commanders and a record number of witch hunts ensued ending the careers of more than 14,000 highly qualified men and women.

1202
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:13,430
President Obama repealed the policy in 2011.

1203
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:20,910
There are more than a million LGBT Veteran and Active Duty soldiers. Fearing continued discrimination, the majority continue to be selective about revealing their sexual orientation.
