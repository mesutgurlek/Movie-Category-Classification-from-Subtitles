have been considering for about
a year, without a decision...

619
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,238
the next step to be taken
in the Pacific war.

620
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,437
The president has decided he
would like to hear firsthand...

621
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,592
the views of his commanders
in chief in the field.

622
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,514
Admiral Nimitz, would you
please present the plan prepared
by you and Admiral King.

623
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,591
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,433
In our westward drive
across the Pacific...

625
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,750
the navy's consistent goal...

626
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,037
has been to cut Japan's
line of communication.

627
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,429
Now, as you know, the central
Pacific offensives...

628
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,071
have taken under control
the Gilbert, the Marshall,
and the Marianan island groups.

629
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,596
In our view, the sound strategy
for early victory...

630
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,912
is to occupy the western Pacific
and seize Formosa...

631
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,230
both to control
the Formosa Strait...

632
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,039
and as a jumping-off point
against Japan.

633
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,556
Now, this means bypassing...

634
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,108
the main Philippine island
of Luzon...

635
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,509
until Formosa is secured.

636
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,239
After General MacArthur's troops...

637
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,595
have seized
the southern Philippines...

638
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,672
the access of advance
that should get the highest priority...

639
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,718
is the central Pacific offensive
toward Formosa.

640
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,951
General MacArthur
could then move into Luzon...

641
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,669
and recapture Manila after
my forces have taken Formosa.

642
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,275
In fact, with the fall of Japan...

643
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,430
the liberation
of the northern Philippines...

644
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,431
including Manila...

645
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,318
will follow de facto, without
any need for force of arms.

646
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,597
We therefore propose
to invade Formosa...

647
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,910
at the earliest opportunity.

648
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,150
And my planners are convinced...

649
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,630
that a target date
of March 1 , '45...

650
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,551
is not unreasonable.

651
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,432
Well, Douglas,
how does it sound to you?

652
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,870
I'm a soldier, and I'll
hold the horse if so ordered.

653
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,869
To bypass isolated islands
is one thing...

654
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,554
but to leave in your rear...

655
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,235
250,000 Japanese troops...

656
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,834
drawing their sustenance
from the Philippines...

657
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,798
involves serious
and unnecessary risks.

658
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,077
From Luzon,
I can clamp a blockade...

659
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,038
on all supplies
from the south to Japan...

660
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,839
thus forcing her
to an early capitulation.

661
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,388
Therefore, I propose...

662
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,438
that we land
at Leyte Beach on Luzon...

663
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,954
and then carry
the fight to Manila.

664
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,828
Given a successful landing,
aren't you afraid of a long
and bloody campaign?

665
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,196
With the kind of
performance and support...

666
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,238
provided thus far by the navy...

667
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,151
I can be in Manila
in five weeks...

668
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,198
from the day my troops
step ashore on the beaches...

669
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,111
and well before next March.

670
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,509
General, how can you say that?

671
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,592
Because for two years, Filipino
guerrillas have been working...

672
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,559
behind the Japanese lines to
set the stage for our landings.

673
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,030
It's your position to know,
but I can't conscientiously
agree with this estimate.

674
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,351
To take Luzon would demand
heavier losses than we can stand.

675
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,271
It seems to me
we should bypass it.

676
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,954
In my two years of fighting
in the southwest Pacific area...

677
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,871
and they have been
long, hard years...

678
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,272
fewer Americans have been killed
than in the single battle of Anzio.

679
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,999
The days of the frontal
attack are over.

680
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,958
Only your mediocre
commanders use it.

681
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,510
Your good commanders
do not turn in heavy losses.

682
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,912
[ Roosevelt]
Douglas, Admiral Nimitz's victories
have been no less than your own.

683
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,390
Franklin, all the years
we've known each other...

684
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,473
I don't believe I told you how
my father won his Medal of Honour.

685
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,438
No, you never did. But you're
about to do it now, aren't you?

686
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,117
It was during the Battle
of Missionary Ridge.

687
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,668
At the height of the fighting,
he saw the flag go down.

688
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,274
As others around him faltered,
he seized up the colours...

689
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,510
and rallied
the troops to victory.

690
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,112
Admiral Nimitz is one
of our greatest admirals.

691
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,079
But just now,
as I listened to the plan...

692
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,879
I thought I saw our flag
going down.

693
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,599
Oh, did you?

694
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,194
Mr President,
had we the will to do so...

695
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,750
we could have saved Bataan and
Corregidor in the first place!

696
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,389
To sacrifice Luzon a second time
cannot be condoned or forgiven.

697
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,357
My dear General...

698
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,238
bypassing Luzon is not
synonymous with sacrificing--

699
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,996
But bypassing Luzon has implications
which stain American honour.

700
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,198
Do you realize what
theJapanese propagandists are
telling the Filipino people?

701
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,157
That Americans will never
shed their blood...

702
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,674
to save the coloured peoples
of the earth!

703
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,035
Your zeal is understandable.
I admire it.

704
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,793
But we can't let it interfere...

705
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,235
with a workable Pacific strategy.

706
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,471
''I give to the Philippines
my solemn pledge...

707
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,358
''that their freedom
will be redeemed.

708
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,716
''Entire resources of men
and material of the United States...

709
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,711
stand behind that pledge.''

710
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,032
Your words, sir.

711
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,071
Mr President...

712
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,628
General MacArthur's points
are well taken...

713
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,952
and I'm sure that the joint chiefs will
wish to consider them very carefully.

714
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,871
I shall return.

715
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,555
I am going back there next fall
if I have to paddle a canoe.

716
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,792
If your decision be to bypass
Luzon with its millions of people...

717
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,758
thousands of American
prisoners of war...

718
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,674
to continue to languish there
in agony and despair...

719
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,555
I daresay that the American
public would be so aroused...

720
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,270
that they would register
complete resentment
against you at the polls next fall.

No, no, make it two.

723
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,555
Nobody can talk me into a headache
the way General MacArthur can.

724
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,712
Gentlemen, I think
it's time to call a recess.

725
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,473
- It's been a fatiguing day.
- Indeed it has, sir.

726
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,120
Recess was my favourite time
in school.

727
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,509
It's getting
to be that way in war.

- Douglas.
- Yes, Mr President?

730
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,834
Why haven't you come home
all these years?

731
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,276
Well, I've had
my hands full out here.

732
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,437
The country has evolved...

733
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,351
grown mature.

734
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,874
Change is inevitable, you know.

735
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,997
The things I value never change.

736
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,550
My only regret is that my son
has never seen his country.

737
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,676
He's never been home.

738
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,551
Where is that for you?

739
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,869
Well, in a sense,
the army is home.

740
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,076
Even my swaddling clothes
were khaki.

741

00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,910
I think of West Point as home.

The lecture halls...

744
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,628

where I became a man.

And I--

746
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,553

overlooking Manila Bay.

were also home.

I appreciate and understand
your feelings, Douglas.

the joint chiefs of staff...

750

upon my return home, that
I have had two excellent briefings.

I'm sure they'll be
both pleased and delighted.

00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,990
I don't think you have to worry
about that, General.

773
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,275
I know the 5th Cavalry.

774
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,069
When I was a little boy, my father
was a captain at Fort Selden...

775
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,720
in the New Mexico Territory.

776
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,793
Geronimo, the Apache scourge,
was on the loose...

777
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,714
and it was a troop from this same 5th
Cavalry that rode through to help us.

778
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,678
They fought then.
They'll fight now.

779
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,391
And they'll win.

780
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,755
Look at that, Mr President.

781
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,559
The second wave
is going in upright.

782
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,598
Our intelligence reports said the
Japanese wouldn't let us on the beaches.

783
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,798
But just look at those boys!
Nothing will stop them!

784
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,758
Where's my landing craft?
I'm going ashore.

785
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,274
I had it delayed, sir. Heavy enemy
mortar fire on the beach.

786
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,430
I felt it was unsafe for
the commander in chief--

787
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,796
- The landing craft, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir.

788
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,834
President Osmea,
you're home at last.

789
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,551
Follow me.

790
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,757
Correspondents, please
stay in the rear until after
the general makes his statement.

791
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,071
No questions--Jerry, where
are you going with that?

792
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,469
I'm gonna get a better shot
down the beach, sir.

793
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,235
I want that camera where it was.
I wanna see that wreckage
in the background.

794
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,596
The general will think
this smoke is marvellous!

795
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,511
Get back.
Correspondents, back.

796
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,477
Low angle, remember.

797
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,631
Right over there. Stay.

798
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,231
You see, General...

799
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,710
my people are going to laugh
if I fell in deep water.

800
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,395
- I cannot swim!
- That's not so bad, Mr President.

801
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,711
Everyone's about to see
that I can't walk on water.

802
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,998
People of the Philippines...

803
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,634
I have returned.

804
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,030
By the grace of Almighty God...

805
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,556
our forces stand again...

806
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,870
on Philippine soil.

807
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,311
The hour of your
redemption is here.

808
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,231
Rally to me.

809
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,151
Let the indomitable spirit...

810
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,677
of Bataan and Corregidor lead on.

811
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,957
As the lines of battle
roll forward...

812
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,429
rise and strike.

813
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,353
For your homes and hearths...

814
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,351
strike!

815
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,396
For future generations...

816
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,758
of your sons and daughters, strike!

817
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,230
In the name of your sacred dead...

818
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,878
strike!

819
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,599
Let no heart be faint.

820
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,911
Let every arm be steeled!

821
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,676
The divine guidance of God
points the way.

822
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,312
Follow in his name to the Holy Grail
of righteous victory!

823
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold it! Hold it!

824
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,078
General, sir, you've
arrived at the front lines.

825
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,311
Well, I see our boys fully
1 00 yards up ahead.

826
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,517
Sir, that's only a forward patrol.
The men are under enemy fire.

827
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,354
You'd be in extreme hazard
if you go on up past this point.

828
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,351
There's Japs right up there.

829
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,908
You can't fight 'em
if you can't see 'em, son.

830
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,831
Let's go.

831
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,111
[ Soldier ]
I don't believe it.

832
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,078
That's the first time I've ever seen
a commander in chief take the point.

833
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,638
Yeah, he's the greatest general
since Sergeant York.

834
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,359
[ Gunfire ]

835
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,318
[ Explosion ]

836
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,232
Cease fire! Cease fire!

837
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,351
Come on.

838
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,271
Will you look at him?

839
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,191
Does he really think
that he can't get hurt?

840
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,999
God damn it,
of course he does!

841
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,640
I've got a little surprise
for the general.

842
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,636
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

843
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,517
Sir...

844
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,431
pursuant to an act of Congress...

845
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,954
you have been promoted
to the rank of General of the Army.

846
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,828
Such promotion to take effect
1 8 December, 1 944...

847
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,751
by order of the president.

848
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,594
Sir, we thought that you should
get these on as soon as you can.

849
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,830
[ Explosion ]

850
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,673
[ Man ]
You got your fifth star, General.

851
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,548
Well, I have no objections.
I like the look of'em.

852
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,313
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you, Court.

853
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,431
[ MacArthur ]
I think it would be a good idea...

854
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,671
to take that mortar out
before someone gets hurt.
