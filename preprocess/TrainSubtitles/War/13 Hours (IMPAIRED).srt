00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,185

He gets his jollies pushing
around alphas because he can.

We had this commander
back in Ranger school,

00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,802
he was a real cockbag.

173
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,072
So on our last night,
me and a buddy, we stole his beret.

174
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,107
The whole barracks
chubbed it.

It's our third contract together,

We met training
SEALs at Coronado.

00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,735
Scott Wickland.
Tyrone Woods.

473
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,471
Dave Ubben.

474
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,833
Come on.
Let me give you the grand tour.

475
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,209
Huh? (CHUCKLES)

476
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,109
TIG: I can relate.
KRIS: Wow.

477
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,979
OZ: It's like
the lobby at Caesars.

478
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,515
Damn!
Shit's bangin'.

479
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,117
(SIGHS) Makes you forget
you're in Benghazi.

480
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,120
Hey, guys.
I'm Agent Alec.

481
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,056
Just dealing with some
Middle Eastern Keystone Cops

482
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,257
out at the gate.

483
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,826
Those guys
yell a lot.

484
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,696
What's your
setup here?

485
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,532
Our Ambo's residence in this half
of the villa is the safe haven.

486
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,701
Forced-entry,
blast-resistant door.

487
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,636
Security bars
on the windows.

488
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,705
Inside that
is our safe room.

489
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,107
Ambo have any
tactical experience?

490
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,743
Nah. He has us.

491
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,750
SCOTT: So, it's a nine-acre
compound, shotgun style

492
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,232
from here,

493
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,869
all the way
to the back.

494
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,057
I'll take you there.

495
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,893
His room links to State in D.C.
and Tripoli.

496
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,215
JACK: That's the TOC?
SCOTT: Yeah.

497
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,763
Back gate?

498
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,799
DAVE: One way only.
Emergency exit.

499
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,168
Got a couple 17 Febs
on detail, cameras.

500
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,304
It's locked.

501
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,940
What kind of firepower you guys
carry other than assault rifles?

502
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,909
We've got multiple
small arms.

503
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,877
And ammo in the TacOps Center
just beyond the cantina.

504
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,912
That way.

505
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,914
That's it?

506
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,050
I thought every embassy had standard
hard-target security measures.

507
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,919
Car bomb barricades,
full-time Marines.

508
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,620
Supposed to.

509
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,988
This isn't an embassy.

510
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,425
We're a temporary
diplomatic outpost.

511
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,727
Uncle Sam's on
a budget right now,

512
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,130
so I guess normal
security regulations don't apply.

513
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,200
Man, that's some real
"dot-gov" shit, huh?

514
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,122
SCOTT: It's like
our own little resort.

515
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,939
I hate to piss on
your party, ladies,

516
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:18,042
but five dudes with
M4s is not enough.

517
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,010
The locals on your front gate
are worthless,

518
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,012
perimeter's soft,

519
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,013
and this whole compound's
a fucking sniper's paradise.

520
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,349
Any big element
gets inside here,

521
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,591
you guys are
gonna fucking die.

522
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,594
Well, that's
heartwarming.

523
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,022
KRIS: What?

524
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,023
No offense.

525
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,658
Guys, we're a mile
down the road.

526
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,960
Anything goes down,
you call us,

527
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,962
I send Boon,
you're good.

528
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,171
JACK: Take care, guys.

529
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,232
What do you think?

530
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,969
A dozen years of military
experience between them, max?

531
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,211
Gonna be a fun week.

532
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,130
Djibouti, request
retasking ScanEagle.

533
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,332
DRONE OPERATOR: <i>Copy that.
I have eyes on both.</i>

534

TYRONE: <i>Oz, sniper over-watch.
Get in position.</i>

535
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,272
Amahl, you lived here
all your life, right?

536
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,748
Yes.

537
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,111
Is it true Gaddafi
only hired females

538
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,473
for his personal
security detail?

539
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,282
Yes. That is accurate.

540
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,155
(LAUGHING)

541
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,364
Gaddafi might've been an evil asshole,
but he wasn't stupid.

Easy, easy.

AMAHL: He's saying bring
your weapon down.

553
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,956
He wants his money.

554
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,091
Okay, okay.

Sona.
Sona, nice to meet you. Bob.

577

It's my pleasure.

Gentlemen, greetings.
Chris Stevens.

582
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,859
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Ambassador.

583
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:56,894
Nice to meet you.
Step on in.

584
00:29:56,896 --> 00:30:00,964
AMBASSADOR: So between what we see
happening in Egypt with Morsi

585
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,800
and the current
destabilization of Syria,

586
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,902
yes, it's easy
to imagine

587
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,937
any number of scenarios
playing out here.

588
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,072
However, in my mind,

589
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,475
our biggest mistake would
be to not view this moment

590
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,310
as an opportunity.

591
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,180
Relationships between
governments are important, yes,

592
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,215
but relationships
between people

593
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,450
are the real foundation
of diplomacy.

594
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,887
And I believe that it is
our mission as Americans

595
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,290
to help Benghazans
form a free,

596
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,652
democratic and
prosperous Libya.

Well, I won't.

the guy's going on two hours sleep.

608
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,350
He had a late scout last night and
an early buyback this morning.

609
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,352
Yeah, buying up all
of Gaddafi's arms.

to act like a professional,

1558
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:47,307
Roger that. Roger that.
Come on, come on.

1559
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,744
In Iraq, we had Black Hawks to
get us out of shit like this.

1560
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,680
Yeah. Well,
here we got nothing and no one.

1561
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,782
Kill the interior lights!

1562
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:58,224
<i>We're lit fucking targets up here.</i>
I'm trying, man.

1563
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:01,689
Hello.

1564
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:05,659
Surreal.

1565
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:06,860
Different world.

1566
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:15,737
Who's this?

1567
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,174
Amahl, are those cars coming
from the neighbor's house?

1568
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,711
Hey! Where the fuck
are they going?

1569
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:31,852
Guys, we just lost
all our Libyan security.

1570
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,720
Does it seem

1571
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,355
like everybody knows what's
going on around here but us?

1572
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,890
That's for sure.

1573
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,660
Strobe's on, marking our position
for the Predator.

1574
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:41,295
I hate to
break it to you,

1575
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:43,730
but I don't think we're
getting any gunships.

1576
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:47,334
Oh. Hell no. Air support?
That'd be too easy.

1577
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:50,804
TIG: <i>Viper, turn off
these goddamn interiors</i>

1578
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:51,872
or I'm gonna shoot
them out myself!

1579
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:53,574
I'm working on it.

1580
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:54,474
He's having a bad night.
<i>Work with me.</i>

1581
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,276
Fuck.
<i>Come on.</i>

1582
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,205
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)

1583
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:01,321
Sorry, guys.
I'm just a bit nervous.

1584
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,417
Wow. Thank you.

1585
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,987
BOON: Rone, which way
you think they're coming?

1586
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:09,523
When they come, they're
coming through Zombieland.

1587
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:19,700
That's strange.
That cop slowed down, then sped back up.

1588
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:21,942
KRIS: <i>I feel like I'm in
a fucking horror movie.</i>

1589
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:26,940
Chef?
Yeah?

1590
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:28,942
Put that down
right there.

1591
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,777
You go downstairs, make sure
everybody in this building's safe.

1592
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:31,779
CHEF: Got it.

1593
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:36,383
TYRONE: Oz? This is where
we make our stand!

1594
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,787
It's dark out there.
BOON: Hey, Rone,

1595
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:43,690
we're going to Building B.
It's better vantage.

1596
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:44,858
Get those DS guys
off of there.

1597
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,394
State!

1598
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,876
I want you to go down and protect
Building C from the ground.

1599
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:06,980
OZ: Guys, let's set sectors of
fire with overlapping coverage.

1600
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:09,283
Tig, I can use you
over here on Tower 3.

1601
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:10,918
Oz, what do you got?

1602
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:16,657
OZ: I got a couple
of local shepherds walking.

1603
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:19,726
KRIS: Hey, State, we got this.
Lot of acreage out there.

1604
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,428
Get on your NODs.
Copy that.

1605
01:28:24,033 --> 01:28:27,334
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting any
friendlies to set up a perimeter?

1606
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:29,836
CHIEF: <i>Uh... Not that
I know of. Why?</i>

1607
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,772
KRIS: 'Cause we got cars
amassing, east side.

1608
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,473
In the parking lot
out by that house

1609
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,409
where the teenagers are that
throw the M-80s over the yard.

1610
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:37,331
<i>Then I guess it
could be poker night.</i>

1611
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,613
Just hold on.

1612
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:42,683
Hey. I got two
cop cars pulling in.

1613
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:45,819
KRIS: Chief, are we expecting
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?

1614
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:46,820
CHIEF: <i>Let me
check on it. Hold on.</i>

1615
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:47,822
Yeah. Take your time.

1616
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:50,424
Alan, check
the perimeter.

1617
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:52,226
Call Benghazi police
and see if that's them.

1618
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:56,275
KRIS: <i>Chief, these cops? I bet
you they work for the bad guys.</i>

1619
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,733
Does this look
like 17 Feb to you?

1620
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:01,835
Dude, how can
you fucking tell?

1621
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,237
They're all bad guys
until they're not.

(SPEAKING ARABIC)

1623
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,610
BOON: And there go
the cop cars.

1624
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:11,978
I got movement.
You see this, guys?

1625
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,547
Yeah, I see it.

1626
01:29:13,549 --> 01:29:14,915
TYRONE: <i>Boon,
how many you see?</i>

1627
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,616
I got unknowns moving
to the parking lot.

1628
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:17,718
Fifteen Tangos.

1629
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,353
I gotta call you back.

1630
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:21,395
OZ: <i>Good vantage point
from here.</i>

1631

TYRONE: <i>Oz?</i>

1632
01:29:23,592 --> 01:29:25,692
OZ: All right.
I got five more guys

1633
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,994
right behind them
little shepherds.

1634
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:31,064
One of them's got something slung.
I can't see what it is.

1635
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:32,632
TYRONE: <i>Everyone's got
weapons in Benghazi.</i>

1636
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:34,000
Until you see a weapon
in someone's hands,

1637
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:35,736
you do not fire.

1638
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:36,837
I don't want anybody
going to prison.

1639

they are coming in.

1642

Oh, yeah, they're coming in now.
Come on.

1643
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,094
Chief, if we're
expecting any friendlies,

1644
01:30:01,096 --> 01:30:02,796
I need to know
that information now.

1645
