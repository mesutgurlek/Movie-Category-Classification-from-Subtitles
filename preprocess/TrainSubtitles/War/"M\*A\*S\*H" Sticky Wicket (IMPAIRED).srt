Waiting for the <i>Robert E. Lee?</i>

00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,026
No, sir, it's Major Burns. He was due back
from "R" and "R" at 2400 hours.

3
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,428
I sent out the daily report
and said he was back.

- You took the scenic route.

6
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,764
- Yes, sir.
- Check his tent? He could have come in...

7

with Batman and Robin.

- No, I checked.
- It's not like Burns.

9

He's a lousy surgeon,
a pain in the butt...

however, he's always on time.

Is it habit forming?

14

No. I've been smoking
five cigars a day for 45 years.

- Scrambled eggs. Would you like a glass?

- Not back from leave yet.

It was very thoughtful of you two
to arrange for his "R" and "R."

It was that or go bonkers.

wept into his pillow?

that Major Burns and Major Houlihan...

were somewhat attached.

47

That's him. He was involved

that while drunk...

Kept calling her Margaret.

Acted like he was
shampooing her hair.

And then begged
to clip her toenails.

Ran off before we could apprehend him.
Is he there, sir?

00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,579
- Gonna try it?
- None of us have ever seen that operation.

301
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:09,017
- What are you gonna do?
- I think I'll hide in the woods till the war is over.

302
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,179
- [Phone Ringing]
- I got it! You got it!

303
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,315
I know I've got it.
Potter here.

304
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:17,691
Yeah, Sergeant.
Oh, not Burns again.

305
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:21,562
He was on this bus,
and he sat down next to a Red Cross lady.

306
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,998
Tried to bite off her buttons.

307
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,071
He kept hollering, "Margaret! Mar..."
Is that his wife?

308
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,233
No, just a well-built ship that crossed
his wake. Have you got him locked up?

309
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,779
Well, not exactly, sir.
You see, the lady screamed...

310
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,475
and the bus stopped,
and he jumped out the window.

311
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,542
Look, Sergeant, do me a favor.
When you finally lasso him...

312
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,851
put him in a padded stall.

313
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:09,476
<i>For your trouble</i>...
<i>Put this toward some shock absorbers.</i>

314
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:26,790
- You staring at me, Corporal?
- Oh, no, sir.

315
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,925
No, I'm sorry, sir. It's just we don't get
too many strangers around here standing up.

316
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,368
Charming place.

317
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,338
An inflamed boil
on the buttocks of the world.

318
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,809
What is that odor?

319
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,903
Uh, north wind, cesspool.
East wind, latrine.

320
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:46,450
- The wind is from the south.
- Oh, that's the kitchen.

321
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,312
Sir, are you the doctor
we've been waiting for?

322
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:54,654
That's quite likely.
Major Charles Emerson Winchester, Surgeon.

323
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,286
Corporal Walter Eugene O'Reilly,
Company Clerk. [Chuckles]

324
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,194
- Shall I get your bag, sir?
- Of course.

325
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,234
Where will I find
your commanding officer?

326
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,001
Uh, in his
commanding office.

327
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,008
Uh, this way.

328
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,906
- Ooh, I'm sorry, sir. Do you mind?
- [Clattering]

329
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,952
Not at all.

330
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,622
- Skoal.
- Anita Ekberg.

331
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,592
- Ingrid Bergman.
- Sonja "Heinie."

332
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:34,159
- Sir, this is Major Charles Emerson, uh...
- Winchester.

333
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,597
- Winchester.
- Radar, don't talk with your hands full.

334
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,862
- Welcome to MASH 4077, Doctor.
- Yup.

335
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,870
Drs. Pierce, Hunnicutt.

336
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,337
- Hawkeye.
- Doctor.

337
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,771
- B.J.
- Doctor.

338
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,639
Major, you have no idea
how glad we are to see you.

339
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:50,272
This is our first break in 36 hours.
Have a snort.

340
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,476
- Thank you. No.
- Got your papers, Winchester?

341
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:57,988
- Gee, what swell gloves.
- Calf.

342
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,182
Oh.

343
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,816
- Where you from, Charlie?
- Charles.

344
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:06,920
- Oh.
- We're pretty informal up here. We get very close.

345
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:09,694
I don't intend to be here
long enough to get chummy.

346
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,826
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- I'll join you.

347
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:13,836
Impressive, Doctor.

348
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:18,204
Harvard Med. Massachusetts General.
What were you doing in Tokyo?

349
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,209
Demonstrating
new surgical techniques.

350
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,542
- Up here, it's strictly meatball surgery.
- Patch 'em up and get 'em out.

351
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:26,014
[Snorts]
That's rather primitive, isn't it?

352
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:29,553
We've got a 98%
survival rate, cowboy.

353
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,886
- Charles.
- No offense intended, Colonel.

354
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,119
Offense accepted, Major.
And you can...

355
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,218
Look. We're all a little tired.

356
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,729
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot.

357
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,732
Colonel, I'm going
to eat now, sir.

358
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,302
- What are they having, Radar?
- Breaded Spam cutlets.

359
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,895
- Every meal an adventure.
- Do the officers eat similar rations?

360
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,532
Yep. We're all just
one big, unhappy family.

361
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:53,543
- Don't we have a choice?
- Two.

362
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,170
Rosie's bar across the road
or starvation.

363
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,181
Duncan Hines
recommends the latter.

364
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,945
Colonel, Dr. Berman is going into heart failure.
He can hardly breathe.

365
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,179
- Let's go.
- [B.J.] Ventricular aneurysm.

366
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,620
- Why the panic?
- Can you do anything about it?

367
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,657
- I've done at least a dozen.
- Successfully?

368
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,659
No offense intended, Major.

369
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,857
- Offense accepted.
- Let's hang out your shingle, Major.

370
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,936
<i>[Winchester]</i>
<i>More light on the heart.</i>

371
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,308
[Winchester]
That light flickers.

372
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,310
[Hawkeye]
You gotta synchronize your blinks.

373
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,937
- [Potter] It's our number two generator.
- Switch to number one.

374
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,948
Number one was stolen
by some locals.

375
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,950
It's now a taxicab in Pukch'ang.

376
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,749
- More suction.
- [Margaret] Suction.

377
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,017
Thank you.

378
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,218
There's your aneurysm.

379
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:46,229
Now, the main difficulty
here, gentlemen...

380
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:50,233
is that the aneurysm
may have a clot in it.

381
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,803
<i>If you don't do this</i>
<i>very carefully...</i>

382
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:55,099
it could break off
and go to the brain.

383
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,436
Then it's "Good-bye, Charlie."

384
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,136
- Sorry. Charles.
- So that's how you do this.

385
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,577
- You oversew the aneurysm.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,580
Good work, Remington.

387
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:07,617
- Winchester.
- Oh, uh...

388
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,279
- Still with us, Hunnicutt.
- 100 over 70.

389
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:13,448
- Beautiful, Doctor.
- [Winchester] Voila.

390
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,527
- Ready to close.
- [Potter] Fine work, Doctor.

391
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,563
[Winchester] Considering the circumstances,
I would say extraordinary.

392
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:23,057
[Hawkeye] Major Winchester, sir,
may I ask a question?

393
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:27,434
- You may.
- Could I stop by sometime for a cup of ego?

394
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,066
Wasn't that wonderful?
Such marvelous technique.

395
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:34,634
The whole family has gifted hands.
Mother's a concert pianist.

396
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:37,476
My dad can get an olive
out of the bottom of a jar with one finger.

397
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:39,709
- And leave the pimento behind.
- Oh, yeah.

398
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,548
Frontline humor, I suppose.
Crude and boorish.

399
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,351
You gotta admit though,
these jokers'll make you laugh.

400
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:48,584
Colonel, sir, I got Major Burns
on the telephone.

401
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,253
- He's calling from Seoul.
- About time.

402
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,990
You coming, Margaret?
It's an obscene phone call.

403
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:57,067
- Crude and boorish.
- Crude and Boorish. A great act.

404
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,160
- He plucked chickens.
- And she jumped through an awning.

405
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:04,241
Yeah, I understand, Sergeant.
Thank you. Put him on.

406
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:08,301
Burns? Not so fast.

407
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,973
Yeah? Yeah.

408
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,982
Uh-huh. You are?

409
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,984
- What's up?
- I should have listened on my own phone.

410
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,986
Opportunity missed
is an opportunity lost.

411
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,181
- Ralph Waldo Emerson.
- Writer of note.

412
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,054
- Writers of notes get famous?
- Please, I'm on long distance!

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,685
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay, Burns.

414
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,629
I'll take care of it.
Right, Major.

415
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:31,793
Right. The same to you.
[Chuckling]

416
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:34,428
- What's the latest on Burns?
- This one's a doozy.

417
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,770
He saw an officer and a blonde
walking down the main drag.

418
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,775
- And in his state...
- Bombed?

419
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,278
Boiled. Mistook them for
Penobscott and Houlihan.

420
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,817
Well, this couple went into a public bath,
stripped down, got in the water.

421
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,045
A man and a lady
in the same water?

422
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:51,621
- Baptists.
- Oh.

423
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,884
Frank jumps in with them,
still in uniform.

424
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,892
Wow!

425
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,292
Grabbed the woman
and started crying.

426
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,854
Suddenly, he realizes
he's in the water with the wrong couple.

427
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,198
Mrs. Kester
hollered bloody murder.

428
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:09,762
Wait a minute.
You mean Brigadier General and Mrs. Kester?

429
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:11,774
In the buff.

430
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:16,341
They're holding Burns
for psychiatric observation.

431
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:18,472
Perfect!

432
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:24,049
And then...
hang onto your skivvies...

433
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:26,146
he's being transferred
out of here.

434
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,282
- Transferred?
- Out of here?

435
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:31,260
You... Frank is being transferred?
You mean for good?

436
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,455
- That's right.
- Holy cow.

437
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:36,624
They can't do that to us. There's so much more
we wanted to say to the fink.

438
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:38,099
And all of it rotten.

439
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:41,137
You realize this reduces
the enemy to just North Korea.

440
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:43,639
This calls for a toast.
You too, Radar.

441
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:45,641
- Special occasion.
- Thank you, sir.

442
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,938
A toast.
What shall it be?

443
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:50,139
- Something tender.
- Something sentimental.

444
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,773
Right.

445
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:55,079
Good-bye, ferret face.

446
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:03,189
[All Laughing, Whooping]

447
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,899
- Let's put it over here.
- Okay.

448
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:14,699
- What does he got in here?
- I don't know.

449
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,070
[Sighs]
Ain't this the final kick in the butt?

450
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,302
We pack so Major Bonkers
can get outta here.

451
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,346
Not an easy task.
Each object holds such unpleasant memories.

452
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:26,178
The laundry.
One pair of shorts, perfect condition.

453
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,184
Mine.

454
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:32,746
- One pair of shorts, holes, buttons missing.
- Frank's.

455
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:35,382
One pair of socks,
perfect condition... mine.

456
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,393
You're pretty quick
with the socks, fella.

457
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,020
- One pair of socks, holes... Frank's.
- Frank's.

458
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,725
- This is gonna be easier than I thought.
- Matter of having a system.

459
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,734
- [Knocking]
- <i>Entre</i>z- <i>vous.</i>

460
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,667
Colonel Potter said
you were packing Frank's things.

461
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:48,671
There's something of mine
I'd like back.

462
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:50,673
I don't think
that's possible.

463
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:53,801
- Margaret, please. We packed so carefully.
- I'll bet.

464
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:56,971
- May one ask what it is you're looking for?
- It's personal.

465
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,743
- The torn shorts are right on top.
- I'll slap you.

466
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,945
- Bully.
- Ah, here it is.

467
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:04,954
- [Gasps]
- This is none of your business.

468
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,956
- What is it?
- A picture of Margaret in a bikini.

469
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,082
- Let me see.
- No.

470
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,318
- Give you a nickel.
- No.

471
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:11,418
- Show you where the horse bit me.
- Not interested.

472
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,293
- Oh, come on. How does she look?
- Beautiful. A goddess.

473
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,993
- Really?
- Oh! Yum! Yum! Yum!

474
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,661
- You're spitting on it.
- I'm gonna faint.

475
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,671
Margaret, put it back.
It'll keep him crazy.

476
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,673
Why torture him?
Frank wasn't all that bad.

477
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,776
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.

478
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,801
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.

479
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:31,244
In some ways,
Donald is no Frank Burns.

480
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,283
- Uh, Margaret...
- Margaret, wait a second.

481
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,682
- Would you care to elaborate on that?
- No, I wouldn't.

482
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,950
Margaret. Look, if you've got something
you want to get off your chest...

483
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,183
- I promise you it won't go beyond this tent.
- Oh!

484
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,658
No, thank you.
I'd sooner tell Walter Winchell.

485
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:47,128
- Might make you feel better.
- Why should I trust you two?

486
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,131
Because we're all you've got.

487
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,360
Because we care.

488
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:53,835
- Come on, Margaret. Have a drink.
- Come on. Sit down.

489
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,907
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.
But sit down. You look upset.

490
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:00,000
- Have a drink.
- What'll it be, gin or gin?

491
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,674
- How's that?
- [Gasps]

492
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:09,514
- [Chuckles]
- Terrible. Thank you.

493
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,555
- Something went wrong, didn't it, Margaret?
- Your word of honor?

494
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:14,591
- Sure.
- What about him?

495
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:17,627
- Him too.
- Well...

496
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,787
the first two days were perfect.

497
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:23,162
Then after that, it was like being
on a honeymoon with my old auntie.

498
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,098
What happened between
the second and third day?

499
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:28,639
Nothing. We were having
a wonderful time... tennis, shopping.

500
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:31,207
A lovely party that evening
at General Weiskopf's.

501
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:33,971
- Lyle was a charming host.
- Lyle?

502
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:36,137
General Weiskopf.
He's an old friend.

503
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,977
We stayed up and talked
and laughed until 3:00 in the morning.

504
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,983
Was the groom in the room?

505
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,985
Sure. He was
right there listening.

506
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,351
What happened after the party?

507
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:50,086
- Nothing.
- As in "nothing"?

508
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:54,562
He stopped talking.
He stopped smiling.

509
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:58,726
He stopped... everything.

510
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:01,270
As in "everything"?

511
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,101
Well, Margaret,
don't you think that's it?

512
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,238
- What?
- <i>That's probably it.</i>

513
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:13,647
Donald was competing
with your whole past.

514
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,446
Some guys can't take
that pressure.

515
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,612
The male libido can be
a very fragile thing.

516
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,284
Oh, poor Donald.

517
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:24,327
Oh, he'll get over it.
It happens all the time.

518
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:26,919
Frank never had that problem.

519
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:30,194
- Frank didn't need it. He had every other one.
- Oh, I know. I know.

520
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:34,328
Frank Burns was a little too
"by the book" for you guys, but...

521
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:39,466
I personally have some very
fond memories of our friendship.

522
00:28:39,577 --> 00:28:42,410
That dirty rat!

523
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:46,779
My alarm clock.
He said the bellboy took it. That fink!

524
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:49,079
<i>[B.J.] Margaret, remember</i>
<i>the fond memories.</i>

525
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,316
Oh, I'll give him a fond memory.

526
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,551
Bottoms up, Frank.

527
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,595
Schaeffer, this is
none of your business.

528
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,597
Colonel, please,
you're shouting at my lawyer.

529
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,894
You are holding
a legitimate Section Eight here.

530
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,731
- Lay it on him, mouthpiece.
- A guy hanging onto a dodge this long...

531
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:08,862
is a legit psychotic, believe me.

532
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:10,873
Look, Captain, it doesn't matter.

533
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,569
Teddy Roosevelt
had a transvestite in his outfit.

534
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:16,340
Rode sidesaddle
up San Juan Hill.

535
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:19,382
- Is that true, Captain?
- Could be.

536
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:21,678
- They all wore such big hats.
- We're sunk.

537
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:25,517
Oh, no, we're not. I'm preparing
my client's brief for General Phelps.

538
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:27,523
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- And, you, as my client...

539
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,991
do not talk to this man
unless I am present.

540
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,654
- Sir, phone call from Tokyo General.
- Got it.

541
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,788
Come on, Klinger.
You and your lawyer, take a hike.

542
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,595
Colonel, I am going to convene
a formal hearing on this.

543
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:41,695
Good. Klinger, I suggest you wear
your black sheath with pearls.

544
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:45,298
Basic black before 5:00? Really.

545
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,639
Potter here.

546
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,578
Yes, of course
I still need a new surgeon.

547
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:53,411
Who? MacKenzie?

548
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:57,578
Look, Baldwin. I've seen that clown's 201 file.
He's a boozer.

549
00:29:57,688 --> 00:30:00,782
Chief engineer
on the Red-nose Express.

550
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,553
Martinelli?
I've seen his surgery.

551
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:07,757
Let me give you a tip. Sew his fingers
together and make him a psychiatrist.

552
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:10,163
What about Winchester?

553
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,235
Yeah, I know he's temporary.

554
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:15,169
Make him permanent
and it's a deal.

555
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,172
Good.

556
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,902
Oh, really?
I'll remember that.

557
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:22,878
- Radar, are you there?
- I was, sir, but now I'm in here, sir.

558
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,744
- Where's Winchester?
- He's getting ready to leave.

559
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,875
- I wanna talk to him pronto.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,545
- And bring me back a Snickers bar.
- With nuts?

561
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:32,555
- No.
- Milky Way.

562
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:34,557
Damn partial.

563
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,559
Here we are,
for your refreshment pleasure...

564
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:40,859
before we present the ravishing
Boom Boom Goldfarb and a trained owl...

565
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,526
synthetic ice cream,
synthetic sherbet, synthetic spumoni.

566
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:49,095
Each and every cup contains
a $5,000 pair of Swiss binoculars.

567
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:52,141
Hey. This offer
limited time only.

568
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:54,143
Time's up.

569
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,611
Watch it, Mac.
Who wants melting ice cream?

570
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,614
But, Father,
I don't want to go back anymore.

571
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:02,413
- Son, we all feel fear. It's quite natural.
- But, Father...

572
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,421
Without fear, one would stand in traffic
and get run over.

573
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,390
It's nature's way
of protecting your life.

574
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,586
Father, it's not my life
that I'm concerned about.

575
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,965
Excuse me?

576
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,934
I killed three people.

577
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:20,936
I saw their eyes.

578
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:25,674
Father, I just don't
wanna kill anymore.

579
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:36,112
- Pierce?
- Chuck?

580
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,953
- Well, you're leaving. What's in a name?
- How're you feeling?

581
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:43,856
Dr. Berman, this is Dr. Winchester.
He saved your life.

582
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:47,954
Thank you.
I thought I was a goner.

583
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:50,033
Yes, I can understand that.

584
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,103
[Chuckles]
I think I've just been insulted.

585
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:56,196
Very observant.
Blood pressure?

586
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,537
140 over 80.

587
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:01,110
I can't believe it.

588
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:04,807
Dr. Pierce tells me
that your technique was extraordinary.

589
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,509
To him, perhaps.

590
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:10,610
Well, I'm on my way.
Good luck, Dr. Berman.

591
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,485
- You're not on staff here?
- Oh-ho, no.

592
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:17,049
This was just a stopover
in a stagnant backwater of the war.

593
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:19,857
- Gentlemen.
- Ta.

594
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,165
- I don't think he likes it here.
- I wonder why.

595
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,170
This time of year, we offer
so much more than Monte Carlo...

596
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:32,333
ringworm, shingles, dysentery...
and at decent prices.

Wow. We don't get

Yes, I'm painfully aware of that.

Major Winchester.

Uh, don't go away, sir.
The colonel wants to see you.

Colonel, I found
Major Winchester.

00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,982
Well, I hope he's succinct.
My jeep will be here momentarily.

- Oh, Winchester.
- Can we hurry this up?

613
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,057
I checked the O.R., the Mess Tent,
the latrine, everywhere.

614
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,593
And then I come in here,

00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:26,595
He was here. His gear was here.

Well, it's very kind
of you to see me off.

618
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,774
I would ask you to join me in a farewell drink,
but there just isn't time.

Oh, we'll have plenty of time.

You're assigned to us permanently.

No!

No. Colonel Baldwin assured me
this is just temporary.

Is this the same Colonel Baldwin
who owes you $600?

- [Laughs] Yes.
- Need I say more?

You mean to tell me
that I have to stay here...

628
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:04,327
just because somebody
owes me $672.17?

629
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:06,335
- That's ridiculous.
- Of course it's ridiculous.

630

- Can I help?
- Is there a prayer for my varicose veins?

Well, there's a mailman's prayer

Certainly not.

- Wounded egos come later. For now, just watch.

838
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:25,547
- Two big clamps.
- [Klinger] Another customer.

839

[Hawkeye] I'll take him.
Give him a magazine. I'll be right there.

840

When you're in a hurry, cut the mesentery
between two big clamps...

- and forget daintiness.
- Throw in a layer of catgut...

- Serosa to serosa.
- And Natchez to Mobile.

846

- No, it won't, and it'll only take 20 minutes.
