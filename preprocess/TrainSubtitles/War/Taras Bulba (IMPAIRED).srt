throughout the civilized world.

east across Asia Minor,

Triumphant, the Turkish Sultan
turned west to the Ukraine.

the frontiers of Poland.

The whole army's probably
lying drunk in the mud.

Never set foot under a Polish roof.

Not even a tent.

37

Colonel Manfred, we
will speak here.

It will spare us
both embarrassment.

Too bad we're fighting
on the same side, huh?

43
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,056
You fight well, Cossack.

His Majesty is pleased
by the results of our alliance.

So pleased he has decided
to do you the honor...

of integrating all Cossack troops
into the Polish-lmperial Army.

Do you see this scalp lock?

56
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,057
That means you're speaking
to the Zaporozhtzi.

57

Do you know what
Zaporozhtzi means?

Honor has nothing to do with this.

67
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,712
We need the Ukraine
as a buffer against the East...

68

We trusted the Poles.

That...

85
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,651
