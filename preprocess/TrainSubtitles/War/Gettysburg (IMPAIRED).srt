00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,242
I always do enjoy this time,
just before the dawn.

157
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,580
When all this is over,
I shall miss it very much.

158
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,416
Sir?

159
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,085
I didn't mean the fighting.

160
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,756
Well…

161
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,133
… it's all in God's hands now.

162
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,345
Good day, sir.

163
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,554
Good day to you.

164
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,443
SORREL:
General, sir.

165
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,822
Should I wake them up, sir? Should I
get them waked up and get going?

166
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,324
No, Moxley.

167
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,494
Let the boys sleep a little longer.
They'll need it.

168
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,204
Yes, sir.

169
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,316
SOLDIER:
Prisoners, mark file, left!

170
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,028
How many men do we have now
in the 20th Maine?

171
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,740
Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

172
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,245
How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

173
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,206
Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

174
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,460
Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse…

175
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,007
… that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

176
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,675
You walked.

177
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,053
Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

178
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,807
After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

179
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,059
Morning, Lawrence.

180
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,562
How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

181
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,814
Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

182
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,401
It doesn't make sense.

183
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,696
Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

184
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,539
BREWER:
Detail, about face.

185
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,543
Attention, detail!

186
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,588
GUARD: You heard the captain.
Stand at attention!

187
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,424
BREWER: Guards, get these men back
on their feet!

188
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,509
[PRISONERS GRUMBLING]

189
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm looking
for commanding officer, 20th Maine.

190
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,812
You found him.

191
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,065
TOM: That's him.
- You're Chamberlain?

192
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,234
Colonel Chamberlain to you.

193
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,488
Captain Brewer, sir.

194
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,032
118th Pennsylvania.

195
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,078
If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

196
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,579
You're welcome to them.

197
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,041
Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

198
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,544
You have to sign for them.

199
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,507
Sign it, lieutenant.

200
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,852
You are relieved, captain.

201
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,107
You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

202
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,442
You want to shoot them…

203
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,486
… go right ahead.

204
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,030
Won't nobody say nothing.

205
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,538
I said you are relieved, captain.

206
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,345
You men can leave now.
We won't need any guards.

207
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,064
My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the colonel of the 20th Maine.

208
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,278
When did you have something to eat?

209
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,949
They're trying to break us
by not feeding us.

210
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,576
We ain't broke yet.

211
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,163
They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

212
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
I'll get the cook going.

213
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,459
The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

214
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,379
We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

215
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,382
We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

216
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,342
TOZIER:
Yes, sir.

217
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,179
Well.

218
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,392
You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

219
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,730
Colonel.

220
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,358
Colonel, we've got grievances.

221
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,948
The men elected me to talk for them.

222
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,368
All right. You come along with me.

223
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,039
The rest of you boys go eat.
We're gonna get moving in a little bit.

224
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,840
TOZIER:
All right, men, on your feet.

225
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,593
- Gosh, Lawrence.
- Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

226
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,012
- Are they moving?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,264
TOZIER:
Forward, march.

228
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,058
LAWRENCE:
What's your name?

229
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,187
I don't feel too kindly, colonel.

230
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,981
LAWRENCE: Yes, well,
I'm usually not this informal.

231
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,735
I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

232
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,822
Somebody ought to welcome you
to my, uh- To our outfit.

233
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,494
They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

234
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,413
I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

235
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,541
Are you sure?

236
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,838
- Go ahead. Sit down, Mister…
- Bucklin.

237
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,548
Joseph Bucklin.

238
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,970
Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

239
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,055
How many have you been in?

240
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,767
Not that many.

241
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,311
It ain't the papers.

242
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,606
I done my share. We all have.

243
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,819
Damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

244
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,531
Look here.

245
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,951
It went clean through.

246
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,954
Colonel, we got a courier coming.

247
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,460
Listen, colonel. I'm tired.

248
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,046
You know what I mean? I'm tired.

249
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,885
I've had all this army, all these officers…
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

250
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,472
All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

251
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,808
They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

252
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,605
They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

253
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,815
I'm tired.

254
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,986
We are good men
and we had our own good flag.

255
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,157
These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

256
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,950
We ain't gonna win this war.

257
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,454
We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

258
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,832
These damn gentlemen. These officers!

259
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,752
KILRAIN:
The courier, sir.

260
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,257
Don't go away.

261
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,136
Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

262
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,514
Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

263
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,351
You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

264
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,521
20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

265
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,024
LAWRENCE: Flankers?
- Yes, flankers.

266
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,319
LAWRENCE: Right, yes.
My compliments to the colonel.

267
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,113
Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

268
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,324
Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

269
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,537
You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

270
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,373
Tell your men I'm coming.

271
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,167
The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

272
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,960
Don't call me Lawrence.

273
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,672
Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

274
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,383
Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

275
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,718
Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

276
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,346
General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

277
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,307
That's different.
Generals can do anything.

278
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,395
Nothing quite so much like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

279
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,816
What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

280
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,777
You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

281
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,320
I know that.

282
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,490
I wonder if they do.

283
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,248
Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

284
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,917
Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

285
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,585
Best cusser I ever heard.

286
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,588
Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

287
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,110
LAWRENCE:
You men gather around.

288
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:45,127
I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

289
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,130
There's nothing I can do today.

290
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,133
We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

291
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,094
I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

292
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,055
I'm told that…

293
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,435
… if you don't come, I can shoot you.

294
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,396
Well, you know I won't do that.

295
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,399
Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

296
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,401
So that's that.

297
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,654
Here's the, uh, situation.

298
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,658
The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

299
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,535
This is no time for an argument.

300
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,829
I tell you,
we could surely use you fellows.

301
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
We're now well below half strength.

302
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,919
Whether you fight or not,
that's up to you.

303
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:31,715
Whether you come along is…
Well, you're coming.

304
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,759
You know who we are,
what we're doing here.

305
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,970
If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

306
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:42,017
This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

307
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,853
There were 1,000 of us then.

308
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,065
There are less than 300 of us now.

309
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,031
All of us volunteered to fight

310
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,411

we were bored at home.

Thought this looked like it might be fun.

Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

313
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,843
Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

314
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,722
And all of us have seen men die.

315
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,185
This is a different kind of army.

316
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,522
If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay…

… for women, for some other kind of loot.

318

They fight for land, power.

319
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,033
Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

We are here for something new.

This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

We are an army out to set other men free.

00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,384
America should be free ground.

a brigade in front of him.

west of Gettysburg town.

921
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,852
It wasn't a pretty sight.

922
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,315
Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

923
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,568
Some wore blue, some wore gray.

924
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,449
Seen enough of this war?

925
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,826
I guess I have.

926
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,496
I guess I have too.

927
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,957
It looks like
I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

928
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,421
I appreciate you talking to me.

929
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,007
See you in hell, Billy Yank.

930
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,011
See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

931

KILRAIN:
I have found a John Henry, sir.

932
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,023
LAWRENCE:
John who?

933
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:55,528
KILRAIN: A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

934
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:09,542
Is he wounded?

935
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,794
Don't know for sure.

936
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,176
The man's exhausted.

937
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,888
We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

938
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:27,309
- Did you get his name?
- He said something I couldn't understand.

939
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,979
I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

940
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,856
Rebs or darkies.

941
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,953
All right, men, as you were.
Surgeon, see to him.

942
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,008
LAWRENCE: We had visitors
from the South before the war.

943
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:03,262
They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

944
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:07,016
We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

945
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,394
But toward the end there was
no getting away from it…

946
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:14,940
… and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

947
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,484
I don't know why.

948
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,614
They fight so well.

949
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:30,956
Tell me something, Buster…

950
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,793
… what do you think of Negroes?

951
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,673
Well, if you mean the race…

952
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,217
… I don't really know.

953
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,262
This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

954
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:50,142
The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

955
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:54,146
Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

956
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,232
You take men one at a time.

957
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,735
To me, there was never any difference.

958
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,529
- None at all?
- None at all.

959
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,907
Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men…

960
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,494
… but those I knew in Bangor, Portland…

961
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,539
… you look in the eye, there was a man.

962
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,168
There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

963
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:17,878
That's all there is to it.

964
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,339
Races are men.

965
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,343
"What a piece of work is man.

966
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,055
How infinite in faculties,
in form and moving…

967
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,766
… how express and admirable.

968
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,937
In action, how like an angel."

969
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,859
Well, if he's an angel, all right then…

970
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,905
… but he damn well must be a killer angel.

971
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,831
Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

972
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:59,211
I see a vast great difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

973
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,048
You're an idealist, praise be.

974
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,552
The truth is, colonel…

975
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,723
… there is no "divine spark."

976
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:16,311
There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

977
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:21,066
When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

978
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,444
Equality?

979
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:28,365
What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

980
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:34,246
Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, colonel?

981
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:37,958
Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

982
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:42,212
No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

983
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,798
Not a leaf, not a tree.

984
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:50,054
There's many a man worse than me
and some better…

985
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,058
… but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

986
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,020
What matters, colonel…

987
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:01,565
… is justice.

988
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,115
Which is why I'm here.

989
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,827
I'll be treated as I deserve…

990
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,164
… not as my father deserved.

991
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,584
I'm Kilrain…

992
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:24,630
… and I damn all gentlemen.

993
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:31,178
There is only one aristocracy…

994
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:36,350
… and that is right here.

995
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:46,902
And that's why we've got to win this war.

his compliments…

… and asks to <i>parler</i> with
the commanding general, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

That's me. Ain't it lovely?

I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

Hardly, sir. I'm merely an observer

LONGSTREET: General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

They do. They do indeed.

His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

- Nor that either.

to fight to keep him out of a game.

1074
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:12,292
Scarlet fever hit Richmond last winter,
right at Christmastime.

1075
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,796
General lost all three of his children
to it.

1076
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,256
The youngest was 10.

1077
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,635
Hasn't been quite the same since.

1078
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:28,850
- Um… The queen.
- To the queen.

1079
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,311
Her majesty.

1080
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,234
Well, see, you are looking fine.

1081
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,071
Looking lovely yourself, George.

1082
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,158
General. No reflection on you, sir…

1083
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,744
… but you know, my division,
my Virginia boys…

1084
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,705
… we haven't seen all that much action
for a long time.

1085
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,625
I mean, well, we weren't that engaged
at Fredericksburg.

1086
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,295
We missed Chancellorsville altogether.
Off on some piddling affair.

1087
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,173
Now they took two of my brigades,
Corson, Jenkins, and sent them…

1088
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,759
… off to guard Richmond.
I mean, Richmond of all places?

1089
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,971
And now, sir, do you know where
I've been placed in the line of march?

1090
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:09,933
Last, sir. That's where I am, exactly last.
I'm bringing up the damn rear.

1091
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,769
Beg pardon, sir.
You see, my boys…

1092
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:16,148
… are beginning to feel a trifle disgusted
at this attitude towards them…

1093
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,649
… as fighting men, sir. My boys-

1094
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:18,859
- George.
- Sir.

1095
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,778
- Please.
- I sure don't mean to imply you, sir.

1096
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,447
No. Hell no, sir.

1097
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,950
No, it's just, uh…
Well, the bureaucrats.

1098
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:30,495
See, I was just- I was hoping, sir,
that perhaps you could…

1099
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,082
… talk to somebody about this
arrangement of the troops.

1100
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:38,253
Would you like me to move the whole army
to the side so you can go first?

1101
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,005
Sir?

1102
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,968
Now that you mention it…

1103
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:48,346
There is no plot, George.
It's just the way things fell out.

1104
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:51,141
I mean, hell, look at it this way.

1105
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,352
If the army has to turn around,
fight its way back…

1106
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,938
… well, you'll be first in line.

1107
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,986
Yes, I suppose that is true, isn't it?

1108
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,155
You understand, sir.

1109
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,866
That this whole damn war
might be over after one more battle…

1110
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,118
… and my Virginia boys
will have missed most of it.

1111
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,870
Yeah, I know.

1112
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:14,998
How far back are they?

1113
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,209
Chambersburg, a hard day's march, sir.

1114
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,960
Mm-hm.

1115
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,756
I know I can count on you, George,
when the time comes…

1116
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,300
… and it will come. It will come.

1117
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,720
Sorry to butt in, but they're calling
for George over at the poker table.

1118
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,306
Your fame, sir, has preceded you.

1119
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,684
Well, thank you, general.

1120
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:40,148
Well, cheerio, fellas.

1121
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,194
Don't forget to bring your money.

1122
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,658
Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

1123
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,202
Old Winnie boy?

1124
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,288
Hancock? Oh, yeah.

1125
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,250
Well, how's he doing?

1126
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:01,086
- You're gonna find out.
- Yeah?

1127
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:06,842
He's got the Second Corps.
Damn clover leaves.

1128
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,804
He's headed this way. Probably run
into him in the next few days.

1129
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,435
ARMISTEAD:
I wish I could see him again.

1130
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,106
I haven't seen him since before the war.

1131
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,318
Never thought it would last this long.

1132
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,904
Me neither, Lo.

1133
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,950
I sure would like to talk
to old Hancock again.

1134
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,077
One more time.

1135
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,374
Well, why not?

1136
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,544
You wouldn't mind?

1137
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,546
Hell, no.

1138
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,591
I mean, really.

1139
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:52,137
Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

1140
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:55,682
Look, when the time comes,
and he's close…

1141
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,728
… just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

1142
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,896
Ain't nothing to it.

1143
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:06,026
Last time I saw him was in California.

1144
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,653
Right when the war was beginning…

1145
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,408
… the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

1146
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,119
Old friends off to war.

1147
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:19,247
- Hey, Lo.
- Hm?

1148
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,543
- How's your brigade?
- Oh.

1149
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,964
I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

1150
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:32,010
I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

1151
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:36,264
Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

1152
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,976
Remember what they used to say
about him?

1153
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:45,523
When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

1154
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,028
Lord, what damn fools we were.

1155
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,657
Now when he passes…

1156
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:58,495
… the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

1157
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,540
Have you ever seen anything like that?

1158
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,836
No. I can't say I have.

1159
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,215
It's amazing what one honest man can do.

1160
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,386
Mm. One honest man and a cause.

1161
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,349
I don't think on that too much anymore.

1162
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,311
I guess my only cause is victory.

1163
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,231
This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

1164
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,525
Then you put your head down and win.

You see, colonel…

1168
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:38,326
… the government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,578
Every government, everywhere.

1170
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:44,499
Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

1171
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:48,545
We do not consent
and we will never consent.

1172
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,881
And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there…

1173
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,093
… to your Parliament and you've got
to make it very plain to them.

1174
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,096
You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here…

1175
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:02,392
… is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

1176
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:05,437
I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

- Jim.
- No, no, no.

1178
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:10,150
Now, we established this country
in the first place…

1179
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:12,485
… with very strong state governments…

1180
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:14,904
… just for that very reason.

1181
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,449
I mean, let me put it to you this way.

1182
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:20,285
My home is in Virginia.

1183
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,872
The government of my home is home.

1184
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,499
Virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled…

1185
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:29,502
… by some king over there in London.

1186
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,465
It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

1187
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:37,135
Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

Sit down. I think that my idea…

1196
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:59,657
… my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

1197
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,493
Colonel, think on it now.

1198
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,746
Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

1199
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:08,666
After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves…

1200
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,336
… into our private lives, our home lives.

what we could and couldn't do.

Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

I mean, just resign.

That's what we did.

1205

That's what I did and now these people

No. It's a thought.

Will the British come in on our side?

Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

Thank you, general.

The Federal position was scouted

We've drawn it up here.

Now, this is the situation.

01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:49,333
The position of the Federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

It starts here. You see these two hills?

This one and the one with the cemetery.

That is where they have concentrated
their troops.

The hook starts there.

1421
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:03,347
Now, it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south…

1422
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:06,517
… ending before two round hills
of high elevation.

The Federals have no troops
on those two hills.

withdrawing from Gettysburg…

would be very bad for morale.

the enemy uses to reinforce himself.

What we must do is we must
make him attack us.

for fear he'll be flanked…

03:03:45,890 --> 03:03:49,352
… and Richmond has nothing left
to send us. So, if we stay, we fight.

2301
03:03:49,977 --> 03:03:53,481
If we retreat now,
we will have fought here for two days…

2302
03:03:53,731 --> 03:03:56,442
… and will leave knowing
we could not drive him off.

2303
03:03:57,276 --> 03:04:01,822
And I have never yet left the enemy
in command of the field. No, sir.

2304
03:04:02,156 --> 03:04:05,159
Retreat is no longer an option.

2305
03:04:05,326 --> 03:04:07,620
The enemy has been attacked
on both wings.

2306
03:04:07,787 --> 03:04:09,205
He has reinforced there…

2307
03:04:09,372 --> 03:04:12,458
… and is strongest there on the wings.
The hills and the rocks.

2308
03:04:12,625 --> 03:04:14,126
So the weak point is in the center.

2309
03:04:14,293 --> 03:04:16,587
They have command of the high ground.

2310
03:04:16,754 --> 03:04:19,173
But in that long slope, you see there?

2311
03:04:19,382 --> 03:04:23,219
The long slope in the center,
there's where he's most vulnerable.

2312
03:04:23,678 --> 03:04:27,723
General Pickett's Virginians
are the only people not yet engaged. Yes?

2313
03:04:29,475 --> 03:04:32,520
With General Longstreet in command,
my old warhorse…

2314
03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:35,898
… meeting the enemy face to face
on ground of his choosing…

2315
03:04:36,065 --> 03:04:38,317
… and with honor, we will prevail.

2316
03:04:58,045 --> 03:05:00,464
Sir, a courier from Colonel Rice.

2317
03:05:03,968 --> 03:05:05,219
Colonel Chamberlain.

2318
03:05:08,723 --> 03:05:10,141
That's some climb, sir.

2319
03:05:10,391 --> 03:05:11,976
My men need rations, lieutenant.

2320
03:05:12,143 --> 03:05:15,938
Colonel Rice has entrusted me to tell you
that you're relieved, sir.

2321
03:05:17,481 --> 03:05:18,566
Relieved?

2322
03:05:18,733 --> 03:05:22,153
PITZER: Fresh troops are on their way up
and they'll take over here, sir.

2323
03:05:22,820 --> 03:05:25,406
Colonel Rice wants to give
your people a rest.

2324
03:05:25,698 --> 03:05:28,075
He wants you to fall back,
and I'm to show you the way.

2325
03:05:28,451 --> 03:05:31,162
Fall back. Yeah.

2326
03:05:32,413 --> 03:05:34,623
Ellis, have the men fall in.
We're moving out.

2327
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:35,875
SPEAR:
Yes, sir.

2328
03:05:36,751 --> 03:05:37,793
Where are we going?

2329
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:40,755
Oh, sir. Lovely spot.

2330
03:05:41,005 --> 03:05:43,299
Very quiet. Safest place on the battlefield.

2331
03:05:43,591 --> 03:05:45,468
Right smack-dab in the center.

2332
03:06:30,596 --> 03:06:32,098
Yes, sir, general.

2333
03:06:32,682 --> 03:06:34,225
We will attack the center.

2334
03:06:34,892 --> 03:06:37,103
But I think you are right about the flank.

2335
03:06:38,354 --> 03:06:41,649
Hood and McLaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday.

2336
03:06:42,483 --> 03:06:46,904
I'll give you two other divisions:
General Pettigrew and General Trimble.

2337
03:06:47,071 --> 03:06:48,572
They are stronger and rested.

2338
03:06:48,739 --> 03:06:52,910
Now you will have nearly three divisions
at your command, including Pickett.

2339
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:56,163
Your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder.

2340
03:06:58,749 --> 03:07:01,502
The attack will be preceded
by massed artillery.

2341
03:07:01,669 --> 03:07:05,005
We'll concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area.

2342
03:07:05,256 --> 03:07:08,050
A <i>feu d'enfer</i>, as Napoleon would call it.

2343
03:07:08,717 --> 03:07:12,513
When the artillery has had its effect,
your charge will break the line.

2344
03:07:12,680 --> 03:07:16,183
You will have nearly 15,000 men
at your command, general.

2345
03:07:16,517 --> 03:07:18,561
You may begin whenever you're ready.

2346
03:07:18,728 --> 03:07:21,522
But plan it well.
Do plan it well, I pray you, sir.

2347
03:07:21,730 --> 03:07:22,982
We stake everything on this.

2348
03:07:23,149 --> 03:07:25,693
Sir, with your permission.

2349
03:07:30,406 --> 03:07:32,741
Sir, I've been a soldier all my life.

2350
03:07:33,033 --> 03:07:36,162
I have served from the ranks on up.
You know my service.

2351
03:07:40,541 --> 03:07:44,128
I must tell you now,
I believe this attack will fail.

2352
03:07:49,008 --> 03:07:52,678
No 15,000 men ever made
can take that ridge.

2353
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:55,848
It's a distance of more than a mile
over open ground.

2354
03:07:56,015 --> 03:07:58,392
When the men come out of the trees
they will be…

2355
03:07:58,767 --> 03:08:01,937
… under fire of Yankee artillery
from all over the field.

2356
03:08:02,104 --> 03:08:03,522
Those are Hancock's boys.

2357
03:08:03,689 --> 03:08:07,943
And now they have the stone wall
like we did at Fredericksburg.

2358
03:08:08,778 --> 03:08:10,738
We do our duty, general.

2359
03:08:11,572 --> 03:08:14,033
We do what we must do.

2360
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:15,659
Yes, sir.

2361
03:08:17,578 --> 03:08:21,373
Colonel Alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good.

2362
03:08:22,583 --> 03:08:27,087
We will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there.

2363
03:08:27,588 --> 03:08:30,591
And the men will know what to do.
All 15,000…

2364
03:08:30,758 --> 03:08:34,720
… will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line. That lower ridge there.

2365
03:08:34,929 --> 03:08:37,097
The line is not strong there.

2366
03:08:37,348 --> 03:08:40,434
General Meade has great strength
on both flanks.

2367
03:08:40,893 --> 03:08:42,811
He must be weak in the center.

2368
03:08:42,978 --> 03:08:47,024
I estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5,000 men.

2369
03:08:47,274 --> 03:08:51,570
And Colonel Alexander's artillery
will break them up like at Fredericksburg.

2370
03:08:52,071 --> 03:08:53,822
- Yes, sir.
- Farewell.

2371
03:09:02,206 --> 03:09:03,749
What are you thinking, general?

2372
03:09:06,752 --> 03:09:08,712
Well, sir…

2373
03:09:08,879 --> 03:09:11,423
… Pickett's division is from my corps.

2374
03:09:11,590 --> 03:09:14,593
But the other two units
are of A. P. Hill's corps.

2375
03:09:18,973 --> 03:09:20,766
Shouldn't General Hill
lead the attack, sir?

2376
03:09:22,226 --> 03:09:23,269
Say again?

2377
03:09:25,479 --> 03:09:28,107
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

2378
03:09:37,324 --> 03:09:38,617
My apologies, sir.

2379
03:09:43,414 --> 03:09:45,791
I've always been very cautious.

2380
03:09:46,208 --> 03:09:47,418
Very cautious.

2381
03:09:47,585 --> 03:09:49,628
There is no one I trust more.

2382
03:09:56,510 --> 03:09:59,638
Sir, if we can take that ridge…

2383
03:09:59,805 --> 03:10:02,182
We can. And we will.

2384
03:10:09,356 --> 03:10:12,359
General, God go with you.

2385
03:10:32,796 --> 03:10:34,632
George, you are leading attack.

2386
03:10:34,798 --> 03:10:36,342
Now get ready, George.

2387
03:10:36,508 --> 03:10:39,345
Take your men behind the line of trees.
I'll give you details later.

2388
03:10:39,511 --> 03:10:41,347
Now, move, George!

2389
03:10:41,805 --> 03:10:43,098
[YELLS]

2390
03:10:52,441 --> 03:10:54,193
[CHEERING]

2391
03:11:28,310 --> 03:11:31,271
[CHANTING]

2392
03:13:44,822 --> 03:13:45,948
Sir.

2393
03:13:46,115 --> 03:13:50,452
Forgive me the torn trousers, sir.
An officer riding around like this.

2394
03:13:50,994 --> 03:13:52,496
Colonel Alexander.

2395
03:13:53,163 --> 03:13:57,376
Those Federal cannon up on that
little rocky hill can cause some trouble.

2396
03:13:57,751 --> 03:14:00,462
I want you to assign some guns
and keep them silent.

2397
03:14:00,629 --> 03:14:01,713
Then…

2398
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:04,591
… you move forward
when the infantry advance…

2399
03:14:04,758 --> 03:14:06,343
… keeping the flanks clear.

2400
03:14:06,552 --> 03:14:08,137
Porter, how old are you, son?

2401
03:14:08,303 --> 03:14:11,098
- Sir, I'm 28, sir.
- Uh-huh.

2402
03:14:12,307 --> 03:14:16,603
Porter, we must also clear those guns
off that low center ridge right there.

2403
03:14:16,770 --> 03:14:19,064
- That's the main thing.
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir.

2404
03:14:19,231 --> 03:14:22,484
LONGSTREET: I'm relying on you.
- I'll sure keep them shooting.

2405
03:14:22,651 --> 03:14:24,570
LONGSTREET:
Good. Good.

2406
03:14:24,945 --> 03:14:26,864
I want you to use everything you have.

2407
03:14:27,030 --> 03:14:29,366
Maximum effort.
Fire all long-range ordinance.

2408
03:14:29,533 --> 03:14:32,619
But don't open up till I give the word
and everything's in position.

2409
03:14:33,162 --> 03:14:36,790
Then fire with all you've got.
I don't want to see a single gun silent.

2410
03:14:36,999 --> 03:14:39,209
Find an observation point
and check the damage.

2411
03:14:39,376 --> 03:14:41,587
We must clear those people off that ridge.

2412
03:14:43,839 --> 03:14:45,215
If we don't…

2413
03:14:45,674 --> 03:14:49,177
Anyway, you let me know when you're
nearing the end of your ammunition.

2414
03:14:49,386 --> 03:14:53,140
We must conserve enough to support
the infantry attack. Is that clear?

2415
03:14:53,307 --> 03:14:54,349
Yes, sir.

2416
03:15:31,929 --> 03:15:33,639
Gentlemen.

2417
03:15:35,474 --> 03:15:38,310
Johnston Pettigrew,
University of North Carolina.

2418
03:15:39,436 --> 03:15:40,646
Yeah, I know.

2419
03:15:41,230 --> 03:15:44,274
They still talk about your grades there
with reverence and awe.

2420
03:15:44,441 --> 03:15:47,819
Your reputation as a scholar
has preceded you, sir.

2421
03:15:47,986 --> 03:15:49,488
I hear you've written a book.

2422
03:15:49,655 --> 03:15:52,741
It was only a minor work.
If the general would care to read it…

2423
03:15:53,367 --> 03:15:56,161
- Surely.
PETTIGREW: A copy with my compliments.

2424
03:15:56,328 --> 03:15:58,664
Captain, retrieve my book
from the baggage.

2425
03:15:58,830 --> 03:16:02,834
General, my apologies, but I do not believe
I will have time to read that today.

2426
03:16:04,962 --> 03:16:06,129
Gentlemen.

2427
03:16:07,631 --> 03:16:10,509
I want you to look
at that clump of trees on that ridge.

2428
03:16:12,094 --> 03:16:15,430
That is where all units will converge.

2429
03:16:15,597 --> 03:16:20,602
You will be spread out in a long line,
perhaps a mile, about 15,000 men.

2430
03:16:21,019 --> 03:16:24,523
All units converging on that point
on the crest of that ridge.

2431
03:16:25,148 --> 03:16:26,692
Now, look here.

2432
03:16:32,114 --> 03:16:34,449
The Yankee center. A stone wall.

2433
03:16:37,035 --> 03:16:38,620
A small grove of trees.

2434
03:16:40,455 --> 03:16:44,835
General Trimble, commanding
Pender's division, will be on the left.

2435
03:16:45,585 --> 03:16:47,713
Pettigrew's brigade in support.

2436
03:16:49,298 --> 03:16:52,718
General Pickett's division
will be on the right side of the attack.

2437
03:16:52,884 --> 03:16:56,847
And now, George,
I want you to put two brigades in front…

2438
03:16:57,097 --> 03:16:59,057
… and one in back, like so.

2439
03:16:59,599 --> 03:17:00,642
Yes, sir.

2440
03:17:01,935 --> 03:17:03,228
Garnett's brigade.

2441
03:17:03,395 --> 03:17:04,896
That's Jimmy Kemper.

2442
03:17:05,272 --> 03:17:07,065
Armistead's in support.

2443
03:17:07,983 --> 03:17:09,651
Good. All right, then.

2444
03:17:09,818 --> 03:17:11,903
Garnett will dress off at Trimble's flank.

2445
03:17:12,070 --> 03:17:15,490
And he will be the hinge, so to speak,
in a series of left obliques.

2446
03:17:16,408 --> 03:17:18,535
Somewhere about
the Emmitsburg Road…

2447
03:17:18,702 --> 03:17:21,621
… you will execute your first left oblique.

2448
03:17:21,788 --> 03:17:23,415
Then direct.

2449
03:17:23,582 --> 03:17:25,125
Then left again.

2450
03:17:25,292 --> 03:17:27,294
And so on at your own discretion…

2451
03:17:27,502 --> 03:17:31,798
… in order to deceive the Yankees
and spread them out in a long line.

2452
03:17:32,132 --> 03:17:33,550
Here. Any questions?

2453
03:17:35,719 --> 03:17:37,262
All right, gentlemen.

2454
03:17:40,932 --> 03:17:42,100
Gentlemen…

2455
03:17:42,267 --> 03:17:45,771
… that is the conversion point.
That clump of trees.

2456
03:17:46,438 --> 03:17:48,440
We will use all of the artillery.

2457
03:17:49,441 --> 03:17:52,778
They will center on that point,
right there.

2458
03:17:53,779 --> 03:17:57,157
Will fire every gun they have
until the ammunition runs out.

2459
03:17:58,200 --> 03:18:01,787

I will give the order and you all go in.

2461

… I do believe this attack will decide
the fate of our country.

2462

All the men who have died in the past
are with you here today.

2463
03:18:33,193 --> 03:18:38,490
I want to say, sir, it is an honor to serve
under your command.

2464
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:50,544
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me
the opportunity of serving here.

2465

2469

Would you mind giving someone an order
to give me a musket?

2470
03:19:59,237 --> 03:20:01,239
I think today I'd like to join the attack.

2471
03:20:01,406 --> 03:20:05,869
If I could even borrow a hat from a soldier
or just a jacket with some stripes on it.

2472
03:20:07,496 --> 03:20:09,080
Sir, just once.

2473
03:20:09,247 --> 03:20:13,585
Because I think, sir,
today might be the last day.

2474

2476
03:20:29,935 --> 03:20:32,270
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

2477
03:20:34,189 --> 03:20:36,942
Troops are now forming
behind the line of trees.

2478
03:20:38,109 --> 03:20:44,366
When they come out, they will be under
enemy long-range artillery fire.

2479
03:20:44,533 --> 03:20:48,286
Solid shot. Percussion.
Every gun they have.

2480
03:20:49,913 --> 03:20:53,333
Troops will come out under fire
with more than a mile to walk.

2481
03:20:53,500 --> 03:20:55,460
And still, within the open field…

2482
03:20:55,627 --> 03:20:58,338
… they'll be in the range
of aimed muskets.

2483
03:21:11,977 --> 03:21:15,397
They'll be slowed down
by that fence out there.

2484
03:21:15,564 --> 03:21:20,318
And the formation,
what's left of it, will begin to come apart.

2485
03:21:21,319 --> 03:21:25,490
When they cross that road,
they'll be under short-range artillery.

2486
03:21:25,657 --> 03:21:27,158
Canister fire.

2487
03:21:27,534 --> 03:21:31,037
Thousands of little bits of shrapnel
wiping the holes in the lines.

2488
03:21:33,415 --> 03:21:36,001
If they get to that wall
without breaking up…

2489
03:21:37,168 --> 03:21:38,837
… there won't be many left.

2490
03:21:42,090 --> 03:21:43,925
A mathematical equation.

2491
03:21:46,553 --> 03:21:50,765
But maybe, just maybe…

2492
03:21:50,932 --> 03:21:53,435
… our own artillery will break up
their defenses.

2493
03:21:54,728 --> 03:21:56,438
There's always that hope.

2494
03:22:01,568 --> 03:22:05,697
That's Hancock out there.
And he ain't gonna run.

2495
03:22:07,615 --> 03:22:09,659
So it's mathematical after all.

2496
03:22:10,952 --> 03:22:17,083
If they get to that road, or beyond it,
we'll suffer over 50 percent casualties.

2497
03:22:21,296 --> 03:22:23,340
But, Harrison…

2498

that wall.

Now you tell me, professor.

2532
03:24:37,265 --> 03:24:39,934
Can you recall a story from antiquity
where two men…

2533
03:24:40,101 --> 03:24:42,187
… who are best of friends,
almost brothers…

2534
03:24:42,353 --> 03:24:45,815
… where these men find themselves,
by a trick of fate…

2535
03:24:45,982 --> 03:24:48,401
… on opposing sides in a great war?

2536
03:24:48,860 --> 03:24:50,862
Then, on a given day…

2537
03:24:51,029 --> 03:24:54,491
… find themselves facing one another
on the very same battlefield?

2538
03:24:56,868 --> 03:25:02,832
If the Greeks did not tell of such a story,
surely the Romans did.

2539
03:25:03,416 --> 03:25:06,044
But, sir, I think it must be found
in the Bible.

2540
03:25:06,503 --> 03:25:08,213
There isn't an officer on either side…

2541
03:25:08,379 --> 03:25:11,841
… who hasn't known someone wearing
the other uniform. I know that.

2542
03:25:12,550 --> 03:25:14,302
But this morning…

2543
03:25:15,178 --> 03:25:17,722
… I looked through my glass
and saw the colors…

2544
03:25:17,889 --> 03:25:21,518
… of the 9th and 14th Virginia regiments
on those ridges before us…

2545
03:25:21,684 --> 03:25:23,811
… directly facing us, right over there.

2546
03:25:24,312 --> 03:25:26,773

… see his old crumpled hat.

2548

Armistead commands one of Pickett's
brigades and he's out there for sure.

would never come.

03:35:23,661 --> 03:35:24,703
PICKETT:
All right, then.

2607
03:35:24,870 --> 03:35:27,540
When the firing ceases,
we step out real quick.

2608
03:35:27,706 --> 03:35:31,127
No halting, no stopping to fire.
We want to get there quick as we can.

2609
03:35:31,544 --> 03:35:32,628
What about Garnett?

2610
03:35:32,795 --> 03:35:35,548

ARMISTEAD: He can't hardly walk.

2611
03:35:35,798 --> 03:35:36,841

2612

George, order him
not to make the charge.

2621

MAN 1: Fire!
MAN 2: Fire!

2623
03:36:36,317 --> 03:36:38,485
We've been firing for a good while, sir.

2624
03:36:38,652 --> 03:36:43,157
It's apparent neither the Federals nor we
are going to gain a clear advantage.

2625
03:36:43,365 --> 03:36:45,993
If we continue to expend our ammunition
at this rate…

2626
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:48,746
… we may endanger our ability
to support the advance.

2627
03:36:48,913 --> 03:36:51,457
Did you not have enough ordinance
when this was begun?

2628
03:36:51,624 --> 03:36:55,961
The Federal fire compelled us to remove
the artillery train farther to the rear.

2629
03:36:56,837 --> 03:36:59,757
It's taking us longer to refill the caissons.

2630
03:36:59,924 --> 03:37:02,384
Sir, we must slow down our fire now…

2631
03:37:02,551 --> 03:37:05,763
… or we will have to cut back on the guns
sent in to support the infantry.

2632
03:37:06,555 --> 03:37:07,681
Damn!

2633
03:37:08,057 --> 03:37:12,603
I'll have to order General Pickett to halt
his attack until the guns get replenished.

2634
03:37:12,770 --> 03:37:16,357
The trains have a little ammunition.
It'll take an hour to redistribute it.

2635
03:37:16,523 --> 03:37:18,817
In the meanwhile,
the enemy would improve the top.

2636
03:37:18,984 --> 03:37:20,110
The longer we delay…

2637
03:37:20,277 --> 03:37:23,447
… the more time the Federals have
to strengthen their own lines.

2638
03:37:23,614 --> 03:37:26,450
And even if we recover more supplies
from the ordinance train…

2639
03:37:26,617 --> 03:37:29,286
… how much more damage can we inflict
on them than they on us?

2640
03:37:30,204 --> 03:37:33,415
They're bringing in fresh batteries
as quickly as we drive them off.

2641
03:37:33,582 --> 03:37:35,793
Just get some more ammunition
and keep it hot.

2642
03:37:35,960 --> 03:37:38,671
I cannot send Pickett's division
or the others…

2643
03:37:38,837 --> 03:37:42,216
… until we clear some of those guns
off that ridge.

2644
03:38:18,627 --> 03:38:23,048
I'm told you are descended
from an illustrious military family.

2645
03:38:23,215 --> 03:38:25,301
Who told you that? Kemper?

2646
03:38:25,718 --> 03:38:28,804
He tells me it was your uncle
who defended Fort McHenry…

2647
03:38:28,971 --> 03:38:31,307
… during the War of 1812.

2648
03:38:31,473 --> 03:38:36,103
And that he was therefore the guardian
of the original <i>Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

2649
03:38:36,270 --> 03:38:39,857
I must say,
I do appreciate the irony of it all.

2650
03:38:40,024 --> 03:38:41,567
Colonel Fremantle.

2651
03:38:42,234 --> 03:38:47,197
It does not begin or end with my uncle
or myself.

2652
03:38:48,115 --> 03:38:50,659
We're all sons of Virginia here.

2653
03:38:54,121 --> 03:38:56,040
That major out there
commanding the cannon…

2654
03:38:56,206 --> 03:38:57,791
… that's James Dearing.

2655
03:38:58,208 --> 03:39:02,046
First in his class at West Point,
before Virginia seceded.

2656
03:39:02,212 --> 03:39:04,715
And the boy over there
with the color guard.

2657
03:39:05,424 --> 03:39:08,052
That's Private Robert Tyler Jones.

2658
03:39:08,218 --> 03:39:12,389
His grandfather was
president of the United States.

2659
03:39:13,557 --> 03:39:18,312
The colonel behind me,
that's Colonel William Aylett.

2660
03:39:18,479 --> 03:39:20,397
Now, his great grandfather…

2661
03:39:20,564 --> 03:39:23,442
… was the Virginian Patrick Henry.

2662
03:39:26,737 --> 03:39:30,574
It was Patrick Henry
who said to your King George III:

2663
03:39:31,325 --> 03:39:34,078
"Give me liberty or give me death."

2664
03:39:38,290 --> 03:39:40,501
There are boys here from…

2665
03:39:40,668 --> 03:39:41,960
… Norfolk…

2666
03:39:43,003 --> 03:39:44,505
… Portsmouth…

2667
03:39:45,172 --> 03:39:48,008
… small hamlets along the James River.

2668
03:39:48,967 --> 03:39:51,637
From Charlottesville and Fredericksburg.

2669
03:39:51,845 --> 03:39:53,847
The Shenandoah Valley.

2670

Every man here knows his duty.

2673
03:40:08,821 --> 03:40:14,284
They would make this charge
even without an officer to lead them.

2674
03:40:17,454 --> 03:40:20,374
They know the gravity of the situation.

2675
03:40:20,541 --> 03:40:23,502
And the mettle of their foe.

2676
03:40:24,670 --> 03:40:28,632
They know that this day's work…

2677
03:40:29,883 --> 03:40:32,928
… will be desperate and deadly.

2678
03:40:33,637 --> 03:40:37,224
They know that for many of them…

2679
03:40:37,391 --> 03:40:40,269
… this will be their last charge.

2680
03:40:41,603 --> 03:40:46,567
But not one of them needs to be told
what is expected of him.

2681
03:40:46,733 --> 03:40:49,653
They are all willing to make
the supreme sacrifice…

2682
03:40:51,238 --> 03:40:56,118
… to achieve victory here.
