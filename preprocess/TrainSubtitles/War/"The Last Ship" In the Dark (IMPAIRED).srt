The outbreak in Ann
Arbor started after Brian left.

- No, listen to me, Jacob.

were responsible for the death

337
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,747
And if that was your mental condition

338
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,282
when Captain Chandler found you,

339
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,751
then what was your condition when
you took the oath of office

340
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:56,554
a mere 11 days later?

341

- Unlikely.

was a mutation after all.

That's right.

circle back from open water

Okay.

Oh, that was close.

648
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,721
Sir, Chinese vessels are converging.

Gator: They can have us
targeted in 30 seconds, sir.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

Okay, there... there's
two on your port side.

Okay.

Oh, God. Jesus.

We're clear!

Alisha: Five seconds. Five
seconds to triangulation.

CIC, break EMCOM. Energize SPY,

At least one ship has

explain the outbreak in Japan.

Hopefully, he'll make
progress on that front.

or how to make things right

after all I have done to you.

701
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:31,739
You can start by
explaining your connection to Peng.

00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:35,042
- He hire you directly?
- It was not Peng.

I was told how to find
you in Vietnam by a smuggler.

709
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:57,798
And what was his cut of a
bunch of American sailors?

710
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,100
Just a promise

711

that I would not pirate certain ships.
