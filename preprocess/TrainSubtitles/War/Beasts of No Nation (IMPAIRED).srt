00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,215
A boy is nothing.

490
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,134
A boy is harmless?

491
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,428
[boys] Harmless, no, sir!

492
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,012
[Commandant]
Does a boy have two eyes to see?

493
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,514
[boys] Two eyes, sir!

494
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,517
[Commandant] A boy has hands to strangle
and fingers to pull triggers.

495
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,686
Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?

496
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,022
A boy is very, very dangerous.
You understand me?

497
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,276
Very dangerous, you understand?

498
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,193
- Very dangerous, you understand?
- Yes, sir!

499
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,194
Huh?

500
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,236
- Huh?
- Yes, sir!

501
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,782
Strika, are you hungry?

502
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,993
Are you wanting to be eating this thing?

503
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,709
Let me see your hands.

504
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,799
Oh, you have hands like a baby.

505
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,677
[sighs]

506
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,559
What are you doing here?

507
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,144
[breathing heavily]

508
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,689
You should be telling me.

509
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,566
If you are telling me,
I will be helping you.

510
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,486
You see, Strika is hungry.
He will eat you.

511
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,737
Huh?

512
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,780
What are you doing here?

513
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:35,667
The government army killed my father...
and my big brother...

514
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,757
and my father told me to run...
into the bush.

515
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,968
[sighs]

516
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,306
Everybody here is
calling me Commandant.

517
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,725
[soldier] How does the Commandant look?

518

[soldier] How does the Commandant look?
[all] All right, sir!

521
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,688
Ah.

522
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,149
Now, what are they calling you?

523
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,984
[softly] Agu.

524
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,278
Oh, you must say it
like you are prouder!

525
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,905
Agu.

526
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,407
One more time.

- Agu.
- Uh-huh.

529
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,452
Well, Agu,

530
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,414
that is what I will be
calling you then, eh?

531
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,500
[breathing heavily]

532
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,503
[grunts]

533
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:26,092
Leave this one under my charge.
I will be training him to be a warrior.

534
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,804
So you can be fighting
the army that is killing your father.

535
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,724
Is that what you want?
You must be saying yes!

536
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,100
[Two-I-C] Formation!

537

[Commandant] What is it that has brought
this big family of strangers together?

- Was it fear?
- [all] No, sir!

We have been defending ourselves

against the killings and rapings
of our own people from the PLF

Hmm?

You will see with

Who is this?

977
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,765
- Who is this?
- Refugees from the village, sir.

978
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,477
They said the PLF and the NRC
took their village three days ago.

979
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,896
They killed most of the town,
but they let these ones go.

980
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,231
Hmm.

981
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:58,280
Well, let us be giving
their village back, huh?

Can you take the bridge?

998
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,717
It's very difficult, sir.
Men are fighting bravely,

999

- Sir?
- <i>Can you take the bridge?</i>

1006
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:19,236
Copy, sir. We will reapply pressure
and push for the bridge. Over.

Yes, sir!

See this thing, huh?
This is a very special device.

1016
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:52,269
We can be seeing the enemy
even when the enemy is hiding.

Come.

I am happy to be following you, sir.

- I am happy to be following you, sir.
- That is good,

1121

because there is no learning
how to be leading.

Some people are born to be leaders,
others are born to be followers,

01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,069
- I'm a good follower, sir.
- Agu, you are different.

1126
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,905
You are reminding me of
when I was a small boy.

1127
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:04,743
That is how I know
you are going to be a leader.

1128
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,829
You see, even the best leader

1129
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:12,083
sometimes he must be knowing
how to be a follower.

1130
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,128
Ah, even me.

1131
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:21,425
I am following the Supreme Commandant,
even if I am not agreeing.

1132
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,887
Huh?

1133
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,098
Yes, sir.
I'm a good follower.

1134
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,349
[chuckles]

1135
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,394
You are seeing this place?

1136
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:35,523
The Commandant is saying
we must take this.

1137
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,733
That it is important.

1138
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:41,070
So, hmm, if it is important to him,
it is important to me.

1139
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,446
[Agu] Yes, sir.

1140
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,118
Because if we get that,
then we can go to Taro.

1141
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,254
That is where your mother is, eh?

1142
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,089
- That is where your mother is, eh?
- She is in the capital.

1143
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,677
[Commandant] Come, Agu.

1144
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,263
After we've been greeted
by Dada Goodblood,

1145
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,016
we'll be taking the capital certainly.

1146
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,439
Come.

1147
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,406
This one has special juju.

1148
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,699
Thank you, sir.

1149
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:30,286
You see, I've been wanting to help you
more than the others, Agu,

1150
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,582
but you cannot be telling the others
how I'm helping you like this.

1151
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,750
It'll have to be our secret.

1152
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,170
You are knowing how to keep secret?

1153
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,004
- You are knowing how to keep secret?
- Yes, sir.

1154
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,714
Well, be saying it.

1155
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,092
- Well, be saying it.
- I can be keeping this secret, sir.

1156

[sighs]

1157
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,898
I'm not punishing you, Agu.
Mmm?

1158
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,151
But I do care for you.

Agu, kneel down.

1163

Be doing this thing... for me.

Agu?

1176
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,770
I don't want that I call you
and you just stand there. Agu?

1177
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,316
Come here,
I'll give you some brown-brown.

1178
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,361
It'll cure everything for you, eh.

1179
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,780
Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.

1180

Hmm?

1181
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:21,665
My boy, what is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

1182
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,211
Come here,
I'll give you some morale booster.

1183
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,672
I think I'll give you
that brown-brown, so...

Leave one of them alive.

1327
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,814
Send him up north to the next village
and then the next village after that.

Sorry, sir. You, get in that car.

Have a seat here.

Goodblood says
this is a token of appreciation...

1370
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,592
[yelling] Yo! What are you doing?

1371
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:09,099
I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander
is so very upset to keep you waiting.

1372
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,309
Please, will you follow me?

1373
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,648
Please sit.

1374
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,738

<i>I trust you rested well.</i>

1384
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,925
I would like you to know
we also offered rations and water

1385
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,970
to the rest of your battalion
this morning.

1386
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,721
[Two-I-C] Thank you, Deputy.

1387
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,148
[Deputy] Please, gentlemen.
Please come over.

1388
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,652
Stand there.

Attention!

1392
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:14,557
Commandant.

1393
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,559
Supreme Commander, sir.

1394
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:20,856
At ease, gentlemen.

1395
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,774
At ease.

1396
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,948
[chuckles]

1397
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,995
It looks like your family has grown.

1398
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,916
They must eat while we talk,
unless you are hungry, too.

1399
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,585
I'm not hungry. Two-I-C,
take them and go and eat.

1400
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:45,380
Two-I-C, you stay.

1401
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,589
Come.

1402
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,597
[Preacher] Lot of food over here.
Let's eat, man!

1403
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:57,184
I love food.

1404
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,145
[soldiers chatting indistinctly]

1405
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,775
What is this?

1406
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,363
You have made me wait.

1407
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:15,452
You are leading me to believe
we are changing objectives.

1408
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,413
Are we not taking the capital anymore?

1409
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,625
Chief, to protect our people,
the time is now.

1410
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:27,880
If we have the momentum
and we have the power, why wait?

1411
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:33,345
You are not the political voice
of this movement, Commandant. I am.

1412
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:37,765
Protecting our people
remains the priority.

1413
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:41,894
But as you know, the world is
becoming aware of this war now.

1414
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:45,815
No one will escape judgment
when it is over.

1415
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,778
And the decisions we make
have far deeper consequences.

1416
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:55,492
And what decisions have you made...
for my battalion?

1417
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,622
Are you not making me general?

1418
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,749
No, I am not.

1419
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:06,294
I'm giving your battalion
to Two-I-C, Commandant.

1420
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,712
That is why I brought you here.

1421
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:12,717
And you, I will promote
to Deputy Chief of Security,

1422
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,801
effective immediately.

1423
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,639
I hope you accept and act accordingly.

1424
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,099
[Two-I-C stands to attention]

1425
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,476
Thank you, sir. I promise
to fulfill my duty to the fullest...

1426
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:22,560
[Commandant] Two-I-C, shut your mouth!

1427
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,023
Get out!

1428
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,652
Soldiers.

1429
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,454
[Commandant] You are demoting me.

1430
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:47,335
This, my battalion...
that I have made with my own hands.

1431
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:49,003
I'm their father!

1432
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,340
Your battalion is my battalion,
Commandant,

1433
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,967
as are hundreds of others
across this nation.

1434
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:58,305
I want the ceremony of changeover
tomorrow,

1435
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:01,349
so that Two-I-C can take the battalion
back out for battle.

What share of the resources

Do not forget you are a soldier.

1443
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,086
Your most important duty is obedience.

1444

Everything is obedience.

Assemble the COs and the troops
and bivouac outside of town.

1463

Yes, sir.

1465

Where are we going?

1466

You will see.

1467
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,328
You will like it.

1468
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:49,374
And if you and Strika are my bodyguards,
and I am going, then you are also going.

1469

Commandant, permission to be dismissed.

I need to be checking on the others...

Negative!

You will be staying here
so we can celebrate you.

In fact, Mama, I want you to bring

[Commandant] Hmm.
But you have one special for Two-I-C.

- [Madam] They are coming.

01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:48,334
Nobody will care for you. Huh?

1749
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:50,754
Look at you.

1750
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:57,343
And you will wake up and you will rise
and see the sunrise and see the sunset,

1751
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,889
and you can just wait all day, all day,

1752
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:05,602
with thousands of men just like you,
waiting for somebody to give you a job.

1753
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:06,728
Huh?

1754
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:10,023
That is what you want to go and do?

1755
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:13,151
You are stupid! [scoffs]

1756
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:16,655
You have nothing!
No future!

1757
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:17,906
I am your future.

1758
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,576
- You fucking die here, sir.
- [cocking gun]

1759
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:21,993
What?

1760
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:30,376
How are you going to shoot me
if you don't have bullets?

1761
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:35,423
And you, Agu?

1762
01:57:35,506 --> 01:57:37,425
You wanna kill Commandant?

1763
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:41,221
Hey, Agu, I want you
to kill Commandant. Come.

1764
01:57:41,304 --> 01:57:42,138
Push it.

1765
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:43,014
- Push it.
- [Preacher whispers] Do it.

1766
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,934
Come, Agu, come.
Put it here. Here!

1767
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,227
A-ha! A-ha!

1768
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,437
Wanna kill Commandant?

1769
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,439
[softly] Do it, Agu.

1770
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:53,441
Do it.

1771
01:57:53,524 --> 01:57:56,111
[Commandant] Kill Commandant!

1772
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:57,988
You wanna surrender?

1773
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,239
Huh?

1774
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:01,282
You wanna surrender?

1775
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:06,121
[gently] You wanna surrender?

1776
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:09,165
Yes.

1777
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,257
Hey, Agu.

1778
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,970
Just get out.

1779
01:58:24,765 --> 01:58:29,645
Just remember,
when you are all poor and hungry

1780
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,189
you'll remember me!

1781
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:37,068
You'll remember your Commandant.

1782
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,988
[yelling] Just go! Just go!

1783
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:41,865
Come on. Everybody, let's move!

1784
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,700
[soldier] Yes, sir!
[Preacher] Come on, let's go.

1785
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:48,038
And know that I will be
calling for you one day.

1786
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,960
Go and drink gunpowder tea
and playing draughts.

1787
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:58,131
No, no, no. You remember me.
You remember your Commandant.

1788
01:58:58,214 --> 01:59:00,216
You're gonna say, "Yeah!"

1789
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:06,890
Remember, I will call for you again...

1790
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:09,893
and you'll come.

1791
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:13,271
Remember.

1792
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,577
They will just lock you up in jail!
You are stupid!

1793
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:30,914
When the time come back,

1794
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:33,333
the other ones,
they'll come eat you.

1795
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:36,795
Just chop for you...
[stammering] your heart.

1796
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:39,547
Agu, you stay here because they don't...

1797
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:46,179
[thunder rumbling]

1798
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:24,342
- [soldier] Halt! Stop there!
- [guns cocking]

1799
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:25,635
Who are you?

1800
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:26,636
- Who are you?
- [Preacher] NDF, sir!

1801
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,721
[soldier] And what is your mission here?

1802
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:28,805
[Preacher] Surrender, sir!

1803
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:31,808
Raise up your arms!
All weapons in the air!

1804
02:00:31,892 --> 02:00:32,893
All of you!

1805
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:36,521
Now turn and face the bush!

1806
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:40,025
Don't look at my face!
Put your weapons on the ground!

1807
02:00:40,108 --> 02:00:43,361
Step back.
Step back!

1808
02:00:43,444 --> 02:00:45,488
And turn around!

1809
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:47,240
I said, turn around!

1810
02:00:47,323 --> 02:00:48,658
All right, hands up!

1811
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:51,244
Hands up! Sit on the floor!

1812
02:00:53,538 --> 02:00:54,873
[speaking native language]

1813

[speaking English] Sit down!

1814
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,379
Put your hands on your head!

1815
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,011
Don't look at my face!

[boys cheering]

1821
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,097
[Father Friday]
Agu, how are you settling in?

1822
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:59,140
Hmm?

1823
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:04,104
I know things are hard.

1824
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,772
I've been there, remember?

1825
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:11,152
We are all here to help you.

1826
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,947
Okay?

1827
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:17,075
[Agu] <i>I am not knowing
how long I am staying here...</i>

1828
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:21,537
<i>but I'm staying here for a long time.</i>

1829
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:28,669
<i>Some week, some month, I am not knowing.</i>

1830
02:04:30,921 --> 02:04:34,217
<i>All I am knowing
is how it is feeling here.</i>

1831
02:04:36,761 --> 02:04:42,017
<i>I am knowing the sound of people screaming
and the smell of dead bodies...</i>

02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,393
[gasping]

1833
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:48,731
<i>and I am knowing the feeling of
the brown-brown and</i> djamba <i>in my blood.</i>

1834
02:04:50,108 --> 02:04:51,776
[singing in native language]

1835
02:04:57,073 --> 02:04:58,866
[speaking English] Hey, calm down!

1836
02:04:58,949 --> 02:05:00,243
This is your home!

1837
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,745
No, they are giving us poison there!

1838
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,497
- They want us to die!
- [boys] Yes!

1839
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:06,082
- They want us to die!
- [Father Friday] Calm!

1840
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:08,793
[Agu] <i>Preacher is tiring of this place.</i>

1841
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:10,920
<i>He's saying, "The war is not over,</i>

1842
02:05:11,004 --> 02:05:13,714
<i>"and they are needing fighters like us."</i>

1843
02:05:13,798 --> 02:05:16,926
We need money for here.
We need money. Eh?

1844
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,054
You can't stay here without money.

1845
02:05:19,845 --> 02:05:22,265
And we're soldiers,

1846
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:24,642
fighting is what we know.

1847
02:05:24,725 --> 02:05:26,769
That's what we should do.

1848
02:05:26,852 --> 02:05:29,564
Have you forgotten?
We have food to eat.

1849
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,274
- We have shelter.
- Shh!

1850
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:37,280
And even we learn, we learn.

1851
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,156
- And even we learn, we learn.
- Yeah.

1852
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:39,532
[Preacher] You for shut up!

1853
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:42,785
You NRC soldier,
with the talk, you talk too much.

1854
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:47,332
Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving.

1855
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:49,167
Preacher!

1856
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:50,043
- Preacher!
- Let's go!

1857
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,089
Randy, don't go into the bush again.

1858
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:57,758
Don't follow Preacher.

1859
02:05:57,842 --> 02:06:00,178
Randy!

1860
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:16,902
I don't like when you look into my eyes.

1861
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:20,906
So if I look at a table,
how can I talk to you?

1862
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:22,492
[Agu] <i>Amy.</i>

1863
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:24,619
<i>She thinks that my no speaking</i>

1864
02:06:24,702 --> 02:06:28,414
<i>is because I can't be
explaining myself like baby,</i>

1865
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,500
<i>but I am not like baby.</i>

1866
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:34,712
<i>I am like old man
and she's like small girl</i>

1867
02:06:34,795 --> 02:06:39,967
<i>because I am fighting in war
and she's not even knowing what war is.</i>

1868
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,220
Try.

1869
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:46,307
Try to talk to me about
some of your experiences...

1870
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:51,437
or try to tell me what you are thinking.

1871
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:56,442
I'm thinking about my future.

1872
02:06:57,777 --> 02:06:58,861
[Amy] Very good.

1873
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:01,114
Very good.

1874
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:04,159
So how do you see your future?

1875
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:14,502
Do me this favor, okay?

1876
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:24,637
I think if you talk to me about it,
it will make you feel better.

1877
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,356
I saw terrible things...

1878
02:07:37,858 --> 02:07:40,695
and I did terrible things.

1879
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:43,781
So if I'm talking to you,

1880
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:49,204
it will make me sad...
and it will make you, too, sad.

1881
02:07:49,287 --> 02:07:50,871
In this life...

1882
02:07:52,748 --> 02:07:55,876
I just want to be happy in this life.

1883
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:01,090
If I'm telling this to you...

1884
02:08:04,969 --> 02:08:07,305
you will think that...

1885
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,141
[sighs]

1886
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:15,020
I am some sort of beast...

1887
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:19,317
or devil.

1888
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,656
I am all of these things...

1889
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,536
but I also having mother...

1890
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:35,916
father...

1891
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:41,256
brother and sister once.

1892
02:08:43,341 --> 02:08:45,551
They loved me.
