00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,267
NARRATOR: This motion picture
is dedicated to

2
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:50,133
France. More than 300 years ago,
French missionaries were
sent to Indochina

3
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:53,200
To teach love of God
and love of fellow man.

4
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,533
Gradually, French influence
took shape in the
Vietnamese land.

5
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,400
Despite many hardships,
they advanced
their way of living

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,967
And the thriving nation
became the rice bowl of Asia.

7
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:07,067
Vast riches were developed
under French guidance
until 1941,

8
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,067
When Japanese troops moved in

9
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,533
And made the rice bowl
red with blood of the
defenders.

10
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,833
In 1945, when
the Japanese surrender
was announced,

11
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,567
A Moscow-trained
Indo-Chinese revolutionist

12
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,533
Who called himself
Ho Chi Minh

13
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:25,067
Began the drive to make his
own country another target
for Chinese Communists.

14
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:29,100
Headquartered in the
North, he called the
new party Viet Minh.

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,067
With the end of
the Korean War,

16
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,267
France was left alone
to hold the hottest
front in the world,

17
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:38,133
And became the
barrier between communism
and the rape of Asia.

18
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,667
Members of the Foreign Legion
imported from North Africa

19
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,867
Fought valiantly
under the French flag,

20
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,633
But the ammunition
pipeline from Moscow
could not be found.

21
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,567
Bombs and shells
made in Russia were
stocked in secret tunnels

22
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,800
Along the mountain range
of the China Gate.

23
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,733
This arsenal was winning the
war for the Communists.

24
00:02:55,833 --> 00:03:01,467
Bombs and shells stocked
underground smashed
village after village.

25
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,567
But still fighting for
her life, 100 miles
from the China Gate,

26
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:09,800
Is the dying village
of Son Toy, the last
holdout in the North.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
Her supplies have
been ambushed,
her ammunition depleted,

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,100
But she fights
as she starves.

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,633
Her only chance of survival
is the American food air-drop
from the South.

30
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,267
The year, 1954.

31
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,400
The day, Thursday.

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,700
The time, 10:00
in the morning.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,533
All animals have
been eaten. All but one.

34
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,600
(AIRPLANE DRONES)

35
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,900
(CLAMORING)

36
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,367
Food! Food!

37
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:27,267
How's Pierre?
Pierre's hungry.

38
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,700
Food!

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,267
Keep off the road,
understand?

40
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,067
Come on, Leung.

41
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,767
(CANNON FIRING)

42
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,400
(EXPLOSION)

43
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,800
It's gonna blow.
Look out!

44
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,067
Spread out!

45
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,733
(EXPLOSION)

46
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,600
COLONEL: Thank you, sisters.
Thank you very much.

47
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,200
You look wonderful,
Lucky, just wonderful.

48
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,467
Now that's the way
I like to see you.

49
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,833
I want you to meet
Captain Gaumont
of the Air Force.

50
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,433
He has been
pulled out of action
specifically to meet you.

51
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,367
Captain, this
is Lia Sermer.

52
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,233
So you're the one
they call Lucky Legs?

53
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,600
I keep them covered
on social calls.

54
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I heard they are hollow,
to keep your cognac in.

55
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,067
(CHUCKLES)
You'll never find out.

56
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,967
What's on your mind,
Colonel?

57
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:40,567
I know what an ordeal it
is for you to stay sober,
but this is important.

58
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,767
Mmm-hmm.
Important to whom?

59
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,067
Important to all of us.

60
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,300
This is an aerial photo
of the border.

61
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,967
There are hundreds of tunnels
here along those hills and
mountains at the China Gate.

62
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,833
You got me sober
to tell me that?

63
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,133
I know you know
about those tunnels.

64
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,567
What's this all about,
Colonel?

65
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:03,467
Somewhere in this area is
a big dump of bombs and shells

66
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,467
And small arms
ammunition that are
crippling our troops.

67
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,167
Everybody knows that.

68
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:12,400
But no one knows just
exactly where it is.

69
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,833
Some of our bombers
got through, but hit
nothing vital.

70
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,367
We have sent out
patrols but they never
got back.

71
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:23,967
You know the 100 miles
from here to the border
like you know your cognac!

72
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:27,567
You have made this trip,
oh, a hundred times
with your cousin.

73
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,167
Those Reds trust you.
That's why we need you.

74
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:37,200
Above all,
you know Major Cham at
the China Gate.

75
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:46,333
My business with the
Major is strictly
my business.

76
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:49,633
We are interested in the
Major because he is
the lock to the dump

77
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,367
And you are the only key
that can open him up.

78
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,633
This isn't my war!

79
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,100
You are part Chinese!
Ah!

80
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm a little of
everything and
a lot of nothing.

81
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,233
The Chinese say I'm this,
the French say I'm that,
the Americans say I'm...

82
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,167
(SIGHS) As far
as I'm concerned

83
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:13,533
You and the hammer and sickle
boys can go fight it out
among yourselves.

84
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,067
When the dump is blown,
there should be

85
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,133
A chain reaction
through the whole area.

86
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,867
In the confusion,
we steal a plane.

87
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,933
My job is to fly
you back here to Son Toy.

88
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,500
We will give you $5,000.

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,500
We'll open a new bar for
you in Saigon

90
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
And stock it with the finest
wines and liquor.

91
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,167
It's a deal?

92
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,200
No.

93
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:45,400
All right, then.
Name your own price.
How much do you want?

94
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,700
I want to get
my son to America.

95
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,567
He has no criminal record,
no disease.

96
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:00,633
He's five years old
and his eyes are a cross
he's got to carry.

97
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,067
But in America,
I think that cross
would be lighter.

98
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,900
You know the right people.

99
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,367
You use your influence
for my son and I'll find
that dump for you.

100
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,667
No. The laws are
strict in America.

101
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,267
All right.

102
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,767
Lucky! Wait a moment.

103
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,967
In this particular case,

104
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,167
I think we can
work it out.

105
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,800
When do we start?
Right away!

106
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,600
I have a pleasant
surprise for you.

107
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
(LAUGHS)
What? A bottle?

108
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,800
(LAUGHING)

109
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Send him in.

110
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,967
You remember
the American dynamiter,
Sergeant Brock?

111
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,067
He is with the
Foreign Legion now.

112
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,433
He will be in charge
of explosives.
(SLAPS)

113
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,900
The deal's off!
Find the dump yourself!

114
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,900
COLONEL:
But I don't understand.

115
00:11:56,067 --> 00:12:00,900
I thought it would be a
wonderful reunion for
both of you on this job.

116
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,367
It would make
everything more pleasant.

117
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:09,233
I knew you lived
together in Saigon,
but what happened?

118
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,700
We just didn't live
together, Colonel.

119
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,767
We were married,
in church.

120
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,067
Oh, you could have
bought her for $30
for two years

121
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,867
As a government-registered
wife.

122
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,100
That's right.

123
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,933
Well, then, did she find
you with another woman?

124
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,633
Is that why
she slapped you?

125
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,667
No. I walked.

126
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,967
Oh, that happens every
day in this part of
the world.

127
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,200
GAUMONT: Oh, yes, it could
have been worse.

128
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,633
It is. No.

129
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,867
What do you mean?

130
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:44,167
She told me her
father was Caucasian
and her mother Chinese.

131
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,767
Who'd ever take
her for Chinese?
Even half Chinese?

132
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,367
One thing I always
wanted was a kid.

133
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,100
We wanted the baby
born in America.

134
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,467
It just didn't work
out that way.

135
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,567
The baby was born
in Saigon.

136
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:07,067
When the doctor
phoned me, I ran.

137
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,600
I ran all the way
to the hospital.

138
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,600
I saw my baby.

139
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,567
It was like a bomb
had hit me.

140
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,467
I walked.

141
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,667
Why?

142
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,167
He was Chinese.

143
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,867
What did you expect?

144
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:31,767
A notarized guarantee that
the baby would be born with
eyes aimed your way?

145
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,867
Do you know why
she volunteered to go
on this mission?

146
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,267
For your son.

147
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:40,600
I promised him America
if she would find the dump.

148
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,067
Son?

149
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,067
Yes. You've got a son.

150
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:53,467
He's five years old.
He has no criminal record,
no disease.

151
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:57,067
The only cross
he has to carry
are his eyes.

152
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,767
You married me
six years ago in Saigon.

153
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,067
Brock, Johnny Brock.

154
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,600
I was a Sergeant
in the American army then.

155
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,833
I married Lia.
Lia Sermer, don't
you remember?

156
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:25,333
Yes. I thought you
were killed in Korea.

157
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,200
You hate my guts, don't
you, Father?

158
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
What did the Colonel want
you to discuss with me?

159
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,933
We need Lia's help
on a patrol.

160
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:44,633
A demolition job.
She said she'd go
until she saw me.

161
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:47,367
I've got to go,
I'm the dynamiter.

162
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,533
She's the only one who can
get us through to the Gate.

163
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,567
The Colonel thought you
could help me change her mind.

164
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,533
Why should I help you?

165
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:59,233
Because her feeling for
me isn't as important as
going on this job.

166
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,133
Her father taught her
all about women.

167
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:05,400
Her Chinese mother taught
her all about men,

168
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,067
But didn't teach her
enough about hypocrites.

169
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,067
You married a beautiful woman
to satisfy your own vanity.

170
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,233
To me, that's a
criminal act.

171
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,867
After you left her
she became known
as Lucky Legs.

172
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:26,333
Lucky Legs, that's what
they call her.

173
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,767
They say she ran
an opium den.

174
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,900
That she was
mixed up in murder,

175
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,667
That she caused a man
to take his life,

176
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,067
That she operated in
black markets and lived
like a princess,

177
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,300
And lived like a prostitute.

178
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,133
They say she's a traitor
to France, they say she's
a traitor to the Chinese Reds.

179
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,300
They say.

180
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,833
The gossips.

181
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:55,667
Those envious ones who
take pride in spreading lies.

182
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:59,067
I know they're lies,
because I know
this woman.

183
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,900
I know what she went
through to feed your child.

184
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,833
The Communists
tore off my leg

185
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:16,467
And knifed a sign
in my side reading
"capitalist spy."

186
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,733
Lia found me
on the outskirts
of the village.

187
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:24,800
She cut off the
gangrenous flesh and
carried me to the hospital.

188
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,067
Help you?

189
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,100
Stay out of her life!

190
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,233
I shouldn't have slapped you.

191
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,833
I should've shot you,

192
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:11,667
But your army would've
tossed me in prison,

193
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,700
And your son over there,

194
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,167
Yeah, that's your son,

195
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,467
He'd be scrounging garbage
like a rat.

196
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,567
Take a good look
at him, Brock.

197
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,100
You didn't have time
when he was born,
remember?

198
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,633
When I saw his eyes,
I got sick inside.

199
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:35,333
He was so ugly.
Chinese all the way
down the line.

200
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:40,467
First time I met you,
you said children should
be seen, not had.

201
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,733
You should have done
what you preached.

202
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,967
Look, I wore no halo
when we got married.

203
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,700
You knew how I felt about
half-castes and their kids.

204
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
Then why did
you marry me?

205
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Because you didn't look like
a 30-buck Chinese bride.
That's why!

206
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,667
I didn't come to beg.

207
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,433
Tell the Colonel
you tried.

208
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,067
And don't stop
on your way out
to pat my son like a dog!

209
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,500
Don't dig his grave because
you can't stomach me.

210
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,067
He's living on
borrowed time now.

211
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,067
He'll never get
another chance
to go to the States.

212
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,867
* China Gate

213
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,233
* China Gate

214
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:06,800
* Many dreams
and many hearts

215
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,300
* You separate

216
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:21,767
* Like two arms open wide

217
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:25,867
* Some you welcome in

218
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:31,567
* And some must stay outside

219
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,733
* Bowl of rice

220
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,067
* Bitter tea

221
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:46,567
* Is this all the good earth

222
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:51,367
* Has to offer me?

223
00:19:56,233 --> 00:20:01,833
* Will I find peace of mind?

224
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,600
* Does my true love wait

225
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,433
* Behind the China Gate?

226
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,333
* China Gate

227
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,100
All right, check your
equipment and hardware.
Kruger?

228
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,200
Explosives and grease gun.

229
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,267
BROCK: Charlie!
Lead wire and
automatic carbine.

230
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,800
Andreades.
Explosives and
automatic carbine.

231
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,367
Goldie!
Explosives and grease gun.

232
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,933
Janszi!
Food, extra ammo and
automatic carbine.

233
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,533
Pigalle!
Explosives and
automatic carbine.

234
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,333
All right.

235
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,367
These, we've got to watch.

236
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:26,100
They're primers.
They set off the explosives.

237
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,900
You just tap one
of them and they
can blow us apart.

238
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,800
That's why we've got to keep
them away from the explosives
at all times.

239
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,500
Now, I'm carrying this box
of 50 of them.

240
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,867
I've got 50 more.

241
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,467
Now, I want one of you guys
to stick your neck out
and carry the other box.

242
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,900
I'll carry it.

243
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,600
That wraps it up,
Captain.

244
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,300
Now, I don't want
trouble over this woman.

245
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,067
She has a job to do,

246
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
We will finish it.

247
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:42,800
LUCKY: You wanna blind me?
Kill that light!

248
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,533
Lucky?
Who else did you expect
this time of night?

249
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:50,967
Pull in the mines!
It's Lucky Legs!
Pull in the mines.

250
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,733
Cognac, huh?

251
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:15,067
Lucky Major. You know,
my mother should have
raised me to be an officer.

252
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,767
You better get
this floor fixed.
How's your village?

253
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,567
Rubble.

254
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,600
Your child all right?
So far.

255
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,433
Oh, we had a bad one today.

256
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,333
Yes. I saw our
planes fly over.

257
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,367
Did they hit your bar?

258
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,533
LUCKY: Oh, that was
wrecked days ago.
I hid my cognac underground.

259
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:41,733
There's one thing that
bothers me, Lucky.

260
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,367
Yeah? What's that?

261
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,767
I've been stuck here
for more than a year,

262
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:01,967
Making sure these French
don't infiltrate to hit
our supply line.

263
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,833
Do me a favor, Lucky,
but don't make it obvious.

264
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,500
When you're with
the Major, drop a word
how nice it would be

265
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,833
If I could be transferred
to Sambor-Treng.

266
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,167
MAN: I haven't seen
my family in a year.

267
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:18,233
I, uh... I'll try
to swing it.

268
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,933
I've never heard of any
man saying "no" to you.

269
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,267
(GIGGLING)

270
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,067
We tie up here.
The rest of the way we walk.

271
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,300
The river bends west.
We go northeast.

272
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
(SPITTING)

273
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:40,067
Say, Goldie, what part
of Czechoslovakia
did you fight in?

274
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,467
Falkenau.

275
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,967
That's where the
last battle was fought.
Yeah, that's right.

276
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,100
And what outfit?

277
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,933
1St Division.

278
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:51,567
Oh, the 1st Division,
huh? The Big Red One.

279
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:55,667
Hey, didn't your outfit take
over the concentration camp
there and make the German

280
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,167
Civilians dress and
bury the Russian dead?

281
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,433
Yeah, funny, isn't it?

282
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:04,100
Going out of our way
to give those vodka
corpses a decent burial.

283
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,333
I wouldn't have done it.
Well, at the time we figured
they were our friends.

284
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,700
PIGALLE: Who knows who's
our friends? It's all so
crazy and mixed up.

285
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,433
We know one thing.
We know America
is our friend.

286
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:18,500
I don't see them fighting
over here. I mean,
in their own uniforms.

287
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
She's helping us where
we need help most.
A war costs money,

288
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,233
Especially this crazy one.
It's cost her a lot.

289
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,067
Say, Lucky Legs, you
think we'll run into one
of those Moi villages?

290
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,733
LUCKY: Mmm. One or two
will be in the way.

291
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,233
Moi? Hey, what's that?

292
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,433
It's Vietnamese
for "savage."

293
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,933
For savages
they certainly have been
taken advantage of.

294
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,700
The Commies promised
them rice and gave them guns.

295
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,533
They're like children.
They love to play soldier,
with red stars on their hats.

296
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,700
You know the Mois well?

297
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Well enough.

298
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,067
My mother was a Moi.
KRUGER: Oh, that's right.
I heard you were part Chinese.

299
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
You heard right.

300
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,667
The Moi believe
that this world is
the land of the dying,

301
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,400
And the next is
the land of the living.

302
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,467
Their religion is their
ancestors. They fill big
jars with rice wine

303
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,600
And pray that the spirits of
their ancestors will take
up residence in them.

304
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,867
In the jars?
Ancestors in the jars?
Yeah, that's right.

305
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,933
Ah!
How do you know?

306
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:21,067
I knew a Moi once
who ran short of funds.
You know what he did?

307
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,467
No.

308
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,900
He took one of those jars
and sold it with his
grandmother in it.

309
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,200
(SCOFFING)
No.

310
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,333
That's right.

311
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,233
(LAUGHING)

312
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,500
Say, you don't
look Chinese.

313
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,100
Everybody doesn't carry
their lives in their faces.

314
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,233
I like the idea of a
Fraulein scouting us.

315
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,200
ANDREADES: I don't.
MAN: You superstitious?

316
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,767
Nope.

317
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:56,400
But a lot of these
Vietnamese switch overnight
to the Communists,

318
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,900
Sell out their friends,

319
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,067
Even their families.

320
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,333
You think the Colonel
would've picked her

321
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:03,533
If there was a chance
she'd sell us out?

322
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:07,067
Why not? The Colonel
was a desperate man.

323
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,400
He'd take a chance
on anyone.

324
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,600
Can you see me walking
in a West Berlin beer parlor
with a Fraulein like that?

325
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,300
Who would believe
she's part Chinese?

326
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,233
You know...

327
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,300
They say there
was a rifle company
of Americans in Saigon.

328
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,967
KRUGER: Company.
The way I heard it,

329
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:28,833
It was a whole battalion.
And do you know what she did?
Shut up.

330
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,900
You're the first American
I saw without humor.

331
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,567
Shut up.

332
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,367
I'm just an old gossip
at heart, Sergeant.
I just said what I heard.

333
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:43,233
GAUMONT: You're too
sharp a soldier to swap
lies and believe them.

334
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:46,267
(LAUGHING)
I was thirteen when Hitler
turned my ears into sponges.

335
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,067
I guess all the propaganda
was squeezed out when
you joined the French.

336
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,967
KRUGER: French?
Still a uniform lover
at heart, eh, Kruger?

337
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:55,400
Ah, it's the only life
for me, even if I have
to die to live it.

338
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,567
Say, Goldie,
what part of America
are you from?

339
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,333
New York.

340
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,500
Yeah, I was with the
Hermann Goering Division.

341
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,800
Yeah, I know.

342
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,533
Your outfit
captured us in Sicily.

343
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,067
Yeah, I remember.

344
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,167
Say, why did you leave
your own army to fight
here in Indochina?

345
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:13,433
Well, what I started
out to do in Korea,
I didn't finish.

346
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,267
There are still a lot of
live Commies around.

347
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,400
(SNORING)

348
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,100
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

349
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,300
GOLDIE: Janszi... Janszi!

350
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:49,000
He's crazy! He jumped me!
What's the idea of hitting me?
I could've killed him!

351
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm sorry, Goldie.

352
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,800
I have that nightmare
all the time.

353
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,233
I always see
that Russian soldier
looking at me.

354
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,367
I...

355
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,067
(SOBBING)

356
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:05,367
I'm sorry.

357
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,533
Forget it.

358
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,367
I fight it all the time...

359
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,767
I fight...

360
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,733
I should have
remained in Hungary.

361
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:20,300
But I got sick of watching the
way they took my church over.

362
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:26,367
I was going to the
University of Budapest
when it happened.

363
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,067
I...

364
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
I... I'm sorry Goldie.

365
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,067
I told you, forget it.

366
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:37,567
I got drunk one night,
drunk with hate.

367
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,733
Just hate.

368
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:45,133
I followed that Russian
soldier down the alley
near the university.

369
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,933
Do you know how I killed him?

370
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,067
With my hands.

371
00:31:58,633 --> 00:31:59,767
My hands.

372
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,533
And I see him
all the time in my dreams.

373
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,200
And I kill him over
and over and over...

374
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,833
You screened
every man for this job,
didn't you, Captain?

375
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,200
Yes.

376
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
On a plane you
can tie up a blow-top,

377
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,900
But on an infantry job
you've got to do something
about it real fast.

378
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,667
What do you suggest,
Sergeant?

379
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:31,767
We can't leave him behind.
He'd be caught
and brainwashed.

380
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:37,333
We can't take him with us.
That Russian soldier might
visit him again.

381
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:40,400
BROCK: It's nothing
personal, Janszi.

382
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,933
We like you,
you know that,

383
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,900
But you're dangerous for us
to haul with us on this job.

384
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,233
You might kill
us all in our sleep.

385
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:55,067
You might take
a shot at Goldie or me
with our primers.

386
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,067
You know what that means?

387
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:05,567
We'd all be blown up,
because you're sick.

388
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,167
He's got to go.

389
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,967
GAUMONT: I guess you're right.

390
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,467
BROCK: I know I'm right.

391
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,100
Nobody fouls up this job.
Nobody.

392
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,067
You're wearing the bars.
Pick a man.

393
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,133
BROCK: The quicker you do it,

394
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,333
The faster we
get it over with.

395
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,733
You make sense,

396
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,367
But I'm not going to
give the order.

397
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,267
What do you mean?

398
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:40,933
You want to kill him?
Kill him, but it will have
to be your decision.

399
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,867
All right.
No! Wait a minute,
Sergeant...

400
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,733
Just...
Just a minute.

401
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,767
Just wait.

402
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,967
I... I'm not afraid to die.

403
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,900
That's why I volunteered
for this patrol.

404
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,800
But, to be killed
by one of you...

405
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,100
I promise,

406
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,500
I won't sleep.

407
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,200
I will keep quiet as a bird.

408
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,300
No more dreams.

409
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,367
No more nightmares.

410
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:19,600
I will keep awake
until the job is finished.

411
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,367
You have a knife.
Use it.

412
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
No.

413
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,200
I pass this time, Janszi.

414
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,667
The next time you
have a nightmare,
it'll be your last.

415
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Janszi.

416
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,533
If I were you,
I'd take some sleepin' pills.

417
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,367
It's all mined except
along the statues.

418
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,500
There's always a
guard stationed there
in contact with his unit.

419
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,833
I'll handle him.
Leung will signal
when to start.

420
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,367
Remember,
the safe ground
is only about that wide.

421
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,767
Brush against
those stone idols and you
won't blow up on a mine.

422
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,067
(LAUGHING)

423
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:58,800
You remember
Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

424
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,967
No, go ahead.

425
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,733
LUCKY: You're afraid
of Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

426
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Have your own
little drink, there.

427
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,767
I'm gonna tell you
a story about
Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

428
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,867
It's nothing.
Nothing at all.

429
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,700
Mines.
Be careful.

430
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
LUCKY: Easy.

431
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,333
Easy now. Mines.

432
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,133
Careful.

433
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,467
We're surrounded by all
kinds of booby traps.

434
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,833
They keep changing
them every day.

435
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,433
How do you get through?

436
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,400
I find out from that
observation post.

437
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,133
What post?

438
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,333
There's a tree house
up there.

439
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,933
They can see movement
in all directions.

440
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,333
Oh, I can get
the information,
but night travel is out.

441
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,400
Too dangerous.

442
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,267
Daylight will be worse.
They will see us.

443
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,967
That's right, but
a dead guard can't see.

444
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll send a man up to
make sure he can't see.

445
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,967
You've been up
there many times?

446
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,133
Yes.

447
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,567
Alone?

448
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:28,533
Yes.

449
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,600
That you, Lucky?

450
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
LUCKY: Yes!

451
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:47,900
You alone?

452
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,467
No. I came with Leung
and some friends.

453
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:51,767
Bring a bottle.

454
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:53,300
How many do you want?

455
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,467
Oh, just enough for me.

456
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,733
Tell them I'll call down
when I find out.

457
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,600
Since when did you start
swamp-crawling at night?

458
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,333
Think I like it?
My orders were to hurry.

459
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
The Major again?

460
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,067
Mmm-hmm.
You jealous?

461
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,400
Everyone's jealous of him.

462
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,667
Is, uh...
Is number three clear?

463
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,433
No. Every path is wired.

464
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,067
Every one?

465
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,433
Yes,

466
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:11,433
But there's a small
bend about twenty yards
from here.

467
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:15,333
Oh? Where? Out there?
About twenty yards?

468
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:18,433
Yes, and if you
keep to the left side,
you'll make it.

469
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,200
But it's too risky
to try at night.

470
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,933
I won't be
relieved till morning.

471
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,667
I better tell
my cousin.

472
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:33,633
Leung?

473
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,300
LEUNG: Yes?

474
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,667
We'll have to wait
till morning.
Did you hear me?

475
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,333
LEUNG: Yes, I heard you.

476
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,667
(CHUCKLING)

477
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,700
You know, Leung
is a very good cousin.

478
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,367
(BOTH LAUGHING)

479
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:27,533
(GROANS)

480
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,067
The Captain told me to
spend the night here.

481
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,333
In case a Commie soldier
slipped up the ladder.

482
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,267
The Captain's a
frustrated matchmaker.

483
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,700
Yeah, I guess you're right.

484
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,833
I was captured.

485
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,867
They tried to brainwash me,
but I was a bad subject.

486
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,833
When it was over,
I was an exchange P.O.W.

487
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,967
You said
you were captured.

488
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:23,900
Yeah.

489
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,067
(CHUCKLING)

490
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:29,067
What's the matter,
don't you believe me?

491
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:34,133
You once told me
that no one could ever
really be captured.

492
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,367
If you want to die,
you'll kill, or be killed,

493
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,333
But if you want to live,
you'll surrender.

494
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,100
That's right.

495
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:45,233
Give me one good reason
you had for wanting to live.

496
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,167
I was afraid to die.
It's as simple as that.

497
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,700
One thing about you, Brock.
You don't lie.

498
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,867
I don't have to.

499
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,467
Why'd you join the French?

500
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,500
Soldiering's my business.
Korea got cold and
Indochina got hot.

501
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,967
Are you really that
interested in fighting
for the French?

502
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:22,067
Sure. I don't particularly
like the Commies and France
was left holding the bag.

503
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,700
France.

504
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,533
There's only a handful
of French here, Brock.
There's millions of Chinese.

505
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:32,567
You came here to fight
for a Chinese baby.
Go on, admit it!

506
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,967
(SCOFFING)
You don't give a damn
about the French.

507
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:36,133
Go on! Admit it!

508
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:53,667
I'm learning
a lesson in hate
just watching you.

509
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,400
I'm too tired
to hate anymore.

510
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:03,367
It was all my
fault, not yours.

511
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:06,167
I'm really to blame.

512
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:10,633
You knew all about me,
but I didn't know
all about you.

513
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,900
Sure, you'd traveled all
over the world, but you
hadn't learned anything.

514
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,800
Not where it counts.

515
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,933
I should have investigated
your heart and your brain.

516
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,867
Should have seen you
weren't adjusted yet.

517
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,467
That you couldn't
face facts that
involve people.

518
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,900
(SIGHING)
Oh, you're tough.

519
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,933
You handle explosives,

520
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,833
But you're not tough
enough to handle life, Brock.

521
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,200
That's where I
made the mistake.

522
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,100
Everybody makes mistakes.

523
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Five years...

524
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:31,233
Five years is a long time
to think about one woman
every night.

525
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:35,067
(SIGHING)
Johnny, for me too.

526
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,300
Five years is a long time
to think about one man.

527
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,100
Every night
I talked to our son.

528
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,067
Half the time I was drunk,
but I talked to him.

529
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:54,267
I told him what I did.

530
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,967
I told him
when I was ashamed.

531
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,633
I asked him to forgive me.

532
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,667
I was luckier than you,
Johnny. I had someone
to talk to.

533
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,533
Someone who loves me.

534
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,633
Every night, Johnny.

535
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,933
I told him...

536
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:22,267
I told him...

537
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:24,333
How much I love his father.

538
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,200
(SIGHS) Oh, we'll
do our job, Johnny.

539
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:51,500
We'll go back together
and take our son
to America.

540
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,067
That's not what I meant.

541
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:02,433
What did you mean?

542
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,867
What do you think?

543
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,367
The wrong man was
killed in here tonight.

544
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,533
Tell the Captain
to send up a human being.

545
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:54,633
(SOBBING)

546
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,333
What's eating them?

547
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:53,967
They know she's your wife.

548
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,767
I thought a man's life was
private in the Legion.

549
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,767
I have a big mouth,
Sergeant.

550
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,933
When I joined
the leather-bellies,
I never figured the Legion

551
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,200
Was an old lady
with an itchy tongue.

552
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,267
Time changes everything,
Sergeant, even the Corps.

553
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:09,067
The Legionnaire of today
is not fighting

554
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:11,900
For a few centimes,
a bottle and a woman.

555
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,900
This time the
Foreign Legion mercenary

556
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:18,567
Is not fighting for money,
nor for the French
government alone.

557
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:23,933
This time they're fighting
for the whole Western world,
against a common enemy.

558
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:28,733
So it is only natural
that time will change
the interests of the men.

559
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,533
They like Lucky Legs.
They know of your son.

560
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,133
They know you are
ashamed of him.

561
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,067
They just don't like you.

562
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,400
Look out!

563
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:55,967
I don't feel so good.

564
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,633
Your back's broken.

565
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,533
I've seen broken backs.

566
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,100
There's nothing anybody
can do about it. Huh?

567
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,433
Nothing.

568
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,667
What're you all waiting for?

569
00:50:13,867 --> 00:50:16,000
Move out. Move out.

570
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,433
We have to wait.

571
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Why?

572
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,300
We can't bury you alive.

573
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,167
I don't like for people
to watch me die.

574
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:31,333
We don't like it, either.

575
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:53,867
She's got manners, that one.

576
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:58,033
She's a wonderful
woman, Brock.

577
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,467
What she ever saw in you?
(GURGLING)

578
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:07,067
Ever been to Greece?

579
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,167
No.

580
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
You?

581
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,633
No.

582
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,900
I remember when
my wife went crazy.

583
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:29,300
I remember when
she died, crazy.

584
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,667
(RAGGED BREATHING)

585
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:39,467
I'm sorry I'm taking
such a long time to die.

586
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,367
We're in no hurry.

587
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,133
Let there be a heaven,

588
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:53,267
For it would kill me to have
to come back here again.

589
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,100
I'm all mixed up, Lia.

590
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,567
I figured you'd understand.

591
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:45,467
I mean, what I told you
up there in the tree house.

592
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:54,067
I could've lied to you.
I could've filled your head
with lies.

593
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,600
I could have said
that I wanted the kid,

594
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,600
That I'd take him
to the States with me.

595
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,367
I could've told you
all those things.

596
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:07,067
But I didn't, Lia,
I didn't.

597
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:13,900
Not when I... Not when I
can't feel anything for him.

598
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,367
You mean...
You mean even now,
after you've seen him?

599
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,100
You feel nothing?

600
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,367
You're the only person that
ever made me feel ashamed.

601
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:35,067
Ashamed of my mother,
my race, myself.

602
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,600
I know I'm different.

603
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,067
I know the difference
between me and my sisters,
and my cousins,

604
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,667
But I never felt
ashamed of it.

605
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:45,767
I told you he might look
Chinese, didn't I?

606
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:49,133
But you said it wouldn't
make any difference, as long
as the baby were healthy.

607
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:50,467
Didn't you?

608
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:52,200
Yeah.

609
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:57,400
But it's different when
it really happens to you.

610
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,967
I never figured it would be
such a one-sided birth.

611
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,333
There's, there's nothing...

612
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:07,733
No, there's nothing
Brock about him,
except half his blood.

613
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,833
Otherwise he's like
millions of Chinese babies.

614
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:16,267
But I don't want him
wearing a grenade
when he's ten.

615
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:19,967
I don't want him carrying
a gun when he's fifteen.

616

01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:28,967
Our situation is too
flexible for that.
We bomb everywhere.

770
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:32,467
It's hard for me to
believe how you can talk
so indifferently about

771
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:34,067
Killing women and children.

772
01:11:35,267 --> 01:11:37,467
I remember when you used to
hate any kind of brutality.

773
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,833
I remember when you hated
the Communists.

774
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:53,100
That was a stupid thing
to say in front of her.

775
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,233
Fortunately, she's deaf.

776
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:57,867
Don't you ever say that
to me again
in front of anyone.

777
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,367
Of course I hate killing,

778
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:05,600
But if France wins I'll be
a school teacher again.

779
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,200
If they don't execute me.

780
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,533
One must adjust to
the times, Lia.

781
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:11,100
When the Communists win,

782
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,533
I'll most likely be sent to
General Staff School.

783
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,733
Imagine me a general,

784
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,133
Stationed in Peking,
or perhaps even Moscow.

785
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:23,067
Can you?

786
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:24,867
Yes.

787
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:27,533
I believe you can become
almost anything, Cham.

788
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,433
You've come a long way.

789
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:33,300
You'd have come with me
if you hadn't listened to
that American soldier.

790
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,233
I told you then it
was all a farce.

791
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:37,767
But, no...

792
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:40,067
He wouldn't buy you
for 30 dollars.

793
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,933
Not your beautiful
American soldier.
He really loved you.

794
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,500
He wanted your children.
He was going to take
you to America.

795
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:50,233
There's a
wonderful man, Lia.

796
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,333
One of the brightest
in all the world.

797
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:55,067
Ho Chi Minh.
"He Who Enlightens."

798
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:56,867
He speaks five languages.

799
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:58,467
I speak seven.

800
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,533
The day I can report
directly to Moscow,

801
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:05,600
Instead of through Peking...

802
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,733
That's the day I'll be
in line to command the
Viet Minh Politburo.

803
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,867
Maybe you're right.

804
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,467
Maybe I'm too blind to
see what's happening.

805
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,067
Maybe I should bring
the boy here.

806
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,933
It's the only sensible
thing to do.

807
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,067
Lia...

808
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,567
We're both half-castes.

809
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,867
But I'm more fortunate
than you. I have Chinese
characteristics. You don't.

810
01:13:30,633 --> 01:13:32,900
Just picture yourself
the wife of a general.

811
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:35,067
Your son safe every night.

812
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:36,533
Playing every day.

813
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:38,500
His mind being developed
so that he can step
into my shoes

814
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,067
And protect the people.

815
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,067
I could have married
many times, Lia.

816
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:53,500
I love only one woman, Lia.

817
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:56,900
Please let me
send for him.

818
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,333
Oh, I don't know.

819
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:03,533
You'll know when you see
what's taking place.

820
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:06,667
All those mountains are
laced with tunnels.

821
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,700
And the French are
losing the war,

822
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,867
Because they don't know
which tunnel is our arsenal.

823
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,567
I'll show you why it's
logical you should marry me.

824
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,467
There are enough bombs
and shells in here

825
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,667
To guarantee your son
a safe life with me.

826
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:15,267
One of these may be
the one to kill him.

827
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:17,567
That's entirely up to you.

828
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,200
It's a butcher shop
before the slaughter.

829
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,400
Call it butchery.

830
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,200
When it's all over
you'll call it virtue.

831
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,833
How can you sleep nights?

832
01:15:27,933 --> 01:15:30,200
It's all according to
your point of view.

833
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,133
You get caught in a
political upheaval,
you're hanged as a traitor.

834
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:35,533
But lead
a successful revolt

835
01:15:35,633 --> 01:15:37,533
And future generations
will worship you

836
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,300
As the father
of their country.

837
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,333
Can you argue with
all this, Lia?

838
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,633
No.

839
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,500
No, it's...
It's horrifying.

840
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,367
And dramatically final.

841
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:53,367
The difference between
failure and success

842
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:56,067
Is in doing a thing
nearly right,

843
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,633
And doing it
exactly right.

844
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,833
If all this fails to
convince you that you'd
be marrying the winner,

845
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,667
I can only
catalog you as a fool.

846
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,900
And file your son
as a casualty.

847
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:11,700
Lia...

848
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,600
It's said that the
Book of Life

849
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,500
Begins with a man and
a woman in a garden and
ends with Revelations.

850
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,700
This is my kind of
garden, Lia.

851
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,667
And my kind
of revelations.

852
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:26,100
With me you'd not
only live long,

853
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,500
But you'd live!

854
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:31,633
Let me think
about it.

855
01:16:31,733 --> 01:16:34,433
The longer you take
to think, the shorter
your boy's life.

856
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:39,267
I'll make up my
mind tonight.

857
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:41,367
I've been praying for
this moment a long time.

858
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,633
Hmm. You?

859
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:45,567
Prayed?

860
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,833
There's moments when
my soul is on its knees.

861
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,533
LUCKY: The guard at
the Buddha is relieved
every two hours.

862
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:27,300
He's been on duty
for twenty minutes.

863
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:30,067
This is the shrine
entrance to the tunnel.

864
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,067
Two guards here.
GAUMONT: What about
their relief?

865
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,767
They've got one hour to go.

866
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:37,200
At the far end
are five guards.
I'll handle them.

867
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,067
Leung will let me know
the minute you've finished.

868
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,833
The Colonel was right in
picking you for this job.

869
01:17:41,933 --> 01:17:44,400
It didn't take you long
to locate those bombs.

870
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,200
It wasn't hard.

871
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,233
No. I guess it wasn't.

872
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,167
GAUMONT: Are you ready?
You'll get a medal for it,
Brock.

873
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:55,800
And I'll get what I want.
GAUMONT: Are you ready?

874
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,200
Yes.

875
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:59,800
Keep close behind me.

876
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,233
There may be a guard not
interested in my legs.

877
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,067
Lia.

878
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:06,800
Wait.
GAUMONT: Is something wrong?

879
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:08,867
Yeah, me.

880
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,067
Lia...

881
01:18:18,267 --> 01:18:20,933
Lia, I never said I was
sorry for what I did.

882
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:25,867
I never apologized.

883
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:28,833
I never asked you
to forgive me.

884
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:34,200
Lia... Lia...

885
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,700
I want you, Lia.

886
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,767
I want you.

887
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,333
I want our kid.
I want him the way he is.

888
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,067
The way he looks.

889
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,433
Lia?

890
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,833
Will you be
my wife again?

891
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,900
Oh.

892
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,600
Oh, Johnny!

893
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,967
That's what I've wanted
to hear for the last
thousand years!

894
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,500
Oh.

895
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,567
There's only
one thing wrong.

896
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,667
What?

897
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,767
Well...

898
01:19:24,867 --> 01:19:26,467
That one-legged priest.

899
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:30,900
The way he feels,
he'd never marry us again.

900
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,367
If only you hadn't
divorced me!

901
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:36,367
But...

902
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:37,867
Johnny...

903
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:39,533
I didn't!

904
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,100
I only hated you,
but you...

905
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,333
You were ashamed of me,

906
01:19:45,433 --> 01:19:48,067
So I was sure that you...

907
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,900
Me?
Oh!

908
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,667
Darling! I couldn't
divorce you!

909
01:19:55,767 --> 01:19:57,200
I couldn't!

910
01:19:58,133 --> 01:19:59,467
Oh.

911
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:04,133
Well, come on...

912
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,433
We've got a job to do.

913
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,933
Come on.

914
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,067
Hello. Good evening.
Good evening.

915
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:38,667
Isn't this a beautiful place?
Oh, it is, yes.

916
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,900
Beautiful! Look at
that gorgeous Buddha.

917
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,167
My, but you're on
duty late tonight.

918
01:21:01,267 --> 01:21:03,133
Yes, you're on duty
terribly late.

919
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,700
You know, I just
came from the Major.
You know what he told me?

920
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,067
He said that you two were
the most wonderful guards
in the whole army.

921
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,567
(GUARDS LAUGHING)

922
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:04,200
That's a good one, huh?

923
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,900
I'll drop by later.
I've got another story
the Major told me.

924
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:25,900
Oh, I haven't
forgotten you!

925
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:27,500
CHAM: Lia!

926
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:30,367
Get back to your post!
GUARD: Yes, sir!

927
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:32,600
Go somewhere, Leung.
Anywhere.
Yes, sir.

928
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:38,833
I've got a surprise
for you.

929
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:09,933
She's hot.
There's a plane there pointed
in the right direction.

930
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:15,400
Where's Lia? Where is she?
LEUNG: She's with the Major.

931
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,767
I'm gonna wait.
Make it hot, Sergeant.

932
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,333
Not until she shows up.

933
01:23:22,433 --> 01:23:24,633
Make that connection hot!

934
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,100
Will you wait for her?
You know we can't!

935
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,633
Look Captain, I know her.
She's smart. She'll find
a way of leaving him.

936
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,167
But you've got to
give her some time!

937
01:23:32,267 --> 01:23:35,800
In your own words, Brock.
"Nobody fouls up this job!"

938
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,733
If that wire is found we've
come a long way for nothing!

939
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:41,400
I'll make it hot, Captain.
I'll make it hot.

940
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,667
But you've got to give
her a couple of minutes.

941
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:46,067
All right.

942
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,533
A couple.

943
01:23:54,733 --> 01:23:55,867
She's hot.

944
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:58,433
Two minutes, Brock.

945
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,967
If you don't blow that dump,
I'll go in myself,
hit the primers,

946
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,933
And you'll never see
your son again.

947
01:24:07,233 --> 01:24:09,733
I just got this message
from Moscow.

I'm going to General
Staff School at once.

949
01:24:13,567 --> 01:24:15,133
I'll have a few good men
infiltrate the French lines

950
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:16,600
And get your son
out of the village.

Do you know what
this means, Lia?

952
01:24:20,867 --> 01:24:23,133
You don't have to think
about it any longer.

953
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:25,133
We can go to Moscow,
the three of us.

Lia.

01:25:20,233 --> 01:25:22,500
How many dynamiters did
you lead up to the gate?

964
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:37,533
The wire running from
the tunnel's been found.

965
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,567
It's been cut.

966

Your mission's a failure.

967

Why did you do it, Lia?

968
01:25:53,467 --> 01:25:56,200
So that my son
can go to America.
