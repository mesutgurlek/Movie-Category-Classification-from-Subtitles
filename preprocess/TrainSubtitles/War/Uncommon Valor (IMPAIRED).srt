1
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,036
Aah!

2
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,938
Wait a minute.
He ain't dead!

3
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,020
Let's go!
Let's go!

4
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:08,933
Frank!

5
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:20,986
Come on, Frank.

6
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,264
Let's get the hell out!

7
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:37,327
Frank!

8
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,133
Frank!

9
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,143
Frank!

10
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,984
Frank!

11
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,524
Hey, come back!

12
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,609
But on this joyous day,

13
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,111
one sobering question,
one haunting question remains.

14
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,147
Are they all back?

15
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,150
Still listed as
missing in action

16
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,152
are 2,500 American men.

17
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,156
Are any of them
still being held prisoner?

18
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,351
For the families
of those men,

19
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:36,156
the Vietnamese war
will never be over

20
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,131
until that question
is answered.

21
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,135
We're waiting
for the first P.O.W.

22
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,137
to emerge from the plane.

23
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,139
All of America waiting,

24
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,142
and in particular,
his family is waiting.

25
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,145
We'll see these heroes
emerging momentarily.

26
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:57,683
We're waiting now for,
on this momentous day,

27
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,619
the end of the war
officially fo rthem.

28
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,622
This day, March 7, 1973.

29
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,625
The first one
coming off now!

30
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,593
He looks a little thin,

31
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,096
but considering what
he's been through,

32
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:14,099
he looks very good
from here.

33
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,601
He's approaching
his family now.

34
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,106
We're waiting
for others to come off.

35
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,573
There's the official reunion.

36
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,110
The war is over for him.

37
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,715
For other American families,
the agonizing will continue

38
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,079
For other American families,
the agonizing will continue

39
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:34,951
until they find out
the fate of their missing sons.

40
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,579
[Thunder]

41
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,089
Daddy!

42
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,061
Daddy.

43
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,933
l'm scared.

44
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,937
Can I sleep
with you tonight?

45
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,586
Colonel Rhodes,
I sympathize, but--

46
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,588
I don't want
your sympathy!

47
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,591
I want you to help me
find my son.

48
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,058
But don't you understand?

49
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,560
There's nothing I can do.

50
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,062
There are 2,500 men
still unaccounted for.

51
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,065
There have been over
400 live sightings

52
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,101
of Americans held
against their will.

53
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,102
There's nothing I can do.

54
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,604
That's all I ever
heard in Washington.

55
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,038
Nobody can do anything.

56
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:03,041
That's why I came
to Bangkok.

57
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,543
Look, you didn't
hear this from me,

58
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,547
but there are a couple
of men here in Bangkok

59
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:12,483
who claim they've seen
American P.O.W.s in Laos.

60
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,283
I think my son's being
held prisoner in Laos,

61
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,790
but I need proof.

62
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,759
Get my son's signature
on the back of this picture.

63
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:25,525
Get my son's signature
on the back of that picture.

64
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,031
All right?

65
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,070
If I get your son's name here,

66
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,971
I want lots of money.

67
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,305
Yeah, O.K.

68
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,588
Hey, you.

69
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,591
[Speaking Thai]

70
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,867
O.K.

71
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,712
Hey!

72
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:26,058
Oh, boy. There's that old
Colonel M.I.A. again.

73
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,525
Hello, Colonel.

74
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,027
How are you?

75
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,030
Sorry we haven't
got time today,

76
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,057
but give me a ring
in my office.

77
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,569
Sorry.

78
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:43,806
Colonel Rhodes,
I can't help you with your son.

79
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,812
I'm trying to find food
for these new refugees.

80
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,314
Talk to that guy over there.
He'll help.

81
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,849
Thank you very much.

82
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:11,536
That your boy.

83
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,539
He prisoner in camp in Laos.

84
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,542
I smuggled the picture out.

85
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,532
I know my son's being held
somep lace in Northern Laos,

86
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,067
but I need to know
exactly where.

87
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,737
I need a thorough recon
of the area.

88
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:45,533
I need a thorough recon
of the area.

89
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:49,541
I can go into Laos
and North Vietnam.

90
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,543
I've got the connections.

91
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:56,446
But it'll take a lot of money
to find your son.

92
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,549
Don, hi!

93
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,585
How are you,Jason?

94
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,121
What do you have for me?

95
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:06,124
You know...ifthey
find out about this,

96
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,592
they'll retire me,
just like they retired you.

97
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,094
Yeah, yeah, O.K.

98
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,504
I suppose someone
could call this treason.

99
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:21,506
No. No, thanks.

100
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:27,069
It's a prison camp in Laos.

101
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,512
Look at the paddy dikes.

102
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,052
There's your proof,Jason.

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,054
There's your proof--111 .

104
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,056
Go get your boy.

105
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,031
O.K.

106
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:55,034
Now, where was I?

107
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,541
Hey, Blaster.

108
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:59,544
Tell us about
that big wave.

109
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:03,048
I've told you guys
that story a thousand times.

110
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,381
I don't remember how I lied
the last time.

111
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:09,421
It doesn't matter.
It's still going to be bitchin'.

112
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,047
All right, all right.

113
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,058
The surf on
the north shore

114
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,594
comes up real fast.

115
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,562
You're out there
having fun,

116
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,565
and then it happens--

117
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,567
a life-threatening
experience.

118
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,403
And then?

119
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,568
This photograph
was taken

120
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,576
somewhere close
to where Frank is being held.

121
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,078
I'm not saying
Frank is one of them,

122
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,081
but those two
are Americans.

123
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,583
They're much too tall
to be Vietnamese.

124
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,119
Average Vietnamese man
is about 5'2-1 /2".

125
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:44,122
And that's supposed
to be Frank?

126
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,418
That is Frank.

127
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:49,086
I bought too many fakes
over the last 10 years.

128
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,595
That definitely is Frank.

129
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,599
Been a P.O.W.
10 years in that shit hole?

130
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,100
Frank is alive.

131
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,602
You got that?

132
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,604
My son is alive.

133
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,038
Take a look at that.

134
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,542
That's a high altitude
photograph

135
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,544
taken from a SR-71 .

136
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,045
Look closely.

137
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,049
Look at the paddy dikes.

138
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,382
The three lines there.

139
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,086
111 .

140
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,554
That's your old
LRRP team designation--

141
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,563
First Battalion,
11 th Infantry.

142
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,565
Don't you see it?

143
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,066
Right here.

144
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,227
Yes.

145
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,567
That's three lines
in the ground.

146
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:35,072
It could be anything.

147
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:38,577
You know it isn't though,
don't you?

148
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:43,081
That's a message
from my son.

149
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,083
You know that.

150
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,700
Hello.

151
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,195
Hi.

152
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,704
Mrs. Wilkes?

153
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,206
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,108
I'm Jason Rhodes.

155
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,610
I phoned this morning.

156
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,112
Yeah, I know who you are.

157
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,116
Listen, my husband doesn't
want to talk to you.

158
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:21,642
I phoned him this morning,
and he said he did.

159
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,688
Not anymore.

160
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:26,657
Why don't you
do me a favor and go away?

161
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,627
Not until
I see your husband.

162
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,129
You've got no right
to be here.

163
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,132
It's taken me 1 0 years

164
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,795
to get that god damned war
out of his head.

165
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,033
Looks to me like
it's still in his head.

166
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,802
Ohh...

167
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,308
that's very deep.

168
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,709
Where were you
all the days

169
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,179
he spent staring
at the walls?

170
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:51,915
Hey, Wilkes!

171
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:52,916
Goddamn you!

172
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,579
Why did you send
your wife out here?

173
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,815
Don't you have
the guts to come out?

174
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,357
Leave him alone!

175
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,256
My son needs you!

176
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,262
At least look
at our photographs.

177
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,268
Wilkesy.

178
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,770
I'll handle this now.

179
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,784
I don't like your tactics.

180
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:28,820
But I'll listen
because of Frank.

181
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:29,820
O.K.

182
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:32,823
Blaster.

183
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,294
Wilkesy.

184
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,297
Why didn't you
stay in touch?

185
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,798
Why didn't you?

186
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,302
I don't know.

187
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,304
It's weird, ain't it?

188
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,808
How did they find you?

189
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,310
I don't know.

190
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,812
Came looking
and found me.

191
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,815
Then we found you.

192
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,817
Thanks a lot, Blast.

193
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,785
It's good
to see you, man.

194
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,281
There are compounds
all over Northern Laos.

195
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,825
There are choppers
we left behind.

196
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,795
We'll use them to get
into the P.O.W. camp.

197
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,797
They're used all the time,

198
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,799
so they should be
well maintained.

199
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,801
Excuse me, please.

200
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,246
You going out?

201
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,748
Mm-hmm.

202
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,249
Early, isn't it?

203
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:08,287
I want to make
happy hour.

204
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,288
Want to come along?

205
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:15,258
No. I think
I'll stay home tonight.

206
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,761
No kidding.

207
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,262
What's that mean?

208
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,356
It means, no kidding.

209
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,266
I don't feel like
going out.

210
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:26,271
He never feels like
doing anything.

211
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,772
That's not true.

212
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,104
Every night it's the same.

213
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,043
He listens to that crap.

214
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:36,775
That crap happens
to be George Gershwin.

215
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,784
It's like I'm not even here.

216
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:43,821
He's like a turtle
hiding in his shell.

217
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,593
He hasn't taken off
those sunglasses in six years.

218
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,060
He hasn't taken off
those sunglasses in six years.

219
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:53,064
I've given up trying
to figure him out.

220
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,670
Maybe you should take him
back to Vietnam.

221
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,699
He doesn't give a damn
about anything here.

222
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:07,712
It was nice meeting
you, Colonel.

223
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,213
Nice meeting you.

224
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,719
If he did go,

225
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,722
how much
would he be paid?

226
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,223
Nothing in dollars.

227
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:36,708
I haven't flown a helicopter
in a while.

228
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,300
I'd probably get
somebody killed.

229
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:43,041
There's unfinished business
over there, MajorJohnson.

230
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,639
Not mine.

231
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,754
Is this the Distinguished
Flying Cross?

232
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,255
Yeah.

233
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:52,757
How'd you get that?

234
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:57,228
Ah...pulling a cub pilot
out of Laos.

235
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,389
Must have been
more to it than that.

236
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,625
Not really.

237
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,160
Tell me about it.
I'd like to hear it.

238
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:06,670
I got him out

239
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:10,175
after a lot of good people
went down trying.

240
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:13,211
It was a hell ofa day.

241
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,713
We'd already lost
a good man named Hendricks,

242
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,715
couple of F-4jocks,

243
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,717
even Sandy Low Lead.

244
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,720
Lost a lot of good friends.

245
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,380
How many?

246
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,220
Oh, I don't remember.

247
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,192
It just seemed
like everybody.

248
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,524
You lost 11 men
and 9 aircraft.

249
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:34,191
You were shot down,
and you went back.

250
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,324
Why?

251
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,392
If you know that,
you tell me.

252
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,767
Why?

253
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:40,066
It was my job!

254
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,071
Right!

255
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,268
We couldn't let good men
die for nothing!

256
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:47,369
That's why we're
going back now.

257
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,708
Wait! Back up!

258
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,749
Don't lay that guilt on me!

259
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,250
No!

260
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,755
I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

261
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,158
What do you
want from me?

262
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,662
I run half this hospital.

263
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,665
I'm off to Bermuda
next week

264
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,169
and not off
to some fantasy war.

265
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,172
I cannot save
the goddamn world!

266
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,673
At ease, Major.

267
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,171
[Telephone Rings]

268
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,711
MacGregor Oil.

269
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,213
Mr. MacGregor, please.

270
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:23,714
Mr. MacGregor's office.

271
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,217
This is Jason Rhodes
calling.

272
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,219
Jason, how's it going?

273
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,221
We're on our way.

274
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,722
How many?

275
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,192
Three. One chopper pilot
turned me down.

276
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,990
Is two enough?

277
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,520
I'll do it with one
if I have to.

278
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,533
I can't turn back now.

279
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,866
Is there anything more
I can do?

280
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,202
Just keep the cash coming.

281
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,708
I'll get our boys back.

282
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,243
What about Sailor?

283
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:55,747
He's in Houston.
I'm going there now.

284
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:59,751
The replica of
the P.O.W. camp is ready.

285
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,684
Great.
Keep in touch.

286
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:04,348
All right.
Talk to you.

287
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,357
Don't worry.
He can't see you.

288
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:07,824
It's a two-way mirror.

289
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,164
Your friend, Sailor,

290
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,668
blowtorched a local
kingpin biker.

291
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:21,672
We're holding him on our
witness protection program.

292
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,700
He come in here with
a grenade around his neck.

293
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,215
I don't think
his bread's quite done.

294
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,223
I had trouble
tracking you down.

295
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,192
You wandered around
the whole country.

296
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,890
Frank mentioned you
in his letters.

297
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,695
He said you were
the best man in the unit.

298
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:49,699
Yeah?

299
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,202
What the hell
happened to you?

300
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:58,732
I'm so far beyond
that shit now.

301
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,745
I get energy
from the air.

302
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:04,249
I talk to polar bears.
I converse with paramecium.

303
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,750
Man, I fuck nuclear waste!

304
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,746
Shit.

305
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:18,229
You guys will be
using real grenades.

306
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,060
They took mine.

307
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,565
Hey, look, asshole.

308
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,070
This is not
a bikers' acid trip.

309
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:28,072
This is a precise
military operation.

310
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,099
Frank was the best man
in anybody's unit.

311
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:36,113
I've got enough brain cells
to remember that.

312
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,286
You've got to
give me a shot, man.

313
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,787
You've got to.

314
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,125
Hey, Wilkesy.

315
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,098
Come on, man.

316
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,695
Sailor?

317
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,206
Ya-hoo!

318
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,744
My master!

319
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:11,248
You haven't changed a bit!

320
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,750
Master Wilkes!

321
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,251
Where's your grenade?

322
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,551
I used that for
an emergency enema.

323
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:27,198
Maybe I do have a little
unfinished business.

324
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:31,726
Besides, this guy wouldn't last
10 minutes without me.

325
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:33,601
You ain't bullshitting.

326
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:34,730
O.K.

327
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,206
Get aboard.

328
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,203
Well, gentlemen, this is it.

329
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:09,206
Exact replica
of the P.O.W. camp.

330
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:10,707
Who built it?

331
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,242
MacGregor's father.

332
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,744
Get your gear.

333
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,747
Stow it in that large tent.

334
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:20,251
I'll meet you here
in an hour for supper.

335
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:27,224
Mr. Ky, supper in one hour.

336
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,725
Thankyou.

337
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,737
Mr. Scott, at ease.

338
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,943
So, who the hell is that?

339
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,282
Good evening.

340
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,285
Hi. How are you?

341
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:58,289
Mr. Ky, you can serve
when you're ready.

342
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,691
Good evening.

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,193
As you were.

344
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:07,366
Since military courtesy
isn't practical here,

345
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:08,397
we'll dispense with it.

346
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:09,992
This is Kevin Scott.

347
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:13,367
He's well-trained in weapons
and training techniques.

348
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,702
And this is Mr. Ky.

349
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:19,540
We'll be eating Vietnamese food
from now on.

350
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:23,206
We don't want
to smell like Americans.

351
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,216
Any questions?

352
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,013
Good.

353
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,715
How long were you there?

354
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:32,222
I wasn't.

355
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,724
Too young.

356
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,524
Is he going with us?

357
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:40,690
Served in
Fourth Recon Marines.

358
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,529
Served?

359
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:46,560
I was discharged
for striking a radio operator

360
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:49,573
who fell asleep
at his post.

361
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:58,239
You're worried that I have
no combat experience.

362
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,750
You're right.

363
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:04,687
There's no way of proving
I won't fail in combat.

364
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:08,158
But you can't prove
that I will.

365
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:11,996
This is gonna be

366
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:16,000
a whole lot offun
with this one.

367
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,497
Gentlemen.

368
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,207
Thankyou for coming.

369
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,210
I knew you would come,

370
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:30,214
'cause you men
have got what it takes.

371
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,216
Molded over a little,

372
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,718
but you still got it.

373
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,723
There's a bond
between you men

374
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:43,694
as strong as the bond
between my son and me.

375
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:47,198
Of course, men who faced
death in battle

376
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,200
share the strongest bond.

377
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:54,238
You men seem to have
a strong sense of loyalty

378
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,241
because you're thought
of as criminals

379
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,742
because of Vietnam.

380
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,403
You know why?

381
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:04,181
Because you lost.

382
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,683
And in this country,

383
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,686
that's like
going bankrupt.

384
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,688
You're out of business.

385
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,691
They want to forget
about you.

386
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,659
You cost too much

387
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,161
and didn't turn a profit.

388
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,666
That's why they
won't get our buddies.

389
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,167
There's no gain in it.

390
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,706
We know the books
are still in the red.

391
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,708
The politicians know, too.

392
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,209
The same politicians

393
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:35,713
that never lost a son
in Vietnam.

394
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:39,217
They say they've
negotiated for 10 years.

395
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,717
Well...

396
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,721
the other side's
not buying.

397
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,193
And while the politicians
sit on their asses,

398
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:54,528
I'm asking you
to lay yours on the line.

399
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,726
Again.

400
00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,998
Because, gentlemen...

401
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,176
we're the only hope
those P.O.W.s have.

402
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:09,177
So, we're going
back there.

403
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:12,179
And this time...

404
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:14,685
this time,
nobody can dispute

405
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:18,189
the rightness
of what we're doing.

406
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,704
Get down!

407
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,206
You're all dead.

408
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,709
Not quite, sir.

409
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,855
[Snoring]

410
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,456
Go, Colonel.
Go, go, go!

411
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:58,860
Go! Go! Go!

412
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:02,631
Move it! Move it!
Move it!

413
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,669
Go! Go! Go!

414
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,671
Fuckin' pimp!

415
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,077
Go! Go! Go!

416
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:15,043
Blaster, go!
Come on, baby, go!

417
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:21,176
O.K. Come on, man.

418
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:24,178
Take it home!

419
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,849
Come on, Scott.

420
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:29,486
Go! Go, Sailor, go!

421
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,153
Come on, rookie!

422
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,163
All right, come on!

423
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:34,721
Go! Go, Sailor!

424
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:38,702
Hit it!

425
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,714
What are you doing?

426
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:56,152
You don't ever quit, boy.

427
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,416
Not when it's for real.

428
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:01,390
All right. That's enough.

429
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:06,959
Shit!

430
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:08,124
Damn!

431
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,134
Too much civilian life.

432
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:11,668
Pull it in!

433
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,172
O.K.! Move your butts!

434
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,673
Double time!

435
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:23,180
Good shooting, Colonel.

436
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,182
Blaster, your elbow down.

437
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,683
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,686
Sailor, stop spraying!

439
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,188
Conserve your ammo!

440
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:41,165
You haven't got
one in the kill zone!

441
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,168
These hands
were made to fly.

442
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,706
Tell the enemy when
he blows your head off!

443
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,708
Don't lose it, mister!

444
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:53,074
You kill the enemy,
asshole!

445
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,204
Sailor, I could teach

446
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,716
an undisciplined brawler
like you a lesson.

447
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,649
Make your move, boy.

448
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,653
Scott! A word, please.

449
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,626
Scott, these men
are seasoned veterans.

450
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:13,130
They can't be treated
like raw recruits.

451
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:16,133
You have to earn
their respect.

452
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:19,669
Yes, sir.

453
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,203
Wilkesy's
claustrophobic as shit.

454
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:57,207
He was the tunnel rat
in our unit.

455
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,176
Goes down a tunnel

456
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,679
to check for
weapon storage.

457
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:05,682
Turns out there's
somebody down there.

458
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,186
He knifes them both
in the dark.

459
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:11,188
Then the shells hit.

460
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,657
He's stuck until
we dig him out.

461
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,660
Wilkes lights a match

462
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:20,164
to move the bodies
offof him.

463
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:23,668
He'd knifed some
woman and her kid.

464
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:26,169
Killed them
deader than shit.

465
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:27,704
Jesus.

466
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:29,205
Wilkes starts freaking.

467
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:31,708
We can hear him
screaming,

468
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:35,212
but he has to stay
with those corpses

469
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,714
until we dig him out.

470
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:42,948
You come in low
under his line of sight.

471
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,723
You leap...

472
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,190
taking him down,

473
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,195
placing your hand
over his nose,

474
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,197
pulling his face away.

475
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:56,200
At the base of his skull,

476
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,532
you insert,
scramble the brains--

477
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:00,537
Instant rag doll.

478
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,130
Most human problems
can be solved

479
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,675
by a charge
of high explosive.

480
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:07,177
In today's lesson,

481
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:10,180
we'll learn to set a series.

482
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,681
Follow me.

483
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,847
The idea is to create
a linked series of disasters.

484
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:19,516
Figure evasive moves
from each blast,

485
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,991
and plant
your next tomato.

486
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,995
Just as we're
coming up here,

487
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,497
they'd trip
charge number one.

488
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:28,658
Boom!

489
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,667
Column splits in two.

490
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,703
Half here, half there.

491
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:36,207
Over here, number two
will set their ass on fire.

492
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:39,209
They think they're safe.
They get away!

493
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:43,577
Boom! Number three
blows their balls off.

494
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:46,208
Number four!
They come over here.

495
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:49,219
They find
a two-pound charge.

496
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,720
Boom!

Quick fuse grenade.

Not a big bang,
but it does a good job.

"We've got to make it."

Congratulations, Sailor.
You wasted a prisoner.

You all right?

506
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,171
Can't sleep, huh?

507
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,218
Foryears, I couldn't sleep
after Korea.

508
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:57,722
My nightmares
all had to do

509
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,723
with the Chosin Reservoir.

510
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,624
The ground there
was so frozen

511
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:05,128
we couldn't bury
our dead.

Piled them on trucks and
lashed them against tanks.

513
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:13,170
For years, I'd wake up

514
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:16,674
with those frozen faces
staring at me.

515
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:22,212
Did it ever go away?

516
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:24,814
No.

517
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:31,188
I finally made friends
with them though.

518
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,790

Sneaky little shit.

Come across.

00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:21,431
You people got caught
'cause you got careless.

540
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:22,932
I told you--

541
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:25,764
All right, Wilkesy!

542
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,360
All right, Wilkesy!

That's why he's called Sailor.

to neutralize

It's an exact reproduction

638
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:32,361
It's imperative
that we're in and out

639
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,898
in less than
three minutes.

640
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:39,232
The lives of everyone
involved may depend on it.

641
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:44,900
We're rehearsing so we can
do this operation in our sleep.

642
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:49,345
10 days time, we'll have
a live fire exercise.

643
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:52,905
Look, we have been pursuing
diplomatic negotiations

644
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:56,420
for the release
of all P.O.W.s,

645
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:58,421
if there are any.

646
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,423
An armed incursion now

647
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,857
would undermine
those negotiations.

651
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:13,793
call Rhodes
and drop this project!

652
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:29,252
Look, I didn't want it
to get this far.

to take serious measures

655
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,726

656
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,728

The men we're going after

659
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,771
will be in rough shape...

660
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,773
something like these men.

661
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:54,277
They may not

01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,766
Colonel.

830
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:16,295
Sir, we lost one RPG,

831
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:17,799
six grenades,

832
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:20,301
and a radio is damaged.

833
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,305
It'll receive,
but the transmitter's shot.

834
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,905
Mr.Jiang.

835
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:35,717
We...

836
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,275
come.

837
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,287
We must continue on.

838
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:43,348
No further words are
necessary, Colonel Rhodes.

839
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:55,771
Since we don't have
night vision gear,

840
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,274
we'll change to 0600
instead of 0300.

841
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:02,277
We're able to
receive your verification

842
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:03,778
about the P.O.W.s,

843
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:08,283
but you'll have to assume
we've gotten the choppers.

844
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,320
Wait till you
hear us coming.

845
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:14,288
Ground team,
you're up that trail.

846
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:17,793
Air team,
follow me down this creek.

847
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:21,258
Well, that's it.

848
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:24,257
It's game time.

849
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:29,271
I've forgotten
the speech I prepared.

850
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:32,775
There are some lines
from Julius Caesar.

851
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,776
"If a man were to know

852
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:38,211
"the end of this day's
business ere it come,

853
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:42,240
"but it suffices
that the day will end,

854
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,752
"and then
the end be known.

855
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,755
"If we meet again,

856
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:48,222
"then we'll smile.

857
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:49,724
"And if not,

858
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:53,228
well, then,
this parting was well made."

859
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:19,248
It should be
right over that hill.

01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:29,257

861
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:30,758

862
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:31,759
Down.

Drop your packs.

864
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:13,734
It looks deserted.

865
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,239
You think
they moved them?

866
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,740
Quite possible.

867
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:22,744
Rice down there
has been harvested.

868
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:27,475
I'll take a look.

869
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:30,677
I'll look at that bridge.

870

Couldn't find a way in.

871
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:44,692
It's walled all around.

Look at this.

873
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:47,194
What?

874
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:55,703
O.K., Wilkesy, I'll go.

875
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,204
No, no, no.

876
01:09:57,273 --> 01:10:01,710
I'll be waiting for you
when you come out.

877
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:03,210
O.K., Wilkesy?

878
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:09,751
Take this.
It'll help protect you.

879
01:11:03,773 --> 01:11:05,206
Help!

880
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:09,978
Wilkesy, you all right?

881
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:16,917
What's wrong, man?

I don't believe it!

isn't here.

887

895

They must've been
working across the river.

896
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:42,456
That's why
we didn't see them.

Jesus, Wilkes!

898

You almost
got me spotted.

900
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:42,483
I saw an American.

901

924
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:37,931

in this area.

Charts and Sailor,
take the barracks.

929
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,457
I'll take the officers' quarters.

930
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:23,471

must fly the helicopter.
