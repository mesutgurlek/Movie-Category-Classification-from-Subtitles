It has these huge walls.

Is Paris.

35
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,348
It has these walls all around.

36

least one. Like this.

Ragnar!

This man is a farmer,

73
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,910
and he has some news for you.

74
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,012
- Lord.
- His name is Stender.

75
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,997
His farm was in Wessex.

76
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,183
I know, Floki. Let the man speak.

77
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:59,488
King Ecbert's son,
Aethelwulf, came one day

78
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:04,126
with his nobles and soldiers,
and killed, burned and destroyed

79
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,067
all of our settlement.

80
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,202
All of it, Ragnar!

81
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,961
Go on.

82
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,271
The slaughter was great.

83
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,908
All our men, their
wives and their children.

84
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,044
Only a few of us survived.

85
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:25,862
Somehow we reached the coast.

86
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,284
We stole a boat,

87
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,553
and then we sailed through ice and fog.

88
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,906
I just wanted to die,

89
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:38,840
as my wife, my daughter and
my little boy had all died,

90
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,672
but the gods refused.

91
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,481
Our misfortune was never ending.

92
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:49,222
Storm blew us off course.

93
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,320
At last we reached a small
frozen bay in Gotland.

94
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:00,150
The ship foundered on the ice.

95
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,504
I saw my eldest son die before my eyes.

96
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,129
And here I am, my Lord,

97
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:17,733
a broken man, who only wants
to die and rejoin his family.

98
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:19,087
Yes, I know.

99
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,354
Do you see now, Ragnar?

100
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,880
This adventure was doomed from the start.

101
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,616
We ignored the warnings of the gods.

102
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:37,870
And so they refused
to protect our farmers.

103
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,662
And who can blame them, Ragnar?

104
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,884
Believe me, Floki.

105
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,906
Aethelwulf

106
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,162
and his father

107
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,966
will feel the wrath of the gods

108
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,756
and my revenge.

109
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,460
And Athelstan?

110
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,087
What about Athelstan?

111
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,824
Athelstan persuaded us to deal
with Ecbert and the Christians.

112
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,661
He persuaded us of their good faith.

113
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:23,133
But now you must see the truth,
Ragnar. It was all a trap.

114
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:27,433
Athelstan is not to blame, Floki.

115
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:32,124
If anyone is to blame, it
is me. Do you understand?

116
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:34,939
Me!

You are a courageous man, Stender.

122

Thank you, Lord.

No, thank you. You are

00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,495
No mercy!

168
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,370
Judith, daughter of Aelle,

169
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,144
wife of Aethelwulf,

170
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,769
you are charged and found
guilty of the heinous crime

171
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,810
of adultery with person
or persons unknown.

172
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,427
You must pray to God for forgiveness.

173
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,694
(SHRIEKING)

174
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:18,001
Stay!

175
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:28,112
Judith, will you not give us the
name of the father of your child?

176
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,631
(SCREAMING LOUDLY)

177
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,997
No!

178
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,480
Athelstan.

179
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:06,355
- Hold! Hold! Hold!
- Athelstan!

180
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,686
(WHIMPERING)

181
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:13,173
What do you mean, it was Athelstan?
What can you possibly mean by that?

182
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,781
(SOBBING)

183
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:16,969
Athel...

184
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,535
(SOBBING) Athelstan is
the father of my child.

185
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:22,192
No.

186
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,034
Athelstan is a holy man.

187
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,203
I cannot blame my daughter-in-law

188
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,172
for being attracted to such a man of God.

189
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,974
Father! Can you not
imagine my own humiliation?

190
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:36,846
I can. But may I suggest that there
are deeper things involved here?

191
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:41,868
In my own mind, there is no doubt
of Athelstan's deep spirituality,

192
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,220
and his close connection to God.

193
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:47,323
So you think that God had
a hand in this conception?

194
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,518
I do. I do, my son.

195
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,697
So how

196
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,301
can we punish a woman

197
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:02,722
who, like the blessed
Virgin, has been chosen by God

198
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:06,433
to give birth to a very special child?

199

(WEEPING)

200
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,874
There will be a Christening after all.

201
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:27,664
The boy's name will be Alfred.

(GASPING)

203
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,863
Oh, Lord.

204
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:19,785
Lord.

205
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,056
Christ the Lord!

206
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,257
I've asked for a sign.

207
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:29,961
You have given me a sign.

208
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:35,011
You've answered my prayers.

209
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:42,234
I was blind, but now I
see. I was dead, but...

210
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,857
I'm reborn.

211
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,498
(WEEPING) Father.

212
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,054
Hear my prayer.

213
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:57,210
And let my cry come unto thee.

(WEEPING)

215
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,929
For the gift of sight.

216
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,178
Lord, thank you.

217
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,238
<i>For the gift of faith.</i>

218
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,644
<i>Thank you.</i>

219

<i>For by you all things were created that
are in heaven, and that are in earth.</i>

Ragnar!

225
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:56,415
What are you smiling about?

226
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:00,736
The Lord has come to me.

227
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:03,438
The Lord?

228
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,041
Your god?

229
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,242
Yes.

230
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:10,378
What did he look like?

231
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:12,347
I felt his presence.

232
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,938
- He came in the form of light.
- Did he speak?

233
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:18,239
No, he did not speak and
yet I heard his voice.

234
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,371
And I am born again.

235
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,459
What do you mean, born
again? Like a baby?

236
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:27,529
I've rediscovered my
faith. I'm a new man.

237
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,212
Born again through the
love of Jesus Christ.

238
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,150
Then you're a Christian again?

239
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,702
With all my heart.

240
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:36,312
With all my soul, with all my being.

241
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,674
I can no longer acknowledge your gods.

242
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,710
I suppose it is better
that I leave Kattegat now.

243
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:45,939
What do you mean? You cannot
leave! You cannot leave me!

244
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,893
I love you.

245
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,823
And you're the only one I
can trust so you must stay.

246
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,440
Well, I'm happy that
you have found your god.

247
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,284
While you are here no
one will ever hurt you.

248
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,276
I will protect you.

249
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,088
It does not matter where I go.

250
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:17,073
What matters to me is where you're going.

251
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:50,226
Floki!

252
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,114
Why are you not working on the boats?

253
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,097
My heart is not in it.

254
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,577
Why not?

255
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:01,289
This is Athelstan's sacred arm ring.

256
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,576
The one Ragnar gave him.

257
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:07,262
I saw him throwing it into the fjord.

258
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,313
Have you told Ragnar?

259
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,653
What's the point?

260
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,003
I feel worried for my father.

261
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:20,842
I don't understand
why he is so interested

262
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:23,452
in the Christians and Christian things.

263
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,567
What are you going to do, Floki?

264
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,852
I am going to leave Kattegat.

265
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:33,154
I will go home to my own culture.

266
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,899
To Helga and my child.

267
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,359
Don't worry, Bjorn.

268
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,694
I will finish the boats.

269
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,626
And in the meantime,

270
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,571
tell our brothers about this.

271
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,935
Who are they?

272
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:11,216
That's Kalf.

273
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:15,829
Those were my ships once.

274
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:19,595
Now they bring Kalf to Kattegat.

275
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,538
Kalf!

276
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,190
King Ragnar!

277
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,442
Earl Kalf.

278
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:30,477
Greetings.

(CHILD GIGGLING)

280
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,372
I join you in the expectation

281
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:42,106
of the greatest raid in
the history of our people.

282
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:49,909
- Who is this chunk of meat?
- This is Earl Siegfried.

283
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:54,987
Lord Ragnar. I put my ships and
my warriors at your disposal.

284
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,110
I'm sure that you remember King
Horik's son, and the widow of Jarl Borg.

285
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:06,849
They also have expressed a
desire to take part in our raid.

286
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:10,203
Erlendur. Torvi.

287
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:16,790
I have to say that... I am a little...

288
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:19,777
caught off guard, seeing you here.

289
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:22,296
I figured there was a
reason you spared my life.

290
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,431
Maybe it's for this.

291
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:27,234
I have to ask, how is
the settlement in Wessex?

292
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,635
Good.

293
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:53,811
You cannot ignore him.

294
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,462
I'm not going to ignore him.

295
00:25:55,498 --> 00:26:00,668
We are going to fight together even
though he took away all that was mine.

296
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:02,882
All that was ours.

297
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,173
Perhaps it was fated?

298
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:09,670
And perhaps it is fated that
I shall win it back some day.

299
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,970
Lagertha.

300
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:22,997
I see you are making yourself
comfortable here as well.

301
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,710
I have come to join with King Ragnar
and you in the attack on Paris.

302
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:31,999
Whatever else divides us,

303
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,518
that simple fact unites us all.

304
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:40,646
We will fight and perhaps, who
knows, we will die together.

305
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:42,783
And if we don't?

306
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,179
Then we will take care of the future.

307
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:48,449
My future or yours?

308
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:53,837
Forgive me, but it seems to me

309
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:57,157
that our destinies are
already locked together.

310
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:01,900
And perhaps always have been!
Wouldn't you agree, Lagertha?

311
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:19,012
Don't hide away.

312
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,981
Why not?

313
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:24,935
Because there is nothing
more beautiful than a mother.

314
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,903
You're drunk!

315
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:31,282
- I want you.
- I know, and I'm sorry.

316
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,973
It's been a long time.

317
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:37,214
You need to be with a woman.

318
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:40,367
Let's find you someone.

319
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:43,359
Isn't that Torvi, the widow of Jarl Borg?

320
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,273
Erlendur doesn't pay her any attention.

321
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:48,244
You'd like her.

322
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,178
Don't do this.

323
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,467
You don't understand. I'm doing
this because I want you to be happy.

324
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:59,302
My father says that
happiness doesn't matter.

325
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:03,390
But you are not your
father, Bjorn Ironside.

326
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:05,969
Or have you not realized that yet?

327
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:08,926
Good night, husband.

328
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,555
Watch it.

329
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:54,239
Rollo.

330
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,830
I have nothing to say to you, priest.

331
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,890
Except this...

332
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,268
Where is your arm ring?

333
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,821
Where is it?

334
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:25,629
I have someone very
special I want you to meet.

335
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,084
Meet Sinric.

336
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,016
The wanderer I told you about.

337
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,755
It was he who guided me to England.

338
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,759
(IN NATIVE TONGUE)

339
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:59,792
You speak the language of the Franks.

340
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,445
Not only that.

341
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:08,645
He also knows how to find
the mouth of the Seine.

342
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:15,694
- Are you thirsty?
- Yes.

343
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,727
Your husband, he will come to Paris?

344
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:23,452
And so shall I.

345
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:26,166
I refuse to be left behind.

346
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,233
You have courage.

347
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:32,379
I'm Viking.

348
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:40,212
Sailing south by south-east, we
come upon the mouth of the Seine.

349
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,501
The gateway to Paris.

350
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,652
Several rivers empty
themselves into the sea,

351
00:30:45,688 --> 00:30:48,605
and the reefs and mudflats are dangerous.

352
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:51,330
But here is the entrance.

353
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:55,195
The entrance to Paradise.

354
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:46,901
Floki!

355
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:51,240
- Floki, what are you doing?
- I have had a sign.

356
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,452
A sign for what?

357
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:54,521
A sign that blood must be spilled,

358
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:56,523
a sacrifice be made.

359
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,457
I have waited a long
time for such a sign.

360
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:04,781
And now my purpose is clear.

361
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:08,099
- What purpose?
- It is not for you to know.

362
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:10,754
Some men lust for women, Helga,

363
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,422
and others lust for gold,

364
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:14,107
but I only lust to please the gods.

365
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,243
You must tell me what
you are going to do.

366
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:19,129
I will only say that I
am going away for a while.

367
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:23,706
But that no one must see me leave and
you must never tell anyone of my going.

368
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,459
Do you swear?

369
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:28,060
Do you swear!

370
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,939
(CHOKING)

371
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,686
I didn't mean to hurt you.

372
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,618
No. I know.

373
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:48,758
But I think you mean to hurt someone.

374
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:56,783
(SINGING IN NATIVE TONGUE)

375
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,367
Bjorn.

376
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,517
I'm sorry I have disturbed you.

377
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,865
Don't be sorry.

378
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,902
I love my wife, Torvi.

379
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:58,111
(MOANING)

380

(DOG BARKING)

383
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,776
(CONTINUES PRAYING)

384
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:01,056
Floki.

385
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:03,683
Priest.

386
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:11,936
Lord, receive my soul.

387
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:20,883
(YELLING)

388
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,548
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

389
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:21,883
The things I do for you.

390
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:37,029
For such a little man,
Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.

391
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,271
This is as close to your
God as I can get you.

392
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:36,623
I never knew what a martyr was.

393
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:40,156
I still don't.

394
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:46,703
You were a brave man, Athelstan.

395
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:50,205
I always respected you for that.

396
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,881
You taught me so much.

397
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,582
You saw yourself as weak and conflicted,

398
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:05,113
but to me you were fearless
because you dared to question.

399
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:14,164
Why did you have to die?

400
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,008
We had so much more to talk about.

401
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:34,654
I always believed that death
is a fate far better than life,

402
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:38,264
for you will be reunited
with lost loved ones.

403
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:43,400
But we will never meet again, my friend,

404
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:49,520
for I have a feeling that your God might
object to me visiting you in heaven.

405
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:56,480
What am I to do now, hm?

406
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:01,467
I hate you for leaving me.

407
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,654
I ache from your loss.

408
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:14,409
There is nothing that can console me now.

409
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,347
I am changed.

410
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:20,716
So are you.

411
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:08,951
Forgive me, my friend,

412
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,929
not for what I have done.

413
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,423
But for what I am about to do.
