1
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,720
(Peter Arnett)
You may hear the bombs now.

2
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:41,723
Ifyou池e still with us,
you can hear the bombs now.

3
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:45,009
They are hitting the centre of the city.

4
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:46,411
(second reporter)
Now we can hear explosions...

5
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:50,770
..off in the distance
to the west of central Baghdad.

6
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,968
Clearly l 've never been there,...

7
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,840
..but this feels like
we 're in the centre of hell.

8
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,565
(radio chatter)

9
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,445
(President Bush) The 28 countries...

10
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:25,965
..with forces in the Gulf area...

11
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,805
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...

12
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,201
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...

13
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,611
..have no choice...

14
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,843
..but to drive Saddam
from Kuwait by force.

15
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,361
(Iraqi spokesman)
A great battle has been initiated.

16
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,647
The mother of all battles.

17
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:51,006
(Bush) Our objectives...

18
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:53,367
..in the Persian Gulf area clear,...

19
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:55,602
..our goals defined.

20
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:58,650
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait...

21
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,007
..completely, immediately,...

22
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,923
..and without condition.

23
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,527
(Bush) The liberation of Kuwait...

24
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,409
..has now entered a fllnal phase.

25
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,280
l have therefore directed
to use all forces available,...

26
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,203
..including ground forces,...

27
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:20,170
..to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait.

28
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,329
(Peter Arnett)
At this point it seems inevitable...

29
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:25,880
..that the ground war is only hours away.

30
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,281
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.

31
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:41,201
Don't ever for one minute
underestimate the enemy,...

32
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,169
..but remember, we're better soldiers.

33
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:47,689
We're fighting with better equipment,
we're better trained and a lot smarter.

34
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:51,321
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...

35
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,801
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.

36
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:54,768
Any questions?

37
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:58,009
Let's have a Little prayer.

38
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,162
Dear God, protect us...

39
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:03,289
..as we protect our country
we so dearly Love.

40
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:07,331
Keep us safe that we値l all get home
to see our famllies and our chlldren.

41
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,288
Amen.

42
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:09,680
Amen.

43
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,726
- Let's kill 'em all.
- (all) Hu-ah!

44
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:26,602
You all right, Boylar?

45
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:30,249
Hell, yeah.

46
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:33,046
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.

47
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,924
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:36,923
(engines starting)

49
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:58,485
Battle-carry Sabot.

50
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,009
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.

51
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,291
- Sabot loaded.
- Indexed.

52
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,088
Crew report.

53
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:10,685
- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.

54
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,161
Gunner ready to give Saddam
a new way to hurt.

55
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,128
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!

56
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,122
Hu-ah.

57
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,726
All right, Boylar?

58
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:18,881
Roger that.

59
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:21,884
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.

60
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:30,608
All Sabre elements, this is Sabre-6.

61
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:31,568
Move out.

62
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,809
(radio chatter)

63
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,968
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

64
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,405
No joy over here.

65
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,608
Permission to try an alternate route. Over.

66
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,809
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.

67
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,360
- (Nat) No surprises. Copy?
- Roger that.

68
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:13,524
I'm taking up the right flank.
I値l get back to you. Out.

69
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:21,009
Contact. I see flashes, 3,500 metres, sir.

70
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,526
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.

71
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:28,886
2,500 metres and closing, sir.

72
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,485
Ready to lase and blaze.

73
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,171
Contact, sir. He's in range.

74
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:35,561
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!

75
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:36,847
On the way!

76
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:42,961
Yeah! Yeah!

77
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,644
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

78
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:47,326
- Find me another target, Patella.
- Loaded!

79
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,084
- Identified.
- Fire.

80
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:56,963
Fire!

81
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,922
(Patella) Got him! We got him!

82
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,491
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.

83
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,528
We got enemy tangos retreating...

84
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,921
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.

85
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:17,243
Your pursuit should intercept
their retreat, grid 7-6-5.

86
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,890
Roger that, Liberty-6.

87
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,963
- Troops!
- Troops!

88
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,410
Cease fire! Cease fire!

89
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,445
(shouting in Arabic)

90
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:52,931
Come on! Come on!

91
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,371
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

92
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,601
Go ahead, Cougar-6.

93
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,967
I have got mines. Repeat, mines.

94
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,690
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

95
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,127
(Nat) Work your way to gridline Charlie.

96
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:08,966
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.

97
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:14,208
(shouting in Arabic)

98
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,085
Whoa! What the...

99
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,884
Oh, shit!

100
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,042
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.

101
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:37,851
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?

102
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,446
- I didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?

103
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:43,324
Who the hell is shooting at us?

104
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,845
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...

105
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,684
..retreating grid 7-6...

106
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,842
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.

107
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,160
Make it out, and fast!

108
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,132
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.

109
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,691
Nat, what's happening?

110
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:58,650
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

111
00:07:58,732 --> 00:07:59,687
This is Cougar-6.

112
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,445
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.

113
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,568
- Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.

114
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,370
Do you or do you not have a target?

115
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,248
I think so!

116
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,401
Gunner, Sabot, tank.

117
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:09,447
Identify! Up!

118
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,521
Fire!

119
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,085
He just fired, sir.

120
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,207
They're firing at us!

121
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,601
- Loader!
- Up, sir!

122
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:18,602
Fire!

123
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,086
Yeah! That's the one!

124
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:24,127
All right.

125
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,601
(radio) Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.

126
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,683
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!

127
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,091
I heard you! We... what?

128
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,571
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:33,847
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!

130
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,526
(radio) Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?

131
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:38,011
Patella, was that one of our tanks?

132
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,162
He fired, sir.

133
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,083
At us or at the T-72s?

134
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,082
I don't know.

135
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,402
At us or at the T-72s?

136
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,607
I don't know!

137
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,648
(Patella) Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

138
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:51,007
(radio) Colonel Serling, report status now.

139
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:52,491
(explosion)

140
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,130
They have range on us, sir.

141
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:57,203
Sir!

142
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,524
Oh, Christ, Colonel...

143
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,206
I gave the order to fire.

144
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,330
So with your thermal equipment,...

145
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:57,166
..confused by burning tanks
and smoke obscuring your visual ID,...

146
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:01,609
..you couldn't tell the difference
between the T-54 and the Abrams.

147
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,523
I believe that, uh, we...

148
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,001
l should have known the difference,...

149
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:09,289
..even with the night scope.

150
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,408
If we weren't under attack,...

151
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:16,361
But, under the circumstances,
there was no way to tell the difference.

152
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,605
Under the circumstances,...

153
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,001
..I suppose there was
no way to tell the difference, but...

154
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:24,810
There was no way to tell the difference.

155
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,086
Thank you, Colonel.

156
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:28,251
That's all we need.

157
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,563
(Patella) We池e almost browning out!

158
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:09,804
(Boylar) We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

159
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,120
Aah!

160
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,804
We just lost Cougar-6!

161
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:15,042
You just lit up a friendly!

162
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,121
(knock on door)

163
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,201
Colonel Serling?

164
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,202
Yes.

165
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,647
You OK? Can I get you something?

166
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,006
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.

167
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:25,050
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.

168
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,360
You got it.

169
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,489
We missed you and Meredith
at Banacek's party last night.

170
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:32,006
I'm too old to dance with you youngsters.

171
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,765
Meredith's not,
so tell her to come without you next time.

172
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:36,843
Oh, OK. I willdo just that...

173
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:37,842
..next time.

174
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:40,810
(telephone rings)

175
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:41,881
Colonel Serling.

176
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,964
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.

177
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,041
Yes.

178
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,805
Washington Post?

179
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,807
About?

180
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,205
Yes, I was there.

181
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,567
That's a matter of public record.

182
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,925
Well, thank you very much, Mr...

183
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:09,164
Gartner. Thank you, Mr Gartner,
but I have nothing to say.

184
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:10,241
No, sir.

185
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:12,561
No, sir!

186
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:16,247
Well, I値l do just that.

187
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,447
Right.

188
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,921
Colonel Serling's here, sir.

189
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:25,967
Ban.

190
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:29,727
I'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?

191
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,246
You and Sylvia have been together,
what, a month?

192
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:35,768
The way she danced with that marine,
it won't last another week.

193
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,763
It may be my last anniversary party.

194
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,485
Were you there for me?

195
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,210
What's up?

196
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:43,927
Hey, Nat.

197
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,764
I've got to talk to you.

198
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,967
How we holding, Ban?

199
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,280
Running late, sir.

200
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,567
- May I run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.

201
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:51,687
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...

202
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,682
Boylar?

203
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,684
Tom Boylar. He died in AI Bathra.

204
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:57,251
He'd been with me a long time.

205
00:12:57,332 --> 00:13:00,130
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.

206
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,362
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.

207
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:05,364
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.

208
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,682
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.

209
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:11,367
- He's a hero. That's all they want to know.
- Roger, but it's not just his parents.

210
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,567
We got a call...

211
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,563
..from the Washington Post.

212
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,880
A reporter named Gartner.

213
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:17,405
A reporter called you about AI Bathra?

214
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,607
You didn't talk?

215
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:19,602
Of course not.

216
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,411
Nobody 値l hang you out to dry.
I won't let 'em.

217
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,720
Did you listen to the tape, sir?

218
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:25,251
Colonel, the war's over.

219
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:29,245
You and I have been given
the great responsiblility and privllege...

220
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,165
..of investigating combat medals
for our army.

221
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,402
In other words, we've been passed over.

222
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,410
I prefer to think of it
as a second chance, Nat.

223
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,448
We understand each other?

224
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:40,487
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:41,971
OK.

226
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:46,409
The White House heard we're considering
the Medal of Honour for a chopper pllot...

227
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,005
..who saved some guys
on a downed Blackhawk.

228
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,970
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.

229
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,964
Which is why
you're taking over the inquiry.

230
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:57,647
We've got the rescued soldiers
in there for debriefing.

231
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:00,971
Attention.

232
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,003
Morning. Take your seats.

233
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,207
Everything in order?

234
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,729
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.

235
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:10,722
Morning, sir.

236
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,086
Good to see you again.

237
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,447
Could we get a picture
of you and the survivors?

238
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:16,011
No, thank you.

239
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:18,367
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.

240
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,603
- Morning.
- Morning.

241
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:26,480
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we値l be fine.

242
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,446
Nat Serling.

243
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,000
I値l, uh, get out ofyour way.

244
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,207
- Major.
- Sir.

245
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:37,489
25 February,
these men were part of a refuelling convoy.

246
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,928
Their Blackhawk was shot down
by an SA-7 west ofAI Kufan.

247
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:44,084
Five seconds after it locked on,
we were down.

248
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:47,847
- We didn't know what hit us.
- Our lines were surrounding them so fast,...

249
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:50,162
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.

250
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:55,326
Iraqi ground troops on the ridge above
kept them completely pinned down.

251
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,164
Did you discuss surrendering?

252
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:03,569
Yes, sir, we did.

253
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,847
We were all wounded one way or another.

254
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,969
We weren't trained
for that kind of situation, sir.

255
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:11,043
Don't have to make excuses to me.

256
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,531
Go on, Sam.

257
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,489
That's all we got so far, sir.

258
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,130
OK.

259
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:18,362
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:22,525
Well,
as ifthings weren't bad enough already,...

261
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,568
..one oftheir T-54s...

262
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,247
..joins the ragheads up on the ridge.

263
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,050
(tank engine)

264
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,806
Incoming! Get down!

265
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:42,643
That round
kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...

266
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:45,405
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.

267
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,722
So we figure that's it. We're dead.

268
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,450
But then we hear it.

269
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,648
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.

270
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:53,881
(helicopter)

271
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,166
Yeah!

272
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,128
Yeah!

273
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,843
(Serling) This Huey, didit take anyfire?

274
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:05,967
Right offthe bat.

275
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,886
But this time
when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.

276
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,610
Ground troops go for cover.

277
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,002
Then the Huey circles back over the tank...

278
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:17,209
That's when
they threw something overboard.

279
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:22,047
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- I couldn't tell, but the tank blew.

280
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,526
Oh!

281
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,840
Yeah!

282
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,490
Man, did it ever blow!

283
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:32,004
We, uh, we never did see
what knocked the Huey down.

284
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:36,730
(explosion)

285
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,803
We couldn't see the crash.

286
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,642
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.

287
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:46,088
The Huey was down below,
between us and the enemy,...

288
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,208
..so they caught most of it.

289
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,726
Any communications
between you and them?

290
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:53,121
No, sir. As I said, our radio was wasted.

291
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,521
Shouting just draws enemy fire.

292
00:16:55,612 --> 00:17:00,447
So the Iraqis,
they start to close in on the Huey...

293
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:01,965
..under cover fire,...

294
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,441
..and the Huey returns fire.

295
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:08,320
We figure it's all over,
and that's when we hear the rescue team.

296
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,845
Cobras, Hueys...

297
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,002
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.

298
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,768
I swear I never heard such a sweet sound.

299
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,808
But now the fuckers are...

300
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,451
I'm sorry, sir.

301
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:24,046
The Iraqis are letting loose with all they got.

302
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,885
- You were right the first time.
- (laughter)

303
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:31,204
Plus the Huey crew is stillbanging away.

304
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,045
We load our wounded aboard,...

305
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,329
..and that's when
somebody decided to leave the dead.

306
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,403
I guess it was the commander ofthe rescue.

307
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,402
Mm-hmm.

308
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,084
And this... Huey crew,...

309
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:46,051
.they, uh, they returned fire
all through the final rescue?

310
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,929
Yes, sir. I... I think so.

311
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:50,401
I couldn't see much, though.

312
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,402
I heard it.

313
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:54,962
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.

314
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:57,327
I heard it, too.

315
00:17:57,412 --> 00:18:02,440
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt
dropping napalm on the downed choppers.

316
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:05,569
I don't know if it was Captain Walden...

317
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,041
..but that Huey...

318
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,451
..saved our lives.

319
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,571
It sure sounds like it.

320
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,763
OK.

321
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:24,722
Thank you for your help.
I値l look over your statements.

322
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,961
Thank you, sir.

323
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,644
Thank you, Colonel.

324
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,801
That値l be all.

325
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,803
- Got something for me?
- I do, sir.

326
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,645
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.

327
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,485
You know I'm going to need
background on these guys.

328
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:40,565
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater
or an illegal allen or gays.

329
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,971
That値l blow it.

330
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,202
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.

331
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:48,410
It's not the Congressional Medal of Honour.
It's just the Medal of Honour.

332
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,607
Tell that to Congress.

333
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,728
If Captain Walden wins this medal...

334
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:54,121
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.

335
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:55,725
It's not a contest.

336
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,372
But that is perfect. That is why I'm here.

337
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:01,489
I'm not here
to get down your throat, make you crazy,...

338
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,528
..take these facts and twist them.

339
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:07,400
I just want to get these nuances out
of your head and to get it straight from you.

340
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,847
- It's a woman.
- You didn't know?

341
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,844
What did you think the hoopla was about?

342
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,730
Banacek's got information
on three of Walden's men.

343
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:20,010
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.

344
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:25,530
She's the first woman ever to be nominated
for a Medal of Honour for combat.

345
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:26,931
I mean, this is gold.

346
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,365
It's gold.

347
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,802
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...

348
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:33,087
..but I've got her Little daughter.

349
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,606
I got the President of the United States.

350
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,887
It's all set in the Rose Garden.

351
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:42,250
The President's going to lean down and
hang that ribbon round that pretty face.

352
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:46,450
There is not going to be
a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.

353
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,568
Excuse us.

354
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:57,209
OK, it was 5 to 1,...

355
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,044
..hook shot.

356
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,282
Me and her are cheerleaders.

357
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:04,648
- More mashed potatoes.
- (woman) Sorry, no more potatoes,...

358
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,371
..but how about some bread?

359
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:10,171
Aah!

360
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,890
(Boylar) Aah!

361
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,532
Daddy, can I have your mashed potatoes?

362
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,206
Daddy?

363
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,248
Sir?

364
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,169
Can I have your mashed potatoes?

365
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:25,123
M... Yeah. Sure.

366
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:26,645
Yeah,...

367
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,211
..soldier.

368
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,407
You want 'em all?

369
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,403
(telephone rings)

370
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:32,641
That enough?

371
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,122
More?

372
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:39,562
Hello?

373
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,529
Yes.

374
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:43,807
Uh, who is calling, please?

375
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,211
Just a minute.

376
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:47,967
It's for you.

377
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:48,962
Who is it?

378
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,485
Somebody Gartner.

379
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,842
Want some more peas?

380
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,127
Excuse me.

381
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,169
Where are you going?

382
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,367
Fort Hood.

383
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:52,491
General Hershberg's got me investigating
a Medal of Honour.

384
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,449
It's a woman.

385
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:56,045
Good for her.

386
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:58,201
Posthumous.

387
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,442
Too bad, but still good for her.

388
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,648
Mmm. Too bad.

389
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:14,368
You talk to the investigators today?

390
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:15,441
Right.

391
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:19,643
It's all right, isn't it, Nat?

392
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,411
Yeah. Fine.

393
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,690
How long are you gone for?

394
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,205
Couple of days.

395
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,968
Then why are you emptying
your sock drawer?

396
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:41,128
I may be gone more than a couple of days.

397
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:50,921
Nat.

398
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,127
Yes.

399
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,728
I don't know what's happening.

400
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,404
Everything's fine.

401
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,005
I'm handling it.

402
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:34,208
(Nat) Mr. Rady,
you were Captain Walden's copilot.

403
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,168
That's right.

404
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:39,006
(Nat) Can you tell me
what you remember about AlKufan?

405
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,171
I remember the earth.

406
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,089
I remember... llario's face.

407
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,649
I wish...

408
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,001
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.

409
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,322
We were just doing our job.

410
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,404
It's not Ren's fault I got hit.

411
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:13,246
She sure as hell saved the lives
of those guys on the Blackhawk.

412
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:17,289
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?

413
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,964
She was so butch.

414
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:20,405
Honey, shut up.

415
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,084
She was, you know.

416
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:28,324
One of those women
who want to be officers...

417
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:30,243
Annie, shut up.

418
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,127
She gave her life for those men.

419
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:40,691
She was a soldier.

420
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,647
There she blows.

421
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:08,245
(gunfire)

422
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,122
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!

423
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,767
- Kill that motherfucker, Bonfires!
- I may as well be pissing on him.

424
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,844
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!

425
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,762
- Making another pass, Ran?
- Yep.

426
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:34,049
No! We should go for altitude,
and call for support.

427
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,611
After we slow down that tank!

428
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:39,170
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!

429
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:42,403
AItameyer,
unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.

430
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,210
Get ready to push it overboard.

431
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,611
Push it overboard, ma'am?

432
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:47,648
llario, unhook the flare gun!

433
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:48,767
What the fuck...

434
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,410
Do it!

435
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:52,448
It's a bomb, asshole!

436
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:56,171
Target coming up!

437
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:57,641
Gimme more!

438
00:25:57,732 --> 00:25:58,926
Ready here!

439
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:01,047
- Got it?
- I got it!

440
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,367
- Tell us when you're there! He値l kick it!
- Allow for the speed of the craft!

441
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:10,285
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.

442
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:12,686
Pick your moment!

443
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:13,568
Now!

444
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:22,045
(cheering)

445
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,443
Oh, my God!

446
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,007
Oh!

447
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:33,640
Whoa! Shit!

448
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,723
Whoa! Oh, God!

449
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,928
Hang on, llario! Grab a hold of me!

450
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,411
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!

451
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:42,609
Hang on.
Come on, llario! Pull yourself up!

452
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,330
Do something!

453
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:47,688
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday!

454
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,286
llario,... call it in!

455
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:54,730
(Ilario)
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!

456
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,086
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

457
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,367
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!

458
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,521
This is Dustoff-3!

459
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:01,523
We're going down! We're going down!

460
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,409
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

461
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:04,402
We are going down!

462
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,882
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!

463
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:09,769
We're going down! Oh, my God...

464
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:23,201
That's it.

465
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:28,448
I woke up three days later
on a hospital ship.

466
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:30,124
Nearly bought it, that's sure.

467
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,611
(Larry King) When did you decide
the type of career in the Army you wanted?

468
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:42,004
(Schwarzkopf) That happened about
my third year at WestPoint when l was...

469
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,481
l could have gone in the Air Force.

470
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:46,449
l stood high enough in my class.

471
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:50,286
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.

472
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:53,045
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?

473
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,531
I know so.

474
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:56,045
Really. How?

475
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,487
I was with him in the Gulf.

476
00:27:58,572 --> 00:27:59,482
No shit.

477
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:02,530
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.

478
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:03,840
Hu-ah.

479
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,570
Hu-ah.

480
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:08,325
Once upon a time,
I was humping in the delta.

481
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,368
- With who?
- The 9 th.

482
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:13,091
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.

483
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:15,732
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.

484
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:19,600
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.
Tony Gartner, Washington Post.

485
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:25,161
They won't find any criminal culpability
in the AI Bathra incident.

486
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,765
You got nothing to worry about.

487
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,251
Those were my men.

488
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,482
I put that badly. I'm sorry.

489
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:34,201
Look, I went to Virginia
and spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Boylar.

490
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:37,646
You what?

491
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:41,691
I'm sorry, but they got a right
to know what happened to their son.

492
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,321
I値l take that.

493
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,443
(steam hissing)

494
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:12,125
(Serling) And this Huey crew, they, uh,
returned fire all through the final rescue?

495
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:13,645
(Chelli) Yes, sir. l think so.

496
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:14,960
l couldn',t see much.

497
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,691
(Thompson) l heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.

498
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:18,841
Not know A-K or M-60.

499
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,365
(Egan) l heard it, too.

500
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:23,967
(Chelli) Last thing we see
is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...

501
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,883
..on the two downed choppers.

502
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:31,608
(screaming)

503
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:35,481
Oh!

504
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:19,882
Sir!

505
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,005
All right, this is antifungal cream,...

506
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:29,971
..but to kill the athlete's foot when
you're in the shower, just piss on your feet.

507
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,121
That's disgusting.

508
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,248
What've you got for me today?

509
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:38,452
You want to get rid of the allergies to
bee pollen, then no caffeine, no chocolate.

510
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,092
Jesus. I give up coffee,
you can bury me now.

511
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,969
(chuckles)

512
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:46,522
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?

513
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,761
How many do you want?

514
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:49,251
I take eight every day.

515
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:50,208
Four's good.

516
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,250
- I need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?

517
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:57,928
I'm investigating the recommendation to
award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.

518
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:00,402
Rowtero?

519
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,402
Yeah?

520
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,845
Can you cover for me?

521
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,366
I'm going to go feed the cancer genes.

522
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:07,807
Do you really need to, uh, I mean...

523
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,365
It's fine.

524
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,124
Uh, what do you want to know?

525
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:19,527
How long were you with Captain Walden?

526
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,728
Um... over... over two years.

527
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,165
Quite a long time.

528
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:24,321
Yeah.

529
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:25,447
You were her medic.

530
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:27,011
Yes, sir.

531
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:30,085
I don't fly any more though.

532
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:33,890
Well, don't miss it, do you?

533
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:34,882
Never.

534
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:36,451
Never again.

535
00:31:36,532 --> 00:31:38,090
That's quite a habit you got.

536
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:40,890
Yeah, it's, uh...

537
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,486
..one of the few things I can call my own.

538
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:45,449
(laughs)

539
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:49,841
So...

540
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:52,241
..tell me what happened at AI Kufan.

541
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:04,563
See, I'd, uh...

542
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,565
..I'd never been in... in combat.

543
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:14,570
(tapping)

544
00:32:14,652 --> 00:32:16,404
(helicopter)

545
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:19,168
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

546
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:22,329
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3...

547
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,963
(groaning)

548
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:38,766
(moaning)

549
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:48,522
llario?

550
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,045
Yeah, I'm OK.

551
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:52,248
Rady's hurt.

552
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:53,765
Monfriez?

553
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,001
100%%%.

554
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:56,008
(crackling)

555
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:56,922
AItameyer?

556
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:58,451
Functioning.

557
00:32:58,532 --> 00:32:59,965
Fire in the hold!

558
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,444
(Ilario) Come here, buddy.

559
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:11,281
This is Dustoff-3.

560
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:12,168
Acknowledge.

561
00:33:12,252 --> 00:33:14,049
This is Dustoff-3.

562
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:15,042
Here. Come on.

563
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:16,531
This is Dustoff-3.

564
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:17,681
Come on.

565
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:20,491
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
AItameyer, how's that fire?

566
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:22,847
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.

567
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,285
(gunfire)

568
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:26,282
Enemy at the back door!

569
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:27,327
Come on! Come on!

570
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,970
Monfriez, get that saw working!

571
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,041
Come on! Get down!

572
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,084
I've got the M-16!

573
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:38,491
(gunfire)

574
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:39,561
llario?

575
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:40,846
He's bad. It's the lung.

576
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,763
We gotta get him out of here.

577
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,405
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?

578
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,289
Dead. So's the ADT.

579
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,409
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!

580
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:01,925
We might be here a while!

581
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:03,041
Captain!

582
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:10,090
You've seen me do this a million times.
You値l be fine.

583
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,367
Ammo?

584
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,807
I got this belt and three more boxes.

585
00:34:16,852 --> 00:34:20,561
OK, AItameyer,
rip out everything you can from the inside.

586
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,210
We're gonna make a perimeter.

587
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:24,487
Monfriez, cover us!

588
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:25,527
Go!

589
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,563
Where's our Kevlar?

590
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:34,641
I got one!

591
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:37,201
Well, put it on!

592
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:44,965
Unh. How's he doing?

593
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:46,326
He's the same.

594
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:47,765
I need a hook.

595
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,450
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.

596
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,601
Then we wait.

597
00:34:58,692 --> 00:34:59,681
For what?

598
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:01,251
For the good guys.

599
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,081
(laughing and shouting in Arabic)

600
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:08,283
You won't think it's so funny
when I nail your fucking ass!

601
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,448
Yeah, they were laughing.

602
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,567
You about, uh... You done?

603
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:20,445
So tell me what happened...

604
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,602
..during the night.

605
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:24,962
You were there. You saw the nights.

606
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:26,644
You know, just... it was black.

607
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:27,881
Just... black.

608
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:29,928
Tell me what happened that night.

609
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:33,608
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.

610
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:39,449
Um... it's not like
any of us were going to sleep anyway.

611
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,685
(Monfriez)
Head down, AItameyer. You might lose it.

612
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:47,447
You OK, Captain?

613
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,443
Shit in my eye.

614
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,284
Will our guys come tonight?

615
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:52,731
They値l be here.

616
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,325
Dust is blowing pretty bad.

617
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:56,687
I don't know
how much longer Rady can hang on.

618
00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:59,081
I can hear the rag heads
when you're not gabbing.

619
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:01,049
Then I'd suggest everybody just...

620
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:22,645
They're going away.

621
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:24,245
It was just a probe.

622
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:25,367
llario?

623
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:26,362
I'm OK.

624
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,362
AItameyer?

625
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,202
My ear!

626
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,247
Monfriez?

627
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:30,890
I... I took one.

628
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:35,762
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?

629
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,127
Unh...

630
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:39,009
Oh, shit.

631
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,730
Stay with Rady.

632
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,284
I like to come here.

633
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:52,285
It's not just the bikinis,
although they ain't bad.

634
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:54,886
It's these kids.

635
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,724
I like to watch them, you know?

636
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:59,690
My folks had this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

637
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:02,730
I still go there sometimes, watch 'em dive.

638
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:04,291
They do the damnedest things.

639
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,727
They never think about the consequences.

640
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:10,011
Imagine that.

641
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:13,129
Imagine not thinking
about the consequences?

642
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:14,884
Imagine that.

643
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:20,683
Are... are we done?

644
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,727
After the attack...

645
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:27,609
..during the night...

646
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,569
What?

647
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:31,085
I mean, we waited.

648
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:32,525
I... I still don't...

649
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:37,163
- I... I don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.

650
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:46,369
Well, Karen,...
the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.

651
00:37:47,572 --> 00:37:48,800
Ohh...

652
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,929
Unh...

653
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:53,889
Unh!

654
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:56,211
How many rounds left?

655
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,520
Just a sec.

656
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:58,965
How many rounds?

657
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,883
I just opened my last can of ammo.

658
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:02,963
Five mags for the M-16,...

659
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:04,087
..9-mll's full.

660
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:05,168
Mine's empty.

661
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,450
Fire a couple of rounds off.

662
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,444
- Let 'em know we're still allve.
- Roger that, Captain.

663
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,722
Now save your ammo
for something you can see.

664
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:23,050
During the course of the incident,
did she display any doubt, any fear...

665
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:26,442
..when she had to make
these life-and-death decisions?

666
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:28,284
No.

667
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,646
No. Never.

668
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:30,881
She just made 'em.

669
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:32,849
Just like that?

670
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:34,365
Just like that.

671
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:37,205
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.

672
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,806
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

673
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,644
We knew they were out there,...

674
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:43,324
..sneaking up on us.

675
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:46,927
But we also knew
at first light they were going to attack.

676
00:38:47,012 --> 00:38:50,846
I don't know why people think only
good things happen when the sun rises.

677
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,161
Incoming!

678
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,127
How many?

679
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:04,440
100. Maybe more.

680
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:06,011
Any good at hand-to-hand?

681
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:08,287
Wait till they get closer.

682
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,886
Make every round count!

683
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:15,371
- Shit!
- Quiet!

684
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:16,931
What in Christ for?

685
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:18,445
They know we're here!

686
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,409
Quiet! I hear something!

687
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,481
(helicopter)

688
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:25,563
Choppers!

689
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,202
Hey!

690
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,011
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

691
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,684
Go! Go!

692
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah! (laughs)

693
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:46,171
Let's get out of here!

694
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:47,241
llario, get the captain!

695
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,685
There's the rescue!

696
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,202
Help Rady!

697
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,850
Pick him up!

698
00:39:59,932 --> 00:40:01,604
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!

699
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,527
Come on! Let's move! Move it!

700
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,011
Gotta go! We gotta go!

701
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,128
Come back for me with a stretcher!

702
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:11,247
Go!

703
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,162
llario, let's get the fuck outta here!

704
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,643
Get the fuck outta here!

705
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:50,885
Aah!

706
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,451
Aah!

707
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:55,801
Medic!

708
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:59,604
Come on! Get him up!

709
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:05,448
Move! Come on! Let's go!

710
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,167
Where's Walden?

711
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:12,965
Captain Walden is dead.

712
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,006
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.

713
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:22,050
We have all the friends.
You're clear and hot.

714
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,692
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.

715
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,363
So...

716
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,807
Is she gonna get it?
Is she gonna get the medal?

717
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,248
Well, I sincerely hope so.

718
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,688
I just... I don't want to tell that story again.

719
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,888
Not one more time.

720
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,564
Yeah, I understand.

721
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:51,691
May I be excused?

722
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:53,808
Yes, you can.

723
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,725
Oh, one more thing I'm confused about.

724
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,685
This M-16...

725
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:01,882
What?

726
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,769
Did it run out of ammo?

727
00:42:05,452 --> 00:42:07,329
Uh, what did I say?

728
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,285
I don't remember. That's why I'm asking.

729
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:14,410
I guess, uh...

730
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:18,326
I guess it ran out of ammo
sometime during the morning.

731
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,164
Um...

732
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:21,844
Or, no, sometime during the night...

733
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:23,251
I don't know.

734
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,529
See, the Blackhawk crew
said they heard M-16 fire...

735
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,763
..during the rescue that morning.

736
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:31,724
Did they?

737
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,201
That's right.

738
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:35,884
Must've been wrong, then.

739
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:36,882
Them or you?

740
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,371
Who, them or you?

741
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:39,680
Oh, them. Them, yeah.

742
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:41,330
No, they must have been wrong.

743
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:43,290
OK.

744
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:45,361
OK.

745
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:48,485
What about the letter?

746
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:50,802
A what?

747
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:54,806
You and Walden traded letters to send home
in case anything happened to you.

748
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:55,961
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

749
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:57,326
So, who was hers to?

750
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,322
Her folks.

751
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,801
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.

752
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,530
Her folks, they're good people.

753
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,443
They got a farm out in Abllene.

754
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:08,366
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid
while we went out on exercises.

755
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,727
Yeah... Yeah.

756
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:13,402
OK.

757
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:15,210
Thank you, Specialist.

758
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,691
Thank you very much, sir.

759
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:24,289
I read somewhere...

760
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:27,489
..that if a child doesn't see a person die,...

761
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,530
..or dead, like in a casket,...

762
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:33,604
..that the person isn't really dead for them.

763
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,490
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

764
00:43:37,772 --> 00:43:38,761
Yes, ma'am.

765
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,889
It was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...

766
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:46,532
..for Karen to want to be a helicopter pilot?

767
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:48,728
I guess that's my fault.

768
00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:51,042
I took her to the fair when she was 11.

769
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:54,283
12 - 7th grade.

770
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:57,045
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.

771
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:59,123
Small one with a bubble up front.

772
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:01,680
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.

773
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,366
I bought Karen a ticket.

774
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:06,488
It was a short ride.

775
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:09,132
But when she came down...

776
00:44:09,212 --> 00:44:12,010
Well, I don't think
she ever came down, actually.

777
00:44:12,772 --> 00:44:17,323
She showed up
at the dinner table one day,...

778
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:20,245
..just after she finished TCU.

779
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:22,163
She's joined the Army.

780
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,004
She wants to fly helicopters.

781
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:25,605
She's real stubborn about it, too.

782
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:27,648
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.

783
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,529
So's Anne Marie here.

784
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:33,923
Come here, honey.

785
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:34,967
Excuse me.

786
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:43,131
Uh, the young men,...

787
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:46,921
..the ones that came to tell us about Karen...

788
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:49,480
..they were dressed just like you.

789
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:52,245
Oh, I see.

790
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:53,401
Major Teegarden,...

791
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:57,883
..her commanding officer, he came, too,
when he came back from the Gulf.

792
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:01,523
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.

793
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,803
Meant a lot to us...

794
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:06,769
..him coming to see us,...

795
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:09,525
..telling us in person how Karen died.

796
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:12,490
I lost men over there, too.

797
00:45:12,572 --> 00:45:14,005
I spoke to the major.

798
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,961
Everybody thought the world
of your daughter. So did Specialist llario.

799
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:22,687
It would sure help if I could see her letter.

800
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:24,603
I mean, if it's not too private.

801
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:25,647
Letter?

802
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,882
From llario?

803
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:32,330
I値l check my notes. Must be my mistake.

804
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:34,084
This her husband here?

805
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,005
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.

806
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:39,560
Her husband's up in Michigan.

807
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:44,089
He and Karen divorced
after only a year or so.

808
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:49,041
He never... well,... it was no picnic.

809
00:45:49,132 --> 00:45:51,043
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.

810
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:54,761
We'd have been thrilled
to have Anne Marie with us all the time,...

811
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,128
..what with the Army and all.

812
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:00,123
But Karen was a real good mom.

813
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:04,881
Never asked for help
unless she really needed it.

814
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:07,725
You can't imagine how hard it was for her...

815
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:11,122
..to go off and leave that Little girl
to fight in a war,...

816
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:14,409
..but it was important to Karen
to do her duty.

817
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:16,050
So she went.

818
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,723
(children's voices)

819
00:46:40,492 --> 00:46:43,404
You've been out here 20 minutes
since I spotted you.

820
00:46:43,492 --> 00:46:46,052
- How much longer before that?
- 15.

821
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,920
I see you, uh...

822
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,764
..got the new refrigerator.

823
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:58,243
Do you think the kids will understand
why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...

824
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:01,324
..instead of playing with them
in the front yard?

825
00:47:01,412 --> 00:47:04,006
Or at Fort Hood,
like you told me you were?

826
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:07,246
Are you back?

827
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:09,731
I'm in transit.

828
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:21,681
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...

829
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:25,447
..to figure out how to be an Army wife
without obliterating myself.

830
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:27,409
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

831
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:29,483
I know you did, Mer.

832
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,528
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...

833
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:35,001
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...

834
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:37,287
..if my husband wasn't in the Army any more.

835
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:39,647
The Army's my life, Mer.

836
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:42,364
And so are we.

837
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:47,527
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.

838
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:50,968
You just have to admit that you can't.

839
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:55,086
You have to want to be here with us,...

840
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,161
..that's all.

841
00:47:59,052 --> 00:48:00,804
We値l be here.

842
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:05,211
For a while.

843
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:17,681
Now go away.

844
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:21,569
If you're not going to stay,
I don't want the kids to see you.

845
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,532
- (tape) This M-16, did it run out of ammo?
- (buzzer)

846
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:32,443
(woman) Yes, sir?

847
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:36,445
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- l don',t remember...

848
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,445
Hey, Nat, what's up?

849
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:44,885
General.

850
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:48,408
It's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.

851
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,447
Discrepancies?

852
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:50,601
Yes, sir.

853
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:53,570
I knew those White House clowns
were up to something.

854
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:56,883
- If she doesn't deserve it, she won't get it.
- It's not Captain Walden, sir.

855
00:48:56,972 --> 00:49:00,521
It's some of the details of the stories
I'm getting from her crew.

856
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:03,968
- I don't know how significant...
- I'm drowning in paper here.

857
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:06,850
They're crawling all over my ass
for combat assessments,...

858
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:11,960
Sir, I just wanted to let you know this is
not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.

859
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:16,409
Now, this specialist, uh, llario,
there's something funny about his story.

860
00:49:16,492 --> 00:49:19,882
We're not giving the medal to llario.
We're giving it to Walden.

861
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:20,927
Roger.

862
00:49:21,012 --> 00:49:22,365
Splendid. Move forward.

863
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:26,445
OK. The discrepancies specifically
relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...

864
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:30,047
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses
ever agree on every detail.

865
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:32,043
You know that as well as I do.

866
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:33,804
When do we get that report?

867
00:49:33,892 --> 00:49:35,723
I want the White House off my back.

868
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:37,131
A few days, sir.

869
00:49:37,212 --> 00:49:41,842
You agree that this report should be
as detailed and accurate as possible?

870
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,168
Which means exactly what, Colonel?

871
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:47,562
Which means exactly what I said, sir.

872
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,607
(knock on door)

873
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:54,163
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy
of Colonel Serling's AI Bathra deposition.

874
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:57,562
The investigator seemed to have
misplaced the last one.

875
00:49:57,652 --> 00:49:59,051
Rise above.

876
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:00,690
This will all be over soon.

877
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:05,005
Will there be
a public statement of the facts...

878
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:06,889
..when the investigation is over, sir?

879
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:11,170
There's been a decision not to release
any findings until every case...

880
00:50:11,252 --> 00:50:13,083
..has been thoroughly reviewed.

881
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:16,084
Well, how long do you imagine
that will be, sir?

882
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:21,883
I mean, next time I see Lieutenant Boylar's
parents, I'd like to tell them the whole truth.

883
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:26,329
You know how many grieving parents
I had to deal with during Vietnam?

884
00:50:26,412 --> 00:50:27,401
This is not Vietnam.

885
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,609
Lieutenant Boylar's tank
was hit by uranium-depleted shells.

886
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:34,002
We're the only country
in the world that uses them.

887
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:37,971
We got reporters from the Washington Post
looking for the truth,...

888
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:40,486
..and the only person that knows it
can't say it...

889
00:50:40,572 --> 00:50:44,406
..because these investigators
are dragging their backsides!

890
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:48,565
Someone has got to be
accountable for this,... sir.

891
00:50:58,412 --> 00:50:59,731
Take a seat.

892
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:14,887
Nat, I'm going to give you
all the rope in the world.

893
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,122
First you imply I'm not interested...

894
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:19,407
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.

895
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:23,565
Now you're suggesting there must be
some cover-up going on about AI Bathra.

896
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:25,483
So how do you want me to respond?

897
00:51:25,572 --> 00:51:27,449
As your commanding officer,...

898
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:31,366
..or as your friend
who nursed you, pushed promotions,...

899
00:51:31,452 --> 00:51:34,683
..and fucking burped your kids
at their baptisms?

900
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,048
Just how should I respond?

901
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:40,931
I'm sorry, sir.

902
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,202
I should hope by God you would be.

903
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:46,724
Now,...

904
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,487
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...

905
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:52,926
..I've been there.

906
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:55,401
Well, this...

907
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:57,323
..whole mess...

908
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:01,491
It's my ass on the line
right there beside yours.

909
00:52:01,572 --> 00:52:05,008
I can feel the chilling the air
as well as you can.

910
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,889
Yes, sir.

911
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,406
And I know about the drinking.

912
00:52:09,572 --> 00:52:12,450
And if I have to write you up,...

913
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:15,000
..it値l just be one more bite out of your record.

914
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:16,241
Clean it up.

915
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:18,721
Get yourself in a programme.

916
00:52:18,812 --> 00:52:20,609
I値l be looking for that report.

917
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:22,171
Soon.

918
00:52:36,372 --> 00:52:39,921
- (Nat) Yes, this is the Serling residence.
- (Mer) We池e nothing right now...

919
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:44,722
- But at the tone, leave a message and...
- (kids) We値l call you when we get home.

920
00:52:44,812 --> 00:52:46,291
(laughter)

921
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,771
(beep)

922
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:07,368
(gunfire)

923
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:09,090
You better get your head into this!

924
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:12,847
I'm going to drop you
from this programme like a hot rock!

925
00:53:12,932 --> 00:53:14,411
You better hurry up!

926
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:19,044
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
I値l get him for you.

927
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:20,042
Thank you.

928
00:53:20,132 --> 00:53:23,363
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?

929
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:25,727
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?

930
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:27,404
You see that man?

931
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:30,882
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.

932
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:33,281
You never leave a man behind.

933
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:36,569
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.

934
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,326
(Nat) You were in Panama?

935
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:39,970
Yes, sir.

936
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,280
Were you there, sir?

937
00:53:41,372 --> 00:53:42,851
Yes, I was.

938
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:45,685
And you were also in Desert Storm?

939
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:47,251
Roger that, sir.

940
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,160
How'd you come to be
on Captain Walden's chopper?

941
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:53,766
I used to hang around the medivac unit.

942
00:53:53,852 --> 00:53:55,365
Wanted to be a medic?

943
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:58,285
Wanted to hump a nurse once.
That count, sir?

944
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:01,320
See, I play poker.

945
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:05,121
Those medivac folks, between missions,
had a lot of time on their hands.

946
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:06,964
Want to know a poker secret, sir?

947
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:07,962
Always.

948
00:54:09,052 --> 00:54:12,567
The people you play against,
find out what they're interested in.

949
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:14,005
Pretend you're interested.

950
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:18,563
They start running off at the mouth,
don't pay attention to their cards.

951
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:22,281
Medevac folks,
they Love to talk about their choppers.

952
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:26,170
Paid for this baby.

953
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:35,204
So, talk to me about, um,...

954
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,362
..25 February.

955
00:54:37,452 --> 00:54:39,807
25 February? Yes, sir.

956
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:43,651
I had some phys rehab time.

957
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:45,211
Got into boxing.

958
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:46,486
Want a soda pop?

959
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:48,085
No, sir. No, I'm good.

960
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:50,645
25 February.

961
00:54:50,732 --> 00:54:52,529
So, 25 February...

962
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:57,088
Major, uh, what's his butt? Garden party...

963
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,730
Teegarden. Major Teegarden.

964
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:02,441
Right. Asked me to go with Walden,
said she might need guns,...

965
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,250
..so I said, you know, OK, why not?

966
00:55:04,332 --> 00:55:08,245
Grabbed me a saw, bungeed one of
the Huey doorways and away we went.

967
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:10,884
Yeah.

968
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:12,121
And, uh...

969
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:13,884
..the captain was a big hero...

970
00:55:14,972 --> 00:55:17,532
She died tragically in the desert,
and Major...

971
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:18,806
- Teegarden.
- Teegarden...

972
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:21,326
..wants her to get the Medal of Honour,
so she値l get it.

973
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,289
When did the M-16 ammo run out?

974
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:25,642
What?

975
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:27,131
M-16 ammo?

976
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:30,568
Blackhawk crew said
they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.

977
00:55:30,652 --> 00:55:32,244
When did it run out?

978
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:35,286
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

979
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,282
You wouldn't?

980
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:40,123
As... as I recall, and, uh...

981
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,645
..I'm not really sure,...

982
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:44,610
..but the M-16 ammo
ran out first thing in the morning.

983
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:47,331
First thing in the morning.
But you're not really sure?

984
00:55:49,492 --> 00:55:50,527
Now I'm confused.

985
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:53,365
- You were there, weren't you?
- Affirmative, sir.

986
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,204
But I was on the saw.

987
00:55:57,332 --> 00:55:58,765
AItameyer would know, sir.

988
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,841
AItameyer?

989
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:03,607
- Yes, sir. He was manning the M-16.
- Oh, I see. OK.

990
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,204
OK, let's back up, then.

991
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,407
Um,...

992
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,722
..when that tank fired on your chopper,...

993
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,325
..you said that, uh...

994
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:16,246
..''You should go for altitude
and call for support'', right?

995
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:18,521
Sir?

996
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,330
You knew this wasn't Panama.

997
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:23,290
Men were going to die,
so you wanted to get out, right?

998
00:56:23,372 --> 00:56:25,681
Wh... who told you that, sir?
Tea Party? llario?

999
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:28,366
It doesn't matter who told me that.
You tell me.

1000
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,365
You don't want to know
what happened out there, sir.

1001
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:39,851
Yes, I do.

1002
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:42,492
You just want me to sign off on the story...

1003
00:56:42,572 --> 00:56:45,644
..so you can finish your job
and the lady can get her medal.

1004
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,364
Are you refusing to tell me?

1005
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:52,250
Colonel, you know
what to do if you get a hang fire...

1006
00:56:52,332 --> 00:56:55,244
..when you pull the trigger
and the round doesn't go off?

1007
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:59,530
You wait, with your weapon pointed in
a safe direction, cos the primer burns slow.

1008
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:02,172
You open your weapon
and take the round out,...

1009
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,651
..it blows up in your face.

1010
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:07,407
Leave this round in the chamber, Colonel.

1011
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:14,202
I work at the Pentagon, Sergeant,...

1012
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:17,011
..so I admit I'm a Little slow on the uptake.

1013
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:19,765
Otherwise I'd say you just threatened me.

1014
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,928
Did you just threaten me, soldier?

1015
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:28,085
Because, if you did, let me respond to you.

1016
00:57:33,572 --> 00:57:35,528
Let me respond to you this way.

1017
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:40,722
I'm an officer, and therefore,
by proclamation, a gentleman,...

1018
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:42,291
..but don't abuse that, son.

1019
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:46,731
Don't get in my cross hairs,
because I値l have no compunction...

1020
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:49,485
..about getting up to my neck in your ass,
understand?

1021
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,003
She was afraid, Colonel.

1022
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:58,767
That's the bottom line on Captain Walden.
She was a fucking coward, sir.

1023
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:04,684
Get me around so I can fire!

1024
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:12,889
- Go back. Let me have another shot!
- I don't know.

1025
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:15,167
I'm going for altitude, call for support.

1026
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:16,128
There's no time!

1027
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:19,045
All right, one more!

1028
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:22,090
But then I'm calling for support.

1029
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:25,687
Unhook the aux fuel cells!
Prepare to toss them overboard.

1030
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,125
llario, get me the flare gun.

1031
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,964
So it was your idea to use the fuel cell?

1032
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,121
Yeah.

1033
00:58:30,212 --> 00:58:31,645
Me, Rady, somebody.

1034
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:35,520
Adrenaline was pumping. You can't
expect me to remember everything.

1035
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:36,761
Try.

1036
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:40,051
Now!

1037
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:45,483
- Yay!
- Whoo!

1038
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:48,881
So what happened during the night?

1039
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:50,485
Walden and llario,...

1040
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,564
..they wouldn't shut up about being rescued.

1041
00:58:55,212 --> 00:58:57,487
Like the Army had nothing else to do.

1042
00:58:57,572 --> 00:58:59,483
Dust is blowing hard out there.

1043
00:58:59,572 --> 00:59:03,326
- Think they値l find us tonight?
- AWACS lost us when the ADT got hit.

1044
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:05,926
SOP is for search and rescue
to begin looking...

1045
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:07,889
Christ, Captain, are you crying?

1046
00:59:07,972 --> 00:59:09,530
It's OK. It's just tension.

1047
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,251
Hey, you're going to be OK, OK?

1048
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:14,084
They値l find us. It値l be OK.

1049
00:59:14,172 --> 00:59:17,881
I can hear the rag heads moving,
as soon as you girls stop gabbing.

1050
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,051
They're going away.

1051
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:36,451
It was just a probe.

1052
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:38,727
- Shit!
- I'm OK.

1053
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,564
- (Monfriez) I took one.
- How's Rady?

1054
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:43,120
Hanging in. Captain?

1055
00:59:44,212 --> 00:59:46,680
Ah! Oh!

1056
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,203
So the rest of the night
went without incident?

1057
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:55,007
Yeah.

1058
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,923
Wasn't that enough for one night?

1059
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,968
You want to continue this tomorrow?

1060
01:00:02,372 --> 01:00:04,442
I don't get emotional about this shit.

1061
01:00:04,532 --> 01:00:06,090
I've been there, you know?

1062
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:09,363
OK. Go on.

1063
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:12,410
Well, after the firefight, we argued mainly.

1064
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:17,088
llario was freaked out by the dark, and
Walden wanted to surrender at first light.

1065
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:21,640
She was a wreck, kept asking about
the ammo, worrying we didn't have enough.

1066
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,529
I knew they'd attack at dawn.

1067
01:00:25,412 --> 01:00:28,324
So what happened during the evacuation?

1068
01:00:29,812 --> 01:00:31,325
Evacuation.

1069
01:00:32,852 --> 01:00:34,046
(gunfire)

1070
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:36,971
All right, let's go.

1071
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:38,326
There's the rescue.

1072
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:44,247
AItameyer, give me a hand with Rady.

1073
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,211
- Come on, Captain!
- Ow!

1074
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:48,202
Come on!

1075
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,327
- No! Don't move me!
- Get away!

1076
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,481
Suck it up!

1077
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:52,802
I got you covered! Ready?

1078
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,441
Go! Go! Go!

1079
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:01,080
- llario, move!
- Not without the Captain!

1080
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:02,446
I値l get her.

1081
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,762
No! I'm not leaving!

1082
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:07,241
I'm not leaving! It's not safe!

1083
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:10,051
They're taking fire!
The choppers are waiting!

1084
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:11,690
No! No! No!

1085
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:23,410
Get the fuck outta here!

1086
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,365
Come on!

1087
01:01:29,012 --> 01:01:30,365
She fired at you?

1088
01:01:30,452 --> 01:01:31,726
Near us, yeah.

1089
01:01:31,812 --> 01:01:36,124
Then why did you lie to the investigators
about how she performed?

1090
01:01:37,852 --> 01:01:41,561
They'd already put together
their own bullshit version of the story...

1091
01:01:41,652 --> 01:01:45,850
..before they talked to me. I told them
what they wanted to hear. We all did.

1092
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:51,404
But that's the truth, so forget about the
medal, or leave it as it is. I don't give a fuck.

1093
01:01:51,492 --> 01:01:55,770
So nobody from your Huey crew
fired an M-16 any time during the rescue?

1094
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:57,410
That's affirmed, sir.

1095
01:01:57,492 --> 01:01:58,811
Monfriez, you ready?

1096
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,571
You sure about that?

1097
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:06,212
That's affirmative, sir.

1098
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,850
We had no ammo.

1099
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:14,691
So how about it, Colonel?

1100
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,649
Want to go a few rounds?

1101
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:18,768
Are you threatening me, soldier?

1102
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:21,161
- Where's your brain bucket?
- I don't need it.

1103
01:02:21,252 --> 01:02:22,844
Don't step in here without one.

1104
01:02:22,932 --> 01:02:27,528
I have to tell you again,
you won't have a head to stick it on.

1105
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:30,331
Come on, Jersey. Right here.

1106
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:31,731
Let's see what you got.

1107
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:33,609
You got nothing, man.

1108
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:36,125
Come on!

1109
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:45,887
(ringing tone)

1110
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,088
- (Meredith) Hello.
- Hello? Baby?

1111
01:02:48,172 --> 01:02:49,446
How're you doing?

1112
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,170
Hi.

1113
01:02:54,252 --> 01:02:55,924
How',s it going?

1114
01:02:56,012 --> 01:02:57,331
Outstanding.

1115
01:02:58,532 --> 01:02:59,681
Outstanding.

1116
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:02,366
I was calling, I wondered...

1117
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:03,680
What... what kind of...

1118
01:03:03,772 --> 01:03:05,649
What size T-shirts the kids wear?

1119
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:07,688
I want to get the kids some T-shirts.

1120
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,807
You know their sizes as well as I do.

1121
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:13,723
Are you OK?

1122
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:16,121
Nat?

1123
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:20,772
I got a pint of, um...

1124
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:22,968
..Scotch here in a paper bag.

1125
01:03:24,652 --> 01:03:26,483
I don't want to drink any of it.

1126
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:30,562
Can you tell me why you need it?

1127
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:39,246
Want me to prattle on for a minute?
I can do that.

1128
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:40,242
(Nat) Please.

1129
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:43,085
OK. Um...

1130
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:44,605
The new refrigerator doesn't work.

1131
01:03:44,692 --> 01:03:46,922
The light doesn't come on
when you open the door.

1132
01:03:47,012 --> 01:03:51,881
I had to drive all the way
over to Wagner, 12 blocks,...

1133
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:54,770
..just so that Brian could practice
riding his bike.

1134
01:03:54,852 --> 01:03:57,082
He's afraid of falling in front of his friends.

1135
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:02,288
He refuses to let anyone
see him riding with training wheels.

1136
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:07,725
They've both taken to sleeping in our bed
since you left.

1137
01:04:09,052 --> 01:04:11,407
It's like sleeping between two tornadoes.

1138
01:04:11,492 --> 01:04:13,164
I better go, baby.

1139
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:14,605
Don Boylar called.

1140
01:04:14,692 --> 01:04:16,045
Jesus.

1141
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:18,526
I better go.

1142
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:21,046
- Nat, talk to me.
- I can't.

1143
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:22,611
- Why not?
- I can't!

1144
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,683
Bullshit. Bull! Talk to me!

1145
01:04:27,052 --> 01:04:28,644
(dialing tone)

1146
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,605
Oh, Christ.

1147
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:35,882
Colonel?

1148
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,371
Colonel?

1149
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:47,648
Can we get some coffee, please?

1150
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:53,245
You're not a happy man.

1151
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:56,921
A woman? The Army?

1152
01:04:57,012 --> 01:04:58,081
AI Bathra?

1153
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:11,164
Talk to me.

1154
01:05:11,252 --> 01:05:12,970
Off the record, if you want.

1155
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:14,405
Way, way off the record.

1156
01:05:14,492 --> 01:05:15,925
Rangers' honour.

1157
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,321
Serling,...

1158
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,868
How long you been back?

1159
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,989
Six months.

1160
01:05:26,075 --> 01:05:28,543
And you...
you've been in the service how long?

1161
01:05:28,635 --> 01:05:29,863
17 years.

1162
01:05:29,955 --> 01:05:33,152
Ah, they got me running this inquiry...

1163
01:05:33,235 --> 01:05:35,908
..on this girl pilot.

1164
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:37,428
Captain Karen Walden.

1165
01:05:37,515 --> 01:05:41,793
She値l be the first woman
to get the Medal of Honour for combat.

1166
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:42,671
Oh, boy.

1167
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:46,191
And everybody in the beltway
wants a piece of this one, right?

1168
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:49,990
I just want to get something clear.

1169
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:52,635
This time, just want somebody to be a hero.

1170
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,672
I want to get something right.

1171
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:56,665
Yeah.

1172
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:59,223
Cos AI Bathra, you know...

1173
01:06:04,315 --> 01:06:05,225
AI Bathra.

1174
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:07,226
You talked to Boylar's parents?

1175
01:06:07,315 --> 01:06:08,384
Yeah.

1176
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:09,988
Do they know?

1177
01:06:10,955 --> 01:06:13,185
They heard from a few of his friends.

1178
01:06:13,275 --> 01:06:16,233
Aw, Jesus...

1179
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:17,304
You know...

1180
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,912
They told Boylar's parents
he died from enemy fire.

1181
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:23,713
I told them that.

1182
01:06:23,795 --> 01:06:26,946
I carried the message,
went to the funeral,...

1183
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:29,390
..watched his mother cry her eyes out.

1184
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:32,194
I stood there
and looked his father in the eye...

1185
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:35,631
..and told him
his son died brave under fire.

1186
01:06:35,715 --> 01:06:38,912
And I was the one
who gave the order to fire.

1187
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,474
I did it.

1188
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:43,433
Then the Army gave me a medal...

1189
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:45,665
..for bravery and valour.

1190
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:49,709
Then they buried me...

1191
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:51,114
..in medals.

1192
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:54,506
Got a sense of humour, don't they?

1193
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,307
Yeah.

1194
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:05,185
Can't remember anything else
except being in the Army.

1195
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:10,230
Either being in it or wanting to be in it.

1196
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:14,868
It's all I know.

1197
01:07:20,315 --> 01:07:21,953
Look, you need to sleep.

1198
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:23,263
You call me any time.

1199
01:07:23,355 --> 01:07:27,268
Anything you want to say about anything,
on or off the record.

1200
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:30,950
I'm going to leave you alone for a while.

1201
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:41,750
llario. Are you saying you can't find him,
or that he's absent without leave?

1202
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:43,632
(man) Sir, that痴 an l... l...

1203
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:45,467
That's right, specialist llario.

1204
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:47,432
Well, we contacted the MPs, sir...

1205
01:07:47,515 --> 01:07:49,506
Roger.

1206
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:51,074
Roger that.

1207
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:52,953
Thank you.

1208
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:57,506
Did she display fear when she had
to make these life-and-death decisions?

1209
01:07:57,595 --> 01:08:00,063
(llario) No, never.

1210
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:03,192
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.

1211
01:08:03,275 --> 01:08:05,152
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

1212
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:09,228
And she... you know, she put up
with a lot of shit to become an officer.

1213
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:13,634
Had to work twice as hard
as everybody else, be twice as good.

1214
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:17,071
She壇 never let the guard down,
show any sign of weakness.

1215
01:08:17,155 --> 01:08:20,227
But she was tough. She could handle it.

1216
01:08:20,315 --> 01:08:23,591
So, ladies and gentlemen,
what I have to say to you in closing...

1217
01:08:23,675 --> 01:08:25,427
..is to go forth,...

1218
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:27,631
..to command wisely,...

1219
01:08:27,715 --> 01:08:29,433
..to advise prudently,...

1220
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:31,551
..to protect with vigilance...

1221
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:33,990
..and to judge with care.

1222
01:08:34,075 --> 01:08:36,305
And above all,...

1223
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:39,751
..to defend with all your heart,
all your soul...

1224
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:41,712
..and all your courage...

1225
01:08:41,795 --> 01:08:45,674
..the lives of the men and women
under your command,...

1226
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,950
..and the United States of America.

1227
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:53,590
Are you now saying
you値l report against her getting the medal?

1228
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:57,270
As I explained to the White House,
there should be a further investigation...

1229
01:08:57,355 --> 01:08:58,993
..before we move forward.
The discrepancies...

1230
01:08:59,075 --> 01:09:01,873
Another matter completely.
Write up a second report.

1231
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:03,434
That's my point, sir!

1232
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,790
llario's disappeared. Altameyer's missing.

1233
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,343
- Who?
- AItameyer, sir. Walden's crew chief.

1234
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:10,266
VA hospital's transferred him out
three weeks ago.

1235
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,913
Paperwork's missing.

1236
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:13,394
Doesn't he have any family?

1237
01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:14,430
Negative.

1238
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:16,187
Fucking VA. We can't wait, Nat.

1239
01:09:16,275 --> 01:09:19,392
You cannot imagine
the kind of heat I'm getting on this.

1240
01:09:19,475 --> 01:09:20,954
Everybody wants it.

1241
01:09:21,035 --> 01:09:25,904
Senators, congressmen, one shiny
piece of something for people to believe in.

1242
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:28,263
Whole episode.

1243
01:09:28,355 --> 01:09:29,868
Walden or AI Bathra?

1244
01:09:29,955 --> 01:09:31,434
Both, damn it, both.

1245
01:09:32,195 --> 01:09:33,423
Submit your report today.

1246
01:09:33,555 --> 01:09:34,544
I'm sorry, sir.

1247
01:09:36,435 --> 01:09:39,029
I won't put my name
on an incomplete report.

1248
01:09:39,115 --> 01:09:42,790
May I remind you who recommended you
for this when no-one else 'd touch you?

1249
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:45,708
You saying you chose me
because I wouldn't rock the boat?

1250
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:49,344
Dereliction of duty,
drunk and disorderly, conduct unbecoming.

1251
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,914
At best, a dishonorable discharge.

1252
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:53,953
At worst, AI Bathra gives us
plenty of grounds, if we want 'em.

1253
01:09:54,035 --> 01:09:56,868
At least somebody has finally said it.

1254
01:09:56,955 --> 01:10:00,789
Nat, don't do this. I could give you
a direct order to submit your report.

1255
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,103
Yes, you could.

1256
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:12,629
Put Hillerman back on the Walden file!

1257
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:15,906
I handed this to you, Nat, as a way back.

1258
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:18,111
You could've had one hell of a career.

1259
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,790
And you give Meredith my best.

1260
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,945
Tell her I didn't have any choice.

1261
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:27,425
I'm going to finish this report.

1262
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,994
On my own, if I have to.

1263
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:32,306
I'm going to get this one right.

1264
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:44,943
You want one?

1265
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:46,468
No, thank you.

1266
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:51,675
Why is it people never want to eat
when they got something important to say?

1267
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:54,030
I always want to eat.

1268
01:10:57,115 --> 01:10:59,868
Need you to help me find somebody.

1269
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,468
You want my help?

1270
01:11:01,555 --> 01:11:04,308
Yeah.
Name's AItameyer. Steven AItameyer.

1271
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:09,268
He was the crew chief on the medevac
chopper, piloted by Karen Walden.

1272
01:11:09,355 --> 01:11:12,711
- One supposed to get a Medal of Honour?
- The very one.

1273
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:17,186
- The Army's usually tidy about its people.
- Yeah, usually, but not this time.

1274
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:21,944
First he demobbed,
then they had him in a VA hospital.

1275
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:25,027
They transferred him.
Now no-one can find him.

1276
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:26,787
Why do you need me?

1277
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,389
Can't someone in the Pentagon help?

1278
01:11:29,475 --> 01:11:31,193
I'm out of the loop.

1279
01:11:31,275 --> 01:11:33,072
Somebody pissed at you?

1280
01:11:35,515 --> 01:11:38,188
- I'm out of the loop.
- Somebody important?

1281
01:11:38,275 --> 01:11:40,789
- You want to help me or not?
- Hey, who called who here?

1282
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:44,828
Yeah, sure, I値l help.

1283
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:46,906
Just tell me why I'm doing it.

1284
01:11:46,995 --> 01:11:50,305
When you go after stories,
you want them to be right, yes?

1285
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:51,305
Yeah.

1286
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:52,384
So do I.

1287
01:11:53,395 --> 01:11:54,908
OK.

1288
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:58,465
So, I help you find this AItameyer,...

1289
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:00,864
..and in return...?

1290
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:08,954
There's a tape.

1291
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:12,504
Sweet Jesus. There's always a tape.

1292
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,551
- D'you want to hear this?
- Yeah.

1293
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:16,114
Yeah, go on.

1294
01:12:16,235 --> 01:12:21,548
There's a tape of all communications
between our tanks that night in AI Bathra.

1295
01:12:21,835 --> 01:12:24,395
Are they trying to make it disappear?

1296
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:28,434
I don't think so, but they're not
advertising its existence, either.

1297
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:29,743
The Army and its image.

1298
01:12:34,075 --> 01:12:36,589
Where do I reach you
when I find this AItameyer?

1299
01:12:36,755 --> 01:12:38,108
The Bethesda Arms.

1300
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:39,105
A motel?

1301
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:42,949
- Bet everything's great in your life.
- Outstanding.

1302
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:44,548
Serling,...

1303
01:12:44,635 --> 01:12:46,068
..eat something.

1304
01:12:46,155 --> 01:12:47,793
You look awful.

1305
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:11,711
(Karen) # Make me an angel

1306
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:15,265
# Flies from Montgomery

1307
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:19,473
# Make me a poster

1308
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:22,752
# From an old rodeo

1309
01:13:23,955 --> 01:13:26,708
# Just give me one thing

1310
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:31,510
# That I can hold on to

1311
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:36,185
# To believe in this living

1312
01:13:36,275 --> 01:13:38,106
# It's just a...

1313
01:13:38,195 --> 01:13:41,187
# Hard way to go

1314
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:45,746
# To believe in this living

1315
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:46,984
# It's just a...

1316
01:13:48,355 --> 01:13:50,550
# Hard way

1317
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,593
# To go

1318
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:55,950
(telephone rings)

1319
01:14:01,435 --> 01:14:02,345
Hello.

1320
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:03,834
(Gartner) Found Altameyer.

1321
01:14:04,115 --> 01:14:05,150
Got any complaints?

1322
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:06,384
Excuse me?

1323
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,625
Rashes, fatigue, bleeding gums,...

1324
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:11,912
..muscle and joint pain,
loss of weight, loss of appetite,...

1325
01:14:11,995 --> 01:14:16,307
..insomnia, reactions to bright sunlight.
You name it, we're seeing it.

1326
01:14:16,395 --> 01:14:18,192
I drink too much. Does that count?

1327
01:14:18,275 --> 01:14:19,947
Hell, we all drink too much.

1328
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:21,514
Here he is.

1329
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:24,506
AItameyer, you want a shave?

1330
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,355
Gentleman here to see you.
You want a shave?

1331
01:14:28,435 --> 01:14:29,868
What's wrong with him?

1332
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:32,185
Abdominal cancer.
That's what's killing him.

1333
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,311
There's many things wrong with him.

1334
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:37,353
He's never awake very long
with all the pain.

1335
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:39,107
I値l leave you two, then.

1336
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:40,389
Thank you.

1337
01:14:42,715 --> 01:14:44,228
How you doing, Steven?

1338
01:14:45,555 --> 01:14:46,988
I'm Colonel Serling.

1339
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,394
Nat Serling.

1340
01:14:48,475 --> 01:14:52,388
I want to talk to you
about Captain Karen Walden.

1341
01:14:54,235 --> 01:14:57,147
They want to give her
the Medal of Honour,...

1342
01:14:57,235 --> 01:15:00,830
..and I know
that you were there in AI Kufan with her.

1343
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:02,234
Roger?

1344
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:06,232
I was...

1345
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:07,543
..hit.

1346
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:09,114
In the back.

1347
01:15:10,115 --> 01:15:11,230
Roger.

1348
01:15:11,315 --> 01:15:13,385
But you were still able to get Rady out.

1349
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,103
Rady.

1350
01:15:17,235 --> 01:15:18,509
Yeah.

1351
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:20,506
Good man Rady.

1352
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,144
I was...

1353
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:28,714
..afraid.

1354
01:15:28,795 --> 01:15:30,672
I understand, son.

1355
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:34,466
(groans)

1356
01:15:34,755 --> 01:15:35,983
That's OK. Take your time.

1357
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:37,303
She was afraid.

1358
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:40,228
She... she was afraid.

1359
01:15:40,315 --> 01:15:42,033
The Captain was afraid?

1360
01:15:43,755 --> 01:15:45,108
Not...

1361
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:48,668
..the Captain.

1362
01:15:48,755 --> 01:15:50,825
Who then? Was it Rady or llario?

1363
01:15:50,955 --> 01:15:52,229
Was llario afraid?

1364
01:15:54,315 --> 01:15:56,033
Me.

1365
01:15:59,475 --> 01:16:02,069
Did... didn't tell.

1366
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,232
You didn't tell what, son?

1367
01:16:07,715 --> 01:16:09,114
The major.

1368
01:16:11,595 --> 01:16:13,392
Monfriez.

1369
01:16:13,475 --> 01:16:15,227
You didn't tell the major Monfriez...

1370
01:16:15,475 --> 01:16:18,148
You...
you and Monfriez didn't tell the major?

1371
01:16:18,235 --> 01:16:19,588
He...

1372
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,791
..and then they...

1373
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:25,909
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major.

1374
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:27,269
(mumbles)

1375
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:31,191
You and Monfriez what, Steven?

1376
01:16:32,715 --> 01:16:33,989
Oh, Jesus.

1377
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:35,349
What? What is it?

1378
01:16:35,435 --> 01:16:37,346
Tell me son, please. What is it?

1379
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:38,385
Jesus.

1380
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:39,385
What? What?

1381
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:40,703
The fire.

1382
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:43,548
- What? What fire?
- Oh, Jesus, the fire.

1383
01:16:44,155 --> 01:16:44,905
What fire?

1384
01:16:44,995 --> 01:16:46,223
The napalm fire?

1385
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:47,225
Jesus.

1386
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:49,624
- You see the napalm fire.
- Jesus.

1387
01:16:49,715 --> 01:16:51,114
Tell me about the fire.

1388
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:54,471
You and Monfriez
didn't tell the major what about the fire?

1389
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,467
- Please, Jesus.
- Steven!

1390
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:57,544
Jesus, please.

1391
01:16:57,635 --> 01:16:59,865
Is it napalm fire? Steven?

1392
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:00,871
Please, Jesus.

1393
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:01,865
Jesus, please.

1394
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:03,024
Steven.

1395
01:17:04,235 --> 01:17:06,066
Jesus.

1396
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,190
Please.

1397
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:08,908
Jesus.

1398
01:17:09,155 --> 01:17:10,190
What's he doing?

1399
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,311
He's upping his meds. Self-medication.

1400
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:14,232
Well, can you get him to stop?

1401
01:17:14,315 --> 01:17:16,749
I mean, I need to talk to him.

1402
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:19,384
Give him a break.
He's feeling no pain now.

1403
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,950
(men singing marching cadence)

1404
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:34,466
Left.

1405
01:17:34,555 --> 01:17:35,465
Left.

1406
01:17:35,555 --> 01:17:36,465
Left.

1407
01:17:36,555 --> 01:17:37,465
Left.

1408
01:17:37,555 --> 01:17:40,274
Get off my car, sir.

1409
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:48,103
Think you got
something to tell me, Sergeant.

1410
01:17:48,195 --> 01:17:49,514
I called around.

1411
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:51,984
You're off this inquiry, so why you here?

1412
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:53,713
Karen Walden sent me.

1413
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:00,071
I just left AItameyer.

1414
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:08,033
What happened out there
that was so bad...

1415
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:12,825
..that it would have AItameyer
laying up in a hospital praying to die,...

1416
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,871
..that's got llario on the run?

1417
01:18:16,395 --> 01:18:18,033
That's right, he went AWOL.

1418
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:22,074
What do you think he値l tell them about you
when they catch him?

1419
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,986
And they're going to catch him, son.

1420
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,872
Now, you can tell them,...

1421
01:18:25,955 --> 01:18:27,673
..or you can tell me.

1422
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,472
What happened out there?

1423
01:18:30,555 --> 01:18:32,147
Nothing happened.

1424
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,506
Nothing happened, sir.

1425
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:37,904
It was a war.

1426
01:18:39,675 --> 01:18:40,664
(slams car door)

1427
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:42,992
Don't lie to me, soldier.

1428
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:44,873
Don't lie to me.

1429
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:49,113
It doesn't matter
whether she gets this award or not.

1430
01:18:49,195 --> 01:18:53,074
It doesn't matter whether I'm on this inquiry
or whether I'm in this Army.

1431
01:18:53,155 --> 01:18:57,148
I'm going to find out the truth.
I guarantee you that.

1432
01:18:57,235 --> 01:19:01,592
You said you were a good poker player.
Well, look me in the eye.

1433
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:03,233
You think I'm bluffing?

1434
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:10,674
No, thank you.

1435
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,354
You want it.

1436
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:17,428
I can smell how much you want it.
It's coming out of your pores.

1437
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:25,033
Tell me about the fire.

1438
01:19:25,315 --> 01:19:26,794
I like trains.

1439
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:29,672
Since I was a kid.

1440
01:19:29,755 --> 01:19:30,983
Big...

1441
01:19:31,075 --> 01:19:32,030
Tough...

1442
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:33,310
Iron.

1443
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:34,828
Used to be iron, anyway.

1444
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:39,431
When I got to boxing pro, I was going to
call myself Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1445
01:19:39,515 --> 01:19:42,507
- Don't that have a nice ring to it?
- Very nice.

1446
01:19:42,595 --> 01:19:45,428
Don't humour me, man.
Say it like you mean it.

1447
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:48,154
Don't humour me, either.
Tell me about the fire.

1448
01:19:48,915 --> 01:19:50,667
Where's my other bottle?

1449
01:19:54,675 --> 01:19:58,634
You ever kill anyone
at close range with a small arm, sir?

1450
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,433
It's messy.

1451
01:20:08,715 --> 01:20:09,989
No.

1452
01:20:10,075 --> 01:20:11,508
We're not talking...

1453
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:13,790
..one of your great big tank guns here.

1454
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,752
Oh, that's OK.

1455
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:17,632
I know what you did.

1456
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:19,194
Your own men.

1457
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:21,391
Guys under your command.

1458
01:20:22,475 --> 01:20:24,272
How'd it feel?

1459
01:20:24,355 --> 01:20:25,674
Bad, right?

1460
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:27,188
Very bad, son.

1461
01:20:27,275 --> 01:20:28,230
Very bad.

1462
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:29,987
(train whistle)

1463
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:33,225
And you didn't even mean to kill them.

1464
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:37,912
I've been a good soldier.

1465
01:20:38,995 --> 01:20:41,463
A good soldier.

1466
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,506
(train whistle)

1467
01:20:44,635 --> 01:20:46,751
Listen to that whistle.

1468
01:20:47,795 --> 01:20:50,263
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1469
01:20:51,475 --> 01:20:52,464
Say it.

1470
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:56,387
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1471
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:00,948
Now get out.

1472
01:21:01,235 --> 01:21:02,987
You don't want to do this, son.

1473
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:04,110
Let me help you.

1474
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:07,153
- It's too late.
- It's never too late. Look at me.

1475
01:21:07,235 --> 01:21:10,466
Things get fucked up in war.
I don't care what happened to you.

1476
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:11,544
You can't do this.

1477
01:21:11,635 --> 01:21:12,590
Wrong!

1478
01:21:14,155 --> 01:21:16,225
I can't do anything else.

1479
01:21:16,315 --> 01:21:20,194
Yes, you can. You can put the car in reverse.
Put the gun down.

1480
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,503
We can help each other.

1481
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:26,428
I don't want to lose another good soldier.

1482
01:21:29,355 --> 01:21:30,344
(cocks hammer)

1483
01:21:31,675 --> 01:21:33,631
I strongly urge you...

1484
01:21:33,715 --> 01:21:35,831
..to dismount the vehicle, sir.

1485
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,188
Monfriez. Monfriez!

1486
01:22:06,315 --> 01:22:07,350
(screeching)

1487
01:22:09,475 --> 01:22:12,353
Aah!

1488
01:22:31,755 --> 01:22:32,983
(llario) imagine that.

1489
01:22:33,075 --> 01:22:36,465
imagine not thinking
about the consequences.

1490
01:22:36,555 --> 01:22:40,104
it痴 not the doing shit that gets to you,
it痴 the consequences.

1491
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:44,151
My folks used to have this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

1492
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:46,112
l still go there sometimes.

1493
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:52,710
Guess you told me about this place
so I'd know where to find you.

1494
01:22:52,795 --> 01:22:54,786
It's beautiful.

1495
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:01,786
The MPs at Fort Stewart...

1496
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,343
..found your stash in your locker.

1497
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:11,393
Pretty ingenious place to keep it, huh?

1498
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:14,903
Not if you wanted it to be found.

1499
01:23:17,635 --> 01:23:19,512
Where'd you hide the needle tracks?

1500
01:23:19,755 --> 01:23:21,029
I, uh...

1501
01:23:21,115 --> 01:23:24,073
I shoot up between my toes.

1502
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:27,833
Monfriez is dead.

1503
01:23:27,955 --> 01:23:30,025
Killed himself.

1504
01:23:30,315 --> 01:23:32,112
AItameyer is dying.

1505
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:39,434
Aren't we all?

1506
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:43,626
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

1507
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:45,114
We're going down! Mayday!

1508
01:23:45,195 --> 01:23:48,073
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

1509
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:49,383
We're going down!

1510
01:23:49,475 --> 01:23:50,828
We're going down!

1511
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:54,465
And the chopper went down?

1512
01:23:54,555 --> 01:23:55,670
What happened next?

1513
01:23:55,795 --> 01:23:59,947
What happened next isn't important.
It's what happened that night.

1514
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,310
Monfriez wanted to make a run for it.

1515
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:05,148
At dawn we're dead.
They値l have reinforcements.

1516
01:24:05,235 --> 01:24:07,032
Escape and evasion, Captain.

1517
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:12,151
Now's the time to do it.
Maybe we'd slip by them in the dark.

1518
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:13,549
I told you,...

1519
01:24:13,635 --> 01:24:15,307
..Rady can't be moved.

1520
01:24:15,515 --> 01:24:16,504
Right, llario?

1521
01:24:16,595 --> 01:24:20,190
That lung - any movement may kill him.
But he may die lying here.

1522
01:24:20,275 --> 01:24:22,584
You see?
Rady will never make it. I say we go.

1523
01:24:27,155 --> 01:24:28,747
Oh, great.

1524
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:30,712
Great. The Captain's crying.

1525
01:24:30,795 --> 01:24:33,434
It's just tension, asshole.

1526
01:24:34,675 --> 01:24:36,825
It doesn't mean shit.

1527
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:39,953
Come on, Captain.
I don't want to wait here to die.

1528
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:44,704
llario?

1529
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:50,749
- I don't know.
- Come on, it's a majority.

1530
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:54,271
That'd be great if this was a democracy,
but it isn't.

1531
01:24:54,555 --> 01:24:56,147
We stay with Rady.

1532
01:24:56,955 --> 01:24:59,628
I wouldn't risk your life. I won't risk his.

1533
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:02,309
So if we surrender,
the Iraqis would doctor him up.

1534
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:04,028
No surrender.

1535
01:25:04,315 --> 01:25:05,873
(footsteps)

1536
01:25:07,275 --> 01:25:08,754
I hear something moving.

1537
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:12,669
- I say we make for the chopper now.
- And I say I heard enough of that shit.

1538
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:15,508
You don't have to go.
We don't need your permission.

1539
01:25:15,595 --> 01:25:17,426
I am in command here!

1540
01:25:17,515 --> 01:25:19,392
Well, maybe not any more.

1541
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:25,432
Give me the saw, Monfriez.

1542
01:25:25,515 --> 01:25:29,588
I can't stop you from running, but
you're not taking our fire power with you.

1543
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:33,346
You're not taking away my weapon.

1544
01:25:37,755 --> 01:25:39,473
Yes, I am.

1545
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:43,109
Hey, I can make a white flag, all right?

1546
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:46,233
There's no way
you're taking away my weapon, cunt.

1547
01:25:46,315 --> 01:25:48,465
Section 28-J,...

1548
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:50,352
..code of millitary justice.

1549
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:51,663
Mutiny,...

1550
01:25:51,755 --> 01:25:54,667
..an offence punishable by death.

1551
01:25:58,795 --> 01:26:00,433
Jesus, Monfriez.

1552
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:03,394
Shut up! She's trying to get us killed!

1553
01:26:05,155 --> 01:26:06,554
llario, who you with?

1554
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:14,271
Come on, llario, shithead,
do you want to die?

1555
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,353
Please, Captain.

1556
01:26:23,715 --> 01:26:24,545
Oh!

1557
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:29,309
Unh.

1558
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:36,423
They're going away.

1559
01:26:36,515 --> 01:26:37,914
It was just a probe.

1560
01:26:38,035 --> 01:26:38,911
Oh.

1561
01:26:38,995 --> 01:26:40,667
Shit.

1562
01:26:40,755 --> 01:26:42,791
(Altameyer) Are you all right?

1563
01:26:42,915 --> 01:26:43,586
(Walden) Shit!

1564
01:26:43,675 --> 01:26:46,064
Oh, my God.

1565
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:47,383
Oh, my God.

1566
01:26:47,555 --> 01:26:48,385
Shit.

1567
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:51,035
I don't fucking believe it.

1568
01:26:53,235 --> 01:26:54,827
Give me your weapon.

1569
01:26:54,995 --> 01:26:57,304
Christ, I thought you were firing at me!

1570
01:26:59,155 --> 01:27:00,508
(click)

1571
01:27:11,155 --> 01:27:13,430
You're wounded, ma'am. Let me see.

1572
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:17,869
You're with him.

1573
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:20,264
You got to let me look at it.

1574
01:27:21,795 --> 01:27:23,831
Christ, let him look at it!

1575
01:27:23,915 --> 01:27:26,383
I gave birth to a nine-pound baby,...

1576
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:27,703
..asshole!

1577
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:29,592
I think I can handle it!

1578
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:36,424
Cap, we got to get you out of here.

1579
01:27:37,435 --> 01:27:39,346
We stay with Rady.

1580
01:27:40,395 --> 01:27:43,034
- And then?
- And then...

1581
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:02,425
- (Altameyer) Incoming!
- (explosions)

1582
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:05,308
150 metres and closing!

1583
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:09,191
(Altameyer) 140!

1584
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:12,273
(Altameyer) 130!

1585
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:14,034
Give me my weapon!

1586
01:28:14,115 --> 01:28:15,673
llario, how's Rady?

1587
01:28:15,755 --> 01:28:17,666
- He's dead!
- No, he's alive!

1588
01:28:18,635 --> 01:28:20,512
Come on, Captain, give him his weapon!

1589
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:23,393
- This is insane! Give me my weapon!
- Shut up!

1590
01:28:23,475 --> 01:28:25,272
90 metres and closing!

1591
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:26,834
80!

1592
01:28:29,235 --> 01:28:30,509
I'm sorry.

1593
01:28:34,835 --> 01:28:35,870
OK. OK.

1594
01:28:35,955 --> 01:28:37,991
OK, we値l get you out of here, Captain.

1595
01:28:38,075 --> 01:28:39,508
It's all over.

1596
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:41,626
No, Monfriez,...

1597
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:43,546
..it's not over.

1598
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:45,068
There will be a reckoning.

1599
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:46,634
Count on it.

1600
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:52,191
Hey, what's that?

1601
01:28:52,275 --> 01:28:54,186
(helicopters)

1602
01:28:55,715 --> 01:28:57,751
There's the rescue!

1603
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:13,310
Let's move it! Move it!

1604
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:14,748
Move it! Move it!

1605
01:29:14,995 --> 01:29:16,064
No!

1606
01:29:16,155 --> 01:29:17,747
Wait.

1607
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:20,065
Help Rady.

1608
01:29:21,075 --> 01:29:23,873
We're pinned down here!

1609
01:29:36,035 --> 01:29:39,072
llario, give me the M-16.

1610
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:42,153
Give me the goddamn M-16!

1611
01:29:58,675 --> 01:29:59,949
I値l cover you.

1612
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:02,430
Go!

1613
01:30:03,955 --> 01:30:04,944
I値l cover you!

1614
01:30:05,035 --> 01:30:05,990
Negative, ma'am!

1615
01:30:06,075 --> 01:30:09,545
Come back for me
with a stretcher and more guns!

1616
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:12,308
- Karen, please!
- Go! It's an order!

1617
01:30:12,475 --> 01:30:12,987
Karen, please!

1618
01:30:13,235 --> 01:30:14,827
Go! Go!

1619
01:30:43,435 --> 01:30:44,754
Wait!

1620
01:30:47,795 --> 01:30:49,148
Wait!

1621
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:55,068
Where's Walden?

1622
01:30:55,395 --> 01:30:58,990
She's dead!

1623
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:12,028
No!

1624
01:32:14,235 --> 01:32:17,113
Monfriez said she would
have court-martial led us.

1625
01:32:19,235 --> 01:32:22,113
AItameyer was too fucked up to say anything.

1626
01:32:25,395 --> 01:32:26,464
She was...

1627
01:32:26,555 --> 01:32:28,750
She was probably killed by small arms...

1628
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,144
..before the napalm ever hit.

1629
01:32:33,035 --> 01:32:34,309
Either way,...

1630
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:37,353
..she never could have
survived that stomach wound.

1631
01:32:38,435 --> 01:32:40,346
You think that matters?

1632
01:32:47,075 --> 01:32:48,554
No.

1633
01:32:51,035 --> 01:32:52,150
No.

1634
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:53,793
Hmm.

1635
01:33:11,475 --> 01:33:13,864
I couldn't bear to send this.

1636
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:16,150
Uh, I didn't even want to...

1637
01:33:16,235 --> 01:33:18,669
I didn't even want to touch it.

1638
01:33:18,755 --> 01:33:20,108
Uh...

1639
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,989
Can you get it to her parents for me?

1640
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,308
Can you...?

1641
01:33:41,395 --> 01:33:42,510
Please?

1642
01:33:44,435 --> 01:33:45,754
Yeah.

1643
01:33:59,475 --> 01:34:02,228
Uh, listen,
I'm going to have to call you back.

1644
01:34:02,315 --> 01:34:04,192
You got off the phone for me?

1645
01:34:04,275 --> 01:34:06,835
- You値l want me there for this.
- Meaning?

1646
01:34:06,915 --> 01:34:10,908
Remember that stereo you told me not to buy
cos who needs a dual cassette deck?

1647
01:34:10,995 --> 01:34:14,305
When does anyone ever have
a reason to copy a tape?

1648
01:34:14,395 --> 01:34:16,670
Nat, just the man I wanted to see.

1649
01:34:16,755 --> 01:34:19,110
Uh, do you know Colonel Serling?

1650
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:21,709
This is Tony Gartner
of the Washington Post.

1651
01:34:21,795 --> 01:34:23,308
He was with the 9th in Vietnam.

1652
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:24,271
Mr. Gartner.

1653
01:34:24,355 --> 01:34:25,470
Colonel.

1654
01:34:25,555 --> 01:34:26,988
Take a seat, Nat.

1655
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:30,067
He's following up
our investigation of AI Bathra,...

1656
01:34:30,155 --> 01:34:34,671
..and it seems that he has a few questions
that he'd like to ask us.

1657
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:36,666
Let's give him every facility.

1658
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,508
- I appreciate that.
- Some ground rules, though.

1659
01:34:39,595 --> 01:34:42,826
I insist we be allowed to schedule
the release of all information...

1660
01:34:42,915 --> 01:34:45,110
..to the public regarding casualties.

1661
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:47,948
Well, I wish I could accommodate you, sir,...

1662
01:34:48,035 --> 01:34:54,270
..but, unfortunately, we値l be going with
a story based on a tape that I've acquired...

1663
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:57,711
..of all radio communications that night.

1664
01:34:59,555 --> 01:35:01,466
So,...

1665
01:35:01,675 --> 01:35:03,393
..I'd like you to listen...

1666
01:35:03,475 --> 01:35:05,306
..and then comment for the record.

1667
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:07,226
I can't comment for the record.

1668
01:35:07,315 --> 01:35:09,306
This is an ongoing investigation.

1669
01:35:11,075 --> 01:35:13,464
(Serling) First right! Turn to the right!

1670
01:35:13,555 --> 01:35:14,670
Sabre-6, this is Bobcat-5.

1671
01:35:14,755 --> 01:35:17,827
Enemy tangos!
Say again! Enemy tanks in our lines. Over.

1672
01:35:17,915 --> 01:35:20,987
(Boylar) Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta...

1673
01:35:21,075 --> 01:35:24,351
- I don't think any more of this...
- This is what happened, General.

1674
01:35:24,435 --> 01:35:27,313
(Serling) Liberty-6, this is Sabre-6.
Enemy tanks on our flank. Out!

1675
01:35:27,395 --> 01:35:29,067
Patella, find me a target.

1676
01:35:29,155 --> 01:35:32,511
- l think l got one, sir.
- Do you or do you not have a target?

1677
01:35:32,595 --> 01:35:34,426
It must be, sir. They池e firing at us.

1678
01:35:34,515 --> 01:35:35,425
Loader!

1679
01:35:35,515 --> 01:35:36,425
Up, sir!

1680
01:35:36,515 --> 01:35:37,425
Fire!

1681
01:35:37,515 --> 01:35:38,664
On the way!

1682
01:35:38,755 --> 01:35:40,473
- Target! We got that sucker!
- Yeah!

1683
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:43,945
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
Repeat, we just lost Boylar.

1684
01:35:44,035 --> 01:35:45,548
Roger that, sir. We got him.

1685
01:35:45,635 --> 01:35:48,388
- You just lit up a friendly.
- Roger that. We... What?

1686
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:51,911
- You just lit up a friendly, goddamn it!
- (turns off tape)

1687
01:35:51,995 --> 01:35:56,307
Cougar-6 was one of your own Abrams,
Colonel Serling. Is that correct?

1688
01:35:58,555 --> 01:35:59,704
Yes, that's correct.

1689
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:05,431
Sabre-6, Nat, what痴 happening?
Sabre-6, report.

1690
01:36:05,595 --> 01:36:07,426
(Serling) Patella, was that one of our tanks?

1691
01:36:07,515 --> 01:36:08,152
They fired.

1692
01:36:08,235 --> 01:36:10,146
At us or at the T-72s?

1693
01:36:10,235 --> 01:36:11,190
l don',t know.

1694
01:36:11,275 --> 01:36:14,028
- At us or at the T-72s, Patella?
- l don,t know!

1695
01:36:14,115 --> 01:36:16,993
- Colonel Serling, report status now.
- (bang)

1696
01:36:17,075 --> 01:36:18,428
They have range on us!

1697
01:36:18,515 --> 01:36:21,632
All Sabre elements,
stop all tanks, turn on your lights.

1698
01:36:21,715 --> 01:36:23,910
I say again,
stop all tanks and turn on your Lights.

1699
01:36:23,995 --> 01:36:26,270
Sabre-6, Nat, what痴 happening out there?

1700
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:29,430
Load us up.

1701
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:33,106
Patella, find me a target.
Snap out of it. Find me a target.

1702
01:36:33,195 --> 01:36:34,310
Patella, come on!

1703
01:36:36,595 --> 01:36:38,153
- Target!
- We're up.

1704
01:36:38,235 --> 01:36:40,430
- Lights on or off?
- Off.

1705
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:43,588
- Fire!
- On the way.

1706
01:36:47,355 --> 01:36:48,344
- Sir?
- Fire!

1707
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:56,585
Colonel Serling, report status now!

1708
01:36:56,675 --> 01:36:59,951
Sabre-6, situation under control, General.

1709
01:37:01,835 --> 01:37:06,545
General, Colonel Serling's order
to activate Lights,...

1710
01:37:06,635 --> 01:37:10,150
..was that a standard response
to enemy infiltration of the lines?

1711
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:13,426
At the critical moment,...

1712
01:37:13,515 --> 01:37:15,949
..in spite of terrible losses,...

1713
01:37:16,035 --> 01:37:19,027
..Colonel Serling didn't hesitate to act.

1714
01:37:19,115 --> 01:37:21,675
Ordering those tanks
to turn on their Lights...

1715
01:37:21,755 --> 01:37:24,872
..saved the lives
of God knows how many of our men.

1716
01:37:24,955 --> 01:37:27,071
Heroic acts arise...

1717
01:37:27,155 --> 01:37:29,225
..out of desperate circumstances.

1718
01:37:29,315 --> 01:37:34,150
I have no trouble at all
believing that Colonel Serling is a hero.

1719
01:37:34,235 --> 01:37:36,226
Like Captain Karen Walden.

1720
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:39,751
Did you know, Mr. Gartner, for the first time
a woman is being considered...

1721
01:37:39,835 --> 01:37:42,190
..for the Medal of Honour
for her performance under fire?

1722
01:37:42,275 --> 01:37:44,027
And, um,...

1723
01:37:44,115 --> 01:37:46,265
..Colonel Serling...

1724
01:37:46,355 --> 01:37:49,233
..is just finishing up the inquiry.

1725
01:37:49,315 --> 01:37:51,146
How's that going, Nat?

1726
01:37:58,035 --> 01:37:59,673
I think, uh,...

1727
01:38:02,915 --> 01:38:07,591
..in order to honour
a soldier like Karen Walden,...

1728
01:38:07,675 --> 01:38:10,667
..we have to tell the truth, General,...

1729
01:38:10,755 --> 01:38:12,905
..about what happened over there.

1730
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:18,705
The whole, hard,...

1731
01:38:18,795 --> 01:38:21,434
..cold truth.

1732
01:38:21,515 --> 01:38:24,871
And until we do that, uh,...

1733
01:38:24,955 --> 01:38:27,992
..we dishonor her...

1734
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:30,305
..and every soldier who died,...

1735
01:38:30,395 --> 01:38:33,034
..who gave their life for their country.

1736
01:38:54,315 --> 01:38:56,545
My full report, General.

1737
01:39:01,555 --> 01:39:04,831
Few of us are given the opportunity,...

1738
01:39:04,915 --> 01:39:07,509
..even fewer the courage,...

1739
01:39:07,595 --> 01:39:12,908
..to sacrifice ourselves
for the lives of our comrades.

1740
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:15,873
In daily life, even as in battle,...

1741
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:21,348
..each one of us is mysteriously
and irrevocably bound to our fellow man.

1742
01:39:21,835 --> 01:39:22,950
And yet,...

1743
01:39:23,635 --> 01:39:26,945
..it is only in death
that the power of this bond...

1744
01:39:27,195 --> 01:39:29,789
..is finally tested and proven.

1745
01:39:31,235 --> 01:39:33,988
And who among us really knows...

1746
01:39:34,075 --> 01:39:37,272
..how he might respond
when that moment comes?

1747
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:11,107
(man) I guess we've been expecting you.

1748
01:40:11,195 --> 01:40:14,983
Ahem. First of all, let me, um...

1749
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:17,350
Let me just say that, uh,...

1750
01:40:17,435 --> 01:40:19,426
..there was nothing that, uh,...

1751
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,870
..Tom and I wouldn't do for each other.

1752
01:40:24,155 --> 01:40:25,793
Nothing.

1753
01:40:26,075 --> 01:40:28,748
He was a good soldier.

1754
01:40:28,835 --> 01:40:31,224
He was like a brother to me.

1755
01:40:32,675 --> 01:40:35,906
That night, uh, 25 February...

1756
01:40:37,995 --> 01:40:40,429
..there were enemy tanks in our lines.

1757
01:40:43,635 --> 01:40:45,546
We thought...

1758
01:40:48,795 --> 01:40:51,787
I... I thought that, uh,...

1759
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:55,231
..Tom's tank was an enemy tank.

1760
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:00,193
And, uh,...

1761
01:41:06,835 --> 01:41:09,190
..I gave the order to fire.

1762
01:41:13,555 --> 01:41:15,193
God help me.

1763
01:41:15,275 --> 01:41:16,788
I, um...

1764
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:21,345
Yeah, I killed him.

1765
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:28,786
As for the funeral,...

1766
01:41:30,635 --> 01:41:32,785
..the lies the Army told...

1767
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:38,152
..and the lies that I told...

1768
01:41:40,235 --> 01:41:42,749
..to you, I can only...

1769
01:41:45,595 --> 01:41:47,506
..beg for your forgiveness.

1770
01:41:53,275 --> 01:41:55,266
As far as the...

1771
01:41:57,515 --> 01:41:59,551
As far as that night, um,...

1772
01:42:01,955 --> 01:42:03,752
..I guess there's no way that, uh,...

1773
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:06,144
..I can even begin to ask you to forgive me.

1774
01:42:08,075 --> 01:42:10,589
I know that,...

1775
01:42:10,835 --> 01:42:14,908
..but it's a burden
you're going to have to put down sometime.

1776
01:42:15,355 --> 01:42:16,913
Thank you, sir.

1777
01:42:44,155 --> 01:42:45,474
Mr. President.

1778
01:42:50,475 --> 01:42:52,272
(engines roaring)

1779
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:16,747
(Karen) Dear Mom and Dad,...

1780
01:43:16,835 --> 01:43:20,145
..well, this is it - the big push.

1781
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:23,147
Looks like it's gonna really happen.

1782
01:43:23,235 --> 01:43:24,827
And I'm afraid,...

1783
01:43:24,915 --> 01:43:26,712
..not of being hurt or killed,...

1784
01:43:26,795 --> 01:43:30,151
..well, kind of, but not much.

1785
01:43:30,235 --> 01:43:34,023
My only regret will be
to never see you two again...

1786
01:43:34,115 --> 01:43:36,345
..and that I値l never see Anne Marie grow up.

1787
01:43:36,435 --> 01:43:39,711
But I know she's in good hands, the best.

1788
01:43:39,795 --> 01:43:44,630
What I'm really afraid of is that
I might let my people down, my crew.

1789
01:43:44,715 --> 01:43:48,708
These people depend on me.
They put their lives in my hands.

1790
01:43:48,795 --> 01:43:51,389
I just can't fall 'em.

1791
01:44:20,555 --> 01:44:22,432
Now, I know if you get this letter...

1792
01:44:22,515 --> 01:44:23,948
..it means I'm dead.

1793
01:44:24,035 --> 01:44:26,230
I only hope that I've made you proud,...

1794
01:44:26,315 --> 01:44:28,192
..that I did my job,...

1795
01:44:28,275 --> 01:44:30,072
..and I didn't let down my country,...

1796
01:44:30,155 --> 01:44:32,953
..my crew, my fellow soldiers.

1797
01:44:33,035 --> 01:44:34,866
I Love you guys.

1798
01:44:34,955 --> 01:44:38,709
Never stop telling Anne Marie
how much I Love her.

1799
01:44:38,795 --> 01:44:41,673
Your daughter, Karen.

1800
01:45:08,715 --> 01:45:10,546
You got it? All right.

1801
01:45:52,835 --> 01:45:54,587
(sighs)

1802
01:46:23,115 --> 01:46:25,993
