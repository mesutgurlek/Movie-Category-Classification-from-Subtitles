00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,040
(INHALING SLOWLY)

2
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,004
Marine, this hearing

3
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,380
falls under
the jurisdiction

4
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,299
of the United Nations.

5
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,635
Now, you understand
this is a deposition,

6
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,136
not a trial.

7
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,888
The charges against
you are serious.

8
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,641
Desertion of your post.
Dereliction of duty.

9
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,351
Any legal actions

10
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,145
that may or may not proceed
from this investigation

11
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,271
will be adjudicated

12
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,399
under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice.

13
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,817
Do you understand your
rights in this matter?

14
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,486
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,821
Lieutenant Abramowitz.

16
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,660
ABRAMOWITZ:
Sergeant Brandon Beckett,

17
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,036
please can you tell us
where you were

18
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,663
on the 4th of August, 2010?

19
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,416
The Democratic Republic
of the Congo in Africa.

20
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,085
What were you
doing in Africa?

21
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,712
My squad had just transferred
from Kabul, Afghanistan

22
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,964
two months earlier.

23
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,257
Your assignment?

24
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,676
We were there as part of ATEP.

25
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,303
The Africa Train
and Equip Program.

26
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,848
We were helping train
the Congolese regular army

27
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,351
to resist the incursion of
well-armed rebel forces

28
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,769
backed by terrorist groups.

29
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,521
In exchange, African
troops would join

30
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,022
the coalition forces
in Afghanistan.

31
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,440
Can you describe the events

32
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,693
that led to your going
AWOL eight days later?

33
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,491
It started August 3rd
at the parade ground...

34
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,076
BECKETT: The AKS-74,

35
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,288
the Soviet weapon designed
to replace the AK-47.

36
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,998
Most likely, this
or one of its variants

37
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,375
is what your enemy
will be using.

38
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,295
The rifle is chambered
for the 5.45 x 39mm round,

39
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,797
similar to our
5.56mm NATO round.

40
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,758
Only the AKS uses
a 52-grain steel-core bullet,

41
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,469
designed to penetrate
body armor.

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,139
This weapon's barrel
has a one in eight twist.

43
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,640
That means there's
enough spin to stabilize

44
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,226
even the heavier
70-grain bullets.

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,311
It's accurate.

46
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,479
If you hear this
thing going off,

47
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,148
you get out of
the line of fire.

48
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,198
Remember,
in our exercises,

49
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,327
you'll be using blanks and
laser-activated MILES vests

50
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,911
to score hits.

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,663
But when you get
into a fire fight,

52
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,999
the idea is
not to get hit.

53
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,002
My men are good soldiers.
They know how to fight.

54
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,212
They just don't
know how to duck.

55
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,548
BECKETT:
Look, Captain Ngoba,

56
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,175
I know some of this is
straight out of the book.

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,510
Your soldiers are
courageous and brave,

58
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,304
but they have to fight
the natural tendency

59
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,181
to start firing back
from unsecured positions.

60
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,849
Yes, we know.

61
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,018
You gotta aim if
you want to maim.

62
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,227
Ngoba, get your
men in formation

63
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,437
and let's go again.

64
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,605
Captain Nelson,

65
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,775
Colonel Jäger would like
to see you in his office.

66
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,194
Brown, take over.
Beckett with me.

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,156
Uh-oh. What did
we do wrong?

68
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,283
Maybe my transfer
came through.

69
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,993
You leaving the Marines?

70
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,120
Anything to get
away from you.

71
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,464
You wanted to see us, sir?
Yes.

72
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,299
New orders for tomorrow.

73
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,759
New orders?

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,305
Training operations will
be temporarily suspended.

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,307
You will be taking
men into the DRC.

76
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,060
Sir, I thought
it was off limits

77
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,311
to outside military forces.

78
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,813
The Congolese government

79
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,106
has cleared us for
this one mission.

80
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,817
The rebels are threatening
all Europeans in the DRC.

81
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,693
Most have moved out long ago

82
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,737
after the country ceased
being a Belgian colony.

83
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,074
But one last Belgian
plantation owner,

84
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,910
a Jean Van Brunt,

85
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,663
has refused to respond
to our communications,

86
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,166
and his property is here.

87
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,752
Come on.

88
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,092
Here in Mukana,
just over the border.

89
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,094
An old-style plantation
that, like its owner,

90
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,512
has outstayed its welcome.

91
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,265
Take 10 men.

92
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,934
You have to go in there
and extract him

93
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,644
and any persons
still working for him.

94
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,355
I'll take five of my Marines
and Ngoba's men.

95
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,523
Good.

96
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,651
Yes, sir.
Dismissed.

97
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,280
Sir?

98
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,489
Yes, Sergeant?

99
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,199
Why not airlift him out?

100
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,786
It's too dangerous
to fly in the area,

101
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,954
since the rebels have
gotten their hands

102
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,372
on Strela missiles.

103
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,334
If they have Strelas,

104
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,170
what else do they
have in store for us?

105
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,464
Hopefully,
you don't find out.

106
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,980
So we're on
babysitting duty
tomorrow?

107
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,648
NGOBA: This is not
a walk in the park.

108
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,318
There's rebel activity
all over that area.

109
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,486
Great.

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,528
Don't worry, Paddy.

111
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,988
We'll be in and out before
they know what hit them.

112
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,823
Bing-bang, like
a Chinese prom date.

113
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,575
Man, you're a pig,
you know that?

114
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,743
CAPOBIANCO: You love it.

115
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,496
Whoa. Check out
the new chick.

116
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,416
BECKETT: Who is she?

117
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,251
BROWN: She's from England.

118
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,879
That's military intel, bro.
Don't even think about it.

119
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,089
What's that
supposed to mean?

120
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,218
It means she'll want
a man with brains,

121
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,261
and you ain't smart,
even for a Marine.

122
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,098
(MEN LAUGHING)

123
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,350
Well, she's looking
over here.

124
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,684
It doesn't make
any sense,

125
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,852
but she's looking
at you, dude.

126
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,396
Go for it, Sergeant.
She wants you all up in there.

127
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,773
Not interested.

128
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,069
Ten bucks says
you don't have the
nerve to talk to her.

129
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,112
I'll second that.
Yeah.

130
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,116
You're on.

131
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,786
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah!

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,872
MAN 1: Here we go.
MAN 2: Go get it, B.

133
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,415
MAN 3: See you
in five minutes.

134
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,879
Hey. I'm Sergeant Beckett.
You're new here, right?

135
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,549
That's it?

136
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,801
What?

137
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,974
That's your
come-on line, Sergeant?

138
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,392
"Hey, you're new?"

139
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,726
Yeah, I guess it's...

140
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,897
It's Abramowitz.
Lieutenant Ellen Abramowitz.

141
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,651
Work on the line, Marine.
Then get back to me.

142
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,321
I will.

143
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,991
CAPOBIANCO:
How'd that work out?
MAN 1: Fail, Sergeant.

144
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,910
BROWN: Walk of shame.

145
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,122
Fraternizing with
a superior officer.

was a Lieutenant.

You owe me 10 bucks.

151

You struck out.

152
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,175
The bet was
to talk to her.

153
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,929
Shit.

That was pathetic.

00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,545
Brown's queer
for Capobianco.

164
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,796
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

165
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,381
See?
BROWN: Busting my balls.

166
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,383

(ALL CLAMORING)

168
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,021
BROWN: There's some fly
women around here.

169
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,690
HOAG: You're gonna take
them back home with you?

170
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,358
BROWN: I ain't saying
I'm gonna take them home.

171
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,484
I'm just saying...

172
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,027
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

173
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,278
"I'll give you a new life."

174
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,280
HOAG: Yeah.
"Move to Utah."

175
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,950
Guys, guys, settle down.
We're almost there.

176
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,952
Mukana's 10 klicks
north of here,

177
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,120
just past Uhuru.

178
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,413
What, they've got a town

179
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,706
named after the chick
from Star Trek?

180
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,416
That's Uhura, dick.

181
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,834
Uhuru is "freedom"
in Swahili.

(MEN CLAMORING)

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,384
Bad joke,

186
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,553
since the rebels
have driven everyone

187
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,804
out of that part
of the country.

188
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,723
Oh, right.
I heard they walked.

189
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,224
Settle down, Vincent.

190
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,978
Yes, this may not be
Afghanistan or Fallujah,

191
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,896
but be careful.

192
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,648
It's the jungle
of the Congo.

193
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,985
CAPOBIANCO:
Okay, jungle faces on.

194
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,238
BROWN: Sounds like a holiday.

195
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,451
BECKETT: Hunters?

196
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,082
Chandler and his
rich European friends

197
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,625
come to get trophies.

198
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,837
I thought it was too dangerous
for Europeans in this area.

199
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,255
Down here,

200
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,424
hunters are a big part
of the economy.

201
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,968
They pay good money
to the government

202
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,678
and they feed the
local villagers.

203
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,137
Keep your eyes open.

204
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,141
And Marines, behave.

205
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,074
Beautiful.

206
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,255
You're Jean Van Brunt?

207
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,506
Who's asking?

208
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,925
Can we speak to
you please, sir?

209
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,928
Come inside.

210
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,232
VAN BRUNT: I don't
understand these orders.

211
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,358
NELSON: It's simple.

212
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,526
We have to take
you out of here.

213
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,444
I have no problem here.

214
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,907
Where are your workers?
They ran off.

215
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,618
They are afraid.

216
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,954
I'm not.

217
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,498
It's for your
own protection, sir.

218
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,376
Leave this place?
I can't.

219
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,627
I'm afraid
we're under orders.

220
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,879
Screw your orders.

221
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,548
This plantation was
built by my father.

222
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,884
It survived the Congo wars

223
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,802
and several small
uprisings since.

224
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,928
I'm not going to abandon

225
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,305
everything he lived
and died for.

226
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,183
No. No, everything that
means anything to me

227
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,393
is in the house

228
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,561
and on that land.

229
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,772
My wife is buried out there,
for God's sake.

230
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,319
You want me to walk
out that door?

231
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,447
I'm sorry, but you
have no choice.

(SCOFFING)

233
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:31,930
All right. I will come
with you. For now.

234
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,850
Take me to your commander.
I'll talk to him.

Ngoba, get the
vehicle. Let's go!

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,113
Everybody, move out!
Okay.

238
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,705
MARINE: Got to
bring her around.

239
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,462
Sir, I don't know
what to say,

240
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,048
but when the fighting is over,
you could come back.

241
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,551
To what? An empty field
where this house once stood?

242
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,304
No. If you take me
out of here,

243
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,973
this place dies, and so do I.

244
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,312

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,362
Get down!

00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,365
MARINE 1: Fall back!
MARINE 2: Run for cover!

248
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,540
Find cover!

249
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,044
HOAG: He's fucking hit!

250
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,256
Hoag, get down!

251
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,174
Get down!

252
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,593
Get fucking down!
Hoag, get down!

253
00:16:54,179 --> 00:17:01,561
Get the fuck down!

254
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,540
Fucking rebels.

255
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
I don't think it's
a squad out there.

256
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,294
Why do you say that?

257
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,088
His rate of fire,
the radius of attack.

258
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,381
I think there's
one guy out there.

259
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,759
One guy. A sniper.
BROWN: Sniper?

260
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,094
Fuck! Fuck!

261
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,555
Where is he? Where are
those shots coming from?

262
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,681
BECKETT: I can't tell.

263
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,807
I think he stopped
shooting.

264
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,392
He's playing with us.

265
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,604
He can't see
around the door.

266
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,273
He's moving around to a
better location to get shots.

267
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,900
VAN BRUNT: Maybe he's gone.

268
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,359
I gotta get back
into my house.

269
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,445
Fuck your house!
You don't understand...

270
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,823
There's 50 yards
of clear kill zone

271
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,325
between here
and that tree line.

272
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,494
He can pick us off
one by one.

273
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,204
But in my house, my...

274
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,499

Oh, my God.
Damn it! Shit!

277
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,886
Come on, stop it!

278
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,639
It won't stop.

279
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,227
BECKETT: Look at me!

280
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,771
BROWN: Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

281
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,189
I messed up.

282
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,486
Breathe.

283
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,446
I can't breathe.

284

285
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,783
Fuck it!

286
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,984

he shooting?

287
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,069

moving positions.

288
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,195

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,446
Fuck what?

290
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,199
This is a U.S. Army
shipping container.

291
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,912
You see this case?

292
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,832
I've packed cases like
this back at Pendleton.

293
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,250
Pelican model 1780 cases.

294
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,670
Cases that hold 12
full-size M-1 6s each.

295
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,840
Shit. What the hell
are they doing here?

296
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,550
I don't know.

297
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,928
Well, Captain,
you got a plan, man?

298
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,181
Against the sniper?

299
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,307
Well?

300
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,602
Why are you looking at me?
You're in charge.

301
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,978
Aren't you the
sniper expert here?

302
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,688
Well, you know more

303
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,814
about this shit
than me, man.

304
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,982
That's beautiful.

305
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,400
How do we fight
this motherfucker?

306
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,693
We wait until
darkness falls.

307
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,154
NELSON: Well,
what if he has NODs?

308
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,156
Night vision only
works in darkness.

309
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,284
We'll make our move
right at dusk.

310
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,203
He won't be able
to use his NOD.

311
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,871
His day vision will
be compromised.

312
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,789
That's our best chance.

313
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,041
And if we can't
get out of here?

314
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,169
Then what?
Walk back to Zimbala?

315
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,004
Those motherfuckers
walked us into an ambush.

316
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,255
We're on our own here, man!

317
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,924
You led us into
a fucking ambush!

318
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,009
I am going home.
I am going home.

319
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,554
Two tours in fucking Iraq,
one in Afghanistan

320
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,723
and to die in
Africa like this?

321
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,767
Fuck that, man.
Fuck them!

322
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,061
Fire!

323
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,939
NELSON: Fuck! Fuck!

324
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,200
We're dead, man.

do with that knife?

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,408
But I thought he didn't
have any enemies.

488

What would he have
been scared of?

489
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,954
I don't know,
but he was worried.

490
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,791
I could tell.

491
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,381
Why would this
have happened?

492
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,510
Can you tell me that?

493
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,637

everyone's friend.

right now isn't going to help.

BECKETT: Your mother?

498
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,708
She died
when I was 10.

499
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,712
My father knew
I needed a family,

500
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,549
so he sent me
to live with my aunt.

501
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,135
Finally, when
I'm old enough,

502
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,392
I came 6,000 kilometers
to see my father,

503
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,895
only to lose him.

this to your father,

No.

00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,662
You don't need to know.

652
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,830
What's the distance?

653
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,875
Two hundred yards.
And how do you know that?

654
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,835
Through the scope.
He's 10 mils high.

655
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,545
Good. Switch him off.

656
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,883
What are you
waiting for, sniper?

657
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,218
You have your
assignment. Shoot.

658
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,607
No.
No?

659
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,109
I need to know more...
What do you need to know?

660
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,485
That man is the
fucking enemy.

661
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,986
You put a bullet
in his head.

662
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,530
I don't kill
indiscriminately.

663
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,741
Correction. You
don't follow orders.

664
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,869
You're not ready to
take on a sniper, kid,

665
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,664
because he would shoot
that man on command.

666
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,916
Empty.

667
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,001
So, end of the lesson.

668
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,683
JÄGER: Captain Ngoba,
according to your report,

669
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,351
your men were in
a direct attack,

670
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,979
and you were separated
from the rest of the unit.

671
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,024
Once you determined
your men had been killed

672
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,486
and lacking sufficient cover,
you chose to retreat to base.

673
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,488
And leave the
rest of us to die.
Sergeant!

674
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,992
Is that a correct reading
of your report?

675
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,076
Yes, sir.

676
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,578
That will be all, Captain.

677
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,419
Lieutenant Abramowitz,

678
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,212
do we know who
these attackers were?

679
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,174
It seems like a
squad-sized force.

680
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,510
However, I think it may
have been one shooter.

681
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,012
That seems unlikely, no?

682
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,015
The medics removed a Russian
.30 caliber rifle round

683
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,266
from his shoulder.

684
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,185
One hundred
forty-seven grains,

685
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,395
one in 11 .5-inch twist.

686
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,605
Are you sure
about the twist?

687
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,231
It's what it says here.

688
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,779
Colonel, the rebels
use Soviet weapons.

689
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,532
Their 7.62mm sniper rifle
uses a one in nine-inch twist.

690
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,203
One in 11 .5.
That's one of ours.

691
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,205
Ours?

692
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,581
The M-24 U.S.
Sniping System barrel

693
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,749
uses that twist.

694
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,418
Whoever it was
used a U.S. sniper rifle

695
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,378
chambered for
the Russian round.

696
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,381
There are millions of weapons

697
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,175
of every caliber
in this country.

698
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,803
Sir, if I may,
just one more thing.

699
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,554
Ballistic suggests
it was a sniper,

700
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,473
but it must have been a squad

701
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,225
that returned and
sanitized the scene.

702
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,727
They removed the bodies,
cleared Van Brunt's house

703
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,937
and made it look
like looting.

704
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,648
So? We'll never know.

705
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,567
Thank you for your report.

706
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,029
That's it?

707
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,113
My men were shot

708
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,573
by what may have
been U.S. weapons,

709
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,992
and you say,
"Thanks for the report"?

710
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,745
Sergeant, we've done
all we can do.

711
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,163
Doesn't look like
you've done anything.

712
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,957
ABRAMOWITZ: The Colonel means

713
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,460
the UN doesn't have the time
or manpower to investigate.

714
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,672
Don't you care
about what happened?

715
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,048
That's beside the point.

716
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,593
The conflict in the
DRC is a flashpoint.

717
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,303
The government can
topple any day.

718
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,265
We have no idea how this will
affect diplomatic relations.

719
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,724
I can look into
it on my own.

720
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,644
Oh, no. That's the
last thing we need.

721
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,355
We cannot afford you
running into the middle

722
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,942
of an international incident
like a cowboy, Sergeant.

723
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,112
Until further notice,
you are confined to base.

724
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,207
Yeah, Captain?
What do you want?

725
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,834
I heard your story
back there.

726
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,337
No, you did not, Sergeant.

727
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,340
Your men do not
respect my men.

728
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,800
We both know this.

729
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:14,265
But we are African soldiers
and you are Marines.

730
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,019
That does not mean
you can judge me.

731
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,813
This is my country.

732
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,567
We did not ask for you and
people like you to come here.

733
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,071
It is unfortunate
about your men,

734
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,866
but I did what I thought
was best at the time.

735
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,015
Brandon?

736
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,101
They told me
you were still here.

737
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,269
I was surprised.

738
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,189
They're still trying
to contact my aunt.

739
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,941
They told me you might die.

740
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,654
The medics always make
it sound worse than it is

741
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,781
so they can look like miracle
workers when you pull through.

742
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,367
Oh.

743
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,370
I brought you some DVDs.

744
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,956
The Michael Jackson movie,
Jonas Brothers.

745
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,416
You know, some
of my favorites.

746
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,501
(KELLI GIGGLES)

747
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,713
These are code five.
Won't work in Belgium.

748
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,508
Maybe you can trade them.

749
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,638
Kelli, have you had
any more thoughts

750
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,223
about who may have wanted
to kill your father?

751
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,851
I already told that woman.

752
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,770
Abramowitz?

753
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,814
Same as I told you.

754
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,649
I don't know
anyone who would.

755
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,776
In the house,
there was a picture

756
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,320
of your father
with some soldiers.

757
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,364
It wasn't there
when we went back.

758
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,699
You know the one?

759
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,451
Yes.

760
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,786
Was your father
in the army?

761
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,913
No.

762
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,416
But he would let the soldiers
come to our plantation.

763
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,917
He traded with them.

764
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,128
Did he trade
with the rebels?

765
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,214
He traded with
the rebels, tribes

766
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,008
and the Congolese army.

767
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,177
He had to, to keep
our home safe.

768
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,984
Sorry. I'm not used
to the Officers' Mess.

769
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,071
It's been a long time
since I've seen a tablecloth.

770
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,828
Ma'am.

771
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,872
WAITER: Here you go, sir.

772
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,374
The Dover sole is amazing.

773
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,880
You rather have an MRE?

774
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,966
No, no. This is great.

775
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,015
So, what do you
want from me?

776
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,102
Well, you've asked
me to dinner.

777
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,189
Can't just be because
you find me attractive.

778
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,320
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

779
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,156
You spoke to Kelli.

780
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,532
You know her father
traded with the rebels.

781
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,951
Why did they kill him?

782
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,917
Between you and I,

783
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,960
the UN may be moving
out of here soon.

784
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,340
Chances are it was more
than a rebel attack.

785
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,219
Even if I did have
the authority to help,

786
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,930
it's just me and four
computer operators.

787
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,973
We just don't have
the resources.

788
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,683
I know I can
track him down.

789
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,061
It would be
a suicide mission.

790
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,563
Mukana was a known hotspot,
even before you got ambushed.

791
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,857
Let it go.

792
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,193
If it was your men,
would you let it go?

793
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,822
I've seen your records.

794
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,450
Three suspensions
during high school,

795
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,077
disciplinary action in
each of your two years

796
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,203
of junior college.

797
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,163
I had a problem
being told what to do.

798
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,749
So you joined the Marines?

799
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,376
I thought it would
help me get over that.

800
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,503
Did it?
I guess not.

801
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,381
Here I am in the
principal's office again.

802
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,177
So tell me,
how did you get here?

803
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,763
Why would you want
to know about me?

804
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,975
Clearly, you've done
your research on me.

805
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,810
Am I not allowed to know
something about you?

806
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,231
Look, I mean, if it's
too embarrassing...

807
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,607
(LAUGHS)

808
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,113
My father was a sergeant major
in the SAS at Hereford.

809
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,824
I grew up on the base.

810
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,284
That must have been fun.

811
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,744
Fun? Oh, no.

812
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,498
But it was interesting to grow
up surrounded by people

813
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,833
that had dedicated their lives

814

to something grander
than themselves.

If you go up against

832
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,039
you're going to get
yourself killed.

was what we called

840

Hell, I went through it.
It's just a test.

there was one man

who could help me
get to the rebels.

852
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,425

where the rebels were
getting these weapons,

I was shot with.

That's the kind
of something

to keep from the public.

01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,060
I decided to get
my ass down here

972
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,145
and bring him back
before he got killed.

973
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,521
Why do you care?

974
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,734
I care because
I knew your father.

975
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,070
He was my friend.
He was my teacher.

976
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,864
He taught me how
to be a sniper.

977
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,824
And he saved my life.

978
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,496
Look, I'm not going back
until I'm done here.

979
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,206
Does that include
your funeral?

980
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,166
Because you will never
see Masiello coming.

981
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,169
Then I need to make
him come to me.

982
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,421
(RINGING)

983
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,175
Hello?

984
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,593
BECKETT: Ellen.

985
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:19,761
Brandon?

986
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,138
Where the hell are you?

987
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,807
I know who killed our men.

988
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,892
I need protection.
You have to send a team
to come pick me up.

989
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,852
You know I don't have
the authority to do that.

990
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,020
I'll be right on the border.

991
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,188
An abandoned village

992
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,148
east of Van Brunt's
plantation named Uhuru.

993
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,358
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

994
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,026
Thanks.

995
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,029
You can trust her?

996
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,740
I don't have to.

997
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,951
If the conspiracy is
coming from the base,

998
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,328
it won't be legit UN force
that'll show up.

999
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,038
It'll be Masiello,
coming to kill me.

1000
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,583
Colonel, I found him.

1001
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,837
Uhuru, it's a town on
the Zimbala-DRC border.

1002
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,088
1300 today.

1003
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,174
I cannot risk any more of
the men in my command.

1004
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,260
Beckett says he has
evidence of the soldiers

1005
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,303
who ambushed his men.

1006
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,097
It takes too long
to get permission

1007
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,473
from whoever passes

1008
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,933
for today's
provisional government.

1009
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,726
We won't need
a full-scale operation.

1010
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,813
I could get him myself.

1011
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,734
You'll need a security detail.

1012
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,573
I want four of your
best men to escort her.

1013
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,325
Get in there and get out
as fast as you can.

1014
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,451
Yes, Colonel.

1015
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:26,995
Thank you, sir.

1016
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,582
(KIDS CHATTERING)

1017
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,718
I'll get the kids
across the border,

1018
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,679
then I'll come back
and help you.

1019
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,264
Not your fight,
my friend.

1020
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,934
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1021
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,103
Where will you go?

1022
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,730
Out of the Congo.

1023
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,648
Zambia. Maybe Namibia.

1024
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,318
It's good hunting there.
At least they'll be safe.

1025
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,447
Thank you.

1026
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,806
This is going
to get hairy.

1027
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,017
I'm ready.

1028
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,296
Masiello.

1029
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,099
Drive.

1030
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,872
He's not coming alone.

1031
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:35,957
You're gonna
have to engage

1032
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,083
the primary attack
house to house.

1033
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,376
Pick your spots.

1034
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,961
Is the com working?

1035
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,504
Loud and clear.
Good.

1036
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,381
And one more thing.

1037
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:48,052
Here. It's an LAR
Grizzly Mark I.

1038
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,930
I didn't know we
had an artillery piece.

1039
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,266
A little souvenir
your father gave me.

1040
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,144
In case he gets up
close and personal.

1041
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,396
Plus, it's been
chafing my ass.

1042
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,939
I don't know what to say.

1043
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,817
Let the weapon
do the talking.

1044
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,278
Where are you gonna be?

1045
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,406
I'm going high.

1046
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,824
A high hide's
never a good idea.

1047
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:10,950
Who taught you that?

1048
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:12,744
Same person who taught you.

1049
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,120
Well, you're right.

1050
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,330
This time, we're
doing the ambush.

1051
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,251
I still don't know
why you're staying in this.

1052
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:23,546
I told you.
I trained Masiello.

1053
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,423
I didn't train him
to kill Americans.

1054
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,091
What about when
you get back to Pendleton?

1055
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,760
You're gonna answer for this.

1056
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,261
Are you kidding?

1057
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,097
We're not gonna
live through this.

1058
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,489
Lovely view.

1059
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,617
Totally exposed.

1060
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,456
MILLER:
Vehicle coming. Look alive.

1061
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,223
Wait with the vehicle,
Captain Ngoba,

1062
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,974
until I make
contact with him.

1063
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,644
Yes, Lieutenant.

1064
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,481
Beckett?

1065
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,674
Beckett!

1066
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,059
Huh.

1067
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,990
(EXCLAIMING)

1068
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:15,074
(SHUSHING)

1069
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,701
Quiet.

1070
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:17,869
What the fuck
are you doing?

1071
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,370
What are you doing here?
I came to bring you back.

1072
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,746
Are you crazy?
MILLER: Beckett?

1073
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,290
Yes?

1074
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,708
Who is that young
lady looking for?

1075
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,418
Me.
Shame.

1076
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,586
What is this?

1077
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,712
It was supposed
to be an ambush,

1078
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,046
but you weren't
supposed to be here.

1079
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,131
Ambush?

1080
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,549
Tell me exactly
what's going on here.

1081
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,595
We got company.

1082
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,263
Rebels?
No.

1083
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:40,308
UN 'flage, cute red hats.
Doubt they're legit.

1084
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,226
Anyway, they're taking
position around the perimeter.

1085
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:43,394
I brought soldiers
from the base.

1086
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,896
To bring me back.

1087
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,939
It's them.

1088
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,532
It's a hit squad.

1089
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,659
They didn't come with me.

1090
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,787
Why are they
shooting at us?

1091
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,581
They're not here
to bring me back.

1092
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,707
They're here
to kill us both.

1093
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,168
Beckett!
Give yourself up.

1094
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,462
NGOBA: We have no choice.

1095
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,672
I'll explain later,
if we live.

1096
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,984
Beckett? You trained
us well, no?

1097
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,031
No! They're
still stacking up!

1098
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,491
I see you.

1099

(MEN YELLING)

1100
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,964
BECKETT: One shot, two kills.
You heard about that, huh?

1101
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,803
Are you all right?
Are you kidding?

1102
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:04,976
Lieutenant.

1103
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,478
Ellen. We're ready to move.

1104
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:09,855
What's the plan?

1105
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,358
MILLER: Half a dozen uglies
out that door, big guy.

1106
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,902
I'll draw their fire.
When I do,

1107
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,529
you go straight that way.

1108
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,072
Okay.

1109
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,865
MILLER: Make that a dozen.
Baker's dozen.

1110
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,744
Be careful.

1111
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,001
See you back at the base.

1112
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:02,908
BECKETT: Go, go, go!

1113
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,726
MILLER: Chasing down Ngoba?

1114
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,061
BECKETT: Yes.

1115
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,146
I got your back, kid.

1116
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:34,398
(GUNSHOT)

1117
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:03,594
I am not fighting you.

1118
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,137
You took us out
to that ambush.

1119
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,682
I am a soldier.
I was following orders.

1120
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,600
Where is he? Masiello!

1121
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,687
I don't know.
Who's behind this?

1122
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,021
He'll kill me.

1123
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,272
I'll kill you! Who?

1124
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,024
I have no proof.

1125
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,527
Jäger?

1126
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:20,903
Colonel Jäger?

1127
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,196
He was using Van Brunt

1128
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,031
to funnel American
weapons to the rebels.

1129
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,450
You knew this? Why
didn't you report him?

1130
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,038
Who would have
believed me? You?

1131
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,873
Would you have believed me?

1132
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,834
My men were killed.

1133
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,210
Yours and mine!

1134
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,548
And we are next.

1135
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:07,491
Miller?

1136
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,370
Miller, do you read me?

1137
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,166
My old instructor is at a loss
for words, baby Beckett.

1138
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:17,543
Masiello.

1139
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,003
That saves introductions.

1140
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,673
Last time we met,
I missed you.

1141
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,383
I'm gonna correct
that mistake.

1142
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,097
You still with me,
baby Beckett?

1143
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,201
(GROANS)

1144
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:48,926
Not good enough, Beckett.

1145
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,196
Son of the great
Thomas Beckett.

1146
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,700
It skips a generation, huh?

1147
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,744
Your father
wouldn't have missed.

1148
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,457
Let's see how you
handle night vision.

1149
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,046
What are you
dragging this out for?

1150
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,187
Well, that wasn't even close.

1151
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,734
I switched scopes,
thanks to you.

1152
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,779
Won't miss next time.

1153
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,466
(EXCLAIMS)

1154
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:53,717
(CHUCKLES)

1155
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:03,936
BECKETT: I caught up
with Lieutenant Abramowitz

1156
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,145
by midday.

1157
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,689
Miller had disappeared.

1158
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:07,773
It took most of
the next day for us

1159
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:08,899
to get back to the base

1160
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,567
where I contacted
U.S. consulate,

1161
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,695
who arranged to
bring me back here.

1162
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,321
In your debriefing,

1163
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,240
you said you believed
a coalition officer

1164
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,158
was conspiring
with the rebels.
Yes.

1165
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,702
And you identified
that officer?

1166
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,828
Yes.

1167
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,832
Sergeant Beckett,
do you have any evidence

1168
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,542
to corroborate
your accusation?

1169
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:33,507
No.

1170
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,931
I'm afraid without
further evidence,

1171
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,016
I have no choice

1172
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,643
but to proceed with
the court-martial.

1173
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:48,188
What about our men lying in
an unmarked grave in Africa?

1174
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:49,523
What are you gonna
do about that?

1175
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,984
The U.S. military can
do nothing officially.

1176
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,612
We have rules to obey,
regulations to follow.

1177
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,133
Of course, you don't.

1178
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:30,689
Peter? Hans?

1179
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,445
I think it's broken.

1180
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,532
Your security detail
won't be coming, Colonel.

1181
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,412
You killed them?

1182
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,039
I don't kill
indiscriminately.

1183
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:48,290
I'm not you.

1184
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:53,504
You must be good.

1185
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:57,549
You survived The Italian.

1186
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,384
Twice.

1187
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:00,761
He was good.

1188
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:03,388
I was better.

1189
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,848
You know how
this works, right?

1190
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:06,016
(COCKING GUN)

1191
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,142
You're here to kill me?

1192
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,352
You had my men killed.

1193
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:09,978
Ngoba told you that?

1194
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,105
Yes.

1195
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,565
Well, he's dead.

1196
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,736
Think he would
have testified?

1197
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,866
You're in this picture.

1198
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,576
Van Brunt had the same
one in his house.

1199
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,831
You two were friends,
weren't you?

1200
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,041
He helped you sell
weapons to our enemies.

1201
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,335
We sold weapons
to both sides.

1202
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,838
Congolese government
and the rebels.

1203
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,297
Why?

1204
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,299
We didn't know
who was going to win.

1205
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,468
We need leverage with whoever
is going to run the country.

1206
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:42,761
Is that right?

1207
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,805
That's the way
we have done things

1208
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,014
for hundreds of
years, Sergeant.

1209
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,141
It's called politics.

1210
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,851
Then why kill Van Brunt?

1211
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,895
Want me to be honest?
Because he knew too much.

1212
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,939
He was the only one who could
connect us to the rebels.

1213
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:55,941
And my men?
I'm sorry

1214
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:58,152
if your personal loss
is more important to you

1215
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,862
than the bigger
picture of the war.

1216
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,446
But you should know,

1217
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,198
it looks like the rebels
will be forming

1218
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,908
the new provisional
government,

1219
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,452
and because of
our policies here,

1220
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,538
they will not be hostile
to working with us.

1221
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,039
That's supposed to
make it worth it?

1222
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,499
I didn't create
the situation.

1223
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:16,086
But a scandal will not
help us win a global war.

1224
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,171
You've played
the game for so long

1225
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,297
you forget what we fight for.

1226
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,466
You know who
my father was?

1227
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,180
A real soldier,

1228
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,557
a man who honored his country
with his service,

1229
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:30,684
who did his job

1230
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:33,312
even when betrayed by cowards
and politicians like you.

1231
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,193
Okay, so kill me.

1232
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:43,947
Think that will
change anything?

1233
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,575
As long as there's war,

1234
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,285
there will be a
necessity for things

1235
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,454
most people don't
have the stomach for.

1236

(GUN CLICKS)

1237
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:55,709
Did you get all that?

1238
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,586
Even the sanctimonious part.

1239
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,381
Colonel Jäger,

under the United
Nations military code
of criminal justice,

1241
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,095
you are under arrest.

Brandon Beckett?

1243
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,160
Major Ed Gulle, Special
Operations Commander.

1244
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,871
I'm not a Marine
anymore, Major.

1245
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,125
I know. That's why
we want to talk to you.

1246
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,801
We got a job for you, kid.
