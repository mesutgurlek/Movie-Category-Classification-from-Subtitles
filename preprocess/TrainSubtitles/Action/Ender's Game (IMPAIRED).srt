I'm not so sure.

01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,806
You can't resign.

1008
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:19,908
You have an obligation
to stay here

1009
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,044
and convince him
to do his duty.

1010
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,679
My father trained horses.

1011
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,881
I've raised yearlings
since I was five years old.

1012
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:27,349
I know a thoroughbred
when I see one.

1013
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,850
We can't lose him.

1014
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,452
My God...

1015
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,721
You really don't see them
as children, do you?

1016
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,056
It used to be a war crime

1017
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,224
to recruit anyone
under the age of 15.

1018
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:38,427
When the war is over
we can have the luxury

1019
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,429
of debating the morality
of what we do.

1020
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,330
When it's over,
what will be left of the boy?

1021
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:45,233
What does it matter if
there's nothing left at all?

1022
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,102
We're using these children
to win a war.

1023
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,405
And if they come home,

1024
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,340
it's my job to put them
back together again.

1025
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,018
Thanks for what you've done.

Hello, Valentine.

1027
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,494
Why are you here?
Did something happen?

1028
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,496
They won't let me see him.

1029
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:49,264
I need you
to take a ride with me.

HYRUM: He's gonna be happy
to see you.

1031
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,378
Come on... You just
want him to re-enlist.

1032
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,113
I want him to save lives.

1033
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,249
And what about his life?

1034
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,289
ENDER: I've been sitting
by Bonzo's bed,

1035
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:48,924
waiting for him to wake up.

1036
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,094
But he may never wake up.

1037
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:55,063
Ender, he attacked first.

1038
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,432
And I fought back,
just like Peter taught me.

1039
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,404
I've had a lot of fights, Val.

1040
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:04,272
I've won because
I've always understood

1041
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:06,141
the way my enemy thinks.

1042
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,943
And when I truly
understand them...

1043
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:08,944
...you also love them.

1044
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,917
I think it's impossible
to truly understand someone

1045
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:18,486
and not love them
the way they love themselves.

1046
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:20,255
But in that moment...
You beat them.

1047
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:23,191
I destroy them.

1048
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,327
I make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again.

1049
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,167
Ender, they want me to talk
you into going back.

1050
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,270
I told them I won't cooperate.

1051
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:36,571
I don't think
you're hiding here

1052
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,640
just because you care
about Bonzo.

1053
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,508
I think you're hiding
because you're afraid.

1054
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,446
Afraid you don't know
your enemy.

1055
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:46,414
Afraid you might lose.

1056
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,883
But what if you're the next
Mazer Rackham?

1057
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:52,053
You can't hide here forever.

1058
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,457
But if you stay here,

1059
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,060
if you don't try,

1060
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,063
then we will all be lost.

1061
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,441
I'll miss you.

1062
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,246
VALENTINE: I'll miss you, too.

1063
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,436
I need to know that you will
not block my emails again.

27 years after

How long did they live here?
We're not sure.

1085

This was a forward
staging post

for their invasion of Earth.

1087
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,849
We built our base here to be
closer to their home planet,

If they're on their

do we have them contained?

For now.

If we have them boxed in,
why go to war?

For the same reason that
you kept kicking that bully

that one particular ship,

and the rest just

1175

A queen...

Who directs the worker ants.

1181

What she thinks they do.

1182
01:14:02,672 --> 01:14:04,772
Without her, they can't
think for themselves...

1183
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,174
And they die.

1184

You destroyed
the queen's ship.

1185

I must have. Yes.

1186

But you can't be certain?
No.

1187

And so the Hegemon insisted
we keep it classified.

1188

That's why they never show
the rest of the battle.

01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,853
Or my face.

Your face...

1193
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,028
You mean, why is it marked?

1194
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,699

Lost him in the war.

to speak for the dead.

Sir, have you ever
seen a queen?

1200
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:57,558
No. No one has.

1201
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,126
But if the Formics
have rebuilt their fleet,

1202
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,062
there must be more
than one queen.

1203
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:02,997
Yes, of course.
On their home planet.

when you attacked here?

Did you find one?
No.

1206

to death on the simulator!

All right. Take your seats.

In a matter of weeks

1223
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:02,056
we may be called on
to fight a real battle.

1224
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,091
Let's bring your commander
up to speed.

1225
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,229
Our latest probe images
will give you an idea

1226
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,964
of what's happening
on the enemy planet.

1227
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,808
Like us, they appear to have
a population growth rate

1228
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,777
that's unsustainable.

1229
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,646
For now, they're contained
on their planet.

1230
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,148
Time is not on our side.

1231
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,183

1233

their above-ground activity
to just a few hours a day.

1234
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,792
What's most alarming
is the rate

1235
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,994
at which their military power
is expanding.

1236
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,684
But they have not yet
moved against us.

1237
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:04,752
No.

1238
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,358
They're planning to colonize
another planet

1239
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,093
before they breed themselves
into extinction.

1240
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:13,294
Our orders are to defeat them

1241
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,896
before they pose
an irreversible threat.

1242

HYRUM: Their very existence
is a threat.

1243
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,300
Is that clear, Commander?

1244
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:24,071
Clear, sir.
Good.

1245
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:25,706
Carry on, Colonel.

1246
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,177
We will begin with
photo real simulations

1247

real battles.

Your toon leaders will
each command a battle group.

1250
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,888
You will issue orders to them.

1251
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,190
They will issue orders

1252
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,191
to their squadrons
of drone pilots.

We call her
"the little Doctor."

1264
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,952
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels.

1265

At the focus point, they reach

01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,793
Leaves nothing standing.

1269
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,895
That's the beauty
of the little Doctor.

1270
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,832
No need to identify
a specific ship for the queen.

1271

The chain reaction
takes out an entire swarm.

But I'll only get one shot.

1273

Once the Formics
see how she works,

1274
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,508
they won't clump
together again.

1275

No. I need two minutes.

What are you talking about?

01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:56,456
The Formics accessed
the game through me.

1608
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:59,359
Their thoughts. My dreams.
All mixed together.

1609
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:05,098
They were trying
to communicate.

1610
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:08,301
What are you doing?

1611
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:12,505
Go back.

1612
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,774
No.

1613
01:40:14,776 --> 01:40:16,376
Please...

1614
01:40:16,378 --> 01:40:17,610
I have to do this.
