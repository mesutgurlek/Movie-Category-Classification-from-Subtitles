they're being robbed.

168

As much as I'd like
to be able to help you,

169
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,072
you know this is
a police issue.

170
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:39,577
But this is turning into
an urgent problem for us.

171
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,379
Our drivers are scared
to death.

172

I'm not sure I understand.

173
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,084
There were more murders
and rapes in this city last year

174
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,085
than there have ever been,

175
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,286
so if you've come to tell me

176
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,556
that we have
an urgent security issue here,

177
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,757
trust me, I'm aware.

178
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,427
My people are at risk just
driving around in this city,

179

just trying to do their jobs,

180
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,697
and...

181
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,236
I've done everything
that you've asked of me.

182
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,905
It's been two years

183
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,307
since you started
investigating my company.

184
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,110
And since then, I've spent
thousands of dollars

185
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,847
hiring lawyers to provide you
with every piece of information

186
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,448
that your office has requested.

187
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,384
And I expect that you've
been asking the same

188
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,953
of my competitors.

189
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,889
So, with all this information
that you've gained,

190
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,824
we're just asking

191
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,827
do you have any idea
who's been doing this to us?

192
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:31,963
I don't.

going on for years.

So, you're right.

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,640
That means you're all
stealing from each other,

197
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,509
which, as far as I can tell,

198
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,910
is just a refreshing new take

199

to your customers

200

for the last 15 years.

please know that we respect

203
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,555
the work that you're doing
to try to help our business

204
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:02,860
But also know that I have never
taken anything from anyone.

205
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,696
So, when you say that we've...

206
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,366
We're on the same side here.

207

Well, yes and no.

208

Mr. morales, you seem like
a decent man.

210
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,014
I don't really feel comfortable
sitting here pretending like

corner of my desk isn't there.

212
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,054
So, you know, I can't go
into specifics right now,

213
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,224
but we believe that
you and your company

214
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,027
have broken the law, and that we
have evidence to prove that.

be bringing a case against you.

obviously, but, uh...

00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,842
Just some kid.

332
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,312
Lawrence is gonna be in
on Wednesday.

333
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,950
I chased him away.

334
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,420
He's not coming back.

335
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,061
Okay?

336
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,698
'Kay.

337
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,943
Now, you do this
and only this.

338
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,648
You look down at the cloth.

339
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,751
You don't say a word.

340
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,987
You just stare down
at the cloth,

341
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,490
and very slowly,

342
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,191
just start shaking your head.

343
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:00,498
Then after sitting
in silence way longer
than feels comfortable,

344
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,132
you turn,

345
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,567
and you say,

346
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,537
"I would love to run
a few numbers for you.

347
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,640
Is there somewhere
more comfortable we could sit?

348
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,309
Now, they're almost always
gonna take you to
the dining room table,

349
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,878
and they're gonna
offer you something.

350
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,248
Whatever it is,
always take the fancy option.

351
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,316
Can I get you a coffee or tea?

352
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,818
I would like a tea, please.

353
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,087
We have some homemade
lemonade or a soda.

354
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,090
I would love a lemonade.
Thank you.

355
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,358
Why?

356
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,826
Because...

357
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,928
We're never gonna be
the cheapest option,

358
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,696
so we have to be the best.

359
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,765
And they want...

360
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,866
no.

361
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,069
They need to feel that you
want the best, too.

362
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,139
That's why our trucks
are the newest or the cleanest,

363
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,009
and our drivers
are approachable.

364
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,411
Now, after you've
done the math,

365
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,914
and you've shown them
how much they can save
over the long haul

366
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:54,251
through proper maintenance,
you need to get them to sign.

367
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,820
But the problem is,
by hiring you,

368
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,923
they need to fire someone else.

369
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,591
And that's never easy.

370
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,593
So...

371
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,962
After you show them the number,

372
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,565
you look up at them,

373
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,534
and stare.

374
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,440
Stare longer than you should.

375
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,189
This is not a joke.

376
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,460
You will only keep this job
if you close,

377
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,362
and that's not funny to you.

378
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,498
I'm only interested
in this company growing,

379
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,101
and when it isn't, it's not
very funny to me at all.

380
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,306
These people work very hard
for their money,

381
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,508
and these other guys
are ripping them off,

382
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,378
treating them poorly,
because they don't know.

383
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,582
So when you look them
in the eye,

384
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,386
you have to believe
that we are better,

385
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:10,728
But you will never do anything
as hard as staring someone
straight in the eye

386
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,830
and telling the truth.

387
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,010
Well, it was great to meet you.

388
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,645
Welcome.

389
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,146

It's a gun.

It's a fucking gun.

Where did you get that?

424
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,032
Your youngest daughter
found it in the bushes

425

outside our front door.

426

with the safety off.

It wasn't some kid
looking to take our TV.

I'll take care of it.

What does that mean when
you say you'll take care of it?

They know how
the industry works,

so they're gonna charge us

00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,005
expanding, I'm getting
stronger, not weaker.

494
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,108
I can't have my drivers
getting hit like this anymore.

495
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,443
It looks like I can't
protect them.

496
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,545
Well, it appears
that you can't.

497
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,451
You seem to be under a lot
of pressure from all sides,

498
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,286
which I understand.

499
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,455
Trust me,
I understand it.

500
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,491
So...

501
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,527
[Sighs]
Let me think this through.

502
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,797
But whatever decision
I come to,

503
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,432
it stands.

504
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,369
Those men show up
every morning for you

505
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,905
because I tell them to.

506
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,174
You have to realize

507
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:08,045
that these are dangerous times,
and we have to adapt.

508
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,281
It's not like when
we was driving.

509
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,752
No. No, it's not.

510
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,489
[Grunts]

511
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,326
So how did it go?

512
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,495
Not well.

513
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,398
He feels very strongly
about it.

514
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,066
I can see that.

515
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,736
I don't think he
fully understands.

516
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,709
What is there to understand?

517
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,077
Well...

518
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,383
Well, first of all,
it's illegal.

519
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,920
It's not illegal
if I say it isn't.

520
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:28,425
My responsibility is to provide
safe and timely passage

521
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:32,295
of goods and products
into and around this city.

522
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,564
And because of this situation,

523
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,233
it is appearing to those,

524
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,335
whose opinions I care about,

525
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,704
that I can't do my job.

526
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,074
That can not
and will not continue.

527
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:47,010
I-I-I'm not even sure
what you're suggesting.

528
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,545
Are you kidding me with this?

529
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:49,880
No.

530
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,316
Every driver in your fleet
gets a handgun.

531
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,920
- And a permit?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,655
When?

533
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,257
By Friday.

534
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,160
Are the permits legit?

535
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,829
That depends on
what they do with it.

536
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,464
They kill their wife with them,
then no.

537
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,832
Then that is
a very fake permit,

538
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,800
and I'll walk away
very quickly.

539
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,804
But they just need to show that
they're defending themselves,

540
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,273
and it'll stop.

541
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,643
Who is it?

542
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,179
I don't know.

543
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,682
I don't fucking know.

544
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,120
Thank you.

545
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,791
Hey!

546
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,694
So I got this machine.

547
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:43,099
I was paying a guy
five bucks an hour
to do this with me last year.

548
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,369
Peter.

549
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,837
Yeah?

550
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,673
I need to speak with you.

551
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,609
No, I see that.

552
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,743
Look.

553
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,612
I know you've been dealing with

554
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,682
a few of your rigs
getting picked off as well,

555
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,518
but this has all gotten
way out of control.

556
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,090
There was a guy with a gun
at my house the other night.

557
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,260
My wife and children
were home at the time.

558
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,162
Everyone okay?

559
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah, I managed
to chase him off.

560
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,343
What can I do?

561
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,345
[Sighs]

562
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,580
I need to know
who's doing this.

563
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,718
- Abel...
- [Abel stammers, sighs]

564
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,953
It's one thing
to go after my trucks

565
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,556
and my drivers
and to steal from me.

566
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,958
This is different.

567
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,495
Have you ever had to deal
with anything like this?

568
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,631
A bunch of thugs
invaded my home

569
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,299
when I was a baby.

570
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,934
Nothing happened.

571
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,336
They were trying
to scare my father.

572
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,006
They ended up just leaving.
We never found out who it was.

573
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,540
But after that,

574
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,677
we moved to a fortress,

575
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,145
just like this.

576
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,750
And those guys who let you in,

577
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,986
they're here to shoot anyone
who isn't invited.

578
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,922
Yes, well, I refuse
to live my life that way.

579
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,491
I won't do it.

580
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,795
I want more than this.

581
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,330
I know you do.

582
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,404
My father's in jail,
as you know.

583
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,705
And...

584
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:31,441
I always wanted to conduct
myself differently than he did.

585
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,942
And you have.

586
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,112
Almost exclusively, yes.

587
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,550
I know why he did what he did,

588
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,919
'cause at the time,
it's easier.

589
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,521
But it's not.

590
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,923
Yes, it is.

591
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,077
[Woman over radio]
<i>Where is he now?</i>

592

[Man over radio]
<i>I just dropped him off</i>
<i>at the hospital.</i>

<i>I think you should come on in.</i>

[Knocking on door]
Hey.

596
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,659
They just got another truck.

597
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,194
I know.

598
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,296
Who was driving?

599
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,997
Leo.

600
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,866
Is he alright?

601
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,102
Yes.

602
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,340
You know,
driver's security aside,

603
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:41,745
this shit is having
a significant financial effect
on this company.

604
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,613
It-it can't continue.

605
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,981
Oh, I know.

606
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,617
How was your talk?

607
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,286
I spoke with him afterward.

608
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,522
I said I wouldn't do it.

609
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,996
I don't think we're in
a position to say that.

610
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,999
What's that?

611
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:03,900
Why don't you take a walk
with me?

612
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,368
Come on.

613
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,805
[Stammering]
Are you serious with this?
This is what it's come to?

614
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:12,142
We have to walk around outside
like we're fucking gangsters?

615
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,711
I am.

616
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,080
And it is.

617
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,492
It looks like we must do this.

618
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,628
Must?

619
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,296
Yeah, or they'll shut us down.

620
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,000
These men,
they work for me.

621
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,736
The trucks they drive,
the customers they serve,

622
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,138
it's all here
because I built this.

623
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,740
That's true.

624
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,074
Until it isn't.

625
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,212
The last guy in the world
that we want problems with

626
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:52,015
is the head
of the fucking teamsters.

627
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:55,251
We're out of business
in a month if they tell
these guys to walk.

628
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,553
We don't have the cash.

629
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:59,556
It will be the end of everything
we have worked for.

630
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,591
If one of these guys
shoots someone,

631
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,827
they're gonna
bring me down for it.

632
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,995
I'm not gonna do it.

633
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,497
I'll talk to him.

634
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,835
We need to close this deal.

635
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,736
We cannot stay like this
any longer.

636
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,339
We have to close
on that property.

637
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,475
We're so weak right now.

638
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,548
Why do you want this so badly?

639
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,020
Because I've got
my entire savings at risk
on this deposit...

640
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,389
No, no, no,
I don't mean the deposit.

641
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,225
I mean... this.

642
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,826
Why do you want it?

643
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,295
Have you ever thought about it?

644
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:43,600
I've thought about it every day
for the last five years.

645
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:47,003
That place has just been sitting
right across that fence
mocking me...

646
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,005
I'm not talking
about that place.

647
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,574
I-I just meant... everything.

648
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,644
Why do you want it so much?

649
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,581

do you know Ian Thompson,
one of our new vps.

00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,661
- Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:14,999
Good.

656
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,536
Alright.

658
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,473
So, what can I
get you to drink?

659
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,108

- I'll be right back.

661
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,946
So...

662
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,247
How are you?

663
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,483
We've been better,

664
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,218
but we're good.

665
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,020
Yes, I heard about that.

666
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,721
If you stay in business
long enough,

667
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,156
it's bound to happen eventually.

668
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,592
Well, that's exactly right,
Arthur.

669
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,128
That's why we wanted
to sit down with you tonight

670
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,497
and be up front about
everything that's going on.

671
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,999
Make sure you understand
the nature of the complaints

672
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,502
and that,
even in a worst case scenario,

673
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,771
we'll move forward with very
comfortable capital on hand.

674
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,006
Yes, but you should know,
Arthur,

675
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,776
that this man has been
digging through our industry

676
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,812
looking for anything
it can find for the last
two years now.

677
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:06,049
And the thought that
he would single us out,

678
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,650
it's ridiculous.

679
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:08,785
Thank you.

680
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,956
I run a fair
and clean business,

681
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,358
and we follow every
standard industry practice,

682
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,961
and I will fight till
my last breath to prove that.

683
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,095
But...

684
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,164
Don't think for a moment
that I'm gonna let this mess

685
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,766
interfere with our plans
to grow.

686
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,636
And we need to know
that you're standing with us.

687
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:27,704
Yes.

688
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:32,842
What is it about this property
that makes you feel
it's so integral?

689
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,811
That you can't put it off until

690
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,614
after all these legal matters
are settled?

691
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,251
That's a very good question.

692
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,989
This property gives us
many things.

693
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:48,625
First, access to the river,

694
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,627
so I can bring in
my fuel directly

695
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,829
from any provider
in the world

696
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,297
straight to my tanks.

697
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,735
Second, it has over ten million
gallons of storage capacity,

698
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:02,038
so I can buy in the summers,
when the price is low,

699
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,140
and sell to my customers,
and more importantly,

700
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,442
my competitors
when the price is high.

701
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,778
I will no longer
just drive trucks.

702
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,613
I will control my fate.

703
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,785
But the real answer
to your question

704
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,721
is that when it feels
scary to jump, Ian,

705
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,591
that is exactly when you jump.

706
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:24,994
Otherwise, you end up
staying in the same place
your whole life,

707
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,829
and that, I can't do.

00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,104
that we will continue to be.

711
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,674
Good.
- Thanks, Arthur.

712

I don't think we have to eat.

Looking for a loan.

I certainly expect the terms
to be in your favor.

But if your grandfather trusted
you with his company,

then I would be willing to
trust you as my lien holder.

a million-and-a-half dollars.

thanking you for your

to bring in the driver.

Yeah, we didn't expect him
to react that way.

1169
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:09,663
Yeah well, the officers there
didn't set it up very well on
their end, either.

1170
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:11,532

It has been brought to our

01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,974
beneficial on your end
to resolve this issue

1174

in a time-sensitive way.

1175

It's a possibility.

for you to review.

before you got here,

and...

1204
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,909
Of course everyone in this room
is fully capable of lying

1205

to their own mothers on their
deathbeds [Laughs nervously],

1206
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:16,884
but the conclusion that we've
come to... and I should say that

1207
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:21,955
we feel fairly certain after
a very Frank conversation,

1208
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:26,293
that the guys
who are doing this...

1209
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:30,631
That they're not actually
working for anyone
in this room.

1210
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:33,901
As you know, there are plenty
of other smaller providers

1211
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,170
in the area that might have
something to do with it,

who are not here tonight.

1213

Peter, thank you.

1214
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,277
Thank you.
That may be true.

1215
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:51,785
But over the last six months,
110,000 gallons of fuel

1216
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,822
have been stolen from me
and my family.

1217
01:24:56,724 --> 01:25:00,761
Now the reason we asked bill
to get you all here,

1218
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,629
is because...

1219
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:05,466
The people at this table
are the only people

1220
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:08,202
within two hundred Miles
of here that have the ability

1221
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:14,074
to purchase and store
that kind of quantity.

1222

So...

1223

No matter what bullshit you've
been telling each other...

1633
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,417
Yes.

1634
01:58:47,386 --> 01:58:49,521
You've come a very long way...

1635
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:52,858
In a very short time.

1636
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,826
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

1638
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:00,799
But you should know that I have
always taken the path
that is most right.

1639
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,367
The most right?

1640
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:04,636
The result...

1641
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:07,472
Is never in question for me.

1642
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:11,543
Just what path do you take
to get there.

1643
01:59:11,545 --> 01:59:15,247
And there is always one
that is most right.

1644
01:59:15,249 --> 01:59:17,415
And that is what this is.

1645
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,587
I hope so.

1646
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:30,662
