Huh! Where'd they run it,
in the razor ads?

147
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,051
Huh? Oh, that.

148
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,678
That's an old business.
You'll get used to that.

[Clicking Tongue]

with the pincher's, huh?

154
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,853
You've got an office for this
sort of thing, Johnny.
Why don't you use it?

155
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,914
There you are, Tony.
That's a bonus.

156
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,155
Hey, that's a nice feel.
That was a fine job, Tony.

157
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,322
Remember,
that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.

158
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,457
You stick to me and do
what I say, play square,

159
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,524
you'll be walkin' around
with lace pants and a gold hat.

160
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,593
You know what I mean?
Sure, I know.

161
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,198
Now, listen, I'm gonna
cut you in on a percentage.
Give you a raise... double.

162
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,438
The South Side is rollin'
in jack. All we gotta do
is step in and take it.

163
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,502
Yeah, and have some fun
with O'Hara too, huh?

164
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,346
Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy
to buck now.

165
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,408
There's lots of jack
on the North Side.

166
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,080
Now listen, you.
You let me think up the ideas.

167
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,022
I'll take care
of that big hop in my own way
when the time comes.

168
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,582
I say we stay out
of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone.

169
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,222
And what I say goes.
Don't ever forget that.

170
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,058
You're the boss.
That's better.

171
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,163
From now on, next to me,
the boys take orders
from you.

172
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,801
Yeah, me and you, huh?
That's fine talk, boss.

173
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:49,712
Here. Have a cigar.
There'll be plenty of work
for everybody.

174
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,114
Costillo slowed down
too much.
Yeah. [Spits]

175
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,675
And now he come
to a dead stop.

176
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,881
Here. You'd better
smoke one of mine.

177
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,859
Mmm.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?

178
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,023
I don't like cigar smoke
in my room. Do you mind?

179
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,829
Listen, I'm gonna hold off
that meeting with the boys
a couple of days.

180
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,370
After Big Louie's funeral,
it's better.
You know what I mean?

181
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,805
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good.

182
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,810
And I want you to send some
flowers... a cross of white
carnations from me, see?

183
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,403
Yeah, and I send
lotsa purple bunch.

184
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,711
Big Louie, he always
liked purple.

185
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,809
Why don't you go
and do it now?

186
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,248
You'd better
make that meetin' Monday.

187
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,520
Tell all the guys
that want to run beer
on the South Side to be there.

188
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,859
Tell 'em I'm gonna make
a speech. Know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.

189
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,526
Well, good-bye, Poppy.
See ya again.

190
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,206
She don't like
anybody but me.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,340
She's a very busy girl.

192
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,406
Expensive, huh?

193
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,587
Here you are, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh,

194
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,494
for just standing outside
and listenin' to a gun go off?

195
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,055
Cinch. When are we
gonna get some more?
We'll get plenty.

196
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,228
There's business just waitin'
for some guy to come
and run it right.

197
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,363
And I got ideas.
We're workin' for Lovo,
ain't we?

198
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,810
Lovo. Who's Lovo? Just some guy
who's a little bit more smart
than Big Louie. That's all.

199
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,440
Hey, that guy is soft.
I could just see it
in his face.

200
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,485
He's got a setup, that's all,
and we gotta wait.

201
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,680
Someday I'm gonna run
the whole works.

202
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,054
Yeah? Remember, those
monkeys on the North Side
ain't so soft.

203
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,060
Oh, yeah? Say,
they're satisfied,
ain't they?

204
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,688
Why didn't they come
and take Big Louie
before we did?

205
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,755
Listen, Little Boy.

206
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,200
In this business, there's only
one law you gotta follow
to keep outta trouble.

Because I want it. That's why.

bring you lotsa trouble.

There's nothing wrong
with his giving it to me.

Tony wants me
to have a good time.
Oh, yes? You listen!

but what he thinks...
Oh, he's got lotsa tricks.

He no give money
to nobody for nothing.
He would to his sister.

Sister. Huh!
That make no difference.

249

To him, you're just
another girl.

250
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,211
Someday when he need you,
he mix you up
in his business...

just like anyone else,

bad like him.

anything I don't want to.

It was a big, black car

gave 'em the works.

make jokes about him.

They had some excuse for glorifying
our old western bad men.

They can't enforce laws

Pass a federal law...

in the same class as drugs
