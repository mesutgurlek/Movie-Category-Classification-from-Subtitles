73
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,073
[Man On Radio] There have been genetic
studies on beef cattle.

74
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,409
There has been concern
the degree of heritability...

75
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,078
of economically important traits
such as rate of growth...

76
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,080
meat conversion
and carcass quality.

77
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:25,376
Thin breeds,
and in many cases Herefords...

78
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,671
they have been selected
for these traits.

79
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:32,466
Findings have shown generally
that such traits are highly heritable.

80
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,635
This is consistent
with similar studies...

81
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,264
conducted elsewhere
around the country.

82
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,100
On the other hand,
some other traits...

83
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,269
such as fertility
and calf-survival rate-

84
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:44,479
low inheritability.

85
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,691
Heterosis,
or hybrid vigor...

86
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,235
may be an important factor
in these latter traits...

87
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,404
and the crossing
of genetic unlikes...

88
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,991
produces heterosis
for best crossbreeding.
