Golitsyn was doing tonight.

Since your father's death,

your family's farm
has been in receivership,

identities do you think Hunt has?

584

The first is sound sensitive -

anything above a whisper
sets it off.

The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

587
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,756
Even the body heat of an
unauthorised person in the room

588
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,674
will trigger it if the temperature
rises just a single degree.

That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning

The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

593
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,959
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm,

594

and any one of these systems,

I think this is what
you're looking for.

Hello, Max.

959
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:34,192
My lawyers are going to have
a field day with this.

Entrapment,
jurisdictional conflict...

01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,515
Well, maybe we'll just leave
the courts out of this one.

01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,075
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

About what?

The apology
from the Justice Department,

VIP treatment,
you know, the whole 9 yards.

971

Well, my mom was a little confused

972
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,079
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald

for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

To you, Luther.

For being off the disavowed list.

Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

Man, I don't know.

983
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,108
I'm going to miss
being disreputable.

984
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,760
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better,

985
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,193
I'll always think of you that way.

Excuse me. Mr Hunt?

Would you like to watch a movie?

Oh, uh... no, thank you.
