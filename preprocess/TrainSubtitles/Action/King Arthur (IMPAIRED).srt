1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,834
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire
extended from Arabia to Britain.

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,669
But they wanted more.

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,273
More land.

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,069
More peoples
loyal and subservient to Rome.

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,394
But no people so important
as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,677
Thousands died on that field.

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,675
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth
day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,788
were members of the decimated
but legendary cavalry.

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,398
The Romans, impressed by their bravery
and horsemanship, spared their lives.

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,629
452 AD

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,352
In exchange, these warriors were
incorporated into the Roman military.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,314
Better they had died that day.

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,311
(neighing)

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,316
Father.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,311
They are here.

16
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,914
For the second part of the bargain they
struck indebted not only themselves...

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,479
The day has come.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,597
..but also their sons,
and their sons, and so on,

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,399
to serve the empire as knights.

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,750
I was such a son.

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,396
There is a legend that
fallen knights return as great horses.

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,029
He has seen what awaits you,
and he will protect you.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,954
Lancelot! Lancelot!

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,395
Lancelot.

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,274
Don't be afraid. I will return.

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,638
- How long shall we be gone?
- 15 years,

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,918
not including the months it'll take
to get to your post.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,309
Lancelot!

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,436
(all shout out "Rus!")

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,751
(Lancelot) Our post was Britain -
or at least the southern half,

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,709
for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall
built three centuries before us

32
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,032
to protect the empire from
the native fighters of the north.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,317
So, as our forefathers had done,

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,518
we made our way and reported
to our Roman commander in Britain,

35
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,910
ancestrally named for the first Artorius,

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,911
or Arthur.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,197
15 YEARS LATER

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,792
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.

39
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,873
- Our freedom, Bors.
- Mm. I can almost taste it.

40
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,234
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,952
(horse whinnies)

42
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,589
Argh!

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,318
(war cries)

44
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,679
Woads!

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,073
(uproar, swords clinking)

46
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Yaa-rgh!

47
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,473
Yah!

48
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,270
Argh!

49
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,119
Argh!

50
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,430
(triumphant cry)

51
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
Rus! Aagh!

52
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,758
Rus!

53
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,992
Rus.

54
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,639
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.

55
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,508
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.

56
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,033
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...

57
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,715
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn't live here.

58
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,679
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?

59
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,838
Spill my blood with Excalibur and...

60
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,036
make this ground holy.

61
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,190
Pick it up.

62
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,075
Pick it up.

63
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,190
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.

64
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,230
That's not the bishop.

65
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,598
God help us.

66
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,399
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.

67
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,232
You're not a Christian, are you?

68
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,355
Does this really work?

69
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,514
(mutters gibberish)

70
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,759
Nothing.

71
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,035
Maybe I'm not doin' it right.

72
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,673
(man chuckling) Arthur!

73
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,435
Arthur Castus. Your father's image.

74
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,875
I haven't seen you since childhood.

75
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,316
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain.

76
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,990
I see your military skills
are still of use to you.

77
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,071
Your device worked.

78
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,789
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.

79
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,952
And these are the great Sarmatian knights
we have heard so much of in Rome.

80
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,596
I thought the Woads control
the north of Hadrian's Wall.

81
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,035
They do, but they
occasionally venture south.

82
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,033
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain
has only increased their daring.

83
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,715
- (man) Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.

84
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,472
Men who want their country back.

85
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,472
- Who leads them?
- He's called Merlin.

86
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,755
A dark magician, some say.

87
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,798
Tristan, ride ahead
and make sure the road is clear.

88
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,078
Please do not worry, Bishop.
We will protect you.

89
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,593
Oh.

90
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,478
I've no doubt, Commander.

91
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,471
No doubt.

92
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,318
Dozens don't worry me
nearly so much as thousands.

93
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,311
Thousands?

94
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,796
Well, now that we're free men,
I'm gonna drink till I can't piss straight.

95
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,872
- You do that every night.
- I never could piss straight.

96
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,669
Too much of myself to handle...
down there.

97
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,637
Well, it's a problem.

98
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,154
No, really, it is. It's a problem.

99
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,475
- It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.
- (all)...baby's arm holding an apple.

100
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,391
(laughter)

101
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,434
I don't like him, that Roman.

102
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,479
If he's here to discharge us,
why doesn't he just give us our papers?

103
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,677
- Is this your happy face?
- (Bors laughs)

104
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,149
Galahad, do you still
not know the Romans?

105
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,470
They won't scratch their arses
without holding a ceremony.

106
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,597
Why don't you just kill him,
and then discharge yourself after?

107
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,434
I don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

108
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,036
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.

109
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,633
- It's a part of you. It's in your blood.
- No, no, no. No.

110
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,231
As of tomorrow
this was all just a bad memory.

111
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,753
Ohh.

112
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,076
I've often thought about what going home
would mean after all this. What will I do?

113
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,071
It's different for Galahad.

114
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,357
I've been in this life longer than the other.

115
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,913
So much for home.
It's not so clear in my memory.

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,596
You speak for yourself. It's cold back there
and everyone I know is dead and buried.

117
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,116
Besides, I have, I think, a dozen children.

118
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,835
Eleven.

119
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,152
You listen. When the Romans leave here,
we'll have the run of all this place.

120
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,028
I'll be governor in my own village
and Dagonet will be my personal guard

121
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,032
and royal arse-kisser. Won't you, Dag?

122
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,795
First thing I will do when I get home is
find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.

123
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,836
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?

124
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,673
Why do you think we left in the first place?

125
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,671
(moos like a cow)

126
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,830
What about you, Lancelot?
What are your plans for home?

127
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,071
Well, if this woman of Gawain's
is as beautiful as he claims,

128
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,879
I expect to be spending
a lot of time at Gawain's house.

129
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,997
- His wife will welcome the company.
- I see. And what will I be doing?

130
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,870
Wondering at your good fortune
that all your children look like me.

131
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,794
Is that before or after I hit you with my axe?

132
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,195
(whistles)

133
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,718
Where you been, now? Where you been?

134
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,039
And what will you do, Arthur,
when you return to your beloved Rome?

135
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,873
Give thanks to God that I survived to see it.

136
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,315
You and your god! You disturb me.

137
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,358
I want peace, Lancelot. I've had enough.

138
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,751
- You should visit me.
- Ah!

139
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,229
It's a magnificent place, Rome.

140
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,756
Ordered, civilised, advanced.

141
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,193
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.

142
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,875
The greatest minds in all the lands
have come together in one sacred place

143
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,632
to help make mankind free.

144
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,311
And the women?

145
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,790
(guard) Open the gate!

146
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,153
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.

147
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,117
Lancelot.

148
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,319
Bishop, please, my quarters
have been made available to you.

149
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,834
Oh, yes. I must rest.

150
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,911
(Bors chuckles lewdly)

151
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,678
- Where have you been?
- Oh...

152
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,719
- I've been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!

153
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,597
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.

154
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,033
- You been fighting?
- Yes.

155
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,189
- You been winning?
- Yes.

156
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,191
That's my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!

157
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,714
(all cheer)

158
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,791
Pelagius.

159
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,476
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.

160
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,438
But, of course, it is to be expected.

161
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,636
(knocking)

162
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,474
Sir, I'm here to escort you
to the fortress hall.

163
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,193
When my master meets with your knights,
he must be seated last

164
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,113
and he must be seated
at the head of the table.

165
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,113
Your master can plonk his holy arse
wherever he chooses.

166
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,794
(laughter)

167
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,351
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.

168
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,316
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?

169
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,954
Arthur says for men to be men
they must first all be equal.

170
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,474
I was given to understand
there would be more of you.

171
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,189
There were. We have been
fighting here for 15 years, Bishop.

172
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,555
Oh, of course.

173
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,952
Arthur and his knights
have served with courage

174
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,388
to maintain the honour of Rome's empire
on this last outpost of our glory.

175
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,155
Rome is most indebted
to you noble knights.

176
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,198
To your final days
as servants to the empire.

177
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,669
Day. Not days.

178
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,716
The Pope's taken
a personal interest in you.

179
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,189
He inquires after each of you,

180
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,469
and is curious to know if your knights have
converted to the word of Our Saviour or...?

181
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,519
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
I have never questioned that.

182
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,477
Of course, of course.

183
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,790
They are pagans. Hm?

184
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,956
For our part, the Church
has deemed such beliefs innocence,

185
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,794
but you, Arthur,
your path to God is through Pelagius?

186
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,715
- I saw his image in your room.
- He took my father's place for me.

187
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,951
His teachings on free will and equality
have been a great influence.

188
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,554
I look forward to our reunion in Rome.

189
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,039
Ah.

190
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,635
Rome awaits your arrival
with great anticipation.

191
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,392
You are a hero.

192
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,268
In Rome, you will live out your days
in honour and wealth.

193
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,915
Alas...

194
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,514
Alas, we are all but players
in an ever-changing world.

195
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,196
Barbarians from every corner
are almost at Rome's door.

196
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,593
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father
have decided to remove ourselves

197
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,719
from indefensible outposts,
such as Britain.

198
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,953
What will become of Britain
is not our concern any more.

199
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,873
I suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.

200
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,030
- Saxons?
- Yes.

201
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,193
In the north a massive
Saxon incursion has begun.

202
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,478
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- And only kill everything.

203
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,553
So you would just
leave the land to the Woads.

204
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,392
And I risked my life for nothing.

205
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,674
Hm.

206
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,591
Gentlemen,

207
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,117
your discharge papers with safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

208
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,875
But first, I must have a word
with your commander.

209
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,753
- In private.
- We have no secrets.

210
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,951
(slams table)

211
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,155
Come. Let's leave Roman business
to Romans.

212
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,870
Let it go, Bors.

213
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,438
Rome has issued a final order
for you and your men.

214
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,919
Final order?

215
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,516
You are to travel north
to rescue the family of Marius Honorius

216
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,435
and return, in particular,
with Marius's son, Alecto.

217
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,559
Alecto is the Pope's
favourite godchild and pupil.

218
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,829
It is his destiny to become a bishop,
perhaps even pope one day.

219
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,117
On this day you ask this of my men.

220
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,631
On this day.

221
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,389
They have risked their lives for 15 years
for a cause not of their own.

222
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,792
And now, on the day they are to be
liberated, you send them on a mission

223
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,713
which is far more dangerous
than any other they have undertaken.

224
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,598
You tell me, Bishop,
how do I go to my men and tell them

225
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,478
that instead of freedom I offer death?

226
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,997
If your men are truly the knights
of legend, perhaps some will survive.

227
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,957
If it is God's will.

228
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,951
Your men want to go home,

229
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,830
and to get home they need to cross
the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.

230
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,433
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.

231
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,991
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?

232
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,150
Rome? God himself?

233
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,310
Everything I've done has been
for the Church and for Rome.

234
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,073
Do not mistake a loyal soldier
for a fool, Germanius.

235
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,948
Would you leave a defenceless
Roman boy, destined to lead our Church,

236
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,270
at the hands of the Saxons?

237
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,076
Fulfill this mission, and your men
will receive their discharge.

238
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,310
Their papers will be waiting here
the moment they return.

239
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,879
You have my word.

240
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,637
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,
for I will hold you to it.

241
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,595
Break it, and no Roman legion,

242
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,711
papal army,

243
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,509
nor God himself will protect you.

244
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,077
That is my word.

245
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,437
- (man) She gave me fleas.
- (man #2) You better hope they're fleas.

246
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,554
Best of three.

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,994
(baby mewling)

248
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,752
Who wants another drink?

249
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,274
- (Lancelot) Ahh.
- (sighs)

250
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,316
When you gonna leave Bors
and come home with me?

251
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,868
My lover is watching you.

252
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,639
Mmm...

253
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,234
You look nothing like him.

254
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,912
You're all Bors.

255
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,755
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?

256
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,992
I aim for the middle.

257
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,271
Oh, they want more!

258
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,875
- Here. Be a mother to your son.
- Oh, come here.

259
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,470
Dagonet, where you been?
We've got plans to make.

260
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,717
Here, please. Sing.

261
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,119
- No.
- Just a last one.

262
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,078
- No, I'm trying to work.
- Come sing. Shut up!

263
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,674
Vanora will sing.

264
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,513
- (Vanora) No, no.
- (chants of "Sing!")

265
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,995
- (man) Sing about home.
- (Gawain) Don't drop the baby.

266
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,439
§ Land of bear and land of eagle

267
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,672
§ Land that gave us birth and blessing

268
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,719
§ Land that called us ever homewards

269
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,713
§ We will go home across the mountains

270
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,759
§ We will go home
We will go home

271
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,038
§ We will go home across the mountains

272
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,954
§ We will go home singing our song...

273
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,270
(singing fades)

274
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,348
§..hear our singing, hear our longing

275
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,718
§ We will go home across the mountains

276
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,157
§ We will go home
We will go home...

277
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,435
(singing fades)

278
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,352
Arthur!

279
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,755
Arthur!

280
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,228
Arthur! You're not
completely Roman yet, right?

281
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,436
Rus!

282
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,390
Knights...

283
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,710
brothers in arms...

284
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,756
your courage has been tested
beyond all limits.

285
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,068
Yes.

286
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,355
But I must ask you now for one further trial.

287
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,112
Drink.

288
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,196
We must leave on a final mission for Rome
before our freedom can be granted.

289
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,313
Above the wall, far in the north,
there is a Roman family in need of rescue.

290
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,470
They are trapped by Saxons.

291
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,755
Our orders are to secure their safety.

292
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,229
Let the Romans take care of their own.

293
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,880
Above the wall is Woad territory.

294
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,310
Our duty to Rome,
if it was ever a duty, is done.

295
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,151
Our pact with Rome is done.

296
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,916
Every knight here
has laid his life on the line for you.

297
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,513
For you.

298
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,558
And instead of freedom
you want more blood?

299
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,835
Our blood?

300
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,070
You think more of Roman blood
than you do of ours?

301
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,878
Bors! These are our orders.

302
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,635
We leave at first light, and when we return
your freedom will be waiting for you.

303
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,392
A freedom we can embrace with honour.

304
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,516
I am a free man!

305
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,556
I will choose my own fate!

306
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,279
Yeah, yeah.
We're all going to die someday.

307
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,591
If it's a death from a Saxon hand
that frightens you, stay home.

308
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,671
Listen, if you're so eager to die,
you can die right now!

309
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,751
- Enough. Enough!
- I've got something to live for!

310
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,559
The Romans have broken their word.

311
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,155
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.

312
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,113
I'll prepare.

313
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,077
Bors?

314
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,276
- You coming?
- Of course I'm coming!

315
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,432
Can't let you go on your own!
You'll all get killed!

316
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,993
I'm just saying what you're all thinking!

317
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,191
Vanora'll kill me.

318
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,231
And you, Gawain?

319
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,391
I'm with you.

320
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,594
Galahad as well.

321
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,073
O merciful God,
I have such need of your mercy now.

322
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,317
Not for myself, but for my knights,

323
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,630
for this is truly their hour of need.

324
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,233
Deliver them from the trials ahead,

325
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,438
and I will repay you a thousandfold
with any sacrifice you ask of me.

326
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,916
And if, in your wisdom,

327
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,356
you should determine that that sacrifice
must be my life for theirs,

328
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,479
so they may once again taste the freedom
that has so long been denied to them,

329
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,596
I will gladly make that covenant.

330
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,389
My death will have a purpose.
I ask no more than that.

331
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,438
Why do you always talk to God
and not to me?

332
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,830
Oh, pray to whomever you pray
that we don't cross the Saxons.

333
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,311
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?

334
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,630
I don't like anything
that puts a man on his knees.

335
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,439
No man fears to kneel
before the god he trusts.

336
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,988
Without faith, without belief in something,
what are we?

337
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,514
To try and get past the Woads
in the north is insanity.

338
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,433
- Them we've fought before.
- Not north of the wall!

339
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,832
How many Saxons? Hm?

340
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,956
How many?!

341
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,159
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?

342
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,832
These people need our help.

343
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,673
- It is our duty to bring them out.
- I don't care about your charge,

344
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,799
and I don't give a damn about
Romans, Britain or this island.

345
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,078
If you desire to spend eternity in this place,
Arthur, so be it,

346
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,037
but suicide cannot be chosen for another!

347
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,998
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, I choose life!

348
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,674
And freedom for myself and the men!

349
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,991
How many times in battle have we
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?

350
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,277
Outnumbered, outflanked,
yet still we triumph.

351
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,989
With you at my side, we can do so again.

352
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,836
Lancelot, we are knights.

353
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,435
What other purpose do we serve
if not for such a cause?

354
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,796
Arthur, you fight for a world
that will never exist.

355
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,393
Never.

356
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,199
There will always be a battlefield.

357
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,352
I will die in battle.

358
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,954
Of that I'm certain.

359
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,112
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.

360
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,673
But if it be this one,

361
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,035
grant me a favour.

362
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,032
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.

363
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,473
Burn me.

364
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,394
Burn me and cast my ashes
to a strong east wind.

365
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,111
(woman screaming)

366
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,030
Don't touch their women.

367
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,909
We don't mix with these people.

368
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,275
What kind of offspring
do you think that would yield?

369
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,952
Weak people.

370
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,951
Half people.

371
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,950
I will not have our Saxon blood
watered down by mixing with them.

372
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,556
According to our laws, no man
may deny me the spoils of our conquest!

373
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,551
He speaks the truth, Father.

374
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,557
My lord! O, my lord!

375
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,676
God's thanks, my lord.

376
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,318
Thank you.

377
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,032
Thank you.

378
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,919
Kill her.

379
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,478
(wails)

380
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,314
No! No!

381
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,960
(softly) Are you challenging me?

382
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,477
If you want to challenge me,
you have to have a sword in your hand.

383
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,431
As long as my heart beats,
I rule and you hold your tongue.

384
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,910
Or I'll cut it out.

385
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,270
(neighing)

386
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,990
We are three days' march from
the Great Wall, if we camp at night.

387
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,275
We won't camp.

388
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,033
The wall - what troops are stationed there?

389
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,634
Light Roman infantry

390
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,280
and possibly Sarmatian knights.

391
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,952
Arthur Castus is their leader.

392
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,235
Arthur? Who is this Arthur?

393
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,155
It is said he has never been defeated
in battle. It is said he is a great warrior.

394
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,831
Why should I trust you?

395
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,190
You're a traitor to your own people.

396
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,477
Tell my father of the Roman estate.

397
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,471
Speak up!

398
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,199
A very high-ranking family live there.

399
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,078
They are of great importance to Rome.

400
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,233
Father, their ransom
could pay for the entire campaign.

401
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,069
I'll attack from the north
with the main army.

402
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,551
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.

403
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,596
Burn every village, kill everybody.

404
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,269
Never leave behind you a man, woman
or child who can ever carry a sword.

405
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,592
Saxon.

406
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,870
How many?

407
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,993
Thousands.

408
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,391
(horse whinnying)

409
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,352
(Tristan) Woads. They're tracking us.

410
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,191
(Arthur) Where?

411
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,872
Everywhere.

412
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,272
Yaah!

413
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,359
Get back!

414
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,391
Get back!

415
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,953
This way!

416
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,911
(war cries)

417
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,278
Yaah!

418
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,551
What are you waiting for?

419
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,792
Inish.

420
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,996
Devil ghosts.

421
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,029
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn't want us dead.

422
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,272
We should have killed them, Merlin.

423
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,874
There might be a purpose
for Artorius and his Knights.

424
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,877
No!

425
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,193
He is our enemy!

426
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,952
So is the Saxon!

427
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,951
(clap of thunder)

428
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,720
(Gawain groaning)

429
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,236
Oh, I can't wait to leave this island.

430
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,710
If it's not raining, it's snowing.
If it's not snowing, it's foggy.

431
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,869
And that's the summer!

432
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,919
The rain is good.
Washes all the blood away.

433
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,036
Doesn't help the smell.

434
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,750
Hey, Bors, do you intend to take Vanora
and all your little bastards back home?

435
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,037
Oh, I'm trying to avoid that decision...

436
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,031
by getting killed.

437
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,315
Dagonet, she wants to get married
and give the children names.

438
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,753
Women!

439
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,149
The children already have names,
don't they?

440
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,231
Just Gilly.

441
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,710
It was too much trouble,
so we gave the rest of them numbers.

442
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,678
That's interesting.
And I thought you couldn't count.

443
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,871
You know, I never thought
I'd get back home alive.

444
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,431
Now I've got the chance,
I... I don't want to leave my children.

445
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,274
- You'd miss 'em too much.
- I'll take them with me.

446
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,990
I like the little bastards.
They mean something to me.

447
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,799
Especially number three.

448
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,273
- He's a good fighter.
- That's because he's mine.

449
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,593
I'm going for a piss.

450
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,591
(laughter)

451
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,116
- (guard) Who are you?
- I am Arthur Castus,

452
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,795
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,
sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.

453
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,950
Open the gate.

454
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,949
(man) It is a wonder you have come.

455
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,555
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.

456
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,234
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.

457
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,029
Our orders are to evacuate you
immediately.

458
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,917
But that... that is impossible.

459
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,710
- Which is Alecto?
- I am Alecto.

460
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,955
Alecto is my son.

461
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,318
And everything we have is here in the land
given to us by the Pope of Rome.

462
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,997
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.
- They're invading from the north.

463
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,878
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have. Us.

464
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,872
- We leave as soon as you're packed.
- I refuse to leave.

465
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,348
Go back to work! All of you!

466
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,034
- You heard! Go!
- All right, all right.

467
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,513
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!

468
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,791
Go back!

469
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,629
If I fail to bring you and your son back,
my men can never leave this land.

470
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,233
So you're coming with me

471
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,836
if I have to tie you to my horse and drag
you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.

472
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,956
My lord.

473
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,349
Lady, my knights are hungry.

474
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,832
Go.

475
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,319
Come!

476
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,989
Come. Let us go, hm?

477
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,231
(man) Sir, you're famous.
You're Arthur, aren't you?

478
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,392
I'm Ganis. I'm a good fighter and I'm smart.
I'd serve you proudly.

479
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,471
Are you from Rome?

480
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,471
From hell.

481
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,598
- Sir.
- Who is this man?

482
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,274
He's our village elder.

483
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,669
What is this punishment for?

484
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,230
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.

485
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,955
Most of the food we grow
is sent out by sea to be sold.

486
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,759
He asked that we keep
a little more for ourselves, that's all.

487
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,479
My arse has been snappin' at the grass
I'm so hungry!

488
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,155
You're from Rome. Is it true
that Marius is a spokesman for God

489
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,515
and that it's a sin to defy him?

490
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,474
I tell you now.

491
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,596
Marius is not of God.

492
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,674
And you, all of you,
were free from your first breath!

493
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,678
Help this man.

494
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,149
Help him!

495
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,199
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army
is coming this way.

496
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,078
They will show no mercy, spare no one.

497
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,151
Those of you who are able
should gather your things

498
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,435
and begin to move south
towards Hadrian's Wall.

499
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,954
Those unable shall come with us.

500
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,679
You, serve me now.
Get these people ready.

501
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,591
(Ganis) Right, you heard him.

502
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,319
You go grab enough food and water
for the journey.

503
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,992
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!

504
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,751
Come on, hurry.

505
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,758
They have flanked us to the east.

506
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,673
They're coming from the south,
trying to cut off our escape.

507
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,193
They'll be here before nightfall.

508
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,953
- How many?
- An entire army.

509
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,031
And the only way out is to the south?

510
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,473
East.

511
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,950
There is a trail heading east
across the mountains.

512
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,514
It means we have to cross behind Saxon
lines, but that's the one we should take.

513
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,039
Arthur, who are all these people?

514
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,031
They're coming with us.

515
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,512
Then we'll never make it.

516
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,911
(distant drums beating)

517
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,871
- Come on, get back to work!
- Back to work!

518
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,592
Move.

519
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,631
Move.

520
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,031
Move!

521
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,719
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.

522
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,712
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.

523
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,237
(Marius) What are you doing?
Stop this!

524
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,559
Arthur, we have no time.

525
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,760
Do you not hear the drums?

526
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,111
Dagonet.

527
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,158
Agh!

528
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,271
Agh!

529
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,033
- Key.
- It is locked.

530
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,031
From the inside.

531
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,909
- You, you... go.
- (whimpers)

532
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,433
Move!

533
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,759
- Gawain.
- (man chanting) Exaudi orationem meam.

534
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,431
Exaudi orationem meam.

535
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,470
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis
et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.

536
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,159
Who are these defilers
of the Lord's temple?

537
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,151
Out of the way.

538
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,792
The work of your god.

539
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,957
Is this how he answers your prayers?

540
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,076
See if there's any still alive.

541
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,517
How dare you set foot in this holy place?

542
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,957
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!

543
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,557
- (Arthur) This one's dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.

544
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,757
And you.
You even move, you join him.

545
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,194
Arthur!

546
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,192
You must not fear me.

547
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,989
Water! Give me some water!

548
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,711
His arm is broken.

549
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,911
And his family?

550
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,071
She's a Woad.

551
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,231
I'm a Roman officer.

552
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,031
You're safe now.

553
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,630
- You're safe.
- Stop what you are doing!

554
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,634
What is this madness?

555
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,473
- They're all pagans here!
- So are we.

556
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,279
They refuse to do the task
God has set for them!

557
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,952
They must die as an example!

558
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,316
You mean they refused to be your serfs!

559
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,118
You are a Roman.

560
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,838
You understand.

561
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,717
And you are a Christian.

562
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,075
You! You kept her alive!

563
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,549
- (soldier) My lord!
- No! No, stop!

564
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,188
When we get to the wall
you will be punished for this heresy.

565
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,829
Perhaps I should kill you now
and seal my fate.

566
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,878
I was willing to die with them.

567
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,111
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.

568
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,476
It is God's wish
that these sinners be sacrificed.

569
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,074
Only then can their souls be saved.

570
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,592
Then I shall grant his wish.

571
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,953
- Wall them back up.
- Arthur.

572
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,794
I said wall them up!

573
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,759
Don't you see it is the will of God
that these sinners be sacrificed?

574
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,311
- Unhand me, defil... They're sinners!
- Get in there!

575
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,511
We're moving too slow.

576
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,909
The girl's not gonna make it,
and neither is the boy.

577
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,117
The family we can protect, but we're
wasting our time with all these people.

578
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,111
We're not leaving them.

579
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,149
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.

580
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,629
Then save your anger for them.

581
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,429
Is this Rome's quest or Arthur's?

582
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,071
(weak moans)

583
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,311
- Arthur.
- How is he?

584
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,673
He burns.

585
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,752
Brave boy.

586
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,032
Some of your fingers are out of place.

587
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,917
I have to push them back.

588
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,791
If I don't do this, there's a chance
you may never use them again.

589
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,237
- (cracking)
- (cries)

590
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,591
(cracking)

591
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,871
They tortured me.

592
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,470
With machines.

593
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,360
To make me tell them things that...
that I didn't know to begin with.

594
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,631
And then...

595
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,309
I heard your voice in the dark.

596
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,194
I am Guinevere.

597
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,430
You are Arthur...

598
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,477
of the Knights from the Great Wall.

599
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,718
I am.

600
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,756
The famous Briton
who kills his own people.

601
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,749
I found tracks coming from the south,
but none going back.

602
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,752
Horsemen travelling light and fast.

603
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,671
Could be Roman cavalry.

604
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,193
Could be knights.

605
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,636
They know we're after them.

606
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,393
They'll head east now,
through the mountains.

607
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,031
God's holy work has been defiled.
I am a servant of God!

608
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,680
No, please, I... Agh!

609
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,793
He says they walled him up in a building
and took the family.

610
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,870
Someone who goes
by the name of Artorius.

611
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,552
It's him.

612
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,074
It's Arthur.

613
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,720
Take your men east. Hunt them down.

614
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,279
I'll take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.

615
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,875
- (man) And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.

616
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,076
I am a servant of God!

617
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,232
Please, I... I am a servant of God!

618
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,718
(monk) Unhand me, you defiler!

619
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,198
(sighs)

620
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,235
Burn it all.

621
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,952
Yah!

622
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,278
My father told me great tales of you.

623
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,793
Really?

624
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,791
And what did you hear?

625
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,831
Fairy tales.

626
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,432
The kind you hear about people so brave,
so selfless, that they can't be real.

627
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,670
Arthur and his knights.

628
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,672
A leader both Briton and Roman.

629
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,037
And yet you chose your allegiance
to Rome.

630
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,758
To those who take
what does not belong to them.

631
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,673
That same Rome that took your men
from their homeland.

632
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,436
Listen, lady, do not pretend
you know anything about me or my men.

633
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,873
How many Britons have you killed?

634
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,633
As many as tried to kill me. It's the natural
state of any man to want to live.

635
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,397
Animals live! It's a natural state of any man
to want to live free in their own country.

636
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,960
I belong to this land.

637
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,315
Where do you belong, Arthur?

638
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,394
How's your hand?

639
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,720
I'll live, I promise you.

640
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,752
Is there nothing about my land
that appeals to your heart?

641
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,956
Your own father married a Briton.

642
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,112
Even he must have found something
to his liking.

643
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,511
(gallops away)

644
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,076
We'll sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.

645
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,550
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again? Yeah.

646
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,197
It is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.

647
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,556
(rustling)

648
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,312
(footsteps)

649
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,959
You betrayed me.

650
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,837
He means you no harm.

651
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,435
Peace between us this night,
Arthur Castus.

652
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,510
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.

653
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,752
The world we have known
and fought for is ended.

654
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,558
Now we must make a new world.

655
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,552
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
I shall be in Rome.

656
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,029
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.

657
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,350
My knights trust me
not to betray them to their enemy.

658
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,876
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.

659
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,632
We have no fight between us now.

660
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,950
You tell that to the knights
you killed before my eyes,

661
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,678
whose bones are buried in this earth.

662
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,159
We have all lost brothers.

663
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,038
You know nothing of the loss I speak!

664
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,872
Shall I help you remember?

665
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,873
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.

666
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,197
Mother!

667
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,191
Artorius!

668
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,431
Mother!

669
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,551
Mother!

670
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,599
I ran to the burial mound
of my father to free her.

671
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,430
To kill you.

672
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,594
Father, please let loose your sword.

673
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,031
I feel the heat of that fire
on my face even now.

674
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,278
I did not wish her dead.

675
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,239
She was of our blood, as are you.

676
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,553
If you were so determined to leave us
to slaughter, why did you save so many?

677
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,309
My men are strong,
but they have need of a true leader.

678
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,550
They believe you can do anything.

679
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,879
To defeat the Saxon
we need a master of war.

680
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,952
Why do you think
I spared you in the forest?

681
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,629
That sword you carry is made of iron
from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.

682
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,475
It was love of your mother
that freed the sword, not hatred of me.

683
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,471
Love, Arthur.

684
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,992
Seize him!

685
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,231
No!

686
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,951
No...

687
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,390
I have the boy!
