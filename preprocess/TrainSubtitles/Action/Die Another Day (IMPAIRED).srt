1
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:35,893
PUKCH'ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA

2
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,605
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to--

3
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:46,585
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q.
De-Mllitarised Zone
North Korea

4
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,997
Open the bag.

5
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,677
That will teach you to lecture me.

6
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,587
Retract the blast doors.

7
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,860
Find me a new anger therapist.

8
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,556
I am Zao.

9
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,225
You are late.

10
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,760
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking
forward to this meeting.

11
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,058
Me too.

12
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,636
My African mllitary friends owe you
many thanks, Colonel Moon.

13
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,569
Few men have the guts to trade
confllct diamonds since the U.N. embargo.

14
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,803
I know all about the U.N.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

15
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,244
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

16
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,613
From your modest collection of cars,
I wouldn't have guessed.

17
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,721
Show me the diamonds.

18
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,953
Show me the weapons.

19
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,530
Bring the weapons.

20
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,306
Hiding weapons
in the de-mllitarised zone.

21
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:53,548
-It's a bit of a minefield out there.
-America's cultural contribution.

22
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,622
One mllllon landmines. And
my hovercrafts float right over them.

23
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,165
RPGs, flamethrowers,
automatic weapons...

24
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,244
...and enough ammunition to run
a small war.

25
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,505
My diamonds?

26
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,517
Check it over quick.

27
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,020
Don't blow it all at once.

28
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,857
I have special plans
for this consignment.

29
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,711
His name is James Bond,
a British assassin.

30
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,526
Mr. Van Bierk,
let me show you something.

31
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,765
Our new tank buster.

32
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,235
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.

33
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,999
Naturally.

34
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,681
And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?

35
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:51,094
It's pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.

36
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,501
You will not llve to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

37
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,643
Then you and I have something
in common.

38
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,302
Who is it?

39
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,815
Where's my son?

40
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,450
It's the General.

41
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,279
Hello...Father.

42
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,586
Why is there a fire?

43
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,757
I'll be there in five minutes.

44
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,988
Get the weapons out of here.

45
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,025
...and kill the spy.

46
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,906
Saved by the bell.

47
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,628
My son is dead.

48
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:49,269
14 months later

49
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,594
I don't condone what they do here.

50
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,754
I don't condone what they do here.

51
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,558
Tell it to the concierge.

52
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:29,570
Still you jest.

53
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,304
Defiant to the last.

54
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:35,508
Your people have abandoned you.

55
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,850
Your very existence denied.

56
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:43,925
Why stay sllent?

57
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,764
It doesn't matter anymore.

58
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,456
Things are out of my hands.

59
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,542
We reach the end, Mr. Bond.

60
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:37,112
Spare me the unpleasantries.

61
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:38,670
Spare me the unpleasantries.

62
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:45,546
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two...

63
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:48,187
...and then you arrive.

64
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,222
A British spy, an assassin.

65
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:56,857
And now the hard-llners have
their proof.

66
00:18:57,065 --> 00:19:00,091
We cannot trust the West.

67
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,765
You....

68
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,671
You took away my son.

69
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:11,607
Your firing squad should have done
the job for me.

70
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,754
I hoped a Western education
would help him become a bridge...

71
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:23,150
...between our worlds.

72
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:27,556
But all it did was to corrupt him.

73
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:30,458
Let's get this over with, shall we?

74
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:34,529
My son had an ally in the West.

75
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:39,235
For the last time, who was it?

76
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,269
Who made him betray his country
and name?

77
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,180
The same person who betrayed me.

78
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,851
Turn around.

79
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,131
Start walking.

80
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,325
Start walking.

81
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,918
Keep walking, please.

82
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:28,920
Keep moving.

83
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,797
Zao.

84
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:48,496
I'm being traded...

85
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,506
...for you.

86
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:55,408
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

87
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:57,344
Your time will come.

88
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:00,515
Not as soon as yours.

89
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:05,490
Keep walking, please.

90
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,437
Look at him.

91
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:20,696
Double check.

92
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,534
You'd think he was some kind
of a hero.

93
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,609
-Reference nine.
-Sir.

94
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,976
Section four.

95
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:37,047
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.

96
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,352
Watch his legs now.

97
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,191
All right, let's go.

98
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,598
No biological agents in the prelim scan.
He's clean.

99
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:56,400
Pulse, 7 2. Blood pressure, 1 20/80.

100
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:02,137
lndications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.

101
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,009
Scorpion venom.

102
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:06,684
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.

103
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:09,183
They'd sting him
then administer the antidote.

104
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:12,357
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

105
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,686
Liver not too good.
lt's definitely him then.

106
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,928
Morning.

107
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:37,574
Welcome back.

108
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,620
Such hospitallty.

109
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,465
You don't seem too pleased to see me.

110
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:05,369
If I'd had my way, you'd still be
in North Korea.

111
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:10,509
Your freedom came at too high a price.

112
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,251
Zao.

113
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,717
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

114
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:20,722
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.

115
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:22,223
And now he's free.

116
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:27,288
I never asked to be traded.

117
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,832
I'd rather die than let him loose.

118
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:33,868
-You had cyanide.
-Threw it away years ago. What is this?

119
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,798
The top American agent...

120
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:39,876
...in the North Korean High Command
was executed a week ago.

121
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,708
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

122
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,975
-And they think it's me?
-You were the only inmate.

123
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,318
They concluded you cracked
and were hemorrhaging information.

124
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,718
We had to get you out.

125
00:23:57,796 --> 00:24:00,287
And what do you think?

126
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:12,273
With the drugs they gave you,
you wouldn't know what you said.

127
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,771
I know the rules.

128
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,709
And number one is, no deals.

129
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,078
Get caught and you're given up.

130
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:23,480
The mission was compromised.

131
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:26,283
Moon got a call exposing me.

132
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:29,655
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew.

133
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:34,490
-Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
-No, it isn't.

134
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:38,865
The same person who set me up then
set me up to get Zao out.

135
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:40,663
So I'm going after him.

136
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:44,534
You're going to our evaluation center
in the Falklands.

137
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,370
Double-O status rescinded.

138
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:48,641
Along with my freedom?

139
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:51,975
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.

140
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:56,447
You're no use to anyone now.

141
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,118
-He's in cardiac arrest.
-Get the crash cart. Notify his superiors.

142
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:12,957
-He's flat-llning on the ECG.
-Stand by.

143
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,795
Two hundred joules.

144
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,162
Three hundred.

145
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,602
Get me some atropine.
We're losing him! Stand by. Clear.

146
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,013
I'm checking out.

147
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,387
Thanks for the kiss of llfe.

148
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:44,119
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

149
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:46,729
Apprehend and detain with force.

150
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:50,527
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

151
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:53,298
Apprehend and detain with force.

152
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:57,601
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

153
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:42,949
My goodness, standards are falling.

154
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:45,989
No tie, dear me.

155
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:50,825
My usual suite, please.

156
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,759
Do you have a credit card?

157
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,935
Or even any luggage, sir?

158
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:59,736
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.

159
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:02,304
-It's been a long time.
-Mr. Chang.

160
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,476
Open the Presidential Suite.

161
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,342
Send up my tallor. And some food.

162
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,239
The lobster's good, with qualls'
eggs and sllced seaweed.

163
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:16,080
-And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.
-Of course.

164
00:28:16,722 --> 00:28:17,984
Do it...quickly.

165
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,155
Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond?

166
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:26,422
Just surviving, Mr. Chang.
Just surviving.

167
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,552
I am PeacefuI Fountains of Desire,
the masseuse.

168
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:52,720
I come with compllments
of the manager.

169
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:55,485
I'm sure you do. Come in.

170
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,635
On the bed, pIease. Face down.

171
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:09,134
Yes, of course.

172
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:14,939
I'm not that kind of masseuse.

173
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,477
I'm not that kind of customer.

174
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:30,918
You think I haven't aIways known
you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?

175
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:34,496
-Hong Kong is our turf now.
-Don't worry about it.

176
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,032
I'm not here to take it back.

177
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,134
Put your hands down.

178
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,641
What the hell do you want?

179
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,337
Just to heIp you settIe a score.

180
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,711
Zao kllIed three of your men.

181
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,915
You get me into North Korea,
I'll take care of him for you.

182
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,080
What's in it for you?

183
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,055
Chance to get even.

184
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,228
Zao has information I need.

185
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:12,229
-I'll have to ask Beijing.
-Do it.

186
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,530
Now get out.

187
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:17,976
UnIess you really wanna give
me a massage.

188
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,451
Mr. Bond.

189
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,089
A llttIe thank-you from us.

190
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,306
Cuba?

191
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:51,442
It seems Mr. Zao has Iost himseIf
in Havana.

192
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,168
If you find him, say goodbye from us.

193
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,941
With pIeasure.

194
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,917
HAVANA

195
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,177
I'm here to pick up
some DeIectados.

196
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:38,447
DeIectados? We haven't made
DeIectados in 30 years.

197
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:42,024
UniversaI Exports.
Check with your boss.

198
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:46,061
RaouI....

199
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:48,660
UniversaI Exports.

200
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:52,827
Follow me.

201
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:54,966
Your passport, senor.

202
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:34,076
I'd come to think the DeIectados
wouId never be smoked.

203
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:39,206
They are particuIarIy hazardous
for one's heaIth, Mr...?

204
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,146
Bond.

205
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:43,218
Mr. Bond.

206
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:45,083
Do you know why?

207
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,020
It's the addition
of the VoIado tobacco.

208
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:50,160
SIow burning.

209
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:52,625
It never goes out.

210
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,234
Just llke a sIeeper.

211
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,995
Sorry for the rude awakening.

212
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,032
I Iove my country.

213
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,938
I'd never ask you
to betray your peopIe.

214
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,511
-I'm after a North Korean.
-A tourist?

215
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:10,772
A terrorist.

216
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:13,917
One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

217
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,049
Zao has no interest
in other peopIe's freedom.

218
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:28,488
I stllI have some friends
in high pIaces.

219
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,467
Favors called in.
Some dollars spread about.

220
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:39,337
We find your friend is here,
on an isIand.

221
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,169
In Los Organos.

222
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:45,605
There is a strange cllnic
run by Dr. AIvarez.

223
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:48,308
He Ieads the fieId in gene therapy.

224
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,389
Increasing the llfe expectancy
of our beIoved Ieaders.

225
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,890
And, of course,
the richest Westerners.

226
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:01,354
We may have Iost our freedom
in the revoIution...

227
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:04,296
...but we have a heaIth system
second to none.

228
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:07,164
You didn't do too badIy
out of the revoIution.

229
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:10,102
We all have our ways
of getting by.

230
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:13,744
You'd be surprised how many
government officiaIs come to me...

231
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:18,476
-...for reminders of the decadent times.
-Yeah, well....

232
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:21,744
-Mind if I borrow these?
-PIease.

233
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,888
My sources tell me
this Zao is very dangerous.

234
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,456
I wish I couId give you more heIp.

235
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:32,561
I couId use a fast car.

236
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:14,936
Mojito, por favor.

237
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,667
Mr. Krug, your admittance papers
for the AIvarez Cllnic.

238
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,571
About bIoody time, FideI.

239
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,646
Round up more girIs
and take them to room 42.

240
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,715
UnIess you want to be known
as FideI Castrato.

241
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,974
Magnificent view.

242
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:41,453
It is, isn't it?

243
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,682
Too bad it's Iost on everybody eIse.

244
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:46,088
Mojito?

245
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,058
You shouId try it.

246
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:55,963
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.

247
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,830
My friends call me James Bond.

248
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,407
Jinx, you say?

249
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,405
Born on Friday the 1 3th.

250
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:06,312
Do you belleve in bad Iuck?

251
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,145
Let's just say my reIationships
don't seem to Iast.

252
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,344
I know the feellng.

253
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:18,660
The predators
usually appear at sunset.

254
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:20,818
And why is that?

255
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,191
It's when their prey
comes out to drink.

256
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:27,835
Too strong for you?

257
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,330
I couId Iearn to llke it.
If I had the time.

258
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,936
How much time have you got?

259
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:37,838
Untll dawn. What about you?

260
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,810
I'm just here for the birds.

261
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:43,311
OrnithoIogist.

262
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,682
OrnithoIogist, huh?

263
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,690
Now there's a mouthfuI.

264
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:55,761
So you're gonna be busy tonight
with the owIs then?

265
00:37:55,965 --> 00:38:00,925
No owIs in Los Organos.
Nothing to see tllI the morning.

266
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,898
Not out there anyway.

267
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:10,203
So, what do predators do...

268
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,973
...when the sun goes down?

269
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,710
They feast...

270
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,145
...llke there's no tomorrow.

271
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,629
Are you aIways this frisky?

272
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:06,631
I've been missing the touch
of a good woman.

273
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:11,335
Who says I'm good?

274
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,472
What do you want?

275
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:28,150
-I don't need a wheeIchair.
-No?

276
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:29,443
You do now.

277
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:47,902
Senor.

278
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:51,336
-Okay.
-Gracias.

279
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:57,101
IsIa Los Organos

280
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,043
So you are to have
DNA-repIacement therapy.

281
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:40,477
Let me expIain the two phases.

282
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:45,120
First, we kllI off your bone marrow.
Wipe the DNA sIate cIean.

283
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:46,752
Phase two:

284
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:49,924
Introduction of new DNA
harvested from heaIthy donors.

285
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:51,684
Orphans, runaways...

286
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:54,226
...peopIe that won't be missed.

287
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:58,324
I llke to think of myseIf
as an artist.

288
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:01,529
And this is when I create.

289
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:06,032
Thank you.

290
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:10,404
It is a painfuI process,
I'm afraid, but...

291
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:13,179
...all great art is.

292
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:17,048
I'll certainIy enjoy working on you.

293
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:23,821
Of course, most artists
are onIy truIy appreciated...

294
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:25,653
...after they're dead.

295
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:48,614
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.

296
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:51,912
l have fond memories
of the countryside.

297
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,843
Good.

298
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:57,778
Got your attention.

299
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:03,751
Who's bankrolling
your makeover, Zao?

300
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:08,484
Same person who set me up
in North Korea?

301
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,212
James? What's going on?

302
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:12,485
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

303
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:07,280
Move it!

304
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,447
Let's go!

305
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:35,896
You see, my friend,
the chemicaI composition shows...

306
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:39,368
...this is from Sierra Leone.
Confllct diamonds.

307
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:44,835
There's some kind
of marking here.

308
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:47,605
-''GG.''
-Let me see.

309
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:53,518
Yes.

310
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:56,987
From the Graves Corporation
in IceIand.

311
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:59,755
That's his Iaser signature.

312
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,825
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there...

313
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,163
...a year or so ago.

314
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:09,927
Yet they're identicaI
to confllct diamonds.

315
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:13,339
What an amazing coincidence.

316
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:18,837
How can he escape
from a British warship...

317
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:22,038
...in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?

318
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,241
-Interesting station, Moneypenny?
-I got a storm warning.

319
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,581
You were supposed
to throw away the key...

320
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,779
...not leave the door wide open.

321
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,584
Are you impIying I had a hand
in his escape?

322
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:35,728
Well, Bond got away real fast,
didn't he?

323
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,794
It is what he's trained to do.

324
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,590
Your boy's been very busy.

325
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,859
He torches a clinic in Cuba.

326
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:45,202
Listen, you put your house in order...

327
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:48,067
...or we're gonna do it for you.

328
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:04,053
Your drink, sir.

329
00:50:05,225 --> 00:50:07,887
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

330
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:35,280
-When's he coming?
-I don't know.

331
00:50:38,558 --> 00:50:41,925
-Looks llke your man won't make it.
-He's right on time.

332
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,391
WonderfuI day to become a knight.

333
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,965
WllI you be using your titIe,
Mr. Graves?

334
00:51:22,169 --> 00:51:25,366
I'm proud of my adopted nation,
but I'd never stand on ceremony.

335
00:51:25,572 --> 00:51:27,733
After that entrance,
you can't be surprised...

336
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:31,069
...you're called a seIf-publlcizing
adrenallne junkie, can you?

337
00:51:31,278 --> 00:51:32,905
I prefer ''adventurer.''

338
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:36,480
We've heard about the Icarus
space program. What's the secret?

339
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:40,141
It's a surprise.
You'll soon be enllghtened.

340
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:43,686
You work 24l7. Is it true
that you don't need sIeep?

341
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,757
You get one shot at llfe.
Why waste it on sIeep?

342
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,656
Aren't you trying out for
the OIympic fencing team?

343
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:53,026
-We hear you're training furiousIy.
-I never get furious.

344
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,633
As they say in fencing,
''What's the point?''

345
00:51:55,836 --> 00:51:56,928
Thank you.

346
00:51:57,137 --> 00:52:00,436
We don't want to keep Her Majesty
waiting any Ionger.

347
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,699
-Mr. Graves.
-Mr. Graves.

348
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,414
Hit.

349
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:23,886
That's a hit.

350
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,561
Hit.

351
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:33,305
Verity?

352
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,774
James Bond.

353
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:37,742
Your Iesson.

354
00:52:41,648 --> 00:52:43,775
I see you handIe your weapon well.

355
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:47,142
I have been known
to keep my tip up.

356
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,159
Do you mind?
I think I've come undone.

357
00:52:55,295 --> 00:52:56,694
Why not?

358
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:01,727
Hit. Positions. PIay.

359
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:06,694
Feast your eyes
on the finest bIade in the cIub.

360
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:09,134
Gustav Graves?

361
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,511
His publlcist, Miranda Frost.

362
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:19,341
My protégé.
Gorgeous, isn't she?

363
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,849
She took the goId at Sydney.

364
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,986
-By defauIt, if I remember.
-DefauIt?

365
00:53:25,191 --> 00:53:28,285
The one who beat her
OD'd on steroids.

366
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:30,258
Miranda deserved that goId.

367
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:32,928
Now she's teaching Graves
how to win one.

368
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,431
He onIy pIays for cash.

369
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:39,300
He's won so much,
nobody eIse wants to fight him.

370
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:45,842
You wanna meet him?

371
00:53:46,646 --> 00:53:47,943
AbsoIuteIy.

372
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,675
Lead on.

373
00:53:54,621 --> 00:53:56,782
-Gustav?
-Verity.

374
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:00,192
-And Mr...?
-Bond.

375
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:03,118
James Bond.

376
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:09,030
-Have we met before?
-I think I'd remember.

377
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:13,404
Of course you wouId. My mistake.

378
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,371
-Are you a gambllng man, Mr. Bond?
-If the stakes are right.

379
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:21,008
A thousand a point
too much for you?

380
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,018
Care to pIace a bet, Verity?

381
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:30,586
No, thanks.

382
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,755
I don't llke cockfights.

383
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:35,983
Shall we?

384
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,126
Excuse me.

385
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:43,463
Best of three hits?

386
00:54:45,304 --> 00:54:46,771
Positions.

387
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:48,736
Ready. PIay.

388
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:50,031
En garde.

389
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:01,144
Hit.

390
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,844
Positions.

391
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:05,120
PIay.

392
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,489
Hit.

393
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,496
Two-nll.

394
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:16,558
Do you want to continue?

395
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:20,899
-You wanna up the wager?
-How much can you afford?

396
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:24,371
Let's pIay for this.

397
00:55:25,745 --> 00:55:27,940
I picked it up in Cuba.

398
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:31,077
I belleve it's one of yours.

399
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:36,152
My, my. They do get around.

400
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:39,252
But then diamonds are for everyone.

401
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:45,157
Brllllant specimen.
CompIeteIy fIawIess.

402
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:49,095
And chemically identicaI
to African confllct diamonds.

403
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:53,067
Then you're about to Iose
something very precious.

404
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:56,999
Positions.

405
00:55:58,544 --> 00:55:59,806
Ready.

406
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:01,604
-PIay.
-En garde.

407
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:09,688
Oh, dear.

408
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:14,258
You want to continue?

409
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,327
Of course I want to bIoody continue!

410
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,725
But since we're upping the wager...

411
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:22,025
...Iet's up the weapons,
shall we?

412
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:28,997
Let's do this the oId-fashioned way.
First bIood drawn from the torso.

413
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:44,167
That is enough!

414
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,280
It's just a llttIe sport, Miranda.

415
00:58:57,155 --> 00:58:59,419
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.

416
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:05,454
SettIe downstairs, shall we?

417
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:23,241
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.

418
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:28,784
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration
in IceIand at the weekend. Icarus?

419
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:32,189
Perhaps you couId join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements.

420
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,291
Once I've smoothed things over
with the cIub.

421
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:37,928
What wouId I do without you?

422
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:44,301
Can I expect the pIeasure of you
in IceIand?

423
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,199
I'm afraid you'll never
have that pIeasure.

424
00:59:49,074 --> 00:59:51,907
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone Ieft this for you.

425
00:59:54,513 --> 00:59:57,073
PIace needed redecorating anyway.

426
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:46,287
I heard of this pIace.

427
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,130
Never thought I'd find myseIf here.

428
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:54,429
Some things are best kept underground.

429
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,804
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.

430
01:01:01,146 --> 01:01:04,479
-Your calling card.
-So, what have you got on Graves?

431
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:07,018
You burn me...

432
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,851
-...and now you want my heIp?
-Did you expect an apoIogy?

433
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:15,618
I know you'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.

434
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:18,660
-Just llke you.
-The difference is, I won't compromise.

435
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:23,490
Well, I don't have the Iuxury of
seeing things as bIack and white.

436
01:01:23,702 --> 01:01:27,661
-Whlle you were away, the worId changed.
-Not for me.

437
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:34,709
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouIdn't be here right now.

438
01:01:34,913 --> 01:01:39,475
-So, what do you have?
-Nothing beyond the officiaI biography.

439
01:01:39,851 --> 01:01:42,217
Orphan working in a diamond mine...

440
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:48,154
...Iearns engineering, makes a huge find
in IceIand and gives haIf of it to charity.

441
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:51,328
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

442
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:57,697
-And his demonstration this weekend?
-ProbabIy just another publlcity stunt.

443
01:01:57,936 --> 01:02:00,632
Tell me what you know
about this Cuban cllnic.

444
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:03,033
Gene therapy.

445
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:07,177
New identities courtesy
of DNA transpIants.

446
01:02:07,379 --> 01:02:12,646
So-called ''beauty parIor.'' We'd heard
rumors. I didn't think it really existed.

447
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:15,510
It doesn't anymore.

448
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:21,022
Zao got away,
but he Ieft these behind.

449
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:25,155
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

450
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:31,597
I think it's a front for Iaundering
African confllct diamonds.

451
01:02:31,803 --> 01:02:36,240
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is polltically connected.

452
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:39,835
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

453
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:42,543
It seems you've become usefuI again.

454
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,750
Then maybe it's time
you Iet me get on with my job.

455
01:04:09,534 --> 01:04:12,503
Forgive my mentioning it,
but a perfect marksman...

456
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:16,071
...isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

457
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:20,374
Check the repIay.

458
01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:24,878
You'll find he's dead and
she's onIy got a fIesh wound.

459
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:28,643
There's aIways an excuse,
isn't there, doubIe-O zero?

460
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:31,820
Give me the oId firing range any day.

461
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:35,823
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.

462
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:40,020
So this is where they keep
the oId rellcs, then, eh?

463
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:44,565
This is where our most cutting-edge
technoIogy is deveIoped.

464
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:47,431
-Point taken.
-Must you touch everything?

465
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:49,732
Does this stllI work?

466
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,216
-Now, Iook....
-So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

467
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,384
I'm trying to get to it.

468
01:05:03,988 --> 01:05:06,183
Weapon, pIease.

469
01:05:11,496 --> 01:05:16,399
One pane unbreakabIe gIass,
one standard-issue ring finger.

470
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:20,196
Twist so. Vollà.

UItra-high frequency
singIe-digit sonic agitator unit.

472
01:05:24,175 --> 01:05:27,440
-You're cIeverer than you Iook.
-Better than Iooking cIeverer...

473
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:29,340
...than you are. Follow me.

474
01:05:29,547 --> 01:05:33,108
Now, a new watch.
This wllI be your 20th, I belleve.

475
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:35,343
-How time flles.
-Yes, well, 007...

476
01:05:35,587 --> 01:05:39,421
...why don't you establlsh a record
by returning this one.

477
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:42,354
Your new transportation.

478
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:57,137
-Maybe you've been down here too Iong.
-The uItimate in British engineering.

479
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,941
-You must be joking.
-As I Iearned from my predecessor...

480
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:04,876
...I never joke about my work.

481
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:10,385
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish,
we call it the Vanish.

482
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:17,024
-Very good.
-Adaptive camoufIage.

483
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:20,129
Tiny cameras project
the image they see...

484
01:06:20,331 --> 01:06:24,028
...onto a llght-emitting poIymer skin
on the opposite side.

485
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:28,171
To the casuaI eye, as good as invisibIe.
PIus, the usuaI refinements:

486
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:34,072
Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking
shotguns to shoot down moblle objects.

487
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:39,080
The manuaI. ShouId be abIe to
shoot through that in a coupIe of hours.

488
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:47,553
Just took a few seconds, Q.

489
01:06:48,326 --> 01:06:51,124
Wish I couId make you vanish.

490
01:06:54,165 --> 01:06:55,826
Come in.

491
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:03,070
Before you Ieave on your mission
for IceIand...

492
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:06,243
...tell me what you know
of James Bond.

493
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:09,342
He's a doubIe-O.
A wlld one, as I discovered today.

494
01:07:10,348 --> 01:07:13,442
He'll llght the fuse
on any expIosive situation...

495
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:18,281
...and be a danger to himseIf and others.
KllI first, ask questions Iater.

496
01:07:18,523 --> 01:07:22,926
His method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get cIose to.

497
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:26,654
A womanizer.

498
01:07:26,896 --> 01:07:30,195
You're going to be seeing
a Iot more of him in IceIand.

499
01:07:31,234 --> 01:07:35,330
With great respect,
a man llke him couId bIow my cover.

500
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:41,437
You voIunteered for this, but in three
months, you've found next to nothing.

501
01:07:41,811 --> 01:07:43,711
Graves seems to be cIean.

502
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:48,873
Bond thinks differentIy, so I'm going to
Iet him do what you so abIy described:

503
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,612
Mix things up a llttIe with Mr. Graves.
With you there...

504
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:55,222
...things won't get out of hand.

505
01:07:56,126 --> 01:08:00,688
In your three years in CryptoIogy, you've
kept business and pIeasure separate.

506
01:08:00,897 --> 01:08:07,234
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite severaI advances.

507
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:11,736
It wouId be foollsh to get invoIved
with someone within the community.

508
01:08:11,975 --> 01:08:14,239
Especially James Bond.
