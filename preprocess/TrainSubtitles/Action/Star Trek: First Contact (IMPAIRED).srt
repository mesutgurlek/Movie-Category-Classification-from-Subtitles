from the sphere.

167
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,020
They're creating
a temporal vortex.

168
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,660
Time travel.

169
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,900
Picard: data, report.

170
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
We appear to be caught
in a temporal wake.

171
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,980
Captain...Earth.

172
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,180
The atmosphere contains

173
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,500
High concentrations
of methane,

174
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,340
Carbon monoxide,
and fluorine.

175
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
Picard: life signs?

176
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,180
Population--
approximately 9 billion.

177
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,580
All borg.

178
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,260
How?

179
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,220
They must've done it
in the past.

180
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,020
They went back
and assimilated earth,

181
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
Changed history.

182
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,540
But if they changed history,
why are we still here?

183
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,420
The temporal wake
must have somehow protected us

184
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,780
From changes
in the time line.

185
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,220
[beeping]

186
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,860
Sir, the vortex
is collapsing.

187
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,780
Hold your course,
mr. Hawk.

188
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,900
We must
follow them back,

189
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,420
Repair whatever damage
they've done.

190
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
Come on.

191
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,700
Good night, eddy.

192
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,260
Go home.

193
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,300
You're gonna
regret this tomorrow.

194
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,020
One of the things

195
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,820
You should've learned
about me by now...

196
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,020
Is that I don't
have regrets.

197
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,980
Come on, lily.
One more round.

198
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
Z, you've had enough.

199
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm not going up in that thing
with a drunken pilot.

200
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,100
I sure as hell am not
going up there sober.

201
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,900
What is that?

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,740
That...Is
the constellation leo.

203
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,140
No. That.

204
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,660
It's an econ.

205
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,260
After all these years?

206
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,540
<i>We gotta get
to the phoenix.</i>

207
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,580
<i>To hell with the phoenix.</i>

208
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,420
Aah!

209
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,060
Man: help! Help! Hurry!

210
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,220
Come on. Move. This way.

211
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,260
Run!

212
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,060
Aah!

213
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,380
Report.

214
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
Shields are down.

215
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,740
Long-range sensors
are off-line.

216
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,820
Main power's holding.

217
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,180
According to our
astrometric readings,

218
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,260
We are in
the mid-21st century.

219
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
From
the radioactive isotopes

220
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,700
In the atmosphere,

221
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,460
I would estimate
we have arrived

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Approximately 10 years
after the third world war.

223
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,940
Makes sense.

224
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
Most of the major cities
have been destroyed.

225
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,740
Very few governments left.
600 million dead.

226
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,860
No resistance.

227
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,340
Worf: captain...

228
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,940
Mr. Worf,
quantum torpedoes.

229
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,940
Ready, sir.

230
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,100
Fire.

231
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,940
They were firing
at the surface.

232
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,100
Location?

233
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,220
Western hemisphere.

234
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,700
North american
continent.

235
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,340
Looks like
a missile complex

236
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,060
In central montana.

237
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Missile complex...

238
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,580
The date? Data,

239
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,340
I need to know
the exact date.

240
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,700
April 4th...2063?

241
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,820
April 4th. The day before
first contact.

242
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,060
Precisely.

243
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,420
Crusher: then
the missile complex

244
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,460
Must be where
zefram cochrane

245
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
Is building
his warp ship.

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
That's what
they came here to do--

247
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,900
Stop first contact.

248
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,820
How much damage,
lieutenant?

249
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Can't tell.

250
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,180
Long-range sensors
are still off-line.

251
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,980
We have to go down there,
find out what happened.

252
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,700
Data, beverly,
you're with me.

253
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,620
Have a security team meet us
in transporter room 3.

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,060
Computer, mid-21st century
civilian clothing.

255
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Number one...

256
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,900
You have the bridge.

257
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,740
Over here.

258
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,180
They're all dead.

259
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,780
See if one of them
is cochrane.

260
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,540
Data, let's go check
the warp ship.

261
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,660
The structural integrity
of the missile

262
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,940
Appears to be intact,

263
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
But there is
significant damage

264
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,780
To various sections
of the fuselage

265
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,540
And primary
intercooler system.

266
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,660
You should have
the original blueprints

267
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,140
<i>In the enterprise computer.</i>

268
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,380
Commander la forge will need
to bring a team down here.

269
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,900
Hold your fire!!
We're here to help you!

270
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,300
Bullshit!

271
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Captain...

272
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,700
I believe
I can handle this.

273

[gun cocks]

274
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,580
Greetings.

275
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,580
Captain, this woman
requires medical attention.

276
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,580
Severe theta
radiation poisoning.

277
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
The radiation
is coming from

278
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,460
The damaged
throttle assembly.

279
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,020
We are all going to have
to be inoculated,

280
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,940
And I have to get her
to sick bay.

281
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,140
Doctor...

282
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,660
Please, no lectures about
the prime directive.

283
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,860
I will keep her
unconscious.

284
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Very well.
Tell commander riker

285
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,140
To beam down with
a search party.

286
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,140
We need to find

287
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
<i>Crusher to enterprise--</i>

288

2 to beam directly
to sick bay.

289
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,180
We have less
than 48 hours

290
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,940
Before this ship
has to be launched.

291
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,900

292
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,180
La forge here.

293
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,780
Geordi, cochrane's ship
was damaged in the attack.

294
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,540
Get down here with
an engineering detail.

295
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,740
We have work to do.

296
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,340
Right.
I'm on my way, captain.

297
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,780
Alpha team, let's assemble
in transporter room 3.

298
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,100
We're heading down
to the surface.

299
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,620
Porter, you're gonna be
in command till I get back.

300
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,580
Aye, sir.

301
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,780
And, porter,

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,380
Check out
the environmental controls

303
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,580
While I'm gone.

304
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,860
It's getting
a little warm in here.

305
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,020
All right, let's go.

306
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,460
Isn't it amazing?

307
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,860
This ship used to be
a nuclear missile.

308
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,900
It is historical irony
that dr. Cochrane

309
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,820
Would choose an instrument
of mass destruction

310
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
To inaugurate
an era of peace.

311
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,300
It's a boyhood fantasy,
data.

312
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
I must have seen this ship

313
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,900
Hundreds of times
in the smithsonian,

314
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,220
But I was never able
to touch it.

315
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,660
Sir, does
tactile contact

316
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,900
<i>Alter your perception
of the phoenix?</i>

317
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,140
Oh, yes.

318
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,300
For humans, touch can
connect you to an object

319
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,460
In a very personal way,
make it seem more real.

320
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,260
I'm detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing...

321
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,420
Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

322
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,420
It is no more
real to me now

323
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,740
Than it was
a moment ago.

324
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,220
Would you three
like to be alone?

325
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,180
What have you found out?

326
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,100
There's no sign of cochrane
anywhere in the complex.

327
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,500
He has to be here.

328
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,980
There was nothing
more important to him

329
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,100
Than this ship.

330
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,940
This flight--
it was his dream.

consider the possibility

What kind
of difficulties?

360
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,660
Humidity levels
have risen 73%,

to run another test

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,340
We just lost contact
with deck 16--

379

Communications,
internal sensors, everything.

380

I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

381

Aye, sir.

384

Mr. Hawk, before we lost
internal sensors,

385
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,980
What were the exact
environmental conditions

386

In main engineering?

387
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
Atmospheric pressure was 2
kilopasquals above normal--

92% humidity,

Quickly. Mr. Data,
lock out the main computer.

I have isolated
the main computer

With a fractal

407

The borg will be able
to break it.

409

The borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

According to starfleet

Follow me.

437
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,940
First thing they'll do
in engineering

438
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,740
Is establish a collective--

439
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
A central point from which
they can control the hive.

440
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,540
The problem is,
if we begin firing

441
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,500
Particle weapons
in engineering,

442
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,740
There's a risk
we may hit the warp core.

443
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,780
I believe our goal should be

444
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,940
To puncture one of
the plasma coolant tanks.

445

446
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,980
Excellent idea.

447
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,380
Plasma coolant

Organic material
on contact.

449
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,740
But the borg are not
entirely organic.

450
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,700
True, but like all
cybernetic life forms,

451
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,060
They cannot survive without
their organic components.

452
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,420
I have ordered
all weapons to be set

modulation.

454

The borg
will adapt quickly.

We will be able to fire
12 shots at most.

What was I saying?

496
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,060
You're drunk.

497
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,020
I am not.

498
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Yes, you are.

499
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,780
Look, he wouldn't
even talk to me

500
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,220
Unless I had a drink
with him.

501
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,940
And then
it took 3 shots

502
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,460
Of something
called tequila

503
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,380
Just to find out
he was the one

504
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,500
We're looking for.

505
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,660
And I've spent
the last 20 minutes

506
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Trying to keep
his hands off me.

507
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,740
So don't go
criticizing

508
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,260
My counseling
technique.

509
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,500
Sorry.

510
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,060
It's a primitive
culture.

511
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,860
I'm just trying
to blend in.

512
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,300
You're blended,
all right.

513
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,220
I already told him
our cover story.

514
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,820
He didn't believe me.

515
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,740
We are running
out of time.

516
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,740
Now, if we tell him
the truth,

517
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,940
Do you think

518
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,620
He'll be able
to handle it?

519
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,180
If you're looking for
my professional opinion

520
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,700
As ship's counselor,

521
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,140
He's nuts.

522
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,180
I'll be sure
to note that in my log.

523
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,140
[music starts again]

524
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,980
Data: captain,

525
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,380
I believe
I am feeling...

526
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,580
Anxiety.

527
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,340
It is an intriguing
sensation.

528
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,500
A most distracting--

529
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,060
Data, I'm sure
it's a fascinating experience.

530
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,980
But perhaps you
should deactivate

531
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,900
Your emotion chip
for now.

532
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,980
Good idea, sir.

533
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,620
[beep]

534
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,540
Done.

535
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,500
Data, there are times
that I envy you.

536
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
It's only me!

537
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,300
Doctor,
are you all right?

538
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Yes. But we have
wounded here.

539
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,300
Worf: lopez,

540
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,100
Get these people
back to deck 14.

541
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,860
There was a civilian.

542
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,460
A woman from the 21st
century. We got separated.

543
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
We will watch for her.

544
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,020
Worf, she
has no idea

545
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,420
What's going on.
Try to find her.

546
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,780
Lower your weapons.

547
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,540
They'll ignore us till
they consider us a threat.

548
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,700
Picard: the
manual release.

549
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
Mr. Worf, hold
this position.

550

Computer: manual release
is on-line.

551
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,980
Perhaps we should
just knock.

Data, cover me.

555
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,900
Captain, they've adapted!

556
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Picard: aah!

557
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,540
Regroup on deck 15.

558
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,540
Don't let them
touch you!

Help.

Please, help.

Aah!

567
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,740
You!

568
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,700
How the hell did you--

569
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,660
Back off!

570
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,620
Calm down!

571
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,580
Shut up!

572
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,900
Who are you?

573
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,180
My name is
jean-luc picard.

574
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,620
No! Who are you with?!

575
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,780
What faction?

576
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm not a member of
the eastern coalition.

577
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,740
Listen--

578
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,660
I said shut up!
I don't care who you're with.

579
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,540
Get me the hell
out of here. Now!

580
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,060
That isn't going
to be easy.

581
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,580
You better find a way
to make it easy, soldier,

582
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,900
Or I'm gonna start
pushing buttons.

583
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
All right!

584
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,700

Your efforts to break
the encryption codes

588
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,940
Will not be successful,

589
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,780
Nor will your attempts
to assimilate me

00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,940
From thousands of species
across thousands of worlds

594
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,700
Since long before
you were created.

595
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,740
But now,
they are all borg.

How'd you do that?

626
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,660
It's your telescope.

627
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,820

We don't know why yet.

634
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,500
So what is it
you want me to do?

635
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,940
Simple. Conduct
your warp flight

636
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,220
Flight
tomorrow morning

637
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,500
Just as you
planned.

638
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,500
Why tomorrow morning?

639
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,060
Because at 11:00
an alien ship

640
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,940
Will begin
passing through

641
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,340
This solar system.

642
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,940
Alien. You mean
extraterrestrials?

643
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,380
More bad guys?

644
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,340
Troi: good guys.

645
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,820
They're on
a survey mission.

646
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,980
They have no
interest in earth.

647
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,220
Too primitive.

648
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,460
Oh.

649
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,700
Doctor,
tomorrow morning

650
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,460
When they detect
the warp signature

651
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,580
From your ship

652
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,020
And realize that humans
have discovered

653
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,700
How to travel
faster than light,

654
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,700
They decide to alter
their course

655
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,860
And make first contact
with earth right here.

656
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,820
Here?

657
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,060
Uh, actually,
over there.

658
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,580
It is one of
the pivotal moments

659
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,860
In human history,
doctor.

660
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
You get to make
first contact

661
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,180
With an alien race
and after you do,

662
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,580
Everything begins
to change.

663
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,980
Your theories
on warp drive

664
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,140
Allow fleets of starships
to be built

665
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,460
And mankind to start
exploring the galaxy.

666
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,140
It unites humanity
in a way

667
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,900
That no one ever
thought possible

668
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,020
When they realize

669
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,620
They're not alone
in the universe.

670
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,860
Poverty,
disease, war--

671
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,020
They'll all be gone
within the next 50 years.

672
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
But unless you make
that warp flight

673
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,900
Tomorrow morning
before 11:15,

674
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,340
None of it
will happen.

675
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,780
And you people,

676
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,940
You're all...
Astronauts

677
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,100
On some kind
of star trek.

678
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,540
Geordi: look, doc,

679
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,700
I know this is a lot
for you to take in,

680
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,460
But we're running
out of time here.

681
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,300
We need your help.

682
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,620
What do you say?

683
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,060
Why not?

684
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,740
[phasers fire]

685
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,380
[click-whir]

686
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,260
It's pretty bad, sir.

687
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,540
It looks like they control
decks 26 up to 11.

688
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,340
But when they took
deck 11,

689
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,780
They--they just stopped.

690
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,060
The borg
have assimilated

691
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
More than
half the ship

692
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,780
In a matter
of hours.

693
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,220
Why stop there?

694
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,700
What is on deck 11?

695
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,140
Hydroponics,
stellar cartography,

696
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,100
Deflector control.

697
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,460
No vital system.

698
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,260
They would not
have stopped there

699
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,180
Unless it gave them
a tactical advantage.

700
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,460
Return to your
checkpoints.

701
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,740
Send reports
every 10 minutes.

702
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,820
Officer:
right, sir.

703
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,460
Something must've
happened in sickbay.

704
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,740
Where are dr. Crusher
and the others?

705
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,180
Why did you break
the cease-fire?

706
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,620
We didn't attack you.

707
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,620
Who did?!

708
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,780
There's a--

709
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,580
There's
a new faction

710
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,500
That wants to prevent
your launch tomorrow morning,

711
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,820
But we're here to help you.

712
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,060
This may be difficult
for you to accept,

713
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,460
But you are not
in montana anymore.

714
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,700
You're on a ship,

715
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,140
A--a spaceship

716
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,580
Orbiting the earth
at an altitude--

717
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,660
You wanna help me,
get me outta here.

718
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,180
All right.

719
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,380
You want a way out,

720
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,980
Here it is.

721
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,580
Lily: what is this?

722
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,580
Australia,

723
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,540
New guinea,

724
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,900
The solomons.

725
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,340
Montana will be up soon.

726
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,540
But you may want
to hold your breath,

727
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,180
It's a long way down.

728
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,580
Now listen to me,

729
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,060
I'm not your enemy,

730
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,980
And I can get you home.

731
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,900
But first you must
put that weapon down

732
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,180
And trust me.

733
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,300
Jean-luc picard.

734
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,700
My name.

735
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,860
That's my name.

736
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,020
What's yours?

737
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,540
Lily.

738
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,900
Welcome aboard,
lily.

739
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,420
Thank you.

740
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,860
[beeps]

741
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,300
Maximum setting.

742
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,740
If you'd fired this,

743
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,660
You would've
vaporized me.

744
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,300
It's my first ray gun.

745
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,540
There's no glass.

746
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,300
Aah!

747
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,980
Force field.

748
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,340
I've never seen
that kind of technology.

749
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,860
That's because it hasn't
been invented yet.

750
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,020
What?

751
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,940
There's more
I have to tell you.

752
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,300
Come on.

753
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,340
[beep beep]

754
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,500
Borg queen:
are you ready?

755
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,020
Who are you?

756
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,740
I am the borg.

757
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,860
That is a contradiction.

758
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,820
The borg have

759
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,380
A collective
consciousness.

760
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,060
There are no
individuals.

761
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,580
I am the beginning,

762
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,500
The end,

763
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,180
The one who is many.

764
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,380
I am the borg.

765
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,740
Greetings.

766
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,460
I am curious.

767
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,180
Do you control
the borg collective?

768
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,220
You imply a disparity
where none exists.

769
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,660
I am the collective.

770
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,220
Perhaps I should
rephrase the question.

771
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,500
I wish to understand

772
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,140
The organizational
relationships.

773
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,140
Are you their leader?

774
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,260
I bring order to chaos.

775
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,260
An interesting,
if cryptic response.

776
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,860
You are in chaos,
data.

777
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,460
You are
the contradiction.

778
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,980
A machine who wishes
to be human.

779
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,980
Since you seem to know
so much about me,

780
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,140
You must be aware that
I am programmed to evolve...

781
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,660
To better myself.

782
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,100
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

783
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,940
Evolving toward
a state of perfection.

784
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,900
Forgive me,

785
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,820
But the borg
do not evolve,

786
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,020
They conquer.

787
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,140
By assimilating
other beings

788
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,620
Into our collective,

789
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,460
We are bringing them
closer to perfection.

790
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,980
Somehow...

791
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,780
I question your motives.

792
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,940
That is because
you haven't been properly...

793
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,500
Stimulated yet.

794
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,620
You have reactivated
my emotion chip.

795
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,540
Why?

796
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Don't be frightened.

797
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,060
I am not frightened.

798
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,860
Do you know
what this is, data?

799
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,220
It would appear

800
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,980
You are attempting
to graft organic skin

801
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,940
Onto my endo-skeletal
structure.

802
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,260
What a cold description

803
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,700
For such a beautiful gift.

804
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,780
[blows]

805
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,740
Was that good for you?

806
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,540
Ooh.

807
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,740
How many planets

808
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,860
Are in this
federation?

809
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,580
Over 150 spread across
8,000 light-years.

810
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,260
You must not
get home much.

811
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,180
Actually, I tend to think
of this ship as home.

812
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,900
But if it's earth
you're talking about,

813
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,820
I try to get back
whenever I can.

814
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,100
[beeps]

815
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,980
Good, they haven't broken
the encryption code yet.

816
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,540
Who, those bionic zombies
you told me about? The--

817
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,100
Borg.

818
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,060
Borg?

819
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,460
Sounds swedish.

820
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,940
Lily: how big
is this ship?

821
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,820
There are 24 decks.

822
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,540
Almost 700 meters long.

823
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,500
Lily: it took me
6 months

824
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,100
To scrounge up
enough titanium

825
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,380
Just to build
a 4-meter cockpit.

826
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,420
How much did
this thing cost?

827
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,220
The economics
of the future

828
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,340
Are somewhat
different.

829
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,460
You see,

830
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,660
Money doesn't exist
in the 24th century.

831
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,820
No money?

832
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,500
[whispers] you mean you
don't get paid?

833
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,180
The acquisition
of wealth

834
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
Is no longer
the driving force

835
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,900
In our lives.

836
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,180
We work
to better ourselves

837
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,620
And the rest
of humanity.

838
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,860
Actually, we're
rather like yourself

839
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,380
And dr. Cochrane.

840
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,420
Aah!

841
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,620
All right!
All right.

842
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,260
Come on.

843
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,940
Is-isn't there
another way around?

844
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,780
I know what
I'm doing.

845
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,820
Definitely not swedish.

846
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,900
Aah!

847
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,740
Aah!

848
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,900
[gasps]

849
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,980
What the hell
are you doing?

850
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,540
[knock on door]

851
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,820
Perhaps something
in satin.

852
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,380
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but we're closing.

853
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,700
And you do understand

854
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,620
We have a strict
dress code.

855
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,060
So if you boys don't
leave right now, I'll--

856
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm looking for
nicky the nose.

857
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,620
The nose?

858
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,300
Hasn't been here
in months.

859
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,180
This is the wrong chapter.

860
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,780
Aah!

861
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,420
Computer,
begin chapter 13.

862
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,500
[beeps and whirs]

863
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,980
¶ if I say I love you ¶

864
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,660
Try to look as if
you're having a good time.

865
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,020
¶ I want you to know ¶

866
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,500
¶ it's not just because
there's moonlight ¶

¶ although... ¶

868
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,340
No, no, no,
look at me.

869
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,780
Try to act naturally.

870
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,100
There he is.

871
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,420
¶ you're all dressed up ¶

872
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,540

874
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,820
Ruby.

875
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,220
This is not a good time.

876
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,260
It's never the time
for us, is it, dix?

877
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,220
Always some excuse,

878
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,860
Some case
you're working on.

879
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,100
I have to talk to nicky.

880
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,220
I'll see you later.

881
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,180
Ok.

882
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,460
But watch
your caboose...

883
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,900
And dump the broad.

884
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,980
¶ if I say ¶

885
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,660

¶ I want you to know... ¶

887
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,500
Well, well, well,

888
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,180
Look what
the cat dragged in.

889
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,260
What's shakin', dix?

890
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,540
The usual, nick,

891
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,660
Martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

892
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,780
Whaa!

893
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,700
Hey, I'm gonna take that
personal in a second.

894
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,820
No offense.

895
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,540
Hey!

896
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,860
Ooh!

897
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,140
Woman: aah!

898
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,140
Yah!

899
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,780
Aah!

900
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,740
Hey!

901
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,700
I think
you got him.

902
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,220
I don't get it.

903
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,500
I thought you said

904
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,860
This was all just
a bunch of holograms.

905
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,060
If it's holograms--

906
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,100
I disengaged
the safety protocols.

907
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,500
Without them,

908
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,060
Even a holographic
bullet can kill.

909
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,500
What are you doing?

910
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,900
I'm looking for
the neuro-processor.

911
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,340
Every borg has one.

912
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,260
It's like a memory chip.

913
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,140
It will contain a record
of all the instructions

914
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,580
This borg
has been receiving

915
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,020
From the collective.

916
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,060
Oh, my.

917
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,500
Jean-luc, it's one
of your uniforms.

918
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,460
Yes.

919
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,020
This was ensign lynch.

920
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
[beeps]

921
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,420
Tough luck, huh?

922
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,700
We've got to get
to the bridge.

923
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
Cochrane: go on.

924
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,140
Jeez.

925
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,820
Ffft.

926
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,300
Geordi: doctor?

927
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,260
Yeah?

928
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,740
Would you mind taking
a look at this?

929
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,620
Uh, ahem, yeah.

930
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,780
Ahem.

931
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,140
I tried to reconstruct
the intermix chamber

932
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,460
From what I remember
in school.

933
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,900
Tell me if
I got it right.

934
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
School?

935
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,500
You learned about
this in school?

936
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,740
Oh, yeah.

937
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,220
Basic warp design

938
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,020
Is a required course
at the academy.

939
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,860
The first chapter
is called...

940
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,500
Zefram cochrane.

941
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,740
Well, looks like
you got it right.

942
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,660
Commander,
uh, this is what

943
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,100
We're thinking of using

944
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,820
To replace the damaged
warp plasma conduit.

945
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,900
[whirs]

946
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah, reg.

947
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,220
Yeah, that's good.
But you need to

948
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,980
Reinforce
this copper tubing

949
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,300
With a nano-polymer.

950
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,860
Dr. Cochrane, I know
this sounds silly,

951
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,460
But can I shake
your hand?

952
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,060
Oh, thank you,
doctor.

953
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,220
I can't tell you
what an honor it is

954
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,460
To work with you
on this project.

955
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,860
I never imagined
that I'd be meeting         reg.

956
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,820
The man who invented        reg!
Warp drive.

957
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,580
I'm sorry. Right.

958
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,020
Thanks.

959
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,820
Do they have to
keep doing that?

960
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,620
It's just a little
hero worship, doc.

961
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,060
Tell you the truth,

962
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,980
I can't say I blame them.

963
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,220
We all grew up hearing
about what you did here,

964
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,860
Or what
you're about to do.

965
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,020
You know, I probably
shouldn't even tell you this,

966
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,420
But I went to
zefram cochrane high school.

967
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,340
Really.

968
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,500
You know, I wish
I had a picture of this.

969
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,540
What?

970
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,780
Well, you see,

971
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,220
In the future,

972
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,700
This whole area becomes
an historical monument.

973
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,580
You're standing
almost on the exact spot

974
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,540
Where your statue's
gonna be.

975
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,500
Statue?

976
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,900
Oh, yeah.

977
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,740
It's marble,
about 20 meters tall,

978
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,500
And you're looking up
at the sky,

979
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,500
And your hand's
sort of

980
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,700
Reaching
toward the future.

981
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,700
I gotta take a leak.

982
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,660
Leak?

983
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,980
I'm not detecting
any leak.

984
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,380
Don't you people from
the 24th century ever pee?

985
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,060
Oh, leak.

986
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,020
I get it.

987
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,340
That's pretty funny.

988
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,300
Excuse me.

989
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,220
Female officer:

Captain.
Crusher: jean-luc.

993
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,140
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.

994
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,100
I found something you lost.

995

997
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,620
Picard: mr. Worf,
report.

998
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,500
The borg control
over half the ship.

999
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,420
We have tried to restore
power to the bridge

1000
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,660
And the weapons systems,

1001
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,140
But we have been
unsuccessful.

1002
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,540
We have another problem.

1003
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,180
I've accessed a borg
neuro-processor,

1004
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,100
And I've discovered what
they're trying to do.

1005
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,020
They're transforming
the deflector dish

1006
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,460
Into an
interplexing beacon.

1007
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,060
Interplexing?

1008
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,340
It's a sub-space
transmitter.

1009
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,580
If they activate
the beacon,

1010
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,220
They'll be able
to establish a link

1011
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,980
With the borg living
in this century.

1012
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,420
But in the 21st century,

1013
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,340
The borg are still
in the delta quadrant.

1014
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,740
They'll send
reinforcements.

1015
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,700
Humanity will be
an easy target.

1016
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,260
Attack the earth
in the past

1017
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,740
To assimilate
the future.

1018
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,500
Then we must destroy
the deflector dish

1019
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,940
Before they can
activate the beacon.

1020
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,340
We can't get
to deflector control

1021
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,940
Or a shuttlecraft.

1022

Mr. Worf,
do you remember

combat training?

1024

I remember it made me
sick to my stomach.

1025
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,020
What are you suggesting?

1026
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,340
I think it's time that
we took a little stroll.

1027
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,220
Hang on.

1028
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,220
There's a humanoid
life sign up ahead,

the pulse emitters,

But I do not believe we will
get more than one or 2 shots

1038
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,300
Before the borg adapt.

1039
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,260
Then we must make
every shot count.

How are you doing,

Tell me,

1052
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,260
Are you using
a polymer-based neuro-relay

1053
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,260
To transit the organic
nerve impulses

1054
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,740
To the central processor
of my positronic net?

1055
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,300
If that is the case,
how have you solved

1056
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,540
The problem of increased
signal degradation

1057

Borg queen: do you
always talk this much?

Not always...

00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,900
But often.

1061
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,780
Why do you insist
on utilizing

1062
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,660
This primitive
linguistic communication?

1063
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,180
Your android brain is
capable of so much more.

1064
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,220

1065
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,300
I am endeavoring
to become more human.

1066
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,340
Human.

1067
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,340
We used to be
exactly like them:

But we evolved to
include the synthetic.

Now we use both
to attain perfection.

Your goal should be
the same as ours.

Believing oneself
to be perfect

1074

Is often the sign
of a delusional mind.

01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,340
[hums]

1159
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,420
Nnn. Unnhh!

1160
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,820
We've had a change
of plans, data.

1161
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,580
Assimilate this.

1162
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,100
Only got an hour to go, doc.
How you feeling?

1163
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,260
I got
a 4-alarm hangover,

1164
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,540
Either from the whiskey
or your laser beam...

1165
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,100
Or both,

1166
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,300
But I'm ready
to make history.
Ha ha ha ha.

1167
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,940
Troi to commander riker.

1168
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Riker here.

1169
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,140
We're ready to open
the launch door.

1170
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,180
Riker: go ahead.

1171
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,540
[door opening]

1172
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,140
Oh.

1173
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,980
Look at that.

1174
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,660
What, you
don't have a moon
in the 24th century?

1175
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,900
Sure we do. Just
looks a lot different.

1176
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,780
There are
50 million people living
on the moon in my time.

1177
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,420
You see tycho city,
new berlin,

1178
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,980
Even to lake armstrong
on a day like this.

1179
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,940
Uh-huh.

1180
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,220
And you know, doctor--

1181
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,180
Please! Don't tell me
it's all thanks to me.

1182
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,740
I've heard enough
about the great
zefram cochrane.

1183
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,940
I don't know who writes
your history books

1184
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,740
Or where you get your
information from,

1185
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,420
But you people got
some pretty funny
ideas about me.

1186
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,940
You all look at me as if
I'm some kind of...

1187
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,620
Saint or visionary
or something.

1188
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,020
I don't think
you're a saint, doc,

1189
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,020
But you did
have a vision,

1190
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,940
And now we're
sitting in it.

1191
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,100
You want to know
what my vision is?

1192
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,540
Dollar signs.

1193
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,500
Money.

1194
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,100
I didn't build this ship

1195
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,660
To usher in a new era
for humanity.

1196
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,540
You think I want
to go to the stars?

1197
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,460
I don't even
like to fly.

1198
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,620
I take trains.

1199
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,940
I built this ship

1200
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,820
So that I could
retire to some
tropical island...

1201
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,060
Filled with...

1202
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,300
Naked women.

1203
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,380
That's zefram cochrane.

1204
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,660
That's his vision.

1205
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,900
This other guy
you keep talking about,

1206
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,340
This historical
figure...

1207
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,020
I never met him.

1208
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,940
I can't imagine
I ever will.

1209
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,580
Someone once said,

1210
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,820
"don't try to be
a great man.

1211
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,420
Just be a man,
and let history make
its own judgments."

1212
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,580
That's rhetorical
nonsense.

1213
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,340
Who said that?

1214
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,940
You did...
10 years from now.

1215
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,740
You got 58 minutes, doc.

1216
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,700
You better
get on that checklist.

1217
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,300
They're on the move again.

1218
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,740
The borg
just overran 3 of our
defense checkpoints.

1219
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,900
They've taken over
decks 5 and 6.

1220
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,020
They've adapted
to every modulation
of our weapons.

1221
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,660
It's like we're
shooting blanks.

1222
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,940
We have to work
on finding another way
to modify our weapons

1223
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,540
So they'll
be more effective.

1224
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,580
In the meantime,

1225
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,420
Tell your men
to stand their ground.

1226
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,460
Sir.

1227
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,780
Fight hand-to-hand
if they have to.

1228
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,780
Aye, sir.

1229
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,780
Wait.

1230
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,380
Captain, our weapons
are useless.

1231
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,460
We must activate
the auto-destruct
sequence

1232
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,020
And use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.

1233
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,580
No!

1234
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,620
Crusher: jean-luc,
if we destroy the ship,
we destroy the borg.

1235
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,580
We're going to
stay and fight.

1236
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,940
<i>Sir, we have lost
the enterprise.
We should not sacrifice--</i>

1237
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,540
<i>We have not lost
the enterprise,
mr. Worf.</i>

1238
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,980
We're not going
to lose it,

1239
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,140
Not to the borg,
not while I'm
in command.

1240
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,340
You have
your orders.

1241
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,660
I must object
to this course
of action--

1242
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,940
Your objection
is noted.

1243
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,540
With all
due respect, sir,

1244
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,140
I believe
you are allowing

1245
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,380
Your personal experience
with the borg to influence
your judgment.

1246
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,620
You're afraid.

1247
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,740
You want
to destroy the ship
and run away.

1248
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,340
You coward.

1249
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,380
Crusher: jean-luc.

1250
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,420
If you were
any other man,

1251
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,740
I would kill you
where you stand.

1252
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,860
Get off my bridge.

1253
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,420
[door opens and closes]

1254
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,700
So, what do we do now?

1255
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,300
We carry out his orders.

1256
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,860
Dyson, kaplan,
start working on a way
to modify the weapons--

1257
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,020
This is stupid.
If we can get
off this ship

1258
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,620
And then
blow it up,
let's do it.

1259
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,900
Once the captain's
made up his mind,
the discussion is over.

1260
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:55,860
Lily!

1261
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,900
[door opens]

1262
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,700
You son of a bitch.

1263
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,300
This really
isn't the time.

1264
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,180
Ok. I don't know jack
about the 24th century,

1265
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,660
But everybody out there

1266
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,060
Thinks that staying here
and fighting the borg
is suicide.

1267
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,740
They're just afraid
to come in here
and say it.

1268
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,820
The crew is accustomed
to following my orders.

1269
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,580
They're probably
accustomed to your
orders making sense.

1270
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,780
None of them understand
the borg as I do.

1271
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,060
No one does.

1272
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,740
No one can.

1273
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,660
What is that
supposed to mean?

1274
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,340
6 years ago...

1275
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,820
They assimilated me
into their collective.

1276
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,340
They had their
cybernetic devices

1277
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,620
Implanted
throughout my body.

1278
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,180
I was linked
to the hive mind,

1279
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,380
Every trace
of individuality erased.

1280
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,700
I was one of them,

1281
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,620
So you can imagine,
my dear,

1282
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,500
I have a somewhat
unique perspective
on the borg,

1283
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,620
And I know
how to fight them.

1284
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,540
Now, if
you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

1285
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,100
I am such an idiot.

1286
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,380
It's so simple.

1287
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,740
The borg hurt you,

1288
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,300
And now you're going
to hurt them back.

1289
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,860
In my century, we don't
succumb to revenge.

1290
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,780
We have a more evolved
sensibility.

1291
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,020
Bullshit. I saw
the look on your face

1292
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,300
When you shot those borg
on the holodeck.

1293
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,900
You were almost
enjoying it.

1294
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,940
How dare you?

1295
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,660
Oh, come on, captain.
Yore not the first man

1296
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,900
To get a thrill
from murdering someone.

1297
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,660
I see it all the time.

1298
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,620
Get out!

1299
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,260
Or what,
you'll kill me

1300
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,860
Like you killed
ensign lynch?

1301
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,060
There was no way
to save him.

1302
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,340
You didn't even try.

1303
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,980
Where was your evolved
sensibility then?

1304
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,900
I don't have
time for this.

1305
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:44,180
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

1306
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,740
I didn't mean
to interrupt
your little quest.

1307
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,500
Captain ahab has to go
hunt his whale.

1308
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,060
What?

1309
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,220
You do have books
in the 24th century?

1310
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,500
This is not
about revenge.
Liar!

1311
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,020
This is about saving
the future of humanity!

1312
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,660
Jean-luc, blow up

01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,700
You wanted a human being
with a mind of his own

1476
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,580
Who could bridge
the gulf between
humanity and the borg.

1477
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,860
You wanted
a counterpart,

1478
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,020
But I resisted.

1479
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,140
I fought you.

1480
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:53,860
You can't begin
to imagine the life
you denied yourself.

1481
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,740
It's not too late.

1482
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,140
Locutus could
still be with you...

1483
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,460
Just in the way
you wanted--

1484
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,940
An equal.

1485
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,380
Let data go,

1486
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,660
And I will
take my place
at your side,

1487
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,860
Willingly without
any resistance.

1488
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:21,220
Such a noble creature...

1489
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:25,220
A quality
we sometimes lack.

1490
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,580
We will add
your distinctiveness
to our own.

1491
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,260
Welcome home...

1492
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,780
Locutus.

1493
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,740
Data, you are
free to go.

1494
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,580
Data, go.

1495
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,860
No.

1496
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,180
I do not wish to go.

1497
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:54,180
As you can see,
I have already
found an equal.

1498
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,260
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct
sequence.

1499
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,820
Data, no. Don't do it.

1500
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,900
Data, listen to me.

1501
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,500
Computer: auto-destruct
sequence deactivated.

1502
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,420
Now enter
the encryption codes and
give me computer control.

1503
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,820
Data!

1504
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,380
Data...

1505
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,940
He will make
an excellent drone.

1506
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,700
Plasma injectors
are on-line...

1507
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,580
Everything's
looking good.

1508
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,540
I think
we're ready.

1509
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,740
They should be
out there right now.

1510
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,140
We better break
the warp barrier
in the next 5 minutes

1511
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,300
If we're going to
get their attention.

1512
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,540
Nacelles are
charged and ready.

1513
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,620
Let's do it!

1514
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:00,740
Engage.

1515
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,820
Warp field
is looking good.

1516
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,620
Structural
integrity...
Is holding.

1517
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,980
Speed--20,000 kilometers
per second.

1518
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,380
Sweet jesus!

1519
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,860
Relax, doctor.

1520
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,260
I'm sure
they're just here
to give us a send-off.

1521
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,940
I am bringing
the external
sensors on-line.

1522
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,220
30 seconds
to warp threshold.

1523
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,900
Approaching
light speed...

1524
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,300
We're at critical
velocity.

1525
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,060
Qutum
torpedoes
locked.

1526
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,340
Destroy them.

1527
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:14,980
Watch...

1528
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,060
Your future's end.

1529
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,300
Data!

1530
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,500
Resistance
is futile.

1531
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Aaah!

1532
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,540
Whoooa...

1533
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,020
Aah!

1534
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,900
Aah...

1535
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,060
Aah!

1536
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:53,140
Aaah!

1537
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,660
That should be
enough.

1538
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,660
Throttle back.
Take us out of warp.

1539
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,020
Is that earth?

1540
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,700
Geordi: that's it.

1541
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,820
It's so small.

1542
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:26,020
It's about to get
a whole lot bigger.

1543
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,500
Captain.

1544
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,220
Data.

1545
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,340
Are you all right?

1546
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:53,380
I would imagine
I look worse than I...

1547
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,540
Feel.

1548
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,380
Strange.

1549
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,940
Part of me is...

1550
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,340
Sorry she is dead.

1551
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,980
She was unique.

1552
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,380
She brought me
closer to humanity

1553
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,260
Than I ever
thought possible,

1554
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,500
And for a time...

1555
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,380
I was tempted
by her offer.

1556
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,220
How long a time?

1557
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,540
0.68 seconds, sir.

1558
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,860
For an android...

1559
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,580
That is nearly
an eternity.

1560
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:56,180
Picard: captain's log,
April 5, 2063.

1561
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,300
<i>The voyage of the phoenix
was a success...</i>

1562
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,420
Again.

1563
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,620
The alien ship
detected the warp signature

1564
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:06,940
And is on its way
to rendezvous with history.

1565
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,260
My god...

1566
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,700
They're really
from another world.

1567
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:26,500
And they're going to
want to meet the man
who flew that warp ship.

1568
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,900
Live long and prosper.

1569
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,180
Thanks.

1570
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,140
I think
it's time we made
a discreet exit.

Stand by

1574
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,020
You gotta go?

1575
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,420
I envy you...

1576
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,100
The world
you're going to.

1577

I envy you...

1578
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:14,260
Taking these first steps
into a new frontier.

1579
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,580
I shall miss you, lily.

Energize.

1582

Report.

1583
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,780
The moon's gravitational
field obscured
our warp signature.

1584
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,060
The vulcans
did not detect us.

1585
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,860
Captain,
I've reconfigured
our warp field

1586
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,460
To match the
chronometric readings
of the borg sphere.

1587
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:52,900
Recreate the vortex,
commander.

1588
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,860
Aye, sir.

1589
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:54,820

Mr. Data, lay in a course
for the 24th century.

1592
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,620
I suspect our future
is there waiting for us.

1593
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,740
Course laid in, sir.

1594
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,260
Make it so.
