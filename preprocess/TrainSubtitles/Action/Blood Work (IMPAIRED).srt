00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,695
No.

160
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,612
Just get a little air.

161
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,655
Let me give us some air
and make it more comfortable.

162
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,132
Okay, let me get this straight. You're
conducting a homicide investigation...

163
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,814
...into the Gloria Torres case?

164
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,129
That's true.

165
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,169
You don't have a license to practice
as a private investigator in California?

166
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,009
That's right.

167
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,176
Do you know it's a crime to practice
as an investigator without a license?

168
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,251
Will you knock off the crap?

169
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,856
I just wanted to have a talk.
Knock off the tape too.

170
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,808
- He's blocking the microphone anyway.
- Why didn't you say?

171
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,734
In the three years we've
interrogated here, maybe I forgot.

172
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,734
Come on, fellas. I'm just
here to help. Have a doughnut.

173
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,975
How do you know Graciella Rivers?

174
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,531
She's an acquaintance.
I told her I'd look into it. That's all.

175
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,896
If you guys aren't gonna have one,
I'm gonna have one.

176
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,015
Look.

177
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,812
I don't care what her sister told you,
Mr. Former FBI Profiler.

178
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,369
This ain't the type of case you like.

179
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,816
This ain't a glamorous case
that will get headlines.

180
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,929
This isn't Charles Manson
or Ted fucking Bundy.

181
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,251
This is an ordinary
convenience-store robbery.

182
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,012
Some idiot with a gun...

183
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,059
...with the right ratio
of balls to brains pulled the trigger.

184
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,415
I told her I'd check it out.

185
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,732
You've been on this a while,
and a fresh pair of eyes won't hurt.

186
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,178
I won't grandstand anybody.
I'll give any information to you first.

187
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,774
I'm not trying to one-up anyone.

188
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,055
What do you want?

189
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,009
A copy of the murder book
and a video walk-through of the scene.

190
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,535
I was always good with crime scenes.

191
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,179
- No can do.
- Why not?

192
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,571
- No way, man.
- How often does the sister call you?

193
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,055
Every day, weekends, holidays...
Believe it or not, we got feelings.

194
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,690
It hurts me to tell her there
are no leads or suspects.

195
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,215
I can get her off your case.

196
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,852
I tell her I looked into it, you're
doing a good job, she stops calling.

197
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,374
You were always good at a crime scene.

198
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,134
But the key word is "were. "
Are you still?

199
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,656
You just give me a copy
of the tape, that's all.

200
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,373
Oh.

201
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,693
We got more than
just the crime-scene tape.

202
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,450
We've got the crime.

203
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,180
Bring the doughnuts. Come on.

204
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,209
WALLER:
That's Kyungwon Kang, the owner.

205
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,175
ARRANGO: He's making his last sale.
She comes in to buy a candy bar.

206
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,412
Yeah, for her kid.

207
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,730
And here he is. Ba-da-bing! Pow, pow.

208
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,292
He picked up all the shells.

209
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,249
MCCALEB:
Hm.

210
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,338
Won't see this on
<i>America 's Favorite Videos</i>.

211
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,290
- There's no sound on that camera?
- Right. He's just talking to himself.

212
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,659
- Could you run it in slow motion?
- Hold on. It's not over.

213
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,969
This guy coming up we call
the Good Samaritan. Watch.

214
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,215
This guy goes up and down the aisles,
looking for bandages, I guess.

215
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,654
Couldn't find any, so he used paper
towels to wrap her head.

216
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,497
The camera never really
gets a good look at him.

217
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,699
After he's finished, he goes outside,
he dials 911...

218
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,739
...and splits.

219
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,052
The voice was Latino. We figure
he was illegal, afraid to stay.

220
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,450
Yeah. That's too bad.

221
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,454
He probably got a look
at the car or the shooter.

222
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,250
We put out fliers, went on all
the Spanish stations. Nothing.

223
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,812
- May I?
- Knock yourself out.

224
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,777
Pushing the pause button
ain't gonna help her.

225
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,809
$32 in the cash register.

226
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,050
Look at that. He winked.

227
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,973
WALLER:
What?

228
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,848
Yeah.

229
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,578
Huh.

230
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,329
ARRANGO:
Well, there you have it, Mr. FBI Guy.

231
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,930
Tell us something we don't know.

232
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,780
The shooter's been
in the store before.

233
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,500
He knew the placement
of the camera.

234
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,857
He's from the neighborhood,
or he just cased the place.

235
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,898
This isn't the first time either.

236
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,257
No emotion, no panic,
policed up his own brass.

237
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,739
This guy's done it before.

238
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,576
What?

239
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,650
How many others?

240
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,850
Let me look at the murder book.

241
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,693
We have to talk to our lieutenant.
We'll be in touch.

242
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,648
- When?
- Give me a number. We'll be in touch!

243
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,380
WALLER: Jesus Christ.

244
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,853
You guys can keep the doughnuts.

245
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,338
We don't need your doughnuts
or your shit!

246
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,092
We got enough of our own!

247
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,337
WOMAN:
Okay. Thanks.

248
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,415
MCCALEB: Mrs. Kang?
- Yes? I know you?

249
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,649
No.

250
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,889
I heard what happened here.
Your husband and all. I'm sorry.

251
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,290
Yes, thank you.

252
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,850
The only way to keep evil out
is not unlock door.

253
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,215
We can't do that.

254
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,848
- We must have business.
- Yeah.

255
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,690
Thank you, ma'am.

256
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,218
[CAR STARTS]

257
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,169
You gonna pay me, or should
I drive you somewhere else?

258
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,494
MCCALEB:
Nearest public library.

259
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,133
Detective Winston said to wait here.
She'll be right with you.

260
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,858
Thanks.

261
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,216
Huh.

262
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,535
Well, well, well, Terry McCaleb.

263
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,130
- Hi.
- As I live and breathe.

264
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,333
Look at you.

265
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,578
Look at you.

266
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,817
I hear you got a new ticker.

267
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,293
That's right. I'm all right, though.

268
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,689
How are you doing, babe?

269
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,979
Me? You know, same old, same old.

270
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,777
So, what's up?
You on a private ticket now?

271
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,977
No. Just doing a favor for a friend.

272
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,289
What case is it?

273
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,098
James Cordell. ATM holdup.

274
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,409
Let's see.

275
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,452
January 22. Newspaper says he was
shot by a guy wearing a ski mask.

276
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,977
Who's this friend you're
doing the favor for?

277
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,339
Graciella Rivers. Her sister was
shot in a store two weeks after.

278
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,255
Also a man in a ski mask.

279
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,015
Am I right? Are they connected?

280
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,697
Yeah. Same guy.
Out of your orbit, though.

281
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,057
Scumbag with a gun.
Three-strikes shit, that's all.

282
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,289
MCCALEB:
What do you mean?

283
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,453
Guy has two felonies,
third puts him away for life.

284
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,214
So he kills any witnesses.

285
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,937
Robbery, murder, it's all the same
sentence for him either way.

286
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,219
I talked to the boys over at L.A.P.D.,
and they showed me a tape...

287
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,497
...but they wouldn't copy
me the murder book.

288
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,616
Hm.

289
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,011
- I'll bet they copied you, though.
- Hm.

290
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,574
Come on, darling,
you owe me just one little one.

291
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,538
I know that.

292
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,134
When you handed me
the Cemetery Man bust...

293
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,619
...you were my membership into
this boys club. I haven't forgotten.

294
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,454
Does that mean yes?

295
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,297
Terry McCaleb.

296
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,378
Lucky for us the bank
had two cameras on this.

297
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,132
The shooter's back there.

298
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,612
I'm betting the mask isn't on yet,
or Cordell would have run.

299
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,932
H&K 9mm, same model used
in the Valley tape.

300
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,614
Hold that.
Back it up a little bit.

301
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,210
Back up there.
Look, he's saying something.

302
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,213
Like in the Valley tape.
He talked there too.

303
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah, he's a real chatterbox.

304
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,820
Did you get a lip reader in?

305
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,971
I'll get on it.

306
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,735
What about his cartridge?
Did he pick up his brass?

307
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,495
- Yeah, there he is.
- Uh-huh.

308
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,093
James Lockridge.

309
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,173
Pulled into the bank lot,
almost got sideswiped by a sedan.

310
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,093
Says it was a white guy,
but nothing else.

311
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,572
He called for the ambulance.
Cordell died going to the hospital.

312
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,300
You got any leads at all?

313
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,850
No, I'm following
the three-strike thing.

314
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,649
I think the man in the ski mask
is one of those.

315
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,854
What about the gun? H&K's
expensive for a holdup man.

316
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,137
That's weird he'd keep
it after the first killing.

317
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,737
I thought about that. I figure he
stole it, but that lead me nowhere.

318
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,458
I don't know. I think we'll need
fresh blood to solve this one.

319
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,816
Well, Jaye...

320
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,256
...why don't you get me
a copy of the book?

321
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,451
Both yours and L.A. Could you?

322
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,333
I'll ask the captain.
I don't see why not.

323
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,572
He was the lieutenant
on the Cemetery Man case.

324
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,652
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

325
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,371
Oh, well. I'm glad
someone got promoted.

326
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,812
[CHUCKLES]

327
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,129
- Right here.
- Thanks.

328
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,930
Mr. Lockridge, Terry McCaleb.
Thanks for seeing me.

329
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,374
LOCKRIDGE:
Are you a policeman?

330
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,455
No, retired FBI. I'm investigating
a related case for a victim's family.

331
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,498
- Good. Because police are stupid.
- Why?

332
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,820
- Didn't they tell you?
- No.

333
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,411
Why would they? When I found
the guy, I call 911, right?

334
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,609
MCCALEB: Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,772
They sent the ambulance
to the wrong place.

336
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,658
Took them 20 minutes.

337
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,937
He might have made it
if they hadn't screwed up.

338
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,011
- Those things happen.
- No.

339
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,172
They screwed up. A guy died.
End of story.

340
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,973
I'm busy. I agreed to see you
because you're already here, so...

341
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,414
...what do you want?

342
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,219
I thought you'd give your
statement to me firsthand.

343
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,019
For the love of God.
I needed cash.

344
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,377
As I pulled up, the guy
driving out almost hits me.

345
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,170
All I saw was a car.
There were no plates, no face, nothing.

346
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,537
I walk up to the ATM,
and there's this guy bleeding.

347
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,659
I figured he got it right before
I got there, so I called 911.

348
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,177
Ten minutes later, they come,
driving right fucking past us. Past us.

349
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,058
Any other details?

350
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,974
It could've been me.
Could've been him finding me...

351
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,419
...with the ambulance driving
right on fucking by. Good stuff.

352
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,170
You done?

353
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,936
Yeah.

354
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,689
Hey, Buddy.

355
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,535
Here's to you. Semper fi,
auld lang syne, keep on trucking.

356
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,260
You look like a skunk.

357
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,889
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Same as always. Big, fat goose egg.

358
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,169
I could use a driver.
$ 10 an hour and meals.

359
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,938
- What's up? An investigation?
- I just need a driver, not a partner.

360
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,808
Okay. I'm in. Whose car?

361
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,893
If we take yours, I'll buy gas,
or I'll sit in the back in mine...

362
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,779
...because of the air bags.
- Your chest, right?

363
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,055
Yeah.

364
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,099
Let's take mine. That way
I won't feel like a chauffeur.

365
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,330
See you in the a.m.

366
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,939
You look tired, Terry.
You should get some sleep!

367
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,618
You don't deserve it.

368
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,295
First of all, I have no idea
where your heart came from.

369
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,498
All BOPRA tells us is they
have an organ...

370
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,220
...with a match to someone on the list.

371
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,814
In your case, we told you
what we knew.

372
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,451
Female, 32, perfect health,
perfect blood typing, perfect donor.

373
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,975
She was murdered.

374
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,812
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

375
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,732
What are you talking about?

376
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,377
She was shot during a robbery and lived
long enough for me to get her heart.

377
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,653
How do you know? You're not
supposed to know about the donor.

378
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,418
Her sister found me.

379
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,892
She read about how I had a rare
blood type like her sister...

380
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,972
...and that my surgery
was on the day she died.

381
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,574
What does she want? Money?

382
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,889
[CHUCKLES]

383
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,176
I'm glad you can find it funny.

384
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,338
She wants me to find out who did it.

385
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,775
She wants me to solve the murder.

386
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,058
Shit. Give me this woman's
name right now.

387
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,853
- You're not thinking of doing this?
- I started yesterday.

388
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,298
And today you're running a fever!
You are 60 days post-transplant!

389
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,293
As your doctor,
I'm ordering you not to do this.

390
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,454
- Respect the gift you were given.
- I do, I do. It was her gift.

391
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,135
She'd be dead either way.
You don't owe her.

392
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,690
It was supposed to be an accident.

393
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,694
99 out of 100 of these are head
injuries that end up fatal.

394
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,849
This one is different.

395
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,171
How is it different?
A heart's a heart!

396
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,695
An accident is fate. Murder is evil.

397
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,889
Please.

398
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,898
I wouldn't have this gift if somebody
hadn't done this hateful, evil thing.

399
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,018
You're not making sense.

400
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,968
She goes into a store
to buy a candy bar for her kid.

401
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,614
I can't explain it.

402
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,489
Terry, sit down.

403
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,293
- You know that little boy in room 218?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,976
He's waiting for a heart that
isn't coming. That could be you.

405
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,008
This is your one chance, Terry.
You tell that woman no.

406
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,292
You save yourself and tell her no!

407
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,688
I can't.

408
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,930
You're gambling with your life.

409
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,410
You get infection or rejection,
there's nothing we can do.

410
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,174
- I have no choice.
- Neither do I.

411
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,855
I can't be your doctor.
I won't be around for this.

412
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,499
Come on, doc.

413
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,538
I'll have your records ready
in the morning.

414
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,258
Good luck, Terry.

415
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,254
Graciella. Make it quick.

416
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,378
- Hello?
MCCALEB: <i>Graciella</i>.

417
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,695
This is McCaleb.

418
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,010
GRACIELLA:
<i>What's going on?</i>

419
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,573
Tell me about her.

420
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,169
What do you mean?

421
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,935
Just tell me something about Gloria.

422
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,412
The more I know, the more
I can get a handle on this thing.

423
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,130
Do you have a kitchen on the boat?

424
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,810
A galley, yeah.

425
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,694
Is it big enough to cook a real meal?

426
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,371
Yeah, sort of.

427
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,851
So...

428
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,569
You want to know my sister,
you'll have to meet her son.

429
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,570
He's everything that was good
about her. It's in him.

430
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,937
I'll bring him by later,
and I'll make you dinner.

431
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,614
Good. I'd like that.

432
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,376
Okay. Then you can
give me an update.

433
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,809
Look, just so you know it, these cases
usually turn on some small detail.

434
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,529
Something someone forgot
or didn't think was important.

435
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,009
That's the key.
I'll have to find it.

436
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,492
You have Glory's heart.
She'll guide you.

437
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,259
Yeah. Thanks.

438
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,091
Quick enough?

439
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,690
BUDDY: You okay?
- Yeah.

440
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,578
BUDDY: Huh?
- Dandy.

441
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,099
BUDDY: I'll tell you what. Let me stop
by the In-N-Out on Victory.

442
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,576
I don't think they serve
hamburgers here. What's up?

443
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,097
The sheriff's office listed all
the three-strikes robbery suspects.

444
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,539
They also made a list of every H&K P7
pistol stolen in the last few years.

445
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,329
I charted that list
plus the address...

446
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,731
...and the work location
of every man on the list.

447
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,892
- A cross-reference to check overlap?
- Exactly.

448
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:43,180
One guy stands out like a whore
in church, and that's Mikail Bolotov.

449
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,856
He's a two-time loser, lives a mile
from where Gloria Torres was shot...

450
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,854
...and works four blocks from where
an H&K was stolen in December.

451
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,898
Why didn't they arrest
this Polo, Bolo...?

452
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,288
- Bolotov.
- Bolotov.

453
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,497
Oh, a Russian son of a bitch!

454
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,979
They don't know about the pistol.
It seems he has a good alibi.

455
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,372
It's his timecard. He punched
out after the Cordell murder.

456
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,055
- A friend could have done that.
- Yeah, true.

457
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,415
- I still don't know why we're here.
- Well...

458
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,093
This is where he works.
I'm gonna go have a talk with him.

459
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,617
- Cool.
- Where are you going?

460
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,295
You go after him, I pull you off.
Good cop, bad cop?

461
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,170
- No. Stay with the car.
- Come on, man. Starsky and Putz.

462
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,890
What are you expecting in there?

463
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,895
Nothing. This is just for show.
Hold this. Thanks.

464
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,694
Can I help you?

465
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,369
My name is McCaleb.

466
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,733
Following up the sheriff's department
investigation of February 3.

467
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,053
Just a minute, please.

468
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,414
Mr. Toliver? A Mr. McCaleb from
the sheriff's department is here.

469
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,376
- We're awfully busy, Mr. McCaleb.
- I'll get right to the point, then.

470
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,692
A few months ago, some deputies
asked you about an employee.

471
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,253
- Bolotov?
- Yes.

472
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,776
I'm on the case.
I'd like to get a few more points.

473
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,578
I'll tell you what I told them.

474
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,898
Bolotov was working that day.
You can see his timecards.

475
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,936
How many employees
do you have here at one time?

476
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,089
Eighty-five.

477
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,936
Is it possible that one of them might
have punched his timecard for him?

478
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,696
We've been in business 16 years.
It's happened.

479
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,219
Is he here today?

480
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,256
Yes, that's him over there.

481
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,491
Bolotov. That's Russian, right?

482
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,220
They're good workers
and don't complain.

483
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,575
They don't mind being paid shit.

484
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,618
- I'd like to talk to him.
- In here?

485
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,535
You want to maintain your cooperation
with the sheriff's office, don't you?

486
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,608
Yeah, all right.

487
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,332
Bolotov, up in the office.

488
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,656
Mr. Bolotov.
Have a chair.

489
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,334
Where were you on the night
of January 22?

490
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,259
I told them before.
I worked that night.

491
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,890
I know, but we know things
now that we didn't know then.

492
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,971
What things?

493
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,850
There was a burglary on Mason Street,
about four blocks from here.

494
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,729
- Is that where you got the gun?
- What gun?

495
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,059
And February 7, I suppose you
got an alibi for that night too.

496
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,935
I don't know that night.

497
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,419
'Course you do!

498
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,290
That's the night you went into Kang's
grocery store and killed two people.

499
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,576
Who are you?

500
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,813
You're not a cop.
Cops goes twos. Who are you?

501
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,617
I'm the Lone Ranger. Now sit down.

502
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,569
No badge. See? No cop.

503
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,018
"Terrell McCaleb. "

504
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,933
Maybe one day, I pay you visit.

505
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,215
Yes?

506
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,531
Not now. I'll get back to him.

507
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,891
Bolotov's alibi isn't solid.
Think about it.

508
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,576
Even if you had a badge,
it'd be the wrong one.

509
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,259
I like him for this.

510
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,493
Bolotov's an ex-con. He could have
done that for any reason.

511
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,055
- You should still put out a pickup.
- Got you a soda, Terr.

512
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,332
- Who the hell are you?
- Buddy, Terry's partner.

513
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,615
- Sort of.
- Great.

514
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,930
Let's get back to Bolotov.

515
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,297
I've already sent a car to his
apartment. He's gone.

516
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,655
- I hit a nerve.
- I'll say.

517
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,256
Remember my lieutenant, who's
now my captain? He's unhappy.

518
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,854
He doesn't want to hear
from you again.

519
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,057
Terry has worked very hard on this.
We both have.

520
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,734
- Sh...
- Shut up.

521
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,248
Also...

522
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:16,017
...he wants the tapes and murder
books back first thing in the morning.

523
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,571
Will that give you enough
time to copy everything?

524
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,334
I've already done that. Thanks.

525
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,775
Go home, you look like crap.

526
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,976
Wait a minute.

527
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,448
Lip reader is 90°% ° certain the shooter
was saying, "Happy Valentine's Day. "

528
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,258
Happy Valent...

529
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,652
That doesn't sound like your average
three-strikes guy, does it?

530
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,217
What's the average these days?

531
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,055
Not much, man.

532
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,977
Happy Valentine's Day.

533
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,259
GRACIELLA:
Do you see the boat?

534
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,455
I told you.

535
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,977
- How much homework do you have?
RAYMOND: Three questions.

536
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,932
- Hey.
GRACIELLA: Hey.

537
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,016
You forgot, didn't you?

538
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,650
Sort of. I kind of got lost
the last couple hours.

539
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,970
- We can do this another time.
- No.

540
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,734
No, we're having dinner.
Come on up.

541
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,489
- Is this Raymond?
- This is Raymond.

542
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,128
This is the man I was
telling you about.

543
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,770
MCCALEB: How are you doing?
- What's <i>The Following Sea</i>?

544
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,218
That's the one that you have to
watch for, the one right behind you.

545
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,216
- Where's the kitchen? I mean, galley?
MCCALEB: Right in here.

546
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,292
- Can you fish off this boat?
- Yeah, you can.

547
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,577
Come on back,
I'll get you a fishing pole.

548
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,539
Jesus.

549
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,054
I didn't want you to see that.

550
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,016
Was she...?

551
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,219
Was she ever scared?

552
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,336
No, she never knew anything.

553
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,772
What I've asked you to do,
it just isn't fair.

554
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,211
Is it?

555
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,176
There's a restaurant in the marina.
Good atmosphere, view of the sunset.

556
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,377
Why don't I just take you
to dinner there.

557
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,211
GRACIELLA:
Why do you live on a boat?

558
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,974
MCCALEB:
I hate mowing lawns.

559
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,012
Why do you live onshore?

560
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,570
GRACIELLA: Because that's where
my warm, cozy apartment is.

561
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,609
You were right, though.

562
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,972
It's a great sunset.

563
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,529
Yeah, you never get tired of it.
Does he stay with you?

564
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,537
Yeah. His dad isn't around.

565
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,898
He's a great kid. Your sister
must have been a good woman.

566
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,376
Thank you.

567
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,939
So how is it going, McCaleb?

568
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,490
Any hope?

569
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,454
Start thinking about your sister...

570
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,579
...who her friends were,
where she went, all of her routines.

571
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,938
- All right. How come?
- That's just an angle I'm working on.

572
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,409
Did she ever know a James Cordell?

573
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,299
- Cordell?
- Yeah.

574
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,649
No.

575
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,129
- You sure?
- Positive. Why?

576
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,178
It may be nothing.
It might be premature...

577
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,093
You think this James Cordell
killed her.

578
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,892
No, nothing like that.

579
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,292
Stop, McCaleb, with the prematures
and the angles. What?

580
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,409
Cordell was killed at an ATM machine
two weeks before your sister died.

581
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,697
We think it's the same gunman
in both cases.

582
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,532
Why would she know Cordell?

583
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,897
They were both in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

584
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,575
This investigation's being conducted
under the theory...

585
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,699
...that the locations were chosen
and the victims were random.

586
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,934
It's the other way around. It's not
where that's important. It's who.

587
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,888
- Gunman took money, so it's robbery...
- Bear with me.

588
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,938
Cordell and your sister
were connected.

589
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,059
There's some intersecting link
between them and the killer.

590
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,372
I'm not following you.

591
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,296
At the Bureau, we used to call
this a full-field investigation.

592
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,736
- That's what I'm conducting here.
- Full-field investigation.

593
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,299
Yeah.

594
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,089
Okay.

595
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,088
Come on!

596
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,135
You know, there was one thing
that's always bothered me.

597
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,972
- What?
- Nothing, but...

598
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,209
What is it?

599
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,976
Glory had this piece of jewelry she
always wore. Like a good-luck charm.

600
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,453
She never took it off. When the police
brought me her effects, it was missing.

601
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,609
What was it?

602
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,978
It was a single earring,
a dangling crucifix.

603
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,813
Okay. So, what does it mean?

604
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,330
Nothing. Some killers take
souvenirs, I suppose.

605
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,453
- That's sick.
- Yeah.

606
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,609
Are you okay?

607
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,216
Yeah. I gotta get back to the boat
for my medicine.

608
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,816
We have to get going too.
Raymond has some homework.

609
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,969
Raymond?

610
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,370
We've gotta go!

611
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,929
Say thank you to Mr. McCaleb. Come!

612
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,295
Thank you!

613
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,415
- Give me that school bag.
- Okay.

614
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,332
- Say thank you.
RAYMOND: Thank you.

615
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,572
MCCALEB: See you later.
GRACIELLA: Give me the school bag.

616
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,175
And he takes the earring.

617
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,015
Hey, Buddy!

618
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,179
What's up?

619
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,736
You're working tomorrow, 6 a.m.

620
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,891
Cool. Whatever.

621
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,092
BUDDY:
Who wants to go to the desert anyhow?

622
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,412
We go where the clues lead.

623
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,578
Don't any clues lead to the beach?

624
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,860
They lead where they lead. Usually
pretty close to where they started.

625
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,619
I have to ask, Terry.

626
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,539
How did it feel?

627
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,058
Back in the day, when you were
going up against all those sickos?

628
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,699
That was my job.

629
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,455
Come on, man. I mean,
driving a truck, that's a job.

630
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,259
All those killers
you used to hunt down.

631
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,699
I read in the paper some used to leave
you messages. That ain't truck driving.

632
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,092
Only one, actually,
ever left me messages.

633
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,056
Sorry, I'm sticking my nose
in it, I know.

634
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,573
Connected.

635
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,892
What?

636
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,770
When I was at the top of my game,
I felt connected to everything.

637
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,410
The victim, the killer,
the crime scene.

638
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,298
Everything.

639
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,296
Just felt like it was all part of me.
It's beginning to feel that way again.

640
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,736
Cool.

641
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:49,457
I'll tell you what. Driving is okay
because I would shit my shorts.

642
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,852
I would.

643
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,219
But that's why you're a famous cop
and I'm a boat bum. A loser.

644
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,652
Buddy, you're not a loser.

645
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,133
It's okay, Terry.
Only my mom has to tell me that.

646
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,133
My friends can tell me the truth.

647
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,169
Mrs. Cordell?

648
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,250
I'm Terry McCaleb. I called you.

649
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,411
Is this a bad time?

650
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,250
- As opposed to a good time?
- Poor choice of words. Can we talk?

651
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,010
Is that your partner in the car?

652
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,251
Yeah.

653
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,448
I wanted to hire an investigator,
but I couldn't afford to.

654
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,293
Couldn't afford to find out
who killed him.

655
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,213
You work for the police?

656
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,450
No, I'm a retired FBI agent.

657
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,898
I'm also a friend of the family
of the woman killed in Canoga Park.

658
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,255
We think it's the same gunman.

659
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,694
I see.

660
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,890
I'd like to tell you I'm sorry.
That's hard coming from a stranger...

661
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,133
...but I went through the files, and
James seemed like a good man.

662
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,209
Funny hearing him called James.
Everyone called him Jimmy.

663
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,769
And he was a very good man.

664
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,659
How can I help, Mr. McCaleb?

665
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,135
See this photograph?
Does this woman look familiar to you?

666
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,815
- Is that someone he might have known?
- I don't think so.

667
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,138
- Is that the victim from Canoga Park?
- Right.

668
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,530
- Is that her son?
- Uh-huh.

669
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,939
I don't understand.

670
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,568
How could he know her?
Are you suggesting they...?

671
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,050
- No, nothing like that.
- Then, like what?

672
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,018
We think your husband and Miss Torres
may have crossed paths with the killer...

673
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:55,459
...sort of the relationship between
the victim and the gunman.

674
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:01,138
The smallest detail of them coming
in contact is very, very important.

675
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,054
Something like dining at the same
restaurant, for instance.

676
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,013
- A restaurant the killer went to?
- Yeah.

677
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,092
That sounds like stalking,
not robbery.

678
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,732
To be honest with you, we're not sure
robbery is the motive in this case.

679
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,254
When they brought back his effects,
was it all there?

680
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,173
Was anything missing?
Rings, watches?

681
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,092
No.

682
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,334
You're sure he couldn't have been
in the Valley two weeks before?

683
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,335
No, he spent a month in Northern
California, working on the aqueduct.

684
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,857
And when my husband wasn't
working, he was home with me.

685
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,217
- Is that his car?
- Yes.

686
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,415
Any personal effects in that?

687
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,571
A picture on the dashboard.

688
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,618
- Still there?
- I don't know. I would think.

689
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,898
The sheriff's department drove
it home. I haven't been in it.

690
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,255
Can I...?

691
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,491
There it is.

692
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,412
MCCALEB:
Right here, yeah.

693
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,209
Any of this stuff your husband's
favorite knickknacks?

694
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,369
No, sorry.

695
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,179
Could you jot down your
husband's routines for me...?

696
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,012
- His sunglasses.
- What?

697
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,412
They hung from the mirror on a cord.
They're missing.

698
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,899
What kind of glasses?

699
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,370
They were Wayfarers.
He had them for years.

700
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,896
- Wayfarers?
- What do you think it means?

701
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,338
I said, what do you think it means?

702
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,493
Probably nothing.

703
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,733
Thanks, Mrs. Cordell.
I'll call you if anything comes up.

704
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,377
Easy, Mac. What's the matter?

705
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,739
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

706
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,575
I saw the killer, Buddy.

707
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,055
At the bank, at the ATM,
where Cordell was killed.

708
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,217
Wait a minute, that's crazy.
That's the last place he would be.

709
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,575
No, it fits the profile.

710
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,368
Profile? What profile?

711
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,215
Take me to the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office.

712
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,688
No, wait! I don't get it.
Why would the killer go back?

713
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,932
Okay. Never mind, I'll just drive.

714
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,330
- Now you're starting to get it.
- This goes any longer, I want a raise.

715
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,373
How about workmen's comp?

716
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,729
Detective Winston's in the field.
Can I take a message?

717
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,892
- Tell her McCaleb was by.
- Hey.

718
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,689
She wanted to see you, Mr. McCaleb.

719
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,339
How about that?

720
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,817
It's McCaleb, Jaye.

721
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,531
WINSTON: <i>I'm en route. You should get</i>
<i>yourself down here ASAP</i>.

722
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,731
What was that first part?

723
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,210
<i>I said, we've got Bolotov</i>.

724
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,849
- Stay there, Buddy.
- This sucks!

725
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:34,252
Trash collectors found him.
We think he's been here since early a.m.

726
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,571
- What are they doing here?
- This alley is the line.

727
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,729
The line?

728
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,972
South side's L.A.P.D.,
north is sheriff's department.

729
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,893
We're not sure who
has jurisdiction yet.

730
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,057
Congratulations, old man!

731
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,179
You shook him out of his tree.
Dumb bastard killed himself.

732
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,773
H&K 9mm.

733
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,376
Same as both murders.
I bet ballistics confirms it.

734
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,491
- What are you talking about?
- He's saying this case is closed.

735
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,969
Bolotov, he doesn't fit the profile.

736
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,449
- Of what?
- A serial killer.

737
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,655
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

738
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,096
This guy stalks his victims
and kills them on camera...

739
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,538
...then he takes trophy items.
- What are you talking about?

740
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,249
I was at the ATM crime scene.
The killer was behind me.

741
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,572
He had Cordell's glasses on,
and he had Gloria Torres' earring.

742
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,777
Did they look like these?

743
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,012
This? And this?

744
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,772
I don't care what you call him.
We got him.

745
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,055
- I don't know, his hair was long.
- Maybe it was a wig?

746
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,938
Maybe.

747
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,058
- You wanna sit down?
- I'm fine, goddamn it.

748
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,179
- Why don't you lay down?
- Arrango, shut up!

749
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,257
There's something in his mouth.

750
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,973
- It's a bullet.
- No way it came from a 9mm.

751
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,379
- Looks like a.38 to me.
- Why'd he put a.38 slug in his mouth?

752
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,373
Same reason he died
on the jurisdiction line.

753
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,929
Somebody's trying to jerk us all off.

754
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,819
Personally, I like being jerked off.

755
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,090
This case is closed in my book.

756
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,098
You're just worried, aren't you?

757
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,057
- Worried?
- Yeah.

758
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,289
About what?

759
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,931
That I might bust this case.
You don't care who gets hurt or killed.

760
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,049
- As long as I don't bust the case.
- What the fuck is it to you anyway?

761
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,849
Gloria Torres, that victim
you didn't give a shit about?

762
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,693
I've got her heart. That's what.
That's right.

763
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,734
I'm alive because she's dead.
That puts me in this bigtime.

764
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,610
You're an asshole, and you can't help
it, but I'm on this case for a while.

765
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,975
I'll be along until we get him.

766
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,736
I don't care whether it's you, him
or whoever. I'm in this.

767
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,610
Stay out of my city!
Go get yourself a dick transplant!

768
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,817
Conflict of interest.

I know the Noone part. But Jasper?

What?

784
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:21,979
I heard it on the news. They said
that they found a Russian man...

785
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,893
...who may be the killer.

I don't think so, but I don't know.

788
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:33,897
They said they had evidence that
could link this guy to both murders.

789
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:37,372
That may just be two cops
trying to grab headlines.

I don't know. Sorry.

through every night without his mother.

I'm sorry.

796
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:03,773
I did what you asked.

797
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,934
I made a list of all
of Glory's routines.

That's good.

She used to go to that market
almost every night.

800
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,098
She'd take Raymond
to McDonald's a lot. Too much.

The one on Ventura and Reseda.

802
01:00:22,781 --> 01:00:27,616
And she would go bowling,
but not lately.

803
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:30,420
She used to visit an aunt
every Thursday...

804
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:34,655
...because our aunt was in a
nursing home in Culver City.

805
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:38,496
Like a responsible person,
she never missed a day of work.

806
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,051
She gave blood every month,
took her son to school...

807
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,894
...and I wanna understand
why she was killed!

808

What?

809
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:48,700
She gave blood?

810
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:53,014
Yes, McCaleb. She's the same
blood type as you are.

01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:55,137
AB with a CMV negative.

812
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:59,294
The hospital would have paid her,
but she wouldn't accept money.

Is there another way to find out?

821
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:35,579
If he gave blood often,
he'd be on the computer.

- Which computer?
- The BOPRA computer.

Look at him. Look at his color.

before he killed her.

No.

941

No, that doesn't make any sense,

945

Yeah.

947

See, Cordell, his organs
were no good.

948
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:27,577
This time, the shooter would make
sure the ambulance got a good lead.

949
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:31,416
So he shot Gloria, then
he comes back with bandages...

950
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,049
...and tries to keep her alive.

Put a wig on him, maybe.

had them on the way anyway.

01:38:42,621 --> 01:38:46,409
Come on, man.

1233
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:48,220
We're connected.

1234
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:51,175
Think of what you're doing.

1235
01:38:51,861 --> 01:38:53,579
You need me.

1236
01:38:54,581 --> 01:38:56,651
No, Buddy.

1237
01:38:56,821 --> 01:39:01,417
Remember how you said I was your
friend and I could tell you the truth?

1238
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:05,538
Well, I don't need you at all.

1239
01:39:18,981 --> 01:39:21,017
Ten ring.

1240
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:30,614
I saved you.

1241
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:51,054
- Right next to you the whole time.
- Yeah.

1242
01:39:51,221 --> 01:39:52,495
You okay?

1243
01:39:52,661 --> 01:39:56,256
Yeah, I'm okay.
Never felt better.

1244
01:39:56,421 --> 01:39:58,776
You got his ass.

1245
01:39:58,941 --> 01:40:01,614
Yeah, there's "no one" anymore.

1246
01:40:01,821 --> 01:40:06,099
Give me a day to catch my breath,
I'll write you a full report.

1247
01:40:06,261 --> 01:40:08,331
I want to see it.

1248
01:40:08,501 --> 01:40:09,854
Two of them okay?

1249
01:40:10,021 --> 01:40:12,330
Yeah, if everyone will
leave them alone...

1250
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:14,890
...not get them any more involved.

1251
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:18,576
- I'll see what I can do about that.
- That's a pal.

1252
01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:21,778
How are you planning
to deal with all this?

1253
01:40:25,141 --> 01:40:27,701
Well, I've got Gloria Torres' heart.

1254
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:30,250
I'll probably just let that guide me.

1255
01:40:31,141 --> 01:40:34,292
- You got anyone, Jaye?
- Excuse me?

1256
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:38,180
Police work can get
kind of heavy on you.

1257
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:40,809
You got anyone at home?

1258
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:49,456
Yeah, I got someone.

1259
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:51,694
Good.

1260
01:40:51,861 --> 01:40:53,135
ARRANGO:
McCaleb!

1261
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:57,135
That's it! I'm sick and tired of your
grandstanding bullshit!

1262
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,700
WINSTON:
You're out of your jurisdiction.

1263
01:40:58,861 --> 01:41:05,096
Maybe. But because you got a Mexican's
heart, it don't make you one of us!

1264
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:07,978
Arrango?

1265
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:12,977
Next time you come around this dock,
this Mexican will kick your ass.

1266
01:41:13,141 --> 01:41:16,816
What? You're out of your
goddamn mind!

1267
01:41:16,981 --> 01:41:19,211
[SWEARS IN SPANISH]

1268
01:41:19,381 --> 01:41:21,770
ARRANGO:
All my life, I've had the shitty jobs.

1269
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:24,455
You got him talking to himself.

1270
01:41:25,701 --> 01:41:28,340
I didn't even know he spoke Spanish.

1271
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:38,057
Poor baby, he's been
at this all morning.

1272
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:45,773
I wish I could get a big, fat marlin
and put it on his line.

1273
01:45:44,581 --> 01:45:45,570
Subtitles : Filou ;-)
