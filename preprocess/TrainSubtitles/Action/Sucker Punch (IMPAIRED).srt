I need her in that chair.

974
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,885
Put her in the goddamn chair!

975
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,370
Thank you.

976
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,683
Close the door, please.

977
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,204
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

978
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:33,160
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

979
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,970
No, no, no.

980
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,324
You're still here.

981
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,722
You're here with me.

982
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,089
In all this shit.

983
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,931
And you don't go away unless I say so.

984
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,005
Okay?

985
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,889
That's not right.

986
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,209
That's not right.

987
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,842
You come hack to me.

988
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,681
[noon oPENs]

989
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,525
-Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
GORSKI: What are you doing?

990
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,729
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

991
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,848
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

992
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,526
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

993
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,001
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.

994
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,084
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

995
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,720
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

996
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,329
Tell them!

997
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,811
Get him out of here.

998
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,362
-Now.
-Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

999
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,682
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

1000
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:46,367
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you--
I'll tell you about the money.

1001
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,887
COP:
Just keep going down the hall.

1002
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,724
You all right, miss?

1003
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,171
Miss?

1004
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,451
SWEET PEA:
And finally, this question:

1005
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,009
The mystery of whose story it will be...

1006
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,847
...of who draws the curtain.

1007
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,008
Who is it that chooses our steps
in the dance?

1008
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,962
Who drives us mad...

1009
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,851
...lashes us with whips...

1010
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,925
...and crowns us with victory
when we survive the impossible?

1011
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,245
Who is it...

1012
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,761
...that does all these things?

1013
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,409
WOMAN [OVER PA]: Bus 22 southbound
to For! Wayne will now begin loading.

1014
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:44,564
Please have your tickets ready
to show the driver.

1015
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,966
TROOPER:
Excuse me, miss?

1016
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,804
Miss, can we have a word?

1017
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,281
WISE MAN:
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

1018
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,171
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

1019
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,051
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

1020
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,964
-We understand.
-Do you?

1021
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,521
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

1022
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,730
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

1023
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,006
Is that true, miss?

1024
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,881
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

1025
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:34,682
-All right.
WISE MAN: Oh, and one more thing.

1026
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,886
-She's been a joy the entire journey.
-Yes, I said, all right.

1027
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:44,608
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.

1028
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,046
It's no problem.

1029
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,002
-I don't have a ticket.
-I know. It's okay.

1030
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,528
Go find a seat in the back.
Try and get some sleep.

1031
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,481
We got a long way to go.

1032
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,121
Thank you.

1033
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,566
SWEET PEA: Who honors those we love
with the very life we live?

1034
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,171
Who sends monsters to kill us...

1035
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,002
...and at the same time
sings that we 'II never die?

1036
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,767
Who teaches us what's real
and how to laugh at lies?

1037
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:37,565
Who decides why we live
and what we 'II die to defend?

1038
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,123
Who chains us?

1039
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,648
And who holds the key
that can set us free?

1040
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,930
l!'s you.

1041
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,046
You have all the weapons you need.

1042
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,486
Now fight.
