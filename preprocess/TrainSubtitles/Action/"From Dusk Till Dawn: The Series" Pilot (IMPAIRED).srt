00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:20,902
Un momento, por favor.

491
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:22,437
Thank you.

492
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,505
Carlos: Yes?

493
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:24,739
Carlos.

494
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,408
Jesus Christ, man.

495
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,842
I didn't realize you had a secretary.

496
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:31,379
She's not a secretary, and
she hates to be called that.

497
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,647
Are you in Mexico?

498
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,783
Uh, about that. We, um...

499
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,785
we ran into some complications.

500
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:38,653
What complications?

501
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:40,955
Well, first, the good
news. We have the bonds.

502
00:26:40,957 --> 00:26:43,625
It just seems unlikely we're going
to be able to get them to you.

503
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:46,061
Now, you said if run into any
trouble to give you a call.

504
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,896
Well, we got some.

505
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,065
So, I was thinking maybe you
could send somebody to pick 'em up.

506
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,000
Maybe pick us up, too.

507
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:54,002
We got half the state of
Texas looking for us right now.

508
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:56,004
It's getting hot. Real hot.

509
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:58,807
- Would you like me to call you a cab?
- No, Carlos.

510
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,343
I was thinking more like a private plane

511
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,977
or a chopper, something.

512
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,979
Your outfit can pull that off, right?

513
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,349
Where are you?

514
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,551
Someplace called, uh,
Benny's World o' Liquor.

515
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:11,553
In some no-name town near McDade, I think.

516
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:13,121
I know the town. It's empty.

517
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,423
Many of your rural areas have been depleted

518
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,593
by the encroachment of
high-volume retailers.

519
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,895
Okay, Carlos, I don't know what
the hell you're talkin' about.

520
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,965
All I know is we're out here
in the middle of nowhere, okay?

521
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,101
There's plenty of runway
right in front of me.

522
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,971
Well, I'm afraid all
our flights are booked.

523
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,573
Okay, fine. I'll, um...

524
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:33,108
I'll up your take. All right?

525
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,610
Say, uh, 40% of the $30
million. Now, that's...

526
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,113
Jesus Christ, that's $13 million, Carlos.

527
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,581
How's that wet your whistle, huh?

528
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,116
[Teeth knocking]

529
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:44,452
Carlos?

530
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,121
Stay where you are. I
will make arrangements.

531
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,791
<i>Y despues, nos preparamos
para el viaje a El Rey.</i>

532
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,394
English, Carlos. Please. English.

533
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:53,862
El Rey.

534
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:55,997
We will get you to El Rey,

535
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,767
and you and Richard
will finally be at peace.

536
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,035
In the meantime,

537
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,605
- trust your brother.
- Trust him?

538
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,640
Richie's the reason we're trapped
in here in the first place.

539
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,811
Trust him... because he
sees things you don't.

540
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,179
What does that mean?

541
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:13,681
[Crackling]

542
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:18,086
Carlos?

543
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,621
Great.

544
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,257
Pete: [Weakly] I got an idea.

545
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,527
Is that you, Pete?

546
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:29,697
It's me... Fred.

547
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,433
I know who you is.

548
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:35,437
I got a bottle of hooch back here.

549
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:39,707
Priced at, uh, $46.02.

550
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,180
It's kind of steep...

551
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,881
but you catch my meaning?

552
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:48,082
I do.

553
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:53,054
[Grunts]

554
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,090
I can't stand up and get it to you,

555
00:28:56,092 --> 00:29:01,062
but I can toss it over the counter.

556
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:04,966
Well, maybe Earl would
like a sip of that hooch.

557
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:08,536
What do you think, Earl? You thirsty?

558
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,005
He does, it's gonna be his last drink.

559
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:14,642
Now, my brother and I have
got what you might want to call

560
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:17,078
a well-coordinated evacuation on the way.

561
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,847
So, I don't want anybody else to die.

562
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,649
- Hey, he shot first.
- Shut up, Richard.

563
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:24,786
However, I also don't want
some unsuspecting motorist

564
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:27,222
to putter by and see a Ranger holding a gun

565
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,157
outside everybody's favorite liquor store.

566
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,125
So here's how it's gonna be.

567
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:33,127
Everybody's gonna live,

568
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:35,029
unless you don't surrender right now.

569
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,799
In which case...

570
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:39,901
Earl here buys the farm,

571
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,971
and you, Rick, truly
become the Lone Ranger.

572
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,506
[Gun cocks]

573
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:47,842
Now, you're not gonna
make me count to 3, are ya?

574
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,911
'Cause I can't count that high.

575
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,046
Don't you do it, Frederico.

576
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,681
Don't you do it.

577
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:58,653
Oh, God damn it.

578
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:00,989
Sorry, Earl.

579
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,161
- Hungry?
- No, thank you, baby.

580
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,264
I got to meet Earl for breakfast.

581
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,734
You know how he loves that diner.

582
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,936
So, are we even gonna talk about this?

583
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,872
Yeah. Talk as much as you want.

584
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:20,041
I think he's too old.

585
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:22,076
Baby...

586
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:24,212
Earl's stronger than an ox.

587
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:26,614
Besides, all a godfather's got to to do

588
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,551
is lift a little side of
this fatback right here.

589
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:31,819
He's all alone.

590
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,821
I know.

591
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:36,791
That just means he gets to spend
a little more time with her.

592
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,993
[Sniffs] Ooh!

593
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,095
She is ripe.

594
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,764
I got to get going.

595
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,832
Baby, I'm not kidding around.

596
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,568
He's the one who's got to raise her

597
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,169
if anything happens to us.

598
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:50,572
- He's got to raise Billy.
- Yeah.

599
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:52,206
And teach her right and wrong,

600
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,709
make sure nothing bad ever happens to her.

601
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:57,779
That's pretty much what he did for me.

602
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:59,581
So, who better?

603
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,284
All right.

604
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:04,752
Okay, wait a minute.

605
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:07,121
We've never had a talk like this before.

606
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:10,792
Usually a whole lot of back-and-forth,

607
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:12,660
and then you win.

608
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,797
I know how much he loves you.

609
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,934
I guess that means he's gonna
love Billy that much more.

610
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:33,214
Hang in there, Earl.

611
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:35,650
What the hell'd you do that for?

612
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:38,086
You can't save me or anyone else in here.

613
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,687
I've been thinking.

614
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,089
Well, you better think fast.

615
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:44,058
These bastards are lookin'
to make a quick exit.

616
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,693
I'm gonna try to get them to leave.

617
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,962
The hell you say.

618
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,964
I didn't get shot so these sons of bitches

619
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:51,633
could ride off into the sunset.

620
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:53,334
Look, I know you're pissed, Earl.

621
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,703
But if I don't get you to a hospital,
I'm gonna burn in Ranger hell.

622
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,105
Now, I got a plan.

623
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,873
But we do this my way.

624
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,175
[Sighs]

625
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,722
Pete? How we doing?

626
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,824
I'm doin'.

627
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,062
And I'm ready to do.

628
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,102
How's the old man doing?

629
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,438
He needs medical attention.

630
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,206
Yeah, well, I said you could fix
him. That's all I said you could do.

631
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,508
Well, that's not enough.

632
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,544
You better knock it off, cowboy,

633
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,647
or you're gonna die with
that look on your face.

634
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,115
He's a handful, isn't he?

635
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,185
Excuse me?

636
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,986
Your brother over there.

637
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,721
Seems a little off his rocker.

638
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,590
Oh, we're gonna talk about my brother now?

639
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:41,991
He's like my partner here.

640
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,960
He needs medical attention.

641
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,962
Look, if you want to get out of here
without something going sideways,

642
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,697
you listen to me.

643
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,732
Every law-enforcement officer
in the state's got their eyes

644
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,668
on every roadway, every street crossing,

645
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,204
watching, waiting.

646
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,473
We've already cased your car. It's burned.

647
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,807
Who says we're taking a car?

648
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,242
I don't care if you're
taking a hot-air balloon.

649
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,212
Now, what I'm telling you
is I can clear you a path.

650
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,214
