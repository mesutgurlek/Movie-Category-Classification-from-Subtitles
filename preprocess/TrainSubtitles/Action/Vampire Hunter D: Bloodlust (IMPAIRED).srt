Yeah, I heard
about that time.

704
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,694
The kidnappers
turned out

705
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,529
to be vampires,
of course,

706
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,366
and so the townspeople
pooled their money

707
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,034
to hire
a vampire hunter.

708
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,619
They wanted the best.

709
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,121
And when
the hunter came,

710
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,624
he was a very strong
and quiet man,

711
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,709
and he did his job, too,

712
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,962
which was to return
the children safely back

713
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,588
into their parents'
homes.

714

It wasn't easy,

715
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,384
but many vampires
died by his hands

was over with.

And when it was over

718

and the children
were back home,

719
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,307
the people
attacked the man.

720
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,227
They said he was a dunpeal
half-vampire himself,

721
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,812
so they punished him.

for doing that.
