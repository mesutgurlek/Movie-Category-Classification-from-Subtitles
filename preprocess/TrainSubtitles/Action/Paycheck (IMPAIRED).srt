1
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,457
It's time to wake up...

2
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,255
...and get a life.

3
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,696
We live in a three-dimensional world.

4
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:19,746
Until now, the world of computing has been a flat world,
consisting of two-dimensional imagery.

5
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,004
Now, through the use of exclusive breakthrough technology,...

6
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:26,640
...ARC has made it possible for you to get a life.

7
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:32,043
A Life, where we can work and play in a life like world
of three-dimensional reality.

8
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,518
A Life, the living monitor.

9
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,785
Impressed?

10
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,651
Yeah, I am.

11
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,131
Would you put one of those in a box for me?

12
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,576
- Are you the lawyer?
- I'm Rita Dunne.

13
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,110
Obviously, no one from Nexim could be here today.

14
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,491
- I'd invite you in, but--
- Good luck, Mr. Jennings.

15
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,391
- I'll see you in two months.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,399
Home sweet home.

17
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,538
What do you think?

18
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,843
This is the exact same technology?

19
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,149
Not the exact same technology. No.

20
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:22,285
Ultimately, I decided to reconceive some of it.
I never liked the way the monitor looked.

21
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,888
And then it occurred to me who needs it?

22
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,558
Gentlemen, I am the future of computing.

23
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:36,693
And I would like to present you with Nexim's
new Freedom Line of display technology.

24
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,500
New from Nexim.
Freedom is in your future.

25
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,743
Launch this now.
ARC is not gonna last.

26
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,286
Who said 100 percent market share was impossible?

27
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,516
Get me Marketing immediately.

28
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:58,522
This far exceeds our expectations.

29
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,222
Congratulations.

30
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:14,039
Well, thank you.

31
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:20,714
You understand, Mr. Jennings, you've just done in
two months what we've been trying to do for three years.

32
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:25,477
Sometimes it's easier if you work backwards.

33
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,580
Cheers.

34
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,264
You won't remember me, will you?

35
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,631
No.

36
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,934
That's too bad.

37
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,434
Marker reached.

38
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,292
OK.

39
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:47,759
We're now extracting his memory
from the marker forward to the present.

40
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,192
Jesus, Rita.

41
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,497
Jesus Christ!

42
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,235
This is dangerous enough.

43
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:34,637
If this man's brain temp goes one C above 43, he's a veg.

44
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,750
Come on, Mike.

45
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,864
Here we go.

46
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,103
It's all clean.

47
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,749
Good morning, sunshine.

48
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,318
Hey, how you doing, big guy?

49
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,752
- OK?
- Yeah.

50
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,825
All right. Thank you. Take it easy.

51
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,394
Slow, slow, slow.
There's no hurry, OK?

52
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,992
- That's it. Good?
- Yeah.

53
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,830
Good man. Hey, Mike, look at me.

54
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,097
Look at me. Right here.

55
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,432
What's the last date you remember?

56
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,445
- October 19.
- Very good.

57
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,417
Mike, what's the last thing you remember?

58
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,917
The Red Sox made the playoffs.

59
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:55,126
OK. Let's get the legal out of the way, shall we?

60
00:08:55,569 --> 00:09:00,037
Mr. Michael Jennings,
under the terms of your non-disclosure agreement,...

61
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,126
...you are considered never to have been an employee.

62
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:08,434
You also understand that all your work
is the intellectual property of Nexim...

63
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,502
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,575
I never worked here. I never saw anybody.
I never was here. I got it.

65
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,573
Is my paycheck ready?

66
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,622
Alrighty.

67
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,395
- How you feeling, tiger?
- Good.

68
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,991
- Now let's hear you.
- All right.

69
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,726
- Ready?
- Yeah.

70
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,901
Go!

71
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:45,644
In order to zero the full eight weeks
I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C.

72
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,009
- I'm fine.
- I'm saying it's getting harder, Mike.

73
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,152
- I said, I'm fine.
- You're slowing down actually. Come on.

74
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,848
I'd be faster if you'd shut up.

75
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,182
Show me what you've got, grasshopper.

76
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,492
That's it. That's more like it!

77
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,691
Yes! Go, go, go!

78
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,491
Go! Go!

79
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,692
Yes! Faster!

80
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,168
Beautiful!

81
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,839
Yes! One more! One more, Mikey!

82
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,981
Now you see how you did that?
How you focused?

83
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,443
- Yeah, I focus on your face.
- Oh, no. You know you Iove me.

84
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:29,082
Come on. Come on.
Don't be mean to the one who does everything for you.

85
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:34,487
Do you realize you've never once
asked me what I see when I erase your memory?

86
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,126
Basically, the last two months just never happened for you.

87
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,932
What's to know?
20 hours a day in a clean room...

88
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:44,798
...ripping off one guy's idea for a computer,
selling it to somebody else. You know.

89
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,740
What'd you do the last two months?

90
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:50,736
You know, the last thing I remember is
driving in Spain in the Aston Martin,...

91
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,403
...learning to dive in Belize with what's-her-name.

92
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,277
The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days trip.
It's great.

93
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,012
I mean, my memories are basically highlights.

94
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:05,488
It's good. It's a good life.
The stuff you erase, it doesn't matter.

95
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,792
What is it with guys like Rethrick?

96
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,228
- He's gotta have everything, huh?
- Well,...

97
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:19,496
...say what you want about Jimmy,
he started Allcom in his garage.

98
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,481
- Wait, wait. Don't you leave me alone.
- What? You'll be fine. Talk. Mingle.

99
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,832
I don't want to mingle.

100
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,662
Hello.

101
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:08,306
- I'm Michael.
- I'm Rachel.

102
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,482
Rachel Porter.

103
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,211
Is that Miss or Mrs?

104
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:21,460
- That would be Dr. Porter.
- Doctor. Well, excuse me, doctor.

105
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,793
It's all right.

106
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,830
What kind of a doctor are you?

107
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,059
- I'm a biologist.
- Really?

108
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,065
Do you work for Jimmy?

109
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,377
So it must be very top-secret biology that you practice.

110
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,409
Oh, yes. Isn't everything?

111
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,449
Let's go.

112
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,554
Excuse me?

113
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:55,361
I mean, I'm happy to continue blathering on,...

114
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,161
...trying helplessly to charm you,...

115
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:03,197
...but I thought maybe, you know,
cut to the chase and just, you know, go somewhere.

116
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,840
I'll tell you what, Michael.

117
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,781
I'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine.

118
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:19,450
If you get the urge to have a real conversation,...

119
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,749
...you'll know where to find me.

120
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,816
OK. Fair enough.

121
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,385
It was nice to meet you.

122
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,065
Giving up so easily?

123
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,965
You don't believe in second chances, now, do you?

124
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,173
In my experience, no, I don't.

125
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,341
- Good night.
- Good night.

126
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,621
- Mike.
- Jimmy.

127
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,849
- How you doing?
- Good. How you doing?

128
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,089
- Good to see you.
- You too.

129
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,828
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

130
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:00,886
- Come back this way.
- Sure.

131
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,393
Hey, Jimmy.

132
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,463
Now you're talking. Thank you.

133
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,798
Wait a second.

134
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,507
Isaac, disable fire protection, please.

135
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,942
Alarm disabled.

136
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,580
I don't think you'd look so good covered in foam.
Even in that spiffy suit.

137
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,284
What's the pitch, Jimmy?

138
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,716
I've known you long enough to know when
you're trying to sell me something. What is it?

139
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:39,165
When there was a time we were in school,
we wanted to change the world.

140
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,804
I thought we said we wanted to save the world.
Well, that's semantics.

141
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,701
- What's the job, Jimmy?
- Can't tell you.

142
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,151
Other than to say that it involves optics.
And you get stock options for this one.

143
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,713
Get a real piece of the company.

144
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,943
What if it doesn't work?
I get a real piece of nothing.

145
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,353
I promise you, it won't fail.

146
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,624
How do you know that?
Is this a real crystal ball?

147
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:10,259
I wish.
The point is, I'll guarantee that you do eight figures.

148
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,702
- Minimum.
- What's the catch?

149
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,504
The job may require a little bit more time than you're used to.

150
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:22,733
- How much more time?
- Two years. Maybe three.

151
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,878
- You're kidding.
- Deadly serious.

152
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,076
Jimmy, that's impossible.
You can't do it.

153
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,508
The longest anyone has ever done is eight weeks.
I know because it was me.

154
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,346
Assuming it were possible, would you do it?

155
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:39,492
- Give up three years of my life?
- Not give up, trade.

156
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,424
Three years in return for the rest of your life.

157
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:46,096
One big paycheck. You're done.

158
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,609
A lot can happen in three years.

159
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,342
You blink, it'll be over-- to you, it'll be two seconds.

160
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:05,784
A heartbeat, then snap, you're rich beyond your wildest dreams.

161
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:09,416
One big paycheck. You're done.

162
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,350
Mr. Jennings. John Wolfe.
Welcome.

163
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,015
You understand that you won't be allowed to leave the grounds.

164
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,624
You'll be assigned a residence right here on campus.

165
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:23,852
All your mail will be screened, no outside phone calls,
and anything you do receive will have to be inspected.

166
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,093
Okay.

167
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,958
I'm going to need all your personal belongings --...

168
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,897
...watch, wallet, anything else you're carrying.
I'm afraid nothing's allowed to be brought in.

169
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:40,438
All these items will be returned to you when you pick up your paycheck.

170
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,847
Sorry. Those too.

171
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,888
- Mike, hey, you made it.
- Yeah.

172
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,781
- Good to see you.
- See you too.

173
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,751
- Everything OK?
- Yep.

174
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,126
Sit down.

175
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,207
I assume Mr. Wolfe gave you all the fine print.

176
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:05,337
Yeah. He also took the last pair of sunglasses
I've managed not to lose.

177
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,406
I'm sorry.

178
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,712
What is this?

179
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,684
It's for your memory wipe.

180
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:22,626
We inject you with an isotope,
migrates to your brain lodges, serves as a marker.

181
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,588
Then, when we're done, another injection erases everything back to the marker.

182
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,753
No barbaric cooking of the brain.

183
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,066
All right.

184
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,992
- What have I gotten myself into?
- Let's go find out.

185
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,709
Initiating Blue Script directory.

186
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,972
Impressive.

187
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,079
This used to be our smallest unit.
Now it's our most profitable.

188
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:30,089
Excuse me Mr. Rethrick, may I speak with you for a moment?

189
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,748
- Have a look around. I'll be right back.
- OK.

190
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:40,193
Cycle complete.
Begin transmission of data.

191
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,604
All right! I give up! I give up.

192
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:13,627
Don't give up.

193
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:21,309
- Dr. Porter. I guess I'm lucky you didn't use thunder and lightning.
- True.

194
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:32,617
OK, well, I won't question your powers in the future.

195
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,382
Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

196
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:39,091
I thought you said Marianne was on a plane tonight.

197
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,717
She was planning to make the
conference call from the plane, sir.

198
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:49,135
Look. I should probably apologize for my behavior the other day.

199
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:52,695
- I -- I get like that sometimes, and I shouldn't. I'm sorry.
- Careful.

200
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:57,105
You are in danger of sounding like you want a second chance.

201
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:08,015
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

202
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,236
- Say something else.
- Excuse me?

203
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,140
Say something nice.
Quick, otherwise I'll forget it.

204
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,679
Was that little breeze for our boy here?

205
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:38,549
Well, I owed him one. Now we're even.

206
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,253
Well, be nice 'cause Mike's moving into the neighborhood.

207
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,180
Oh.

208
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,025
- See you around.
- OK.

209
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,602
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

210
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,633
You can still back out.

211
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,042
No hard feelings.

212
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:20,116
No, I want to stay.

213
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:24,521
Michael Jennings, meet the other half of your team, Dr. William Dekker.

214
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,864
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

215
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,036
Gentlemen.
Let's have a look at the next three years of your lives.

216
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,340
What happened?

217
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,044
Michael.

218
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,917
You're done.

219
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:31,087
- How long was it, Jimmy?
- It's been three years, Mike.

220
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,765
- How'd I do?
- You did good.

221
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:40,704
Your money's been transferred to your account at Reddy Grant & Associates.

222
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,767
You've got an appointment there today at 1:00.

223
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:46,913
Just go home, do the paperwork.
When you feel up to it, give me a call.

224
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:48,905
We've got a lot of catching up to do Mike.

225
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,523
Ninety-two million dollars.

226
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:36,131
Everyone at Reddy Grant associates appreciates your business sir.

227
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:40,556
Well, not as much as I appreciate my business, I promise you.

228
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,303
OK.

229
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,474
Just sign there.

230
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,140
- All right.
- Great.

231
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,680
- Your personal items.
- Yes.

232
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,442
You only needed four stamps.

233
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:05,089
Oh, well, guess I could afford the extra 50 cents.

234
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,697
I don't think this is my stuff.

235
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,497
- It's not?
- No.

236
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,936
- I-I-I don't know what happened.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

237
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:26,874
It doesn't matter.
Let's talk about my shares.

238
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:31,842
What I'd like to do is get some money now,...

239
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:37,124
...and, you know, put the rest away for long term, you know, to live off.
So how do we -- So how do we do that?

240
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,393
Mr. Jennings, you forfeited your shares.

241
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,496
I beg your pardon? What?

242
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:52,035
Yeah, here. Dated four weeks ago.

243
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:59,341
You surrendered the shares and stated to
deliver only the envelope of personals.

244
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:04,745
- Don't you remember doing that, sir?
- No.

245
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,320
I don't remember that, because I didn't do that.

246
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:13,652
Why would I do that?
I wouldn't do that. It doesn't make sense.

247
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,456
A mistake has been made, and it needs to be corrected.

248
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,630
- Well, I agree. It's a strange thing you did, but...
- It's not strange.

249
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:24,734
Strange is, you know, a little out of the ordinary, but still plausible.

250
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:28,139
Giving away $100 million in shares
in a Fortune 500 company for some,...

251
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:31,237
...uh, knickknacks isn't strange, it's insane.

252
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,876
No one would do that.
This doesn't make sense.

253
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,581
I mean, unless you think this is a
$40 million can of hair spray, uh, which is pink.

254
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,677
And, uh, you know, what is this, a $100 million book of matches?
I mean, you know.

255
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:44,554
I've been a little out of it for a couple of years.
I don't know, is this back in style now?

256
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,589
Is this-- Are these $100 million sunglasses?
Am I missing something here?

257
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:50,696
Okay, I'll look into it, but it's gonna take me some time.

258
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:54,027
- This is crazy. So I'm going to make some phone calls.
- Okay.

259
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,108
Mr. Rethrick's office.

260
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:08,278
- It's Michael Jennings. Tell him it's important, please.
- I'm sorry, he stepped away.

261
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,443
He won't be back until this afternoon.

262
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,346
I can try him on his cell phone.

263
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,244
Just have him call me as soon as he gets in. Okay?

264
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,087
- OK.
- Thank you.

265
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:34,363
Listen, guys, a mistake has been made here. All right?

266
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,861
- I'm not a traitor. I'm an engineer.
- A reverse engineer, right?

267
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:43,506
We only know that you accepted payment
of classified government technology.

268
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:48,080
Mike, that's called treason.
In this country, people get fried for that one.

269
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:52,082
Yeah, and you know what? In this country, when the FBI
harasses you, you also get an attorney-- Thanks very much.

270
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,350
- Not today you don't.
- What the hell is this?

271
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:57,523
This is what happens when the attorney general calls me and says...

272
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:01,923
...that Michael Jennings' cooperation is a matter of national security.

273
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:06,200
Look, first of all, that stuff isn't mine, OK?
A mistake--

274
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,340
What is?

275
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:18,134
Perfect fit. You were saying?

276
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:26,080
Well, let me show you a few pieces
of the puzzle that we're solving.

277
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:29,711
William Dekker, government physicist, weapons division.

278
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,415
Three years ago, his project gets shelved.

279
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:35,687
He didn't like that, so he sold his work.
Classified work.

280
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:39,230
Showed it to several major corporations.
We think Rethrick bought it.

281
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,803
Unfortunately, we can't link Rethrick to the sale, because Dekker died.

282
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:46,305
Natural causes.

283
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:51,133
"Natural" being gravity after a 140-foot
fall out of his apartment building.

284
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,509
So what does this have to do with me?

285
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:58,983
These are Patent applications filed this month.
They show designs based on Dekker's work.

286
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:02,589
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents.

287
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,849
Don't you get it?
It's your name on those patents!

288
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:08,026
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing
about Dekker or where the design came from.

289
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:11,559
So what you need to do is,
tell us everything you did for Rethrick. Right now.

290
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:16,966
- I can't.
- You'd rather spend reset of your life...

291
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:19,145
...in prison protecting your so called friend?

292
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:22,798
- Just help us, and we can work with you.
- I can't. I can't!

293
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:25,108
He wiped my memory!
I don't remember!

294
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,305
I'll tell you whatever I know.
I was set up, but I swear to God, you have to believe me.

295
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:31,783
I don't remember what I did for the past three years!

296
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:42,159
What?

297
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,921
Wait a second!

298
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:51,966
Wait!

299
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:56,069
We figured Rethrick might've tried a wipe, so we'll try an extraction.

300
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,235
You're not gonna see anything.
You're wasting your time.

301
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,865
We're getting something here.

302
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,568
Come on!
Come on!

303
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,578
Shit.

304
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,549
We got nothing.

305
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:46,054
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.

306
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,330
Boss.

307
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,697
He won't mind.

308
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,586
- Smoke!
- Shit!

309
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:18,486
- Goddamn it!
- I can't see anything!

310
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:23,089
Secure the door!

311
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,592
Where the hell is he?

312
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:31,036
- He's loose!
- Don't worry, he can't go anywhere!

313
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:34,540
Cover the door!

314
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:36,809
I'll get the lights!

315
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,539
I can't see!

316
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:45,812
Get low to the ground!
Stay low to the ground!

317
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,718
Mitchell!

318
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,291
See anything?

319
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:03,336
- Is that him?
- Klein, where'd you go?

320
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:07,463
Al, shut the door!

321
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:10,007
What's going on?

322
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:22,921
Good night, Mikey.

323
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,701
Copy that.

324
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,544
- Watch it, coming through!
- Go! Go! Go!

325
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:20,070
- Coming through!
- Out of the way!

326
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,680
- See him?
- I see him!

327
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:28,321
- Out of the way, lady!
- There!

328
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,780
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- Out! Out!

329
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,426
- Coming through!
- All right, let's go!

330
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,233
Excuse me.

331
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,068
Coming through!

332
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,770
- Out of the way! Open those gates!
- Hey, man, watch it! man.

333
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,510
Come on! Come on!

334
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,546
Where did he go?

335
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,221
I'll get men at every stop!

336
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,414
He'll be long gone by then!

337
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,320
How the hell did he do that?

338
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:49,501
- Oh, sorry.
- You all right?

339
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,938
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.
- Be careful.

340
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:58,568
Hey! Hey!
Watch it!

341
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,442
Hey! Hey!

342
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,364
Jane. Relax.
Everything's fine.

343
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:28,272
I know you talked to federal agents.
It's okay, cause it's been worked out now.

344
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:31,170
I just need to find out who-- who sent these items.

345
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:32,973
Can you help me out?

346
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:37,711
- Um, they were sent three years ago.
- No, no. Remember, there was a mix-up, see?

347
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:41,877
These weren't the ones that were sent three years ago. Somebody
else sent these. I need to find out who that is. I need to talk to them.

348
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:43,858
Oh, you're right.
Replacements were sent a few weeks ago.

349
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:46,354
- Who sent it?
- Well, you did.

350
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,689
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.

351
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:59,437
I'm going to need all your personal belongings.

352
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:13,352
Michael Jennings died at three minutes after 3.

353
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:17,814
The government, left with no case, closed its investigation of Allcom.

354
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:24,525
So you see, it's impossible that he escaped
unless you changed something.

355
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,532
I didn't.

356
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:31,996
- What were you doing, exactly?
- I was eating pie.

357
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:37,434
He left the attorney's office exactly when it predicted.

358
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:42,819
- The Feds took him exactly when it predicted--
- But he didn't die like it predicted!

359
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,015
Michael Jennings is not a super agent.

360
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:49,656
He's an engineer.

361
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:53,187
Yet somehow he managed to escape from a double-Iocked room.

362
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,323
How? Was it fate?

363
00:38:56,537 --> 00:39:01,528
No, fate was on our side. That means someone who
knew changed something. And it wasn't me.

364
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:03,702
And if it wasn't you, then who the?

365
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:17,081
Has anyone checked the machine since Michael walked out of here?

366
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:56,952
Find him.

367
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:32,396
"If you only look where you can't go,
you will miss the riches below."

368
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,923
Yeah, I'm already missing my riches.

369
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:40,396
"17-44-4-26-37-40-22."

370
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,700
A combination? A code?

371
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,335
A password?

372
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,339
"New Liberty Savings."

373
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,547
New Liberty Savings Bank, please.

374
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:36,179
What does that mean?

375
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:40,519
You're saying the bank doesn't exist?

376
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,142
That's comforting.

377
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:16,719
Who sent these items?

378
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:19,164
You did.

379
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:23,061
That's you right here. See?
Twenty items.

380
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:29,034
These are patent applications.

381
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:33,075
Look whose signature is on every one of those documents!

382
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,209
A mistake has been made here.
I'm not a traitor!

383
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:41,015
Dekker died!

384
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,755
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing about Dekker or where the design came from.

385
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:48,952
You have to believe me.
I don't remember what I did for the past three years!

386
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,591
Michael.

387
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,268
Michael.

388
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,261
You're done.

389
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,141
Hello?

390
00:43:07,354 --> 00:43:11,574
Jesus, Shorty.
You don't know how good it is to hear a familiar voice.

391
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,352
Michael?

392
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,617
Listen, man.

393
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:17,685
I'm in a-- I'm in a jam, and I need you.

394
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,125
All right.

395
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,989
Meet me at Union Station at 9:00.

396
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,529
- I'll be there.
- OK, buddy.

397
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:38,776
Outbound local from Seattle to Kent departing from track five.

398
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:47,553
Eastbound Spokane, gate ten.

399
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,200
Michael.

400
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:37,431
Say one word about this hat and I'm out of here.

401
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,705
Oh, man!

402
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:51,044
Oh, my God.

403
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:01,553
I told you not to take that job, Mike.

404
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:09,599
- Come on, let's get a table.
- OK.

405
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:12,678
Injections?

406
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:16,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You would have to do it that way, I guess.

407
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,944
But, of course, that's a chemical process.

408
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:19,937
So?

409
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,605
Well, you'd have some latent memories.

410
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:25,808
Maybe that's what I'm seeing.

411
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:31,655
Most likely. Memories that made it through the wash,
and then they got stirred up when the Feds went into your head.

412
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,559
Why would I have these things?

413
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,423
Explain this.

414
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:39,288
I sent myself this junk instead of the money.

415
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,325
Oh, brother.

416
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:42,935
I don't know.

417
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,803
But that's not the question you should be asking yourself.

418
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:49,240
- No?
- No. The question that you should be asking yourself is,...

419
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,471
...why did you give up all that money?

420
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,642
That's the most bizarre part of this whole thing.

421
00:45:55,656 --> 00:46:00,014
Ninety million dollars.
Nobody changes that much in three years.

422
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:02,081
OK, all right, buddy.

423
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,315
I wanna figure out what you built.

424
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,356
All right, let's work backwards.

425
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,663
They told me I was working on a design by someone named Dekker.

426
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:12,758
- Dekker?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:15,458
- William Dekker?
- I think so.

428
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:21,070
What I heard was,
he was working on something level five for the Feds...

429
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,804
...when they came in one day and they just shut him down.

430
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:25,873
- What was it?
- Well, the consensus was a laser.

431
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:30,178
- Why was that?
- Because Dekker's drawings called for a mirror and a lens.

432
00:46:30,324 --> 00:46:35,921
Now, the only thing that uses those is a laser, right,
or some kind of satellite camera to see things from far away.

433
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:40,116
Here comes the first number, 17.
Followed by 44.

434
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:43,593
- The lens required perfect optics.
- Four.

435
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:45,896
- The mirror...
- Twenty-six.

436
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:49,502
- So the capital outlay is huge.
- Thirty-seven.

437
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,900
- I mean, the word was, I think it was gonna cost.
- Forty.

438
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,965
- 500 billion dollars.
- And the bonus number is 22.

439
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:02,271
Who's gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something?

440
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,010
What?

441
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:14,117
There is no way I get out of that extraction
room without the cigarettes and the glasses.

442
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,425
I would've never gotten on that bus without the bus ticket.

443
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:21,116
If I didn't have the diamond ring,
I wouldn't have followed that kid to Reddy Grant.

444
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:22,141
Right.

445
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:28,833
I gave up that money just to make sure
that I would pay attention to these items.

446
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,640
Why?

447
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,703
Because I know what you'd spend 500 billion dollars to see.

448
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,213
The future.

449
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:46,626
If you selected five numbers and the bonus number,
you're a second-prize winner.

450
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:47,618
He used a virus.

451
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:51,431
The machine went down at 3:03 this afternoon.

452
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:53,824
3:03.

453
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,664
Can you program around the virus?

454
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,365
No. It's not that kind of virus.

455
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,534
Come on, I'll show you.

456
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:15,585
It's not in the software.

457
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:21,965
It's in the hardware.
He put a circuit somewhere in here.

458
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,528
It's like a poison pill.

459
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,599
But you can find it, right?

460
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:29,662
Yeah, I can.

461
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,970
Then do it.

462
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,966
Slight change of plans.

463
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:40,211
According to Mr. Stevens, we don't need Michael Jennings anymore.

464
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:45,145
Look, if we know anything,
we know that time travel's not possible.

465
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:47,583
Einstein proved that, right?

466
00:48:47,584 --> 00:48:49,021
Time travel, yes.

467
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:53,224
But Einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing, theoretically,...

468
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:55,851
- ...could be accomplished.
- Mike, Mike. Come on.

469
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,354
Maybe we should just find Dekker...

470
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:00,524
- I can't talk to Dekker.
- Why not?

471
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,941
- He had an accident.
- An accident?

472
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:06,878
Yeah, he-- he fell out of his bedroom window.

473
00:49:07,081 --> 00:49:09,339
Fell out of his--

474
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:13,638
He fell out of his bedroom window!

475
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:17,682
I see. Sure.

476
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:19,820
That could happen.

477
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,354
Oh, geez, wait a minute.

478
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:26,618
- We got to get ourselves out of here.
- Shorty, listen to me.

479
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:31,734
I think what happened was I used this thing,
I saw my future.

480
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,291
And I saw what I needed to change it.

481
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:39,435
But all I could get Allcom were these, uh, you know, innocuous items.

482
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:45,016
Each item has to be used at a specific time, at a specific
place to accomplish whatever it was I needed to get done.

483
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:48,444
I mean, without the stuff in here,
I'd already be dead.

484
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:52,915
Yeah, well, it's too bad that you don't
know what the rest of them are for.

485
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:58,555
What?

486
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,246
Gotcha!

487
00:50:29,596 --> 00:50:30,989
Hey!

488
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,285
Great seeing you again, Mike!

489
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:37,658
Jesus!

490
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:56,448
Those guys do not look like feds.

491
00:50:58,025 --> 00:51:00,613
Here. Listen to me.
Take this.

492
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:04,856
This will get you through that door.
Close it behind you. Understand? Go!

493
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:07,555
- OK!
- Go! Go on!

494
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:12,962
Shit!

495
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:15,959
Go!

496
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:43,792
Oh, God, I hope that was a good thing to do.

497
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:14,786
Shit.

498
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,309
Go.

499
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,115
Where's your gun?

500
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:24,279
He's got it.

501
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:39,031
So how are you, Mike?

502
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,199
You?

503
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:45,645
Why?

504
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:48,242
Don't remember?

505
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:51,917
You brought this on yourself, Mike.

506
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:02,683
So how does it feel knowing you're going to die?

507
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:26,109
Shit.

508
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:12,856
- So you are saying he designed his own escape?
- Mr. Attorney General, sir, we have no explanation.

509
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:17,694
Because after looking at all the evidence the only logical,
albeit hard-to-accept conclusion,...

510
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:21,028
...is that he was able to predict what was going to happen to him.

511
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,529
These are memories extracted from Jennings before he fled.

512
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:27,269
They don't seem to add up to anything.

513
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:31,341
Gladys.

514
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:34,838
That's all for today.

515
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,756
We knew Dekker was trying to design something,...

516
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:47,121
...but when he sold his plans, he wasn't even halfway done.

517
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,356
I don't understand.

518
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:51,994
Dekker was working at JPL on a laser-enhanced lens.

519
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:56,858
He claimed the lens was powerful
enough to see around the curvature of the universe.

520
00:57:57,111 --> 00:58:00,672
...Dekker believed that if you could see
around a curve that went on forever...

521
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:04,511
...you would end up back where you started, looking at yourself.

522
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:08,043
Except you're not looking back at yourself now, in the present.

523
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:11,409
No, you are not.
You're looking at the future.

524
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:16,452
Can you imagine what'll happen if Jennings figures out what he's done,
and tries to profit from it?

525
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:19,786
- Any nation in the world would give him a king's ransom.
- Jennings won't do that.

526
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,665
I was this close to him. He never lied.

527
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:24,192
When he heard what he's being accused of, he was hurt and scared.

528
00:58:24,194 --> 00:58:26,789
Fine, once you bring him in I'll give him the Medal of Honor.

529
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,561
That's if Rethrick doesn't find him first.

530
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:37,706
You think he really saw the future?

531
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,241
That would be something.

532
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,417
Café Michel?

533
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,486
My name is Michael Jennings.

534
00:59:56,498 --> 01:00:01,922
And I can't remember if I made a reservation there recently.

535
01:00:01,925 --> 01:00:05,128
Would you check that out for me?
Thanks.

536
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:08,198
I did?

537
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,693
OK.

538
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:13,271
Right. How many is it for?

539
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:18,943
Oh, no, thank you.
No, I'll be there.

540
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:20,740
Thank you.

541
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:43,165
Hello, you two.

542
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:48,032
Did he feed you?

543
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,129
Rachel, it's Jimmy.

544
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:17,299
- You all right?
- Why?

545
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,034
You don't know?

546
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,007
No.

547
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:25,942
May I come in?

548
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:29,613
When was the last time you saw Michael?

549
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:31,910
Yesterday morning.

550
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:35,619
He was pulling an all nighter at his lab.

551
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:42,220
Rachel, I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this.

552
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:46,497
Michael left Allcom yesterday.
Permanently.

553
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,971
- What?
- He finished his work.

554
01:01:53,313 --> 01:01:56,003
- We erased his memory, and he--
- No.

555
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:59,577
- He left.
- No. He promised me.

556
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:02,745
He said he wasn't going to go through with it.

557
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,407
He made a lot of money on this one, Rachel.

558
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,149
He said he didn't care about the money.

559
01:02:19,106 --> 01:02:21,000
So she doesn't know anything.

560
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,829
He wouldn't leave without her.

561
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,698
It's Michael. He'd be smart.

562
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:29,041
We're missing something.

563
01:02:57,578 --> 01:03:00,036
As soon as she leaves for work, get in there.

564
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:01,998
And make sure she can't go anywhere alone.

565
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,804
I want to know what just happened.

566
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:15,246
Bye, guys.

567
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,628
Good morning, Dr. Porter.

568
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:27,597
Going somewhere?

569
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:38,402
Good morning.

570
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,041
Good morning.

571
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:54,220
I'm going to go up top.
Take my bag.

572
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,655
- You're gonna need this.
- Got it. Thanks.

573
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:06,362
Coming?

574
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,240
No, thanks.
I'd rather watch from down here.

575
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,873
Suit yourself.

576
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:24,288
Look, we've been through the bathroom and
tossed the rest of the apartment, too. Zero.

577
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:27,484
This is what I want you to do.
Go back in the bathroom.

578
01:04:39,914 --> 01:04:42,809
OK, start turning left.

579
01:04:44,952 --> 01:04:46,846
Tell me what you see.

580
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:49,779
The mirror.

581
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:08,292
We've got him.

582
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:12,230
She's supposed to meet him at Cafe Michel, 1 p.m.

583
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:15,537
Well, let's make sure she does.

584
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,997
I'm here to meet someone.
Michael Jennings.

585
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:16,860
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

586
01:06:19,613 --> 01:06:22,474
Sit at that table right there.

587
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,835
In the seat, with your back to the window.

588
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:49,268
Michael, thank God you're all right.

589
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:52,571
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

590
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,810
Michael, it's me.

591
01:07:00,387 --> 01:07:02,008
Rachel.

592
01:07:04,558 --> 01:07:06,008
Look...

593
01:07:06,327 --> 01:07:08,312
You can't remember me.

594
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:13,851
No. I'm sorry.

595
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:26,102
Cops. We can't go in.
I'll have to wait for a clear shot.

596
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:28,064
Maya, stall for time.

597
01:07:28,282 --> 01:07:30,842
Tell him you thought he'd remember something.

598
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:33,109
That you two were engaged.

599
01:07:35,956 --> 01:07:38,778
I guess I thought you'd remember something.

600
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:41,516
We've been together for three years.

601
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:43,987
I don't know what to say.

602
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:46,888
I'm really sorry.

603
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:49,128
I'm trying.

604
01:07:51,939 --> 01:07:54,697
That's how he's doing this.

605
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:03,803
Listen to me very carefully, Maya.
This is what I want you to say.

606
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:08,346
Michael, I can see you still have the envelope.

607
01:08:08,355 --> 01:08:10,010
That means it's working.

608
01:08:10,224 --> 01:08:12,978
I know you switched the personal items.
I helped.

609
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:16,597
- You left me a note on a mirror.
- You left me a note on a mirror.

610
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:18,589
- I'm supposed to take something from you.
- I'm supposed to take something.

611
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,003
- Something I can use to get to Stevens.
- Something I can use to get to Stevens.

612
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:25,630
- He's a man you worked with. He's trying to fix the machine.
- He's a man you worked with.

613
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:28,227
He's trying to fix the machine.

614
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,033
Work backwards, Michael.

615
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:43,149
Yeah. Take the swipe card.

616
01:08:43,824 --> 01:08:45,945
That's the swipe card for the campus.

617
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,452
You're supposed to give that to me.

618
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:52,987
Rachel wouldn't be hurt if he hesitated,
she'd be impatient.

619
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,624
Look, Michael, if you can't trust me right now,
then we are lost. For good.

620
01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:00,430
Nice.

621
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,260
OK.

622
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:08,107
I'd better get back.

623
01:09:08,882 --> 01:09:11,174
They'll get suspicious soon.

624
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,675
Wait here.
I'll be back in half an hour.

625
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:26,523
And don't worry, we end up together.

626
01:09:37,644 --> 01:09:43,544
Michael I love you.

627
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:02,187
- What's my favorite baseball team?
- What?

628
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,894
What's my favorite baseball team?

629
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:10,426
Who cares?

630
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:24,981
That would be the Red Sox.

631
01:10:25,982 --> 01:10:26,982
Yeah.

632
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:37,021
- I think maybe we should go.
- Wait!

633
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:48,734
Now we can leave.
Come on.

634
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,717
Wait! Hold on.

635
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,359
- You have a car?
- I might.

636
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:08,188
You might?

637
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:11,862
Look for a BMW!

638
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:14,226
You gotta be joking.

639
01:11:21,182 --> 01:11:23,372
Shit! Shit!

640
01:11:24,351 --> 01:11:26,802
- Let me see that key.
- Why?

641
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:28,676
You're in the wrong section.

642
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,784
Jennings bought the BMW from Southgate Auto on the Internet.

643
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:35,085
He had the key mailed to him four weeks ago.

644
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:38,225
- What's the color of his car?
- It isn't a car.

645
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,087
They just turned on Pine.
Intercept them on Sixth.

646
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:24,567
- How good am I on this thing?
- You're OK!

647
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:37,313
- Look, I just said you're OK, OK?
- OK.

648
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,650
Hang on!

649
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:52,320
- Report of shots. Southgate BMW.
- Got it.

650
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,881
- Stop! I lost the envelope!
- What?

651
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:31,530
- I'll come back and get you.
- See you!

652
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:54,037
Got it!

653
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,183
Let's get out of here.

654
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:13,763
Take us down!

655
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:17,797
Mike, we can help you!
We know what's going on!

656
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:20,467
Let us bring you in!

657
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:35,819
He's headed for the tunnel!
Cut him off! Cut him off!

658
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:02,310
Duck!

659
01:17:05,559 --> 01:17:07,043
Split!

660
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:33,910
You think Jennings foresaw that?

661
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:37,375
Maybe next time he'll see a nice quiet stakeout.

662
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:10,974
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

663
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,583
It's OK.

664
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:18,850
It's all for you anyway.

665
01:18:20,735 --> 01:18:24,660
And I -- I brought you some clothes.

666
01:18:25,406 --> 01:18:28,592
I thought you might need them.
I hope it's OK.

667
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:30,528
Thank you.

668
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:33,703
These are mine?

669
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,644
You don't remember?

670
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:39,335
No.

671
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,948
You don't remember me, do you?

672
01:18:51,132 --> 01:18:52,582
Well...

673
01:18:59,807 --> 01:19:01,325
These are for you.

674
01:19:45,586 --> 01:19:51,542
Happy birthday to you

675
01:19:51,993 --> 01:19:56,987
- Happy birthday to you.
- You're so sweet.

676
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,500
I'm sorry.

677
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,470
I'm sorry.

678
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:25,884
I just don't remember.
I shouldn't have left.

679
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:46,461
So you're saying he sent himself
a different set of personal items...

680
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:50,057
...ones he'd selected after using the machine
and nothing our security would flag?

681
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:54,136
Everyday things combined with the power of foresight...

682
01:20:54,321 --> 01:20:58,281
...transform Michael from engineer to escape artist.

683
01:21:00,494 --> 01:21:03,851
I don't know about you, but I'd like to return the favor.

684
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,872
Michael, are you OK?

685
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,744
I'm all right.

686
01:21:37,264 --> 01:21:40,693
Michael, I don't know what you saw in your machine,...

687
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:45,521
...but I remember, a few weeks ago,
you came back from your lab and you are pale.

688
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:48,195
You asked me the strangest question.

689
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:53,003
- What?
- If I knew it wouldn't work out...

690
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:57,467
...for you and I, before we were together,
would I have done it?

691
01:21:59,787 --> 01:22:01,544
What did you say?

692
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:05,213
That I wouldn't trade our time for anything.

693
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:09,385
That's all we are, the sum of our experiences.

694
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:15,480
Besides, some of the best things in life are total mistakes.

695
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:30,140
- What?
- You know, when I checked this envelope out of Reddy Grant,...

696
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:34,304
...they told me I signed in 20 items, but there are only 19.

697
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:36,575
I don't understand.

698
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,265
What are these pictures of?

699
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:47,210
Michael, look at the rest of the pictures.

700
01:24:11,485 --> 01:24:13,675
Look at the last one.

701
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,881
Oh, my God. It's the future.

702
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:28,491
The machine predicts a war, and we go to war to avert it.

703
01:24:28,702 --> 01:24:34,061
It predicts a plague.
We herd all the sick together, create a plague.

704
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:38,097
Whatever future this predicts, we make happen.

705
01:24:38,946 --> 01:24:41,768
We give over control of our lives completely.

706
01:24:43,384 --> 01:24:45,278
I did this.

707
01:24:45,653 --> 01:24:48,113
Seeing the future will destroy us.

708
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:04,225
If you show someone their future, they have no future.

709
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:09,432
If you take away the mystery, you take away hope.

710
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:15,102
I have to go back.
I have to destroy that machine.

711
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:18,278
It's impossible. The campus is huge.
There are hundreds of guards.

712
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:24,849
Hey, I would not have given up the three years we had
together unless I was absolutely sure I could get us 50 more.

713
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:27,879
Okay. So how do we get in?

714
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:32,319
- We don't.
- You said everything was happening...

715
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:35,923
...for a reason, and that includes me being here.

716
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:37,488
So come on.

717
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:39,999
Hey, Rachel.

718
01:25:50,518 --> 01:25:54,141
Another day at the most.
I don't have many more places to look.

719
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:57,314
I guess you weren't as smart as you thought, Stevens.

720
01:25:57,324 --> 01:26:01,318
Hey, Jennings wouldn't find it any
faster unless he knew where to look.

721
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,693
We've got the feeds from mass transit.

722
01:26:10,104 --> 01:26:12,297
He could be anywhere by now.

723
01:26:12,307 --> 01:26:16,498
Except he's not running away.
He could've given himself a way...

724
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,303
...to disappear,
but look what he gave himself instead.

725
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:22,436
His Allcom security pass.

726
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,675
He's going back.

727
01:26:34,028 --> 01:26:37,655
Let's get a warrant to tap phone and data lines coming out of Allcom.

728
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:41,752
Put some bodies on that campus.
I want that machine!

729
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:06,352
Jennings and the girl were spotted.
What do you want me to do?

730
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:07,844
Nothing.

731
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,214
- Stay where you are.
- Nobody gets through!

732
01:27:35,222 --> 01:27:37,373
- Sir!
- I didn't do anything!

733
01:27:37,992 --> 01:27:39,214
Settle down!

734
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:44,923
All the metal detectors on level four
just went off at the same time. Ball bearings.

735
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:58,103
Just down the hall from the metal detectors.

736
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:04,675
Pull the guards off the Jennings lab.
Let him slip in, think he's fooled us.

737
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:07,270
Once he's fixed the machine, take him.

738
01:28:24,605 --> 01:28:26,362
I built this.

739
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:30,603
This door shouldn't be open.
There's something wrong.

740
01:28:36,617 --> 01:28:38,135
They're expecting us.

741
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:42,544
Let me close this door behind us.
And keep it shut.

742
01:28:42,757 --> 01:28:45,345
- He's in.
- Confirmed. He's in.

743
01:28:45,559 --> 01:28:48,711
Great. Once we confirm he's at the machine, let's go in after him.

744
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:51,483
I thought we were gonna wait for him to come out.

745
01:28:51,499 --> 01:28:54,333
I can't wait! Whether it's Jennings or the machine,...

746
01:28:54,335 --> 01:28:56,629
...I don't care, as long as I get one of them.
Let's go!

747
01:29:05,112 --> 01:29:07,399
This will do. Watch out.

748
01:29:07,414 --> 01:29:10,142
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- Smashing the lock.

749
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:11,773
Hold on a second.

750
01:29:11,986 --> 01:29:15,843
You can't just smash the thing.
They'll still be able to get in.

751
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:19,550
We gotta jam the outside reader.

752
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,060
Let's go.

753
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:43,009
Let's take a look at the future before we destroy this thing.

754
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:44,700
I bugged it.
I rigged it so Jimmy wouldn't use it against me.

755
01:30:44,702 --> 01:30:46,699
Then you can fix it, right?

756
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:56,345
Now, where would I have planted that bug?

757
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,348
Maybe on one of the motherboards.

758
01:31:02,563 --> 01:31:06,284
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we won't be needing this, OK?

759
01:31:07,568 --> 01:31:09,325
You're dangerous with that thing.

760
01:31:09,536 --> 01:31:11,695
You must have given yourself something to help you find it.

761
01:31:11,697 --> 01:31:16,293
I don't know, what it would be.
The only things left are the bullet and, uh, this.

762
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,570
- A crossword?
- Yeah.

763
01:31:22,216 --> 01:31:23,905
Look at this.

764
01:31:24,184 --> 01:31:25,975
Twelve down.

765
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:29,342
Maybe it's here.

766
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:37,755
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

767
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:42,053
Let's take a look.

768
01:31:42,736 --> 01:31:44,994
Maybe it's a circuit diagram.

769
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:50,034
I wouldn't have put it in the primary path.

770
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,269
Twelve down.

771
01:32:12,566 --> 01:32:13,823
Take him.

772
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:19,592
OK, corridor three, sublevel A, Jennings' lab.

773
01:32:28,482 --> 01:32:33,841
All right, let's put this thing to good use one last time.

774
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:35,805
Let's get us out of here.

775
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:24,360
That's in the lab.

776
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,325
It's the catwalk.

777
01:33:47,695 --> 01:33:53,316
Look, I've changed my future before using this thing.
I can do it again.

778
01:34:12,553 --> 01:34:15,705
We don't have any more time.
We got to destroy this before they get to it.

779
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:18,910
Reprogram the door to Jennings' lab, please.

780
01:34:18,926 --> 01:34:20,376
Now.

781
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,529
He must've done something to the controller.

782
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:33,633
- How are we gonna get out of here Micheal?
- I don't know.

783
01:35:05,105 --> 01:35:06,396
Clear!

784
01:35:06,907 --> 01:35:09,729
- What are you doing?
- These things are liquid hydrogen.

785
01:35:09,843 --> 01:35:12,870
They're used to cool the machine.
They fire in order.

786
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,330
Number one just fired.

787
01:35:14,548 --> 01:35:18,466
When it gets down to number six here,
that's all she wrote.

788
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:21,980
I'll see you when this goes off, Jimmy.

789
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:29,219
Come on!

790
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,928
You see?
You judge too soon.

791
01:35:54,788 --> 01:35:57,883
They went out through the vent.
Spread out, find them.

792
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:29,173
Position three standing by.

793
01:36:30,758 --> 01:36:32,349
Come on.

794
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:36,016
Freeze!

795
01:36:44,205 --> 01:36:45,427
Look out.

796
01:36:48,575 --> 01:36:50,162
Seal off all exits to the lab.

797
01:37:08,896 --> 01:37:14,790
All right, Jennings, let's see what you've been up to.

798
01:37:29,483 --> 01:37:33,402
Rachel, go for the door, OK?

799
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:01,064
Drop the gun.

800
01:39:04,912 --> 01:39:06,569
Drop the gun.

801
01:39:59,233 --> 01:40:02,453
Looks like Michael's got a date on the catwalks.

802
01:40:07,475 --> 01:40:09,663
Let's make sure he makes it.

803
01:41:28,055 --> 01:41:29,879
- Let's go.
- No. We can't take the catwalk.

804
01:41:29,891 --> 01:41:33,119
I know. We won't, I promise.
Come on, let's go.

805
01:41:43,737 --> 01:41:47,194
- Michael! What are you doing?
- Rachel, go. Go. I'll distract them.

806
01:41:47,197 --> 01:41:48,529
- Go, please.
- No!

807
01:41:48,532 --> 01:41:51,830
Listen to me. This is my debt.
I built this machine.

808
01:41:51,845 --> 01:41:54,630
- I have to pay for it.
- No! You come with me now!

809
01:41:54,638 --> 01:41:57,204
You promised you'd change your fate!

810
01:41:57,217 --> 01:41:59,270
Please, we don't have time.

811
01:41:59,486 --> 01:42:05,414
If you love me, if you care about me. Go.
Have a good life.

812
01:42:07,594 --> 01:42:09,749
Remember me.

813
01:42:11,865 --> 01:42:13,520
Damn you.

814
01:42:19,507 --> 01:42:21,332
Jimmy.

815
01:42:21,776 --> 01:42:26,840
You want to kill me, come do it yourself.

816
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:35,404
Here I am. You want me?
Come get me.

817
01:42:40,628 --> 01:42:43,421
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Mike.

818
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:47,391
- Looks like this is it, huh?
- Yeah, it is, Mike.

819
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:50,553
- You only have yourself to blame.
- That's a lie.

820
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:53,632
You can't change your fate, Mike.
You're gonna die today.

821
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,393
Maybe.

822
01:42:57,478 --> 01:43:00,202
But you're not going to kill me.

823
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,877
That's right, Mike.
I've seen the future.

824
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:28,551
Still think you can change your fate, Mike?

825
01:44:30,304 --> 01:44:32,289
I am the future, Mike!

826
01:44:58,565 --> 01:45:01,055
- Rethrick has Jennings.
- Retire him.

827
01:45:01,068 --> 01:45:03,101
- What?
- We have the machine.

828
01:45:03,103 --> 01:45:07,432
We can't risk its creator falling into the wrong hands.
Come on.

829
01:46:06,367 --> 01:46:08,386
Don't blame me.

830
01:46:09,336 --> 01:46:13,023
You and Michael would've lived happily ever after, no memory wipe.

831
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,366
He's the one who saw something he didn't like.

832
01:46:15,576 --> 01:46:19,172
He's the one who decided he wanted to stop the program.

833
01:46:35,429 --> 01:46:39,025
Look at it this way, you did change the future, Michael.

834
01:46:39,033 --> 01:46:41,793
Before you interfered you both would've lived...

835
01:46:41,802 --> 01:46:45,830
...we would still be friends, instead of ending up like this.

836
01:46:46,273 --> 01:46:48,724
It wasn't meant to be.

837
01:46:54,948 --> 01:46:57,172
Giving up so easy?

838
01:46:59,286 --> 01:47:03,342
Don't you believe in second chances?

839
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:07,481
To tell you the truth, I do.

840
01:47:19,573 --> 01:47:21,831
Go, go, go.

841
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,774
Rachel!

842
01:49:02,342 --> 01:49:04,202
Let's go.

843
01:49:09,416 --> 01:49:11,344
Look.

844
01:49:20,928 --> 01:49:23,049
Any records? Any papers?

845
01:49:23,264 --> 01:49:26,125
Explosion destroyed everything.

846
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:36,229
- Are we trying to salvage that or what?
- I guess we don't get the machine, do we?

847
01:50:03,871 --> 01:50:06,026
Any sign of Jennings?

848
01:50:06,774 --> 01:50:10,534
No, I'm afraid he didn't make it.

849
01:50:54,288 --> 01:50:59,876
What was Shorty thinking, starting a nursery?
I mean, these plants are on life-support.

850
01:50:59,927 --> 01:51:02,850
What do you mean? Really?
He told me he had a green thumb.

851
01:51:02,863 --> 01:51:05,457
Gangrene is more like it.

852
01:51:05,466 --> 01:51:09,025
Lucky for Shorty, I'm a biologist.

853
01:51:09,036 --> 01:51:12,087
Lucky for both of us, since I failed biology,...

854
01:51:12,095 --> 01:51:15,223
- ...I'm no help to either one of you.
- So you say.

855
01:51:15,242 --> 01:51:19,003
Too bad, though, because I'm looking for a partner...

856
01:51:19,013 --> 01:51:22,035
- ...for a start-up company.
- Really? Doing what?

857
01:51:22,082 --> 01:51:24,176
We're gonna save the world.

858
01:51:26,721 --> 01:51:28,581
I don't think I'm your guy.

859
01:51:28,789 --> 01:51:32,781
But would you settle for someone who wants to help you change it?

860
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:35,720
- Mmm, okay.
- Good.

861
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:40,021
So how does it end for us, Michael?
I mean, what's in our future?

862
01:51:40,067 --> 01:51:45,326
You know, I don't know.
I kind of like it that way.

863
01:51:45,339 --> 01:51:48,293
- I do know one thing.
- What's that?

864
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:52,494
I never want to forget anything ever again.

865
01:51:55,149 --> 01:51:59,905
Break it up, break it up.
The birdman cometh.

866
01:52:01,222 --> 01:52:02,949
- Shorty.
- It's dinner.

867
01:52:02,957 --> 01:52:05,214
- You found them.
- Yes, I did.

868
01:52:05,225 --> 01:52:07,676
- Who does everything for everybody around here?
- You do.

869
01:52:07,695 --> 01:52:09,486
- You're right.
- You're my hero.

870
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:11,215
Thank you very much.

871
01:52:11,232 --> 01:52:14,225
- You hear that? I'm a hero.
- That's great.

872
01:52:15,236 --> 01:52:17,528
I think I remember.
Are those our birds?

873
01:52:17,738 --> 01:52:20,731
Yes, of course they are.
We bought them together.

874
01:52:20,741 --> 01:52:24,907
You remember the birds?
Well done. You could see into the future...

875
01:52:24,912 --> 01:52:27,868
...and all you remember are Polly and Tweety over there.

876
01:52:27,881 --> 01:52:31,309
- Why don't you remember something that would make us rich, huh, Mike?
- Wait a second.

877
01:52:31,317 --> 01:52:32,438
What is it?

878
01:52:32,553 --> 01:52:35,541
- I think there was something else.
- No, no, no.

879
01:52:35,556 --> 01:52:38,510
The envelope's empty.
Don't worry about it.

880
01:52:38,515 --> 01:52:42,488
Hold on. I'm working backward here.

881
01:52:46,534 --> 01:52:52,690
"If you only look where you can't go,
you will miss the riches below."

882
01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:58,096
I must've known you'd never get rid of these birds.
Alright?

883
01:52:58,102 --> 01:52:59,865
Of course not. They're family.

884
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:05,041
So I knew this would be here.
What only looks where it can't go?

885
01:53:05,052 --> 01:53:06,775
A caged bird.

886
01:53:08,722 --> 01:53:11,515
"You will miss the riches below."

887
01:53:14,895 --> 01:53:17,016
The riches below.

888
01:53:25,373 --> 01:53:27,498
What is that?

889
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:31,497
Well, that's a $90-million lottery ticket.

890
01:53:31,512 --> 01:53:34,002
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- It's $90 million.

891
01:53:34,014 --> 01:53:36,145
- Nice.
- Yes, I'm proud of it.

892
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:38,377
Wait a minute. No.

893
01:53:38,385 --> 01:53:40,618
- Wait a-- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

894
01:53:40,621 --> 01:53:41,543
You know what?

895
01:53:41,755 --> 01:53:45,214
I think now's probably a good time to discuss my commission, 33%.

896
01:53:45,226 --> 01:53:47,455
- I thought it was 5.
- No, 33%.

897
01:53:47,461 --> 01:53:51,318
- Thirty-three percent! We had a deal at five percent.
- He deserves it. - Absolutely.

898
01:53:51,332 --> 01:53:57,283
- It was found on-- It was found on my premises.
- You know what? I'll come back. I'm going to cash this in.
