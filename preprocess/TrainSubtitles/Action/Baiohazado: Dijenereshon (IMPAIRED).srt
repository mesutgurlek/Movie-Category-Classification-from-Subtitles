1
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:27,249
Can you see that area behind me
beneath the red-tinted sky?

2
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,556
That is what's left of Raccoon City
after the military fired a missile at it.

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,799
According to unconfirmed reports,
the missile was allegedly nuclear.

4
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,470
If this is the case,
there's little hope of finding...

5
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,299
...any survivors among
the city's 100,000 inhabitants.

6
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,439
Mr. President, what is the connection
between Umbrella Corporation...

7
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,510
...and this incident?
- No more questions.

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,410
Was the missile launched
as a result of this connection?

9
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,845
Can you shed light on this?

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,145
<i>The president has announced
his resignation.</i>

11
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,152
Umbrella Corporation stock
plummeted here in Europe.

12
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,325
This dealt a blow
to the business giant...

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,494
...resulting in its
complete dissolution.

14
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,826
<i>The estimated number of bio terror
victims has skyrocketed...</i>

15
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,499
<i>...from hundreds of thousands
to over one million.</i>

16
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,798
<i>The president announced that
the Republic of Bajirib...</i>

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,905
<i>...led by General Grande,
was the latest addition to the list...</i>

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,507
<i>...of countries
that sponsor terrorism.</i>

19
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,200
- Announced it plans to put
taxpayers' money to work...

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,041
...by allocating one billion dollars
for an anti-bio terror program.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,578
<i>Pharmaceutical company WilPharma
issued a press release...</i>

22
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,380
<i>...on establishing
a research facility in Harvardville...</i>

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,454
<i>...home to 100,000 residents.</i>

24
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,525
We've taken every precaution
to ensure that a catastrophe...

25
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:37,594
...such as the one suffered by
Raccoon City, is never repeated.

26
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,756
<i>Inflamed by Senator Ron Davis'
full support of the new facility...</i>

27
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,426
<i>Dr. Curtis Miller, a long time opponent
of the WilPharma research facility...</i>

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,300
<i>... was arrested and charged
with obstruction of business...</i>

29
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,102
<i>...and issuing threats to proponents
of WilPharma's ex...</i>

30
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,947
Our organization has disassociated
itself from Dr. Miller.

31
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,008
The human rights organization
Terra-Save has demanded...

32
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,553
...WilPharma release the results
of their tests conducted in India.

33
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,385
WilPharma stock fell sharply as
a result of scathing accusations...

34
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,494
...hurled at them by Terra-Save.

35
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,664
<i>WilPharma must go.</i>

36
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,066
<i>WilPharma must go.</i>

37
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,104
<i>We say no. WilPharma must...</i>

38
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,540
Members of Terra-Save lie in wait here
in front of Harvardville Airport...

39
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,512
...in anticipation of Senator Davis'
imminent arrival.

40
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,741
The group hopes
to confront the politician...

41
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,012
...who will be attending the National
Pharmaceutical Conference.

42
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,260
<i>Now arriving in Gate 32A...</i>

43
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,330
<i>... Flight 349
from Newark, New Jersey.</i>

44
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,336
<i>Will a Brock Silverstein
please report to Gate 7?</i>

45
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,630
<i>Brock Silverstein to Gate 7.</i>

46
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,707
<i>Flight 89 from Columbus
has just arrived at Gate 17.</i>

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,004
<i>For those waiting to depart,
it'll just take a minute to de-board...</i>

48
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,841
<i>...and turn the plane around.</i>

49
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,077
It's been ages.

50
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,256
You look great.

51
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,681
You look tired.

52
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,522
Blame my new boyfriend,
he won't let me get any sleep.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,029
Boyfriend, huh? Is that what
you're calling the W.H.O. Report now?

54
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,395
FDA, actually.

55
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,264
Aunt. I'm tired.

56
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,460
Yes, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,971
Stay here, and I'll bring the limousine
around as quickly as I can.

58
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,666
Will you watch Rani for a minute?

59
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,107
- Sure thing.
- I'll be right back.

60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,043
Well, we should
introduce ourselves.

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm Claire Redfield.

62
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,609
- You can call me Claire.
- I'm Rani.

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,812
Nice to meet you, Rani.
That's a pretty name.

64
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,228
Excuse me, sir,
are you feeling all right?

65
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,427
Would you like me
to bring you some water?

66
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,975
It's urgent I reach Frederic Downing
from WilPharma.

67
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,204
Emergency.

68
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,015
<i>We say no. WilPharma must go.</i>

69
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,291
Do you work for Terra-Save too?

70
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,892
Yep. Just like your aunt.

71
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:59,224
I like everybody from Terra-Save
because they're all pretty cool.

72
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,026
You fight bad guys, right?

73
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,998
- Bad guys?
- Like him.

74
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:08,367
<i>Senator Davis, you serve as a special
advisor for WilPharma Corporation.</i>

75
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,236
<i>After viewing photos of their
latest human test subjects...</i>

76
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,639
<i>...what are your thoughts?</i>

77
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:19,544
That Halloween is celebrated earlier
in India than in the U.S., maybe?

78
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,257
Really, I simply don't understand
American humour.

79
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,591
Apologies. I didn't mean to...

80
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,626
Don't worry about it. I can relate.

81
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,031
Are you two waiting for someone
as well?

82
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,222
Yeah.

83
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,199
Well, I think the asylum let
the patients out for the day.

84
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,065
It's a bit crazy outside.

85
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,604
That's an understatement.

86
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,368
The Air Dome Research Facility
isn't the only thing...

87
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,943
...Senator Davis
brought to Harvardville.

88
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,377
It's like the wacko circus hit town.

89
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,547
Well, l...

90
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,722
I'm weary of waiting.
I'm going to grab a taxi.

91
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,357
Good day, ladies.

92
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,400
Who the hell let it leak out
that I was coming?

93
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,128
Now those damned agitators
are out there stirring up trouble.

94
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:16,001
I don't need this.
Get them out of here.

95
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,745
What tar pit did this crap
ooze out of?

96
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,745
I'm sorry, I'll get you another.

97
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,851
I don't care what it takes,
just get rid of them now.

98
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,953
Arrest them if you have to.

99
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,589
But, sir, we don't have
any grounds for arrest.

100
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,850
They haven't done
anything illegal yet.

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,857
Senator, may I make a suggestion?

102
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,360
We could slip out through
the regular entrance.

103
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,089
No one would expect that,
so the crowd won't notice us.

104
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,734
What? Hell, no.

105
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,268
I am an elected official.

106
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,566
I will not skulk out of here
like some whipped dog.

107
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:54,577
Now, I won't budge from this spot
until you get that swarm of vermin...

108
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,544
...out of the building.

109
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,052
The bad guy. Claire.

110
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,927
It's him. The bad guy we saw on TV.

111
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,128
Senator Davis.
Can I have another word?

112
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,029
- You cannot.
- Please, senator. Please.

113
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,033
Just one more question.
Why would you...?

114
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,401
What the hell is this?

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,635
Rani, wait here, okay?

116
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:32,049
Did someone put you up to this, or is
this stupid costume your brilliant idea?

117
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,776
Okay, genius,
you got something to say...

118
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,148
...get it off your chest and move on.

119
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,625
This is too much.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,498
Ma'am, are you involved in this?

121
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,676
Indirectly, in a manner of speaking.

122
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,439
Then, in a manner of speaking...

123
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,150
...you're coming with me too.

124
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,982
- Now, wait just a minute.
- Chief.

125
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,904
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,630
What's going on here?

127
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,479
Stand back.

128
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,217
Move, move, move. Out of the way.

129
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,613
Stand back.

130
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,049
Move away from him now.

131
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,145
Damn.

132
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,334
Too late. He's dead.

133
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,897
Let's get the hell out of here.

134
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,536
Run.

135
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,010
Get away. Hurry.

136
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,504
Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

137
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,900
<i>Reporting live

00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,101
...and access into the area
is blocked.

159
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,801
Authorities are not releasing details
and we have very little information...

160
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,036
...at this time.

161
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,148
However, according
to unsubstantiated reports...

162
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,810
...a bio terror event has occurred
in one of the airport terminals.

163
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,390
Senator Ron Davis is among those
who are confined within the airport.

164
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,289
At present, his condition...

165
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,473
Give me a hand.

166
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,510
I want to go home.

167
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,152
I don't understand
why you won't let me leave.

168
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,967
Why can't we stage
rescue operations?

169
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,075
Please, chief.
You've got to talk to your higher-ups.

170
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,177
You heard the 911 call, didn't you?

171
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,939
Come on, please.

172
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,342
Damn it.

173
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,576
What's the matter?
Chief Jackass again?

174
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,652
What's the status of the site?

175
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,259
Well, the entire airport
is completely blockaded now.

176
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,329
We were attacked by two people
that I believe were recently infected.

177
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,521
But don't worry.

178
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,965
We caught them and locked them up
in a task-force vehicle.

179
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,670
But even so, becoming infected
by being bitten...

180
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,539
It's like something out of
a horror movie.

181
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,944
Those creatures rising up
out of their graves.

182
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,456
Come on, I'm just kidding.
But seriously...

183
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,854
...do you think this WilPharma drug
has something to do with all this?

184
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,828
I don't know.

185
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,623
Even if there is a connection,
that shouldn't kick off...

186
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,928
...a spontaneous outbreak
of some creepy-ass plague.

187
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,201
It definitely reeks of terrorism.

188
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,570
That explains why the state Board of
Health hauled ass to get here so fast.

189
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,075
What do you think the suits
are trying to cover up?

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,942
If I knew that, I'd have
a hell of a lot more clout.

191
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,243
The White House sent a special agent
to handle this mess.

192
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,114
He ought to be here soon.

193
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,516
You can ask him.

194
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,854
Ask all you like, but honestly, there's
nothing to discuss on that subject.

195
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,456
Who the hell are you?

196
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,326
Leon S. Kennedy.

197
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,866
Then you're the one?

198
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,806
This is one of the 911 calls
that was made.

199
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,173
<i>- How many are alive?
- Four, including me.</i>

200
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,905
<i>One's wounded. The senator.</i>

201
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,606
<i>Can you give me your location?</i>

202
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,445
<i>We're in the VIP lounge,
west end of the arrivals lobby.</i>

203
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,679
<i>Listen, I don't know how long
we can hold up.</i>

204
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,416
<i>Send help now before
those things get at us. Please hurry.</i>

205
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,253
Most likely, that call came
from here.

206
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,899
We believe they're in the VIP lounge
for Atmos Airlines.

207
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,069
Right now, the airport police
and state Board of Health...

208
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,532
...are the first responders.

209
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,206
They've completely shut down
the main entrance here...

210
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,968
...and the two side entrances
here and here.

211
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,146
There are no other routes
into the terminal building.

212
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,747
We believe our best bet
is to fly in by helicopter...

213
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,315
...and enter through the roof.

214
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,783
- The team should be comprised...
- I'll take the two of you. No one else.

215
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,546
What? Why?

216
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,782
Because I don't care to risk increasing
the number of infected.

217
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,622
You don't want to be forced
to shoot your friends, do you?

218
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,698
Hey. Hey. Hold on a second.
You can't be serious.

219
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,129
Who does this guy think he is?
He doesn't look military.

220
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,239
He's the special agent
assigned to this incident.

221
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,002
Let's just see what he can do.

222
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,477
Those infected with this virus
will attack other people...

223
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,585
...anyone, without exception.

224
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,388
The people that are bitten become
infected and go on to attack others.

225
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,289
The only way to stop the infection
is to destroy the infected' brains.

226
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,124
Destroy their brains?

227
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,065
Shoot them in the head.

228
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,462
We're here.

229
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,328
The song of the infected.

230
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,065
Wait.

231
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,130
Are you okay?

232
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,761
Take it easy.

233
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,801
Help is on the way.

234
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,108
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,040
Look.

236
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,116
Stop or I'll shoot.

237
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,097
That's impossible.

238
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,192
Angela.

239
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,207
You like that, huh?

240
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,511
- You want some of this? Get off.
- Stop, enough.

241
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,382
Yeah, come on. Yeah!

242
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,762
- That's enough. Stop.
- Get off.

243
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,500
Freaks.

244
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,130
Yeah.

245
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,406
Hey.

246
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,755
What the hell, man?

247
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,764
I shot her point blank.
There's no way I could've missed her.

248
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,338
I told you. The only way to stop them
is to shoot them in the head.

249
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,064
It's their only vulnerable spot.

250
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,303
Don't forget it, otherwise
you'll waste time and ammunition.

251
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,879
And that can prove to be fatal.

252
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,220
Let's go.

253
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,598
- Those were gunshots.
- They sent help.

254
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,331
We're goanna get out of here.

255
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,907
You should thank me.

256
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,602
If you hadn't told them I was here,
they would've ignored your call.

257
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,907
You might want to stick your ego
up your ass...

258
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,279
...considering your own secretary
left you here to die.

259
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,611
What was that?

260
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,347
Someone who isn't infected.

261
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,526
We have to help.

262
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,718
It's too late.
There's nothing we can do.

263
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,127
That's right.
I mean, if you, then I leave too.

264
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,165
No, Claire, don't go.

265
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,361
When my father left,
he said the same thing.

266
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,733
He said he was going
to go help my mother...

267
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,774
...but he didn't come back,
and neither did she.

268
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,639
And if you leave,
you won't come back either.

269
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,109
It's okay.

270
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,078
I am goanna come back.

271
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,549
- I promise.
- Really?

272
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,022
By the way, do we have anything here
that can be used as a weapon?

273
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,683
Never saw this coming.

274
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,995
Is there anyone there?

275
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,438
No answer. Never a good sign.

276
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,991
Get down.

277
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,629
Leon.

278
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,304
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

279
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,741
You're the one?

280
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,542
Is this it?

281
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,218
- Yup.
- Reinforcements?

282
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,080
None. We're getting out alone.

283
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,886
Is it too much to hope
you at least have some sort of a plan?

284
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,061
- We're goanna run across the lobby.
- Are you insane?

285
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,196
The lobby is crawling
with those creatures.

286
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,626
It's also the widest area.

287
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,233
It's too dangerous
to take the long way around.

288
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,424
He's right.

289
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,536
They aren't fast.
We can get by them.

290
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,729
Oh, yeah?

291
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,739
And since when
did the NGO member...

292
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,878
...become such an authority
on the subject?

293
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,274
She's one of the rare survivors
of Raccoon City.

294
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,315
She has more experience
with this kind of hellish nightmare...

295
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,452
...than anyone else here.

296
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,552
Hey, Raccoon City,
isn't that where they...?

297
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,245
Yes.

298
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,759
Run.

299
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,541
Keep up with me, Rani.

300
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,111
- Go.
- Thanks.

301
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,424
Senator.

302
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,265
Sir.

303
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,715
Greg.

304
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,958
Shit.

305
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,651
He got bit.

306
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,161
He damn well got bit.

307
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,128
Stay back.

308
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,259
Go on without me.

309
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,301
- Greg. Wait.
- Greg.

310
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,495
You got this?

311
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,774
Greg.

312
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,037
Greg. No.

313
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,976
Greg.

314
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,650
Greg!

315
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,956
You okay?

316
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,961
Do I look like I'm okay?

317
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,537
Are we going to make it out of here?

318
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,942
We have a clear view
and a straight path to the exit.

319
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,313
We'll take out as many as we can...

320
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,319
...and run like hell.

321
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,958
Angela, back me up.

322
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,587
Got it.

323
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,403
Can't you get rid of them any faster?

324
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,668
They're starting to gather over here.

325
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,045
We're not goanna make it out,
are we?

326
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,547
It's getting tough.

327
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,049
We got to go.

328
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,347
Rani.

329
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,499
Claire.

330
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:53,988
You all right?

331
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,394
Barely.

332
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,602
- Rani, are you okay?
- Claire.

333
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,038
Let's go.

334
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,618
Thank you.

335
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,260
Where's the senator?

336
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,239
Finally.

337
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,037
I'm over here.

338
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,582
The light. Run towards the light.

339
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,644
Get that perimeter set up. Move.

340
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,816
Don't stand there, man. Set it up.

341
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,510
Move in, move in. Open fire.

342
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,383
- Light them up, boys. Light them up.
- Get a move on.

343
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,956
Move, move.

344
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,725
Rani!

345
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,564
Rani.

346
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,498
Aunt.

347
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,875
- Aunt.
- Oh, my God. You're all right.

348
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,271
I was so scared.

349
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,277
Aunt.

350
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,574
Aunt.

351
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,877
They were everywhere.

352
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,146
- I didn't think I would see you again.
- I can't stand kids.

353
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,688
They're a real pain in the ass.

354
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,257
Oh, my poor darling.

355
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,088
Bastard.

356
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,856
That girl will have nightmares...

357
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,194
...for the rest of her life
because of you.

358
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,838
Let me go. Give her to me. Please.

359
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,199
I got it, I got it.

360
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,601
Claire.

361
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,969
You okay?

362
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,771
Oh, honey, I know.
But she's fine, really.

363
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,413
We just have to wait.

364
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,778
No problem.

365
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,084
I'll take care of it.

366
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,263
We can use that
in the worst-case scenario.

367
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,399
I have no intention
of letting WilPharma...

368
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,967
...end up looking like a savior.

369
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,700
Hey, Hunnigan. I'm reporting in.

370
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,130
<i>I already heard.</i>

371
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,931
<i>The Marines landed
in the nick of time and saved the day.</i>

372
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,902
<i>I can't tell you how relieved I am.</i>

373
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,804
I'm amazed and impressed
you got authorization for that.

374
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,845
<i>- You must have pulled a few strings.
- Yes. Well, I have my resources.</i>

375
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,177
<i>After I received confirmation
from USAMRIID...</i>

376
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,377
<i>... that the virus used in this attack
was indeed the T-virus...</i>

377
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,522
<i>... I submitted a plan
to the president.</i>

378
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,158
<i>He pushed it through
as a special emergency act.</i>

379
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,625
<i>Every Marine involved in the assault
was vaccinated.</i>

380
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,856
<i>- Have the terrorists made demands?
- No, not yet.</i>

381
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,660
But the FBI captured a member
of General Grande's army...

382
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,030
...in Los Angeles just moments ago.

383
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,207
When we interrogate him,
he might give us some information...

384
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,932
...that'll establish a link...

385
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,668
...between this terrorist attack
and the one in India.

386
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,972
Maybe we'll dig up a lead
on the whereabouts...

387
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,149
...of former
Umbrella Corporation employees.

388
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,478
They've got to be the ones peddling
the virus on the black market.

389
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,554
What the hell is going on?

390
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,691
Why are WilPharma drugs
being brought here?

391
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,189
It's the vaccine.

392
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,560
You. What are you doing here?

393
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,533
He's WilPharma's head researcher.

394
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,601
May I introduce Frederic Downing.

395
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,241
He's the one who developed
a vaccine for the virus...

396
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,174
...which you, in particular,
are so familiar with.

397
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,142
You mean the infection
in the terminal?

398
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:19,649
You thought that was
WilPharma-engineered, didn't you?

399
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,657
Utterly ridiculous.

400
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,328
An inoculation.

401
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,558
That's what they've been working on.
A way to prevent further outbreaks.

402
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,864
- But...
- Claire, it's true.

403
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,569
- You knew?
- Yes.

404
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,040
I didn't think its use
would be sanctioned this quickly.

405
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,836
Then the human testing
that took place in India...

406
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,983
An attack by terrorists
that somehow got hold of the T-virus.

407
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,847
All the members of the group
supported by General Grande...

408
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,352
...were infected,
so we don't know the details.

409
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,685
The U.S. Government obtained
permission from Indian authorities...

410
00:34:55,893 --> 00:35:00,023
...to administer the T-virus vaccine
to the nearby communities.

411
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,826
A vaccine secretly developed
by WilPharma.

412
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,229
It was a success.

413
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,371
The infection rate
was kept as minimal as possible.

414
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,770
Why the hell didn't you
break out the vaccine for this?

415
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,070
If we'd been inoculated before
we entered the terminal, Greg would...

416
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,440
Inoculation would have been
entirely possible...

417
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,446
...had Terra-Save not backed us
into an adversarial corner.

418
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,884
Had we been able
to follow proper procedure...

419
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,685
...as outlined in the original schedule,
the government medical stockpile...

420
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,261
...could have been shipped anywhere
in the U.S. Within 12 hours.

421
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,399
Oh, my God. Then...

422
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,660
...it's all our fault.

423
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,673
I wouldn't argue with you there.

424
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,883
We just ended up
making things worse.

425
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,779
That's not true.

426
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,853
The villains here
are the ones who used the virus.

427
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,922
But worse than them
are the ones who made it.

428
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,061
Seven years ago,
our lives were changed forever...

429
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,993
...by the virus from Umbrella Corp.

430
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,035
<i>Umbrella collapsed...</i>

431
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,242
...but their viral legacy
continues to spread.

432
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,177
I'm goanna scrub this virus
from the face of the Earth.

433
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,258
You chose the role of rescuer
rather than fighter, like me.

434
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:42,193
You chose a path that
your brother and I couldn't follow.

435
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,561
You weren't wrong.

436
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,469
Leon, thank you.

437
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,482
Hurry.

438
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,180
Find some extinguishers.

439
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,359
Clear the area
before the gas tanks blow.

440
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,584
Let's go, let's go.

441
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,195
Where's the rest of the team?
Come on.

442
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,297
- How do I use this thing?
- Help.

443
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,194
Somebody help. I'm stuck.

444
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,028
I'm coming, I'm coming.

445
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,432
Hurry up, come on.

446
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,378
- What happened?
- The trucks carrying the vaccine...

447
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,610
How much vaccine is left?

448
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,018
Everything we brought today was all
we were able to scrape together...

449
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,522
...from vaccine samples
inside the company.

450
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,957
And most of that has just been lost.

451
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,595
Where's the manufacturing data?

452
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,960
- You think they're after the data too?
- Could it be?

453
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,364
Why don't you tell us
what their demands are already?

454
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,500
If you don't want to talk
I'll just go directly to the president.

455
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,700
The truth.

456
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,641
Truth?

457
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,280
They demand the truth.

458
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,974
The viral weapon from which Umbrella
Corporation's T-virus was derived.

459
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:12,087
They want to reveal everyone from the
U.S. Government who was involved.

460
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,520
Was the government
really involved?

461
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,750
The proof went up in smoke
with Raccoon City.

462
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,225
Wait a minute.
The truth didn't disappear.

463
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,990
- There never was any.
- Convince the terrorists of that.

464
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,032
If they don't get that information,
what will happen?

465
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,330
They'll disperse the T-virus
in every populated area in the U.S.

466
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,733
The deadline is midnight.

467
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,532
That's only four hours from now.

468
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,437
And there's no vaccine left.

469
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,669
Can we find out
who the terrorists are?

470
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,179
I have a clue as to the identity
of one of them.

471
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,784
Right after the first infected victims
appeared in the airport terminal...

472
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,684
...I noticed a man in the lobby.
His name is Curtis Miller.

473
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,223
I know him.
He's one of those bleeding hearts...

474
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,157
...protesting the construction
of the new research facility.

475
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,093
If the terrorists' demands
are the release of information...

476
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,529
...on what really happened
in Raccoon City...

477
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,636
...then he might...
- It can't be.

478
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,939
Curtis Miller is...

479
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,038
...my older brother.

480
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,093
My brother
wouldn't do something like this.

481
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,320
He was arrested
for threatening WilPharma.

482
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,556
He just demanded
information be made public.

483
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:06,965
Unfortunately, the rest of the world
doesn't see it that way.

484
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,406
If you claim he's not a terrorist...

485
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,601
...why don't you bring him here
to explain himself? Now.

486
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,238
You're sure packing a lot of hardware
just to go see your brother.

487
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,281
Where are you going?

488
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,116
I'm going to the office
and check on the development data.

489
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:05,023
Can I help you with something?
Don't worry. I'm not scheming...

490
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,960
...to infiltrate your organization
for my own devious purposes.

491
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,397
I'm afraid there's only one thing
you can do.

492
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,197
Join me for a late afternoon tea.

493
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:26,816
There you are. Comfortable?
It’ll be nice to have some company.

494
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,010
This is the road to Curtis' home.

495
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,941
I haven't heard a word from Curtis
in three years.

496
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:15,119
He lost his wife and child
in the Raccoon City tragedy.

497
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,488
That's odd. It won't accept my card.

498
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,426
- Has that happened before?
- No. This is the first time.

499
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,200
I'll have to use the master code.

500
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,092
We're entering an air dome.

501
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,025
The roof is supported...

502
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:10,332
...by creating a difference between
the exterior and interior air pressure.

503
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,965
The danger levels in this facility
are assigned...

504
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,105
...according to the microbes
that are handled in each section.

505
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,901
From the right,
the levels ascend from 1 to 4.

506
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,170
The higher the number,
the higher the danger level.

507
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:53,145
Rest assured, however, that there are
stringent safety measures in place...

508
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,911
...in the unlikely event
a problem occurs.

509
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,284
If anything positive rose
from the ashes of Raccoon City...

510
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,790
...it's that security and safeguard
standards have been elevated...

511
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,485
...in order to avert
any future calamities.

512
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,825
What about this zero area?

513
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,068
That contains researchers' offices,
meeting rooms and the like.

514
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,763
That's where we're headed next.

515
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,701
This isn't paradise.

516
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:19,336
This is what you came
to assist me with.

517
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,437
Thank you.

518
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:25,707
Smells delicious.

519
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:33,983
- What are you doing?
- Checking on the development data.

520
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:45,626
- Yes, senator.
- I figured you must be there by now.

521
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:47,226
What do you want?

522
00:47:47,436 --> 00:47:49,301
<i>Why did you bring
that woman there?</i>

523
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:58,302
You're not feeling sorry for her,
are you? That's not like you.

524
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:01,505
Don't you understand?
This is our chance.

525
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:05,820
Yes, I know.

526
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:07,579
Yes.

527
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:09,747
Yes.

528
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:12,726
What did he say?

529
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:16,424
Nothing of any consequence,
I assure you.

530
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:19,929
He said something to you, didn't he?

531
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:23,161
He warned me
not to let you see anything.

532
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:26,340
Would it cause trouble
if I saw something in particular?

533
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:32,107
No.

534
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:40,080
When I started out as a rookie cop...

535
00:48:40,288 --> 00:48:42,552
...I responded to a call
about a small child...

536
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:46,750
...that was stranded on a sandbank
in the middle of a flooding river.

537
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:51,494
I impulsively jumped into the river.

538
00:48:53,502 --> 00:48:55,527
The next thing I knew...

539
00:48:55,737 --> 00:49:00,106
...I was waking up in a hospital bed,
bleary and disoriented.

540
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:05,407
They informed me afterward...

541
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:10,017
...that I had saved the child.

542
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:13,081
But three S.R.T. Members
were injured...

543
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:16,780
...while fishing my sorry butt
out of the water.

544
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:24,491
Talk about depressed.
I felt lower than dirt.

545
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:28,465
What was I thinking,
putting others in harm's way like that?

546
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,901
Not to mention
that I could've been killed too.

547
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:40,980
But then Curtis said something...

548
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:45,643
...that made me stop
beating myself up.

549
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,685
"If you don't try to save one life...

550
00:49:53,361 --> 00:49:55,955
...you'll never save any."

551
00:49:59,901 --> 00:50:00,890
In the end...

552
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:06,565
<i>... his own words
came back to haunt him.</i>

553
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:26,960
Let me through. Let me through.

554
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:45,537
There is something,
but Davis wants it to remain hidden.

555
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:55,382
This is the G-virus.

556
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,770
You have that here?

557
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:16,944
It remains a secret
even within the company.

558
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:19,545
The government affiliates
don't know about it either.

559
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:21,443
It was obtained
through special means.

560
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,083
A group with which neither we...

561
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:26,048
...nor someone in the senator's
position can be associated.

562
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:29,355
You got it on the black market.

563
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:33,022
What did you plan on doing
with the G-virus?

564
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:36,789
Create a vaccine. But even the senator
couldn't adequately express...

565
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:38,795
...the threat
G posed to the government.

566
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,299
The plans were shelved
and it remains in Level 4 ever since.

567
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:44,472
The senator is a member
of the committee...

568
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:47,073
...that decided
to bomb Raccoon City.

569
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,373
I've got to tell Leon.

570
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:52,341
Wait, no. L...

571
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:55,015
If you do that,
what's going to happen to me?

572
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:59,311
You didn't seem worried about that
when you were telling me everything.

573
00:52:08,129 --> 00:52:11,690
Looks like... Looks like there's
something wrong with the server.

574
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:43,921
I'm going to stop Curtis.

575
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,209
Claire, what's wrong?

576
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:05,079
Leon, get over here
to WilPharma right now.

577
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,514
They've got the G-virus.

578
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,281
They were goanna make a vaccine
like for the T-virus...

579
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:12,460
...but Davis just called Frederic
and told him to get rid of it.

580
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,629
- Is Frederic there?
- He just went to go fix the server.

581
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,627
Or he may have gone
to dump the virus.

582
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:20,494
<i>- Couldn't be.
- Claire?</i>

583
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:23,398
There's a call
coming from inside the building.

584
00:53:23,605 --> 00:53:25,573
Hold on.

585
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,468
<i>- Claire?
- Frederic? Where are you?</i>

586
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:31,338
<i>- In Level 4.
- Why?</i>

587
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:33,036
You were
going to the server room.

588
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:35,739
<i>I saw someone suspicious
on my way and followed him.</i>

589
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,975
<i>You need to get out.
There's a time bomb.</i>

590
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:39,619
<i>It's too late to stop it.</i>

591
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:41,789
<i>We'll have another biohazard
if this thing...</i>

592
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:52,125
Claire? Claire!

593
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,527
- Damn it.
- What's wrong?

594
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:56,863
I don't know. We got cut off.

595
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:01,669
<i>Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.</i>

596
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:05,471
<i>Terminate all activities immediately
and evacuate the dome...</i>

597
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,446
<i>... until safe conditions
are re-established and verified.</i>

598
00:54:09,651 --> 00:54:13,781
<i>Attention all personnel.

599
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:17,480
<i>Terminate all activities immediately

600
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:22,288
<i>... until safe conditions
are re-established and verified.</i>

601
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:13,670
<i>Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.</i>

602
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:17,477
<i>Terminate all activities immediately

603
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:21,314
<i>... until safe conditions

604
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:25,754
<i>Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.</i>

605
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,190
<i>Terminate all activities

606
00:55:29,597 --> 00:55:31,690
<i>... until safe conditions
are re-established...</i>

607
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,333
Looks like sections are blocked.

608
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:36,128
Let's split up. We can meet up again
in the inner garden.

609
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:38,931
- Ready?
- Ready.

610
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,199
Angela.

611
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:44,838
You're not alone.

612
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:46,411
We're together in this.

613
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:51,751
I know.

614
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,240
Leon.

615
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,847
What happened? Where's Frederic?

616
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:33,790
He was telling me about a time bomb
he found in Level 4 when...

617
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:39,765
- A nasty wound. We got to get out.
- I'm all right. Listen to me.

618
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:41,833
Curtis was here, I saw him.

619
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:45,836
He came out of Level 4
where the G-virus was kept.

620
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,405
Curtis.

621
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,313
Angela.

622
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:42,526
You're hurt.

623
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:44,598
You need medical attention.

624
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:48,829
- Why, Curtis?
- I couldn't forgive them...

625
00:57:49,037 --> 00:57:51,471
...for covering up
the Raccoon City atrocity.

626
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:56,609
I refused to let the government
rewrite the truth as they saw fit.

627
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,043
So when I finally learned the truth,
I swore...

628
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:06,209
I swore I'd make them reveal it,
no matter what it took.

629
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,184
Curtis.

630
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:11,119
But he also told me...

631
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:14,556
...that I couldn't make things
any worse.

632
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:19,022
Even if it was deserved...

633
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:23,363
...there was no chance of me...

634
00:58:23,938 --> 00:58:26,771
Of me causing a recurrence
of that horror...

635
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:31,104
...here in the town
where I was born and raised.

636
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:33,507
That's why he left me.

637
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:37,707
That's why he blew up this place.

638
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:52,721
Wait.

639
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:00,802
Nothing can stop it now.

640
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,437
In a moment...

641
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:09,844
...l'll reveal the irrefutable truth...

642
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:14,215
...in my own personal way.

643
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:23,187
And all of you
will be the very first witnesses!

644
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:46,443
Go straight down this corridor.
Head to elevator AD-2.

645
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,519
It'll take you to an outside exit.

646
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:50,190
Got it.

647
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:51,449
Claire.

648
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:56,155
- Try not to get killed.
- Okay, ditto.

649
01:00:06,474 --> 01:00:08,066
Move.

650
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,469
No!

651
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:16,279
Stop.

652
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,489
Cease fire. Cease fire.

653
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:45,274
The target became aggressive
and resisted capture.

654
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:48,004
I deemed it necessary to open fire
and issued the order.

655
01:00:48,216 --> 01:00:49,547
The target was terminated.

656

- You've got to be kidding me.

661
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:11,228
My men shot the shit out of you.

662
01:02:07,695 --> 01:02:09,686
My leg.

663
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,394
Angela.

664
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:50,521
Angela, get clear.

665
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:53,256
Leon.

666
01:04:58,666 --> 01:04:59,655
Somebody.

667
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:05,071
Somebody pull me up.

668
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,299
What is this?

669
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,401
Anhydrous ethanol.

670
01:05:45,613 --> 01:05:47,547

01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:53,779
Not us, the building.

01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,358
We're still in here.

675
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:03,792

01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:05,659

677
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:12,896

01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,395

683
01:06:38,232 --> 01:06:40,291
Go!

684
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:07,085
Stop.

685
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,761
You'll ignite us all.

686
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:30,174

- It's impossible.

687
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,284

No, no, no!

689
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:13,655

01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:30,508

697
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,461
It sees you as a breeding tool.

698
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,095
That thing isn't
your brother anymore.

699
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:34,035

714
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:33,135
I know what Leon would do.

715
01:13:36,717 --> 01:13:37,979

716
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:46,290

All right, Curtis.

734
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,671

740
01:17:24,578 --> 01:17:26,239
...the hole will close.

741
01:17:58,878 --> 01:18:00,436
Let me go.

742
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:05,784
Let go of me, damn it,
or you'll fall too.

743
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:08,454
You can't die.
You have to destroy these viruses.

744
01:18:10,991 --> 01:18:13,983
Please, Leon, don't try to save me.

745
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:18,221
If you don't try to save one life,
you'll never save any.

746
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:28,704
Isn't that right, Curtis?

747
01:20:19,853 --> 01:20:21,616
Are you okay?

748
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:02,617
It recorded.

749
01:22:36,923 --> 01:22:38,584
Where's Frederic?

750
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:41,954
Dead. No vaccine data, no nothing.

751
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:44,026
The same as Raccoon City.

752
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:45,690
What?

753
01:22:46,499 --> 01:22:47,488
Frederic said it.

754
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,793
You couldn't convince countries
to invest...

755
01:22:50,003 --> 01:22:52,904
...in the development of the
insufficiently researched G-virus.

756
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:55,074
What are you talking about?

757
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:59,109
At first, I didn't suspect you were
connected with this terrorism.

758
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:03,408
If for no other reason than you were
in the airport when the event occurred.

759
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:06,814
But you had a motive
for causing all this.

760
01:23:07,487 --> 01:23:08,476
Stocks.

761
01:23:10,089 --> 01:23:13,684
WilPharma stock tanked
because of our accusations.

762
01:23:13,893 --> 01:23:16,020
You were afraid that the situation...

763
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:19,062
...would turn out the same
as it did for Umbrella Corporation.

764
01:23:19,265 --> 01:23:21,790
So you needed an excuse
to use the vaccine.

765
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:23,901
Now, wait a minute.

766
01:23:24,103 --> 01:23:26,003
Yes, I'm a stockholder.

767
01:23:26,205 --> 01:23:30,198
And WilPharma should regain
the public's faith after this incident.

768
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:34,710
But there's no way in hell I would
support terrorism to ensure that.

769
01:23:34,914 --> 01:23:38,441
First of all, what is the G-virus?
I've never even heard of it.

770
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:42,109
I know you ordered Frederic
to dispose of the G-virus...

771
01:23:42,322 --> 01:23:43,448
...when you called him.

772
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,817
I told him
not to show you anything more...

773
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:48,459
...then you needed to see,
that was it.

774
01:23:48,661 --> 01:23:50,390
I doubt he knows anything.

775
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:51,955
Leon.

776
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,224
General Grande's
communication man talked.

777
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:58,894
It seems that all of us, the senator
included, were fooled by him.

778
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:01,903
Who are you talking about?

779
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:13,450
<i>- Frederic? Where are you?
- In Level 4.</i>

780
01:24:13,653 --> 01:24:15,814
Why? You said you were
going to the server room.

781
01:24:16,022 --> 01:24:18,650
<i>I saw someone suspicious
on my way there and followed him.</i>

782
01:24:18,858 --> 01:24:19,847
<i>You need to get out.</i>

783
01:24:20,059 --> 01:24:22,425
<i>There's a time bomb here.
It's too late to stop it.</i>

784
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:31,164
<i>We'll have another biohazard
if this thing...</i>

785
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:36,868
It can't be.

786
01:24:39,312 --> 01:24:40,574
It's me.

787
01:24:41,047 --> 01:24:43,038
What do you think?

788
01:24:43,249 --> 01:24:46,776
Yes, per your request.

789
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:50,386
As of now, General Grande...

790
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,251
...only you will be in possession...

791
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:55,894
...of a set
of the T-virus and the T-vaccine.

792
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:59,223
Nothing would offer greater
advantage when negotiating...

793
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:04,062
...with a country that wants to keep
the existence of this virus a secret.

794
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:13,779
You needn't worry.

795
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,540
I've anticipated everything
down to the last detail...

796
01:25:16,749 --> 01:25:20,048
...including my own
escape arrangements.

797
01:25:21,721 --> 01:25:23,086
Don't forget...

798
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:27,316
...you owe me extra money
for the data on the G-virus.

799
01:25:28,261 --> 01:25:29,990
And one last thing:

800
01:25:30,196 --> 01:25:31,720
As a friend...

801
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:35,458
...heed my advice
and forget about G.

802
01:25:35,668 --> 01:25:39,832
The stuff is wickedly volatile,
and it can't be controlled.

803
01:25:46,713 --> 01:25:49,477
Right on time.

804
01:25:59,592 --> 01:26:01,457
You were supposed to come alone.

805
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,687
I just wanted to see your face
one more time.

806
01:26:08,334 --> 01:26:10,097
Don't move.

807
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:12,931
I have the last of the vaccine,
and the development data.

808
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:15,630
This is all that remains
in the entire world.

809
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:17,639
The rest is gone.

810
01:26:20,913 --> 01:26:23,313
Yes, that's right.

811
01:26:23,516 --> 01:26:26,508
You two can appreciate the situation
better than anyone...

812
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:32,123
...after your up-close-and-personal
experiences with virus victims.

813
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:35,723
Mankind will need this.

814
01:26:45,605 --> 01:26:48,335
Wait. Please. Don't shoot me.
Let's talk.

815
01:26:48,941 --> 01:26:51,535
You're a smart woman,
and smart women like money.

816
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:55,236
I can make you rich.
We'll split everything 50-50.

817
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:58,645
I meant 70-30. I'm happy with 30.

818
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,944
Please. Please, take it all.

819
01:27:01,154 --> 01:27:05,955
Don't... Don't kill me.
I'm begging you. Please, no.

820
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:11,993
You're too pathetic to kill.

821
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,203
- All units, move in.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:25,604
Suspect has been apprehended
and is in custody.

823
01:28:09,755 --> 01:28:12,349
Frederic confessed everything.

824
01:28:15,094 --> 01:28:19,292
He was also the one that provided
the T-virus to the terrorists in India.

825
01:28:19,498 --> 01:28:22,831
He even acted
as the black-market broker.

826
01:28:25,571 --> 01:28:27,334
He stole the T- and G-viruses...

827
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,475
...then escaped right before
the Raccoon City disaster.

828
01:28:30,676 --> 01:28:35,045
But Frederic decided he could
only sell them as a set with a vaccine.

829
01:28:35,248 --> 01:28:37,307
So he erased his past...

830
01:28:37,516 --> 01:28:39,211
...found employment
at WilPharma...

831
01:28:39,418 --> 01:28:43,684
...and gained unrestricted access
to their research facilities.

832
01:28:44,056 --> 01:28:46,820
He had the luxury of searching
for potential customers...

833
01:28:47,026 --> 01:28:49,517
...while manufacturing the vaccine.

834
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:52,925
This is how he stumbled upon
General Grande.

835
01:28:53,132 --> 01:28:55,225
The terrorist incidents
were demonstrations...

836
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:57,732
...staged for
General Grande's benefit.

837
01:28:57,937 --> 01:28:59,097
Sort of a...

838
01:28:59,305 --> 01:29:01,967
...twisted sales pitch.

839
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:07,141
And my brother
was just a tool to them.

840
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:10,944
He was used.

841
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:15,078
This doesn't absolve Curtis
of what he did.

842
01:29:15,288 --> 01:29:17,813
But we share
something in common with him...

843
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:19,787
...and that's his passionate desire...

844
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:23,587
...to prevent any further tragedies
like Raccoon City.

845
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:55,150
I got to go.

846
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:57,524
All right.

847
01:29:58,764 --> 01:30:00,664
Catch you later.

848
01:30:06,672 --> 01:30:08,572
Leon.

849
01:30:12,244 --> 01:30:15,907
Let's go diving together again...

850
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:17,514
...sometime.

851
01:30:18,351 --> 01:30:20,080
Love to.

852
01:30:32,732 --> 01:30:35,292
When did you two go diving?

853
01:30:35,801 --> 01:30:36,995
Don't worry about that.

854
01:30:37,203 --> 01:30:39,967
More importantly,
what are you up to?

855
01:30:40,172 --> 01:30:42,163
Need a lift?

856
01:30:42,808 --> 01:30:45,572
I have a limousine waiting.

857
01:30:45,778 --> 01:30:47,143
Claire.

858
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,244
Next time
we bump into each other...

859
01:30:53,452 --> 01:30:55,249
...let's hope it's some place...

860
01:30:55,454 --> 01:30:58,287
...a little more normal.

861
01:31:00,059 --> 01:31:01,924
Definitely.

862
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:05,156
Until next time.

863
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:42,824
<i>Senator Ron Davis
announced his resignation...</i>

864
01:31:43,035 --> 01:31:46,402
<i>... after being accused of insider
trading with WilPharma stock...</i>

865
01:31:46,605 --> 01:31:50,132
<i>... a company of which
he is a major stockholder.</i>

866
01:31:53,879 --> 01:31:55,847
<i>Next, in international news:</i>

867
01:31:56,048 --> 01:31:59,449
<i>General Miguel Grande
has suddenly decided to participate...</i>

868
01:31:59,652 --> 01:32:01,779
<i>... in a Central Asian
disarmament conference.</i>

869
01:32:01,987 --> 01:32:05,980
<i>But the real motivation behind
his participation is not yet known.</i>

870
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:09,855
<i>Government sources seem to be
optimistic about the turnaround...</i>

871
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:13,088
<i>... and say that it is to alleviate
economic blockades...</i>

872
01:32:13,299 --> 01:32:15,233
<i>... while rumours state
that it is because...</i>

873
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:19,165
<i>... his ability to produce biological
weapons has been removed.</i>
