<i>The high-altitude, low-opening jump, the
HALO, is where we get the most fatalities.</i>

01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,004
<i>Next, after the free fall, pop the chute
at 200 feet below the Chinese radar.</i>

602
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,134
<i>You'll be traveling over 200mph.

cut away your chute.</i>

605

- I've got no choice, Wade.</i>

608
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,109
<i>I have to prove
