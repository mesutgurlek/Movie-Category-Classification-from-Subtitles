I couldn't possibly go...

Hey, Luke, thanks.</i>

520

<i>Thanks for coming

00:37:30,354 --> 00:37:32,523
We're going

531
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:52,102
And now I sense
you wish to continue...

your search for
young Skywalker.

<i>In time,
he will seek you out.</i>

536
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,034
And when he does...

537
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,037
you must bring him
before me.

538
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,414
He has grown strong.

539
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:15,584
Only together
can we turn him...

540

to the dark side
of the Force.

00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,668
Look I so old
to young eyes?

547
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,004
No, of course not.

Yes, I do.

Master Yoda,
you can't die.

Strong am I
with the Force...

561
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:47,676
but not that strong.

Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

the way of the Force.

But I need your help.

566
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,826
I've come back to
complete the training.

567
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:15,788
No more training
do you require.

568
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:19,291
Already know you
that which you need.

569
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:23,796
Then I am a Jedi.

570
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,339
Oh!

571
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:30,302
[Laughs, Coughs]

572
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:32,346
Not yet.

573
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:34,807
One thing remains...

574
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:36,308
Vader.

575
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:39,979
You must confront Vader.

576
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:44,942
Then, only then,
a Jedi will you be.

577
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,696
And confront him
you will.

578
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:54,577
Master Yoda...

579
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:00,875
is Darth Vader
my father?

580
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,297
Rest I need.

581
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:07,840
Yes.

582
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,300
Rest.

583
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:13,304
Yoda, I must know.

584
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:20,436
Your father he is.

585
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:27,818
Told you, did he?

586
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:32,364
Yes.

587
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:35,868
Unexpected this is.

588
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:39,955
And unfortunate.

589
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,542
Unfortunate that
I know the truth?

590
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,169
No.

591
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,884
Unfortunate that you
rushed to face him...

592
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:55,554
that incomplete
was your training...

593
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,850
that not ready for
the burden were you.

594
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,687
I'm sorry.

595
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:05,064
Remember...

596
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:10,027
a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

597
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:16,283
But beware...

598
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:18,536
Anger, fear...

599
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:19,954
aggression...

600
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,165
the dark side are they.

601
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:27,294
Once you start
down the dark path...

602
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:31,674
forever will it
dominate your destiny.

603

Luke...

604
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:37,596
Luke...

605
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:40,516
do not...

606
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:48,649
do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

607
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:52,695
or suffer your
father's fate you will.

608
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:56,240
Luke...

609
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:59,493

Why didn't you

You told me Vader...

627
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:07,621
betrayed and murdered my father.

<i>Your father was seduced by

<i>He ceased to be

<i>from a certain

<i>Anakin was
a good friend.</i>

<i>When I first knew him...</i>

641
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:45,826
<i>your father was
already a great pilot...</i>

642

<i>but I was amazed how strongly

<i>I took it upon myself

<i>You were our only hope.</i>

<i>if Anakin were

<i>That is the reason...</i>

00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:17,668
<i>but they could be made
to serve the emperor.</i>

671
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:42,067
Well, look at you...
a general, huh?

672
00:48:42,193 --> 00:48:44,820
Someone must have told them
about my little maneuver...

673
00:48:44,904 --> 00:48:45,988
at the Battle of Tanaab.

674
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,323
Well, don't look at me, pal.

675
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:48,824
I just said
you were a fair pilot.

676
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:50,326
I didn't know they were
looking for somebody...

677
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,077
to lead
this crazy attack.

678
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,371
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

679
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:57,583
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

680
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,211
You're the respectable
one, remember?

681
00:49:00,336 --> 00:49:02,922
[Chimes]

682
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:08,427
The emperor's
made a critical error...

683
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:10,387
and the time for our attack
has come.

684
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:12,765
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies...

685
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,767
pinpoint the exact location...

686
00:49:14,892 --> 00:49:17,353
of the emperor's
new battle station.

687
00:49:17,436 --> 00:49:19,772
We also know that the weapon systems
of this Death Star...

688
00:49:19,897 --> 00:49:21,607
are not yet operational.

689
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:23,067
With the imperial fleet...

690
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,610
spread throughout
the galaxy...

691
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,278
in a vain effort
to engage us...

692
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:28,364
it is relatively
unprotected.

693
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:30,991
But most important of all...

694
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:33,285
we've learned
that the emperor himself...

695
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,788
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

696
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:38,207
of the construction
of this Death Star.

697
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:44,463
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

698
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:45,923
Admiral Ackbar, please.

699
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:49,343
You can see here
the Death Star...

700
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:52,638
orbiting the forest moon
of Endor.

701
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:56,308
Although the weapon systems
on this Death Star...

702
00:49:56,433 --> 00:49:57,601
are not yet operational...

703
00:49:57,685 --> 00:50:01,897
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.

704
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:05,025
It is protected
by an energy shield...

705
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:06,610
which is generated...

706
00:50:06,694 --> 00:50:09,238
from the nearby forest moon
of Endor.

707
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,743
The shield
must be deactivated...

708
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:18,622
if any attack
is to be attempted.

709
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:21,250
Once the shield is down...

710
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,961
our cruisers
will create a perimeter...

711
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,964
while the fighters fly
into the superstructure...

712
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:31,093
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

713
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:35,973
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

714
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:37,349
Good luck.

715
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:40,936
You're going
to need it.

716
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:43,105
General Madine.

717
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:46,775
We have stolen
a small imperial shuttle.

718
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,819
Disguised as a cargo ship...

719
00:50:48,944 --> 00:50:51,113
and using
a secret imperial code...

720
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:54,158
a strike team
will land on the moon...

721
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:55,993
and deactivate
the shield generator.

722
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,369
[C-3PO]
Sounds dangerous.

723
00:50:57,494 --> 00:50:59,830
I wonder who they found
to pull that off.

724
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:02,958
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

725
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:04,460
Uh, my team's ready.

726
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:07,004
I don't have a command crew
for the shuttle.

727

Arrr!

728
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,216
It's going to be rough, pal.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

729

I'm with you, too.

1165
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:15,145
I have to try.

1166
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:35,624
Hey, what's going on?

1167
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,501
Nothing.

1168
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:42,006
I just want to be alone
for a little while.

1169
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:44,008
Nothing?

1170
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,593
Come on, tell me.

1171
01:21:45,676 --> 01:21:47,386
What's going on?

1172
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:52,892
I...

1173
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:54,727
I can't tell you.

1174
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:56,729
Could you tell Luke?

1175
01:21:56,854 --> 01:21:59,690
Is that
who you could tell?

1176
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:01,734
I...

1177
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:03,194
Ah.

1178
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:17,708
I'm sorry.

1179
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,214
Hold me.

1180
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:19,061
This is the rebel
that surrendered to us.

1181
01:23:19,186 --> 01:23:21,438
Although he denies it, I believe
there may be more of them...

1182
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:24,942
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

1183
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:27,736
He was armed
only with this.

1184
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:32,449
Good work, Commander.

1185
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,076
Leave us.

1186
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,078
Conduct your search...

1187
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:39,623
and bring
his companions to me.

1188
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,125
Yes, my lord.

1189
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:45,462
The emperor
has been expecting you.

1190
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:48,257
I know, Father.

1191
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:52,094
So, you have accepted the truth.

1192
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:53,804
I've accepted the truth...

1193
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:56,807
that you were once
Anakin Skywalker, my father.

1194
01:23:56,891 --> 01:24:00,102
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

1195
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:03,647
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

1196
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,108
I know there is good
in you.

1197
01:24:06,192 --> 01:24:09,528
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

1198
01:24:10,905 --> 01:24:14,283
That was why you
couldn't destroy me.

1199
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:19,288
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

1200
01:24:24,376 --> 01:24:28,881
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

1201
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,471
Your skills are complete.

1202
01:24:40,518 --> 01:24:42,394
<i>Indeed you are powerful...</i>

1203
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,314
as the emperor has foreseen.

1204
01:24:49,443 --> 01:24:51,320
Come with me.

1205
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:57,368
Obi-Wan once thought
as you do.

1206
01:24:57,451 --> 01:25:02,665
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

1207
01:25:02,748 --> 01:25:04,834
<i>I must obey my master.</i>

1208
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:07,670
I will not turn...

1209
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,422
and you'll be forced to kill me.

1210
01:25:10,548 --> 01:25:14,385
If that is your destiny.

1211
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,512
Search your feelings, Father.

1212
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:18,013
You can't do this.

1213
01:25:18,097 --> 01:25:19,640
I feel the conflict within you.

1214
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:21,058
Let go of your hate.

1215
01:25:21,183 --> 01:25:25,604
It is too late for me, son.

1216
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:30,401
The emperor will show you...

1217
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,279
the true nature of the Force.

1218
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:36,323
He is your master now.

1219
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:42,997
Then my father is truly dead.

1220
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:09,773
Urrr.

1221
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,791
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

1222
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:30,586
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

1223
01:26:30,669 --> 01:26:32,671
This isn't going
to be easy.

1224
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:34,173
Hey, don't worry.

1225
01:26:34,298 --> 01:26:37,009
Chewie and me got into
a lot of places...

1226
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:38,302
more heavily guarded
than this.

1227
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:41,180
[Speaking Ewokese]

1228

[Speaking Ewokese]

1229
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:47,520
[Leia]
What's he saying?

1230
01:26:47,645 --> 01:26:49,522
He says
there's a secret entrance...

1231
01:26:49,647 --> 01:26:51,857
on the other side
of the ridge.

1232
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,628
Admiral, we're in position.

1233
01:27:12,753 --> 01:27:14,338
All fighters accounted for.

1234
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:17,800
Proceed with the countdown.

1235
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:20,845
All groups
assume attack coordinates.

1236
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,805
[Speaking Alien Language]

1237
01:27:22,888 --> 01:27:26,183
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

1238
01:27:26,308 --> 01:27:29,186
He'll have that shield down on time.

1239
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:30,688
[Speaking Alien Language]

1240
01:27:30,813 --> 01:27:35,234
Or this will be
the shortest offensive of all time.

1241
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,989
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

1242
01:27:40,114 --> 01:27:41,991
All right. Stand by.

1243
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:54,003
[Whistle]

1244
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,719
[Speaking Ewokese]

1245
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:04,221
Back door, huh?
Good idea.

1246
01:28:04,305 --> 01:28:06,515

1247
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,186
[Speaking Ewokese]

1248
01:28:10,269 --> 01:28:12,146
It's only
a few guards.

1249
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:15,191
This shouldn't be
too much trouble.

1250
01:28:15,274 --> 01:28:18,110
[Speaking Ewokese]

1251
01:28:18,235 --> 01:28:20,196
[Speaking Ewokese]

1252
01:28:20,321 --> 01:28:23,699
It only takes one
to sound the alarm.

1253
01:28:23,782 --> 01:28:25,784
Then we'll do it
real quiet like.

1254
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,370
Oh, my!
Princess Leia!

1255
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:31,373
I'm afraid
our furry companion...

1256
01:28:31,457 --> 01:28:33,792
has gone and done
something rather rash.

1257
01:28:33,918 --> 01:28:35,753
Rrrrooohh.

1258
01:28:35,836 --> 01:28:37,713
Oh, no.

1259
01:28:37,796 --> 01:28:40,841
[Han] There goes our
surprise attack.

1260
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:48,432
[Starts Engine]

1261
01:28:48,557 --> 01:28:50,809
Look, over there!
Stop him!

1262
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:03,531
Not bad for
a little furball.

1263
01:29:03,614 --> 01:29:05,115
There's only one left.

1264
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,617
You stay here.

1265
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,327
We'll take care of this.

1266
01:29:08,452 --> 01:29:09,912
I have decided...

1267
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:12,665
that we shall
stay here.

1268
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,583
Whoo-whoo!

1269
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:15,501
Yahoo!

1270
01:29:19,964 --> 01:29:21,423
Whoo whoo!

1271
01:29:24,093 --> 01:29:26,595
Wa ha ha ha!

1272
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,815
Wa ha ha ha!

1273
01:29:42,403 --> 01:29:43,529
Hey!

1274
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,829
Yoooaww!

1275
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:54,415
Ooohm.

1276
01:30:47,134 --> 01:30:50,221
Welcome, young Skywalker.

1277
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:53,474
I have been expecting you.

1278
01:30:53,557 --> 01:30:55,935
You'll no longer need those.

1279
01:31:01,106 --> 01:31:03,609
Guards, leave us.

1280
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:14,620
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

1281
01:31:14,745 --> 01:31:19,375
In time,
you will call me master.

1282
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,961
You're gravely mistaken.

1283
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:24,213
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

1284
01:31:24,338 --> 01:31:28,634
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

1285
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:35,307
<i>You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...</i>

1286
01:31:36,392 --> 01:31:40,604
about a great many things.

1287
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:43,065
[Vader]
His lightsaber.

1288
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:47,736
Ah, yes. A Jedis weapon.

1289
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:50,406
Much like your father's.

1290
01:31:50,531 --> 01:31:52,074
By now you must know...

1291
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:53,909
your father
can never be turned...

1292
01:31:53,993 --> 01:31:56,036
from the dark side.

1293
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:59,039
So will it be with you.

1294
01:31:59,123 --> 01:32:00,499
You're wrong.

1295
01:32:00,624 --> 01:32:04,253
Soon I'll be dead,
and you with me.

1296
01:32:04,336 --> 01:32:06,297
Ha ha ha ha!

1297
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:09,800
Perhaps you refer
to the imminent attack...

1298
01:32:09,884 --> 01:32:11,969
of your rebel fleet.

1299
01:32:12,094 --> 01:32:14,263
Yes.

1300
01:32:14,346 --> 01:32:16,307
I assure you...

1301
01:32:16,432 --> 01:32:20,519
we are quite safe
from your friends here.

1302
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:23,522
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

1303
01:32:23,647 --> 01:32:27,943
Your faith
in your friends is yours.

1304
01:32:28,027 --> 01:32:32,948
[Vader]
It is pointless to resist, my son.

1305
01:32:36,785 --> 01:32:38,662
Everything that has transpired...

1306
01:32:38,746 --> 01:32:42,166
has done so
according to my design.

1307
01:32:42,249 --> 01:32:46,086
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

1308
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:51,217
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

1309
01:32:51,342 --> 01:32:54,553
It was I
who allowed the Alliance...

1310
01:32:54,678 --> 01:32:58,599
to know the location
of the shield generator.

1311
01:32:58,682 --> 01:33:02,353
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

1312
01:33:02,478 --> 01:33:06,732
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

1313
01:33:06,857 --> 01:33:08,567
Oh...

1314
01:33:08,692 --> 01:33:12,571
I'm afraid
the deflector shield...

1315
01:33:12,696 --> 01:33:18,369
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

1316
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:25,501
All right, up!
Move! Come on.

1317
01:33:25,626 --> 01:33:27,086
Quickly. Quickly.

1318
01:33:27,211 --> 01:33:28,379

1319
01:33:28,504 --> 01:33:29,880
Grr!

Han, hurry!

1321
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:35,511
The fleet will
be here any moment.

1322
01:33:35,594 --> 01:33:38,556
Charges!
Come on, come on!

1323
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:42,518
Oh, my!
They'll be captured!
