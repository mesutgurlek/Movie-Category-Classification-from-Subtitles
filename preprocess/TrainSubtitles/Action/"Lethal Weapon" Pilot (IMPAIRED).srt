171
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,599
as much as the next guy.

172
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,518
What...?

173
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,305
This is the most uncomfortable
chair I've ever sat in.

174
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,724
It's very expensive, don't break it.

175
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,059
(laughs)

176
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,727
Well, since I have you back,
I got you a new partner.

177
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,229
He's a lateral transfer from Texas.

178
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:43,814
Worked Homicide and Vice.

179
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,315
Name's Martin Riggs.

180
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,650
Also a Navy SEAL war hero.

181
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,201
Look, it's my first day back.

182
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,820
I don't want to have to babysit

183
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:52,072
some adrenaline junkie with PTSD.

184
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,457
Just show him around.

185
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,908
This came from the city attorney
personally.

186
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,460
(knocking on door)

187
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,236
We got a bank robbery downtown

188
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,212
We have hostages.

189
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,965
Hey. Welcome back, Murtaugh.

190
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,216
Thought you were dead.

191
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,669
Not yet.

192
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,888
- Get on the floor, now!
- (screaming)

193
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,556
Now!

194
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,808
(siren whoops)

195
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:13,260
Adrian, what's up?

196
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:15,717
Three armed suspects inside,
about 20 hostages,

197
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,384
and they beat up
a security guard pretty bad.

198
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,417
- Anybody talk to them yet?
- ‭ADRIAN: They said something about

199
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,234
- wanting a helicopter.
- Yeah, good luck with that.

200
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,736
- Let me get you...
- ‭RIGGS: We should probably

201
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,158
get the element of surprise.

202
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,120
- Excuse me.
- Look, I'm not trying to

203
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:26,415
tell you how to do your job, right?

204
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:28,335
I'm just saying it's not exactly
Ocean's Eleven in there.

205
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,866
Hey, could you get this guy out of here?

206
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,366
Sorry, I didn't...

207
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,869
- (gunfire)
- Where's our chopper?!

208
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:35,370
Okay, we got shots fired.

209
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,098
Set up mobile command around the block.

210
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:37,988
Let's go!

211
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:39,216
All right, Murtaugh.

212
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,009
First day back, baby.

213
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,377
- (beeping rapidly)
- All right.

214
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:44,212
(exhaling)

215
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,078
- (Riggs whistling)
- Hey, we got a...

216
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:49,430
we got a civilian
walking towards the bank!

217
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,857
- Someone stop him!
- He's not a civilian; he's a cop.

218
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,022
New guy. Name's Riggs or something.

219
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,258
Martin Riggs?

220
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:57,709

I brought some gifts.

228
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,511
Look, I wasn't sure what everyone liked,

229

We want a chopper!

Look, I'm new to the area,

234
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:23,520
uh, but it seems like you picked

235
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,855
a pretty busy intersection for that.

236
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,857
I'm not sure where
you'd set a chopper down.

237
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:27,942
Is this funny to you?

00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,360
No, not at all.

I just... I think you guys
are in over your head.

they're never gonna take you seriously.

Unless...

243
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,036
Unless what?!

244
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,568
You off someone.

Murtaugh's new partner.

247
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:46,561
Teach him that?

248
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,212
I just met that man, okay?

249
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,932
This kind of crazy
takes years to develop.

What is going on in there?

Hey, Doc.

252
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,468
Murtaugh's new partner just
told them to kill a hostage.

253
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,519
RIGGS: And it can't just be anyone.

254
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,604
You know, they can't be old

255
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:57,972
or unattractive

256
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,224
and, to be frank...
and I hate saying this...

257
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,976
but white's better.

258
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,495
I'm sorry, it's true, though, right?

259
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:04,755
More publicity.

260
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,897
Maybe we should just off you!

261
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,649
Ooh! Offing a cop.

262
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,118
Now that would definitely
get their attention.

263
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:12,786
Although, I don't think you guys
have the sack for that.

Oh, yeah?

00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,211
or nobody does!

268
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,914
What the hell is he thinking?

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
He's gonna get himself killed.

270
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,719

We're gonna do this.

Move, move, move!

284
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,336
Move it up, move it up.

285
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,922
Three.

286
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,929

Spread out, spread out!

(hostages shouting)

290
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,887
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

291
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,138
They got a bomb!

292
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,606
(panicked shouting)

00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,155
Martin Riggs.

297
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,373

Bet you saw some pretty intense stuff.

301
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,515
Well, that's all classified.

302
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,649
I wish I could talk about that,
though, you know?

303
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,795
But also, you never know
who's listening.

304
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,771
Oh, I don't think you're paranoid.

305
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,933
I think you're in pain.

306
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,010
I'm very familiar with this game.

307
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,445
What you don't talk about
can't hurt, right?

308
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,046
But I'm the one

309
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,785
who I.A. is going to ask
if you're field ready,

310
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,668
so you're gonna have to.

311
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,537
I'm an open book.

312
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:21,978
What would you like to discuss?

313
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,257
How about your wife?

314
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:27,594
Next question.

315
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,763
Okay, but they don't get any easier.

316
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:30,973
Let's try.

317
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,799
Do you want to die?

318
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,553
MURTAUGH: The man wants to die!

319
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:37,971
Which is fine, his business,

320
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,139
but if it was up to me,

321
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,357
I'd lock him in a padded white room.

322
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:43,276
But that's not my area of expertise.

323
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:46,146
What is my domain is sustaining the life

324
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,481
of one Roger Mayfield Murtaugh!

325
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,449
- (watch beeping rapidly)
- Calm down.

326
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:50,533
That thing's gonna explode.

00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,786
- (beeping stops)
- I.A. is investigating.

328
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,120
But he'll probably be cleared,

329
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,538
since the shots were fired
from the suspect's weapon.

330
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:56,873
You're not seriously considering

331
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,957
putting that man back in the field.

332
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,375
It came from upstairs.

333

335

Sure, Murtaugh can give you a ride.

339
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,713

340

"Dead on arrival."

341
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,084
Does it mean something different here?

342
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,145
I just want to make sure

343

there's no one else left
for you to kill.

344

Just you and me.

345
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,457
Besides, I.A. confiscated my weapon

346
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,508
until I'm cleared from the bank,

347
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,793
so if we gotta kill somebody,

348
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:27,878

Gunshot wound to the right temple,

360
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,010
appears self-inflicted.

361
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,562
Residue on his right hand

362
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,147
consistent with the .22
found by his side.

363
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,315
Looks like suicide.

364
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,634
He served. ‭Yeah.

365
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,186
He was actually a SEAL.

366
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,437
'06 through '11.

367
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:05,989
He also has scarring on his wrists.

368
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,491
Might not have been his first attempt.

369
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,943
MURTAUGH: Hmm.

370
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,661
Okay. Well, I think we have

371
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:12,996
a pretty clear picture of what happened.

372
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,948
I'll go fill out some paperwork.

373

RIGGS: How'd he get here?

374

No car, no bike, no bus stop.

375
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,088
Maybe he walked.

376
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,791
He's got silt on
the bottom of his boots.

377

If he'd've walked, it would've come off.

There's none of that around here.

379
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:28,461
Maybe he Ubered.

Come on, seems like a pain
in the ass, don't you think?

382
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:32,933
Wouldn't you just go bang at home?

383
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,218
I wouldn't know.

384
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,687
Lucky you.

385
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,889
Take the body to the morgue.

386

Push his autopsy
to the front of the line.

387

Hey, hey. What are you doing?

388
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,694
This man served his country.

389
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,399
I'm gonna give him
a proper investigation.

390
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,821
(sniffles quietly)

391
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,491
We are very sorry about your loss,
Mrs. Alvarez.

392
00:14:58,543 --> 00:14:59,876
He didn't do this.

393
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,386
Do you understand me?

394
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:04,247
Ma'am, we're exploring
all possibilities.

395
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,082
That's why we're here.

396
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,134
We noticed some scarring

397
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,895
on your husband's wrists.

398
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:11,838
That was a long time ago,

399
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,424
when he first got home from the war.

400
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,842
One day, I came home

401
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:18,428
early from work, and I found him.

402
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,262
In the tub.

403
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,901
But then everything changed.

404
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,631
How so?

405
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,178
MRS. ALVAREZ: He found this new job,

406
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:30,407
working security
down at the Port of L.A.

407
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:33,193
He was exercising, he stopped taking

408
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,112
his anti-anxiety medicine, Klonopin.

409
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,865
I think he felt like a soldier again.

410
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:41,668
Mrs. Alvarez,

411
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:44,004
were you guys going somewhere?

412
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,288
(sighs)

413
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,506
Yeah.

414
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,729
Ramon wanted us to start over.

415
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,260
He found us a big house

416
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,846
in Arizona.

417
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,047
When were you leaving?

418
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:57,217
Next week.

419
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:06,393
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Alvarez.

420
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,817
Lefty, huh?

421
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,504
This your dad's?

422
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,991
You guys play?

423
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,293
We'd play catch sometimes.

424
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:24,911
Always seemed to make him happy.

425
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,955
I certainly understand killing yourself

426
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,573
once you've moved to Arizona

427
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,076
but seems a little aggressive
to do it the week before, no?

428
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,028
If you were gonna kill yourself,

429
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,402
how would you do it?

430
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,562
Hypothetically.

431
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,902
Pills seem nice, you know?

432
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,237
Drift off, fall asleep.

433
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,571
Then, of course,
some idiot pumps your stomach,

434
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:48,739
you wake up, you're in the hospital,

435
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:49,844
you gotta go to work the next day,

436
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,885
everybody knows about it,
that's humiliating.

437
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,386
I have heard really nice things

438
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,971
about drowning, though, you know?
‭No, no, no.

439
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,641
If you were going to shoot yourself,

440
00:16:58,429 --> 00:16:59,595
how would you do it?

441
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,541
May I?

442
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:09,152
Come on. I'm not gonna
do it here, I promise.

443
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:22,699
First, I'd swing by Home Depot.

444
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,367
Pick up a nice,
polyethylene plastic sheet,

445
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,753
lay it out nice and neat
so as not to make a mess.

446
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,789
Then I'd take my final,
last shot of Jonathan Daniel's,

447
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,708
leave the instructions for my internment

448
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:34,711
and a nice $6,500 check
for burial costs.

449
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,013
Actually, things are
more expensive out here.

450
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,048
I might need to look into that.

451
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,850
My point was,

452
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,385
you'd use your dominant hand.

453
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,856
So why would Alvarez

454
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,691
shoot himself with his right hand

455
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,025
if he was lefty?

456
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,228
Maybe he didn't.

00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:23,302
I'm gonna go talk to him. Maybe
we know some of the same people.

500
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,087
Hey, I haven't given
police permission to question

501
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,722
- my employees.
- ‭Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, chico.

502
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,974
You don't want us coming
back here with warrants

503
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,484
and looking through all your cargo.

504
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:32,704
Hey!

505
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,071
Amigo!

506
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:37,599
Look, I want to talk to you
about Ramon Alvarez.

507
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,568
Hey, look, I know you didn't kill him;

508
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:40,772
if you did, he wouldn't
have a head, right?

509
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:43,772
¿No habla inglés?

510
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,310

(grunting)

512
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:50,496
Let him go! Now!

513
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:51,613
It's okay, guys.

514
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:53,949
I'm a cop.

515
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,227
Nothing?

516
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:58,398
Look, I don't have a badge

517
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,584
or a gun or anything, you know.

518
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,981

which I associated with
a cartel in Juarez.

630
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,861
Right, so he questioned him.

631

00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,549
Well, when you say it
like that, it doesn't...

647
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,584
Fair enough.
I'll put someone else on this.

648

Per your request Murtaugh,
starting tomorrow,

649
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,004
both of you are reassigned.

650
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:21,785

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,018
I mean, we would've
made a terrible team.

654
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,153
Hey, look, look.

655
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,938
Nothing personal.

656
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:37,489
I'm just at a place in my life

657
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,907
where I don't want to
be the cowboy anymore.

658
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,409
Whatever gets you through the night.

what, and what does that mean?

00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:47,199
Come on, we were both there.

662
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,450
I saw you.

663
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,869
You were scared.

664
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,371
All right? You don't want to die.

665
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:55,090
No, I don't want to die.

666
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:56,344
Unlike you,

667
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,757
who tries to accomplish that
every second of the day.

668
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,929
Understand I am not trying to judge you.

669
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,527
All right? I get it.

670
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,700
Something happened to you, man,

671
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,191
and you snapped.

672
00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:07,692
You want to kill yourself?

673
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:09,271
Go home, put the little sheet down,

674
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,640
and get it done, but
don't you dare judge me

675
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,609
for wanting to stay alive.

676
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,651
Okay, Roger.

677
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,570
I still think you shouldn't
be out there, though.

678
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,075
Look, there's plenty of good people

679
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,643
in this world that aren't cops.

680
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,129
Go be one of them.

00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:50,813
first ones through the door...

684
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:53,649
but this dude is in a class by himself.

685
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,233
It's as if he's trying to die.

686
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:58,153
And then he has the temerity
to want to judge me.

687
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,438
Yeah, baby?

688
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:00,522
Calm down.

689

You are the bravest man I know.

Now...

691
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,780
I hope this isn't a ploy

692
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,498

No. (laughs)

No.

Your stress-relieving gift.

701
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:25,631

- ‭Yes.

Well, you get enough wine

Don't worry. I'll get it.

You keep drinking. Here.

708
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,980
(laughs) Go get the door.

709
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:42,870
So, uh...

710
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,038
I was at home, uh, thinking
about bullet entry wounds.

711
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,957
Sounds like a very pleasant evening.

712
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,209
And I was flipping
through the Alvarez file.

713
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:51,328
Traces of gunpowder on his temple.

714
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,413
That means he didn't have the
gun pressed against his head.

715
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,132
Seems like a weird way to kill yourself.

716
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,467
Mm-hmm. And?

717
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:00,470
So, anyway, um, you know,

718
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:02,089
I was wondering, you know, maybe,

719
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,423
you know, if you wanted to,

720
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,976
we could swing by
the, uh, coroner's office.

721
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:08,428
You sure you don't want a cop for that?

722
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:11,515
Look, maybe I was a little
out of line before.

723
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,100
All right, I get it.

724
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,234
You're too old for...

725
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,019
Hey, hey, hey, no.

726
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:19,439
I'm just as sharp as I've always been.

727
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:20,774
TRISH: Baby, who is it?

728
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:22,359
Uh, it's no... noth... no one.

729
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:23,360
Just, um...

730
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,412
Hi. Martin Riggs.

731
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:26,613
The guy that almost
got your husband killed.

732
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:27,914
I'm sure you've heard a lot about me.

733
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,846
Not a word. We're about to have dinner.

734
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,926
Would you like to come in, Martin Riggs?

735
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:31,702
No, he can't.

736
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,972
- He can't...
- Yeah, and I ate, like, a week ago,

737
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:35,038
- so, you know, I'm fine.
- TRISH: Oh.

738
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,540
- I mean, it smells great, but...
- (laughing): Oh.

739
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,542
- Tastes even better.
- Oh, okay.

740
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,807
My dad says you were in a war.

741
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,442
See any action?

742
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:56,393
(groans) Such a nerd.

743
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,529
Yeah, a little.

744
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,329
You know, I'm thinking
about enlisting, too.

745
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,282
No, you're not.

746
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,950
ROGER JR.: I want real-life experience.

747
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,152
What am I gonna learn at Princeton

748
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:06,165
that I couldn't learn from the Internet?

749
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,704
What it feels like to touch a live girl?

750
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,290
(laughs)

751
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,875
I think you should enlist.

752
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,126
Hell, I think there should be a draft.

753
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,245
But I suppose

754
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,080
it all depends on the life
experience you're after.

755
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,915
If you want to see your best
friend's head get blown off,

756
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,417
it's ideal.

757
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,335
But if you're just trying
to piss off your parents?

758
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,921
Hitchhiking through Thailand,
that be a little bit better.

759
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,911
See, Mom, that's exactly
what I'm talking about. Experience.

760
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,092
No, stop, we're not talking
about that right...

761
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:30,093
Why?

762
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,638
What's going on?

763
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,174
I don't like being out of the loop.

764
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:35,175
What's happening?

765
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,664
I had a teeny bit of weed.

766
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,995
- What?!
- And now Mom is losing her sh...

767
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,425
- No... watch it.
- ‭stuff.

768
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,332
Watch it. Losing her stuff.

769
00:28:41,357 --> 00:28:42,478
I'm really impressed
with the weed out here.

770
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:44,218
I mean, it's incredible, you know?

771
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,987
I mean, as far as I can tell,
it's really the only perk

772
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,572
to living in California.

773
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,807
I had massive, you know,
psychological issues.

774
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:59,476
So, of course, I would never,
uh, suggest that for a child.

775
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,011
What I would suggest, though,

776
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,679
maybe your old man
take a little hit off the tree.

777
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,431
You know what I mean? Little
bald-headed Coolio gets loose.

778
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,400
(laughter)

779
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,601
That's funny, huh?

780
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:08,936
I like being tight.

781
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:10,104
It keeps me alive.

782
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,189
Well, we can tell. Yeah.

783
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,825
So, Martin... do you have any kids?

784
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,663
Uh... no.

785
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:21,532
Um...

786
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:22,771
wasn't really in the cards.

787
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:24,451
- You know?
- Mm. But you're married?

788
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,756
Not anymore.

789
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,291
Not anymore, no.

790
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:33,127
MURTAUGH: Imagine that.

791
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,962
Let me guess.

792
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:37,097
You had an affair with your gun.
(laughs)

793
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,099
Nobody's laughing.

794
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,520
She passed away.

795
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:51,632
I'm sorry, Martin.

796
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,758
Ah, it's life, right?

797
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,534
Never ceases to surprise.

798
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:00,583
(baby crying)

799
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:01,792
It's the baby.

800
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:03,506
I'll get the baby.

801
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:05,457
(toy squeaking)

802
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:08,160
(grunting)

803
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:09,995
Bite!

804
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:11,046
Bite!

805
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,833
(baby laughs) Bite!

806
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,168
(squeaking)

807
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,877
What are you doing?

808
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,873
(growling playfully)

809
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:22,942
Nice family you got.

810
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:26,512
Yeah, they keep us on our toes.

811
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:28,179
And up all night.

812
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,399
Yeah, I noticed the slight...

813
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,518
The slight age difference, yeah.

814
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:34,820
What do you want?
It wasn't part of the plan.

815
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,071
Trish was 42.

816
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,189
The kids were out.

817
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:38,858
Nine months later, this one comes out.

818
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,577
She come... Boom, I'm here!

819
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:44,078
You can't deny me!

820
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:45,197
(laughs)

821
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:49,668
And then I have a heart attack
in the delivery room.

822
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:52,120
You were in the right place.

823
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:53,873
Anywhere else, they say
I wouldn't have made it.

824
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,291

Yeah, well, for the future,

wasn't directly against
his head when it was fired.

Nope.

851
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:10,816
Also the tox reports say he had

852
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,651
40 milligrams of Klonopin in his system.

853
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,486
Enough to kill him if the bullet
didn't get there first.

854

Didn't his wife say
he was off of that drug?

855

So someone had to know
the meds he was on,

so it didn't look like he'd been doped.

Look, I get it. You took the kid

975

because you thought
that his dad stole your heroin,

983
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,872
Ooh. Well, that's the one where

and then you up your profile from
small-time dealer to cop killer.

986
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,212
Then you spend the rest
of your life in prison

00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:00,463
or on the run... most likely, dead.
