158
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,232
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

159
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,153
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

160
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,515
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

161
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,399
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

162
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,120
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

163
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,874
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

164
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,316
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

165

I don't want to hear that shit!

166
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

167
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,516
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

168
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,399
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

169
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,951
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

170
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,473
How?

171
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,313
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

172
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,994
Not everyone believes what you believe.

173
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,151
My beliefs do not require them to.

174
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,754
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

175
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,559
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

176
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,553
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

177
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,757
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

178
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,832
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

179
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,153
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

180
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,550
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

181
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,429
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

182
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,239
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

187
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,473
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

188
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,029
The people must be told
what is happening.

189
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,838
Of course, councilor.

190

But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

191

- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

A panic is not what anyone wants.

193

What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

194
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,951
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councilor.

197
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,317
Consider that in the past six months...

198
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,436
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

199

This attack is an act of desperation.

will be fulfilled and this war will end.

I hope you're right, captain.

202
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,914
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councilor.

203
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,548
It is simply a matter of time.

Because of Morpheus.

Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

how can I make a choice?

468
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,159
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

469
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,757
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

470
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,913
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

471
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,068
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

472
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,959
I love candy.

473
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,839
But why help us?

474
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,356
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

475
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,838
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

476
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,039
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

477
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,550
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

478
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,280
Look. See those birds?

479
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,751
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

480
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,517
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

481
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,513
There are programs running
all over the place.

482
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,958
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

483
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,795
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

484
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,873
Well, you hear about them all the time.

485
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,193
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

486
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,070
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

487
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,631
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

488
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,030
...is the system assimilating
some program...

489
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,671
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

490
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,718
Programs hacking programs.

491
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,633
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

492
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,588
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

493
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,754
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

494
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,277
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

495
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,195
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

496
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,920
...or return to the source.

497
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,671
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

498
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,229
Where you must go.

499
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,439
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

500
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,279
...in your dreams, haven't you?

501
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,159
A door made of light?

502
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,710
What happens when you go through
the door?

503
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,638
I see Trinity...

504
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,837
...and something happens...

505
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,831
...something bad.

506
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,834
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

507
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,549
- Do you see her die?
- No.

508
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,232
You have the sight now, Neo.

509
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,278
You are looking at the world
without time.

510
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,749
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

511
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,515
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

512
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,717
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

513
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,589
No, you've already made the choice.

514
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,194
Now you have to understand it.

515
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,119
No.

516
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,397
I can't do that. I won't.

517
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,355
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

518
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,878
Because you're the One.

519
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,838
What if I can't?

520
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,911
What happens if I fail?

521
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,358
Then Zion will fall.

522
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,196
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

523
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,557
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

524
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,709
The Keymaker?

525
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,316
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

526
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,075
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

527
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,630
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

528
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,553
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

529
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,350
What do all men with power want?
More power.

I got nothing but bad news.

- Yeah.

- No.

Our connection.

546
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,360
I don't fully understand how it happened.

547
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,751
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

548
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,480
...something overwritten or copied.

549
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,234
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

550
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,358
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

551

And what reason is that?

552
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,348
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

554
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,156
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

555
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,072
...but it happened anyway.

I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

...compelled to disobey.

We're here because we are not free.

There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

Are there two among you

Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

Captain Soren?

- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

understand the reason.

634
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,836
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councilor's call.

635
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,150
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

636
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,229
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

637
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,228
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

638
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,389
Why?

639
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,757
Because some things
never change, Jason...

What can you see, Neo?

01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,670
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

643
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,353
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

Is that good for us or bad for us?

Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,159
Bad for us.

- Yes, of course. Who has time?

The question is,
do you know why you are here?

672
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,235
We are looking for the Keymaker.

673

Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,955
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

676
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:59,638
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

You are here
because you were sent here.

You were told to come here,

It is, of course, the way of all things.

- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

No. Wrong.

689
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,831
Choice is an illusion created

I wrote it myself.

698
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,312
It starts so simply...

699
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,871
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

Is it the wine? No.

What is it then? What is the reason?

01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,630
And soon it does not matter.

Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:52,913
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

710
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,318
And this is the nature of the universe.

711

We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

712

...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

Beneath our poised appearance...

714
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,794
...the truth is, we are completely...

715
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,313
...out of control.

716

Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

"Why" is what separates us from them...

...you from me.

720

Without it, you are powerless.
