1
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,951
<i>He slaughtered our men,</i>

2
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,382
<i>our brothers,</i>

3
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,343
<i>our sons.</i>

4
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:40,240
<i>But they cry out to us for justice.</i>

5
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,612
<i>For their souls, I swear to you</i>

6
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,803
<i>the man who took our loved ones from us,</i>

7
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:52,295
<i>the man who brought us such pain and sorrow,</i>

8
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,068
<i>we will punish him.</i>

9
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>We will bring him... here.</i>

10
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,710
<i>We'll not rest</i>

11
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:07,037
<i>until his blood flows into this very ground.</i>

12
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,129
<i>We will have our revenge.</i>

13
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,214
<i>- Sir? Excuse me.
- Yeah.</i>

14
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,114
<i>But the finish is included
in the cost of the wash.</i>

15
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:42,888
<i>That's okay, I'd rather do it myself,
I'm a little obsessive that way.</i>

16
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,996
<i>- Lenore.
- Bryan.</i>

17
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,728
<i>- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, you?</i>

18
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:32,037
<i>- Good, good.
- Somethin' up?</i>

19
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,482
<i>No. It's Saturday, 2 o'clock.
Kim's driving lesson?</i>

20
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,312
<i>Yeah, music lesson got switched.</i>

21
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,799
<i>- The Tuesday one or the Friday one?
- I have no idea.</i>

22
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,606
<i>You know how kids are.</i>

23
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,304
<i>Um-huh! Especially those who're desperate</i>

24
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,636
<i>to pass their driving test at their third try.</i>

25
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,602
<i>She's not desperate.</i>

26
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:54,446
<i>But she failed the test twice, Leny.
It's important.</i>

27
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,942
<i>So ... where is she? Really.</i>

28
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:03,648
<i>- I've never been a good liar, have I?
- No, it's not your forte.</i>

29
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,954
<i>She met her boyfriend.</i>

30
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,327
<i>She has a boyfriend?</i>

31
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,922
<i>Do you want to come in for a drink?</i>

32
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,521
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think you should, okay.</i>

33
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,909
<i>Why didn’t she tell me, for God's sake?</i>

34
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,236
<i>She probably didn't want
you running a full security</i>

35
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,492
<i>check of everything thing
he's done since kindergarten.</i>

36
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,803
<i>But she's okay, right?</i>

37
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,512
<i>Yeah, she's okay.</i>

38
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,046
<i>Tell me it's none of my business, but ...</i>

39
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,357
<i>Are you okay?</i>

40
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:49,329
<i>No.</i>

41
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:55,464
<i>Not really, you know, we've separated.</i>

42
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:59,847
<i>Well, is there nothing I can do?</i>

43
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:04,549
<i>Well, I better... thanks for the wine.</i>

44
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:09,524
<i>- Bryan! Don't.
- I don't even know where the kid lives.</i>

45
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,844
<i>You found her in a city of
12 million people within 72 hours.</i>

46
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,735
<i>- Promise me.
- I just told you...</i>

47
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:20,280
<i>- Promise!
- I'm gonna give her her space.</i>

48
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,463
<i>Hi.</i>

49
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,397
<i>Can I help you?</i>

50
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,410
<i>Is Kim here?</i>

51
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,540
<i>- Yeah, and you are...?
- Her father.</i>

52
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,632
<i>Mr. Mills, what a pleasure, I'm Jamie.</i>

53
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:14,386
<i>Come in.</i>

54
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:20,423
<i>- Can I get you anything? A drink or...
- Just my daughter would be fine.</i>

55
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:23,554
<i>- Dad?
- Hi.</i>

56
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:24,898
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

57
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,862
<i>Well, I know how important it is
for you pass your tests.</i>

58
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,787
<i>Wait! Kim you don't have a license.?</i>

59
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,661
<i>Have you ever tried to parallel park an Escalade?</i>

60
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,081
<i>I told you to take the test with my car.</i>

61
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,768
<i>Dad.</i>

62
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,431
<i>Thank you.</i>

63
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,675
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mills.</i>

64
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:54,748
<i>Could we slow down a little bit, please.</i>

65
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,026
<i>I can't believe you could do that.</i>

66
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,096
<i>You're leaving in fall, right, next week.</i>

67
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,518
<i>It's the only time I can get
to do this before I go to Istanbul.</i>

68
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,593
<i>We planned this.
When you make plans, you keep them...</i>

69
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,378
<i>No, Dad, you planned it.</i>

70
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:09,655
<i>- How did you even find me?
- Your mom and I were talking...</i>

71
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,253
<i>Why didn't you tell me you have a boyfriend?</i>

72
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,252
<i>Because I knew you'd over-react and I just
wanted to be normal, even if I'm just pretending.</i>

73
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,835
<i>- Remember to break before stop.
- Dad!</i>

74
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,548
<i>Mom doesn't know where Jamie lives.</i>

75
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:30,459
<i>GPS?</i>

76
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,346
<i>I had it installed on your phone, I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:37,626
<i>It's just... you hear so many scary stories
of goings-on of people your age.</i>

78
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:41,622
<i>Dad, I don't even know how to start feeling
normal again, but this definitely isn't it.</i>

79
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,118
<i>Kim, you can move.</i>

80
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:00,201
<i>Use your side mirror.</i>

81
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,694
<i>Perfect! Why couldn't you do that in the test?</i>

82
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:17,824
<i>I don't know.</i>

83
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:21,776
<i>Maybe I didn't really want a license.
Listen...</i>

84
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,008
<i>Of course I know where you're coming from.</i>

85
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,272
<i>But you gotta trust me to figure this out.</i>

86
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,923
<i>- Don't do this again, please.
- I won't.</i>

87
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,340
<i>And don't go running a background
check on him with your friend.</i>

88
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,462
<i>I won't.</i>

89
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:39,915
<i>Okay.</i>

90
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:44,295
<i>- See ya Wednesday.
- Au revoir.</i>

91
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,633
<i>- Love you.
- Hey, I love you.</i>

92
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,196
<i>One moment.
A package came for you.</i>

93
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,764
<i>- I'll meet you inside.
- As you wish, Sir.</i>

94
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:31,252
<i>Your mail.</i>

95
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,351
<i>Sebastian.</i>

96
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:03,100
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know.</i>

97
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,139
<i>Okay.</i>

98
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,152
<i>You want to play with me?</i>

99
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,577
<i>But then, you could play her tomorrow.</i>

100
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,763
<i>- Look.
- No! No!</i>

101
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,751
<i>Again the rules are changing.</i>

102
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,606
<i>- What's happened? Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm great.</i>

103
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,092
<i>I'll... come in, I'll get Kim.</i>

104
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,287
<i>Hey, hey,  hey, hey!</i>

105
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,124
<i>- Leny, talk to me.
- We...</i>

106
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,289
<i>We had this trip planned to
China for Kim's spring break...</i>

107
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,901
<i>the family, you know, to
try and work things out.</i>

108
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:50,931
<i>And when Stu and I... we thought
it'd be nice for Kim and I to...</i>

109
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:54,560
<i>you know, to be away... together,
away from all the tension.</i>

110
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,934
<i>- Sure.
- They cancelled everything, all the reservations.</i>

111
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,633
<i>I just can't believe he did that to us.</i>

112
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,817
<i>I'm tired of the fighting, the lawyers ...</i>

113
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:13,422
<i>- He's turned into such a bastard.
- I'm sorry, Leny, I'm sorry.</i>

114
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,186
<i>I'm sorry, this is really not your problem.</i>

115
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:22,705
<i>It's my turn to have Kim for the fall,
I'll take care of that.</i>

116
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,648
<i>Look, why don't you and
Kim come with me?</i>

117
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,799
<i>But, we can't impose on you,
you're working.</i>

118
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,308
<i>You're not imposing,
I'm working for 3 days.</i>

119
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:36,853
<i>Then you could come over, it... could be fun.</i>

120
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,503
<i>That's so sweet.</i>

121
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,977
<i>I do not know, I... just...
I can't think of right now.</i>

122
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,181
<i>Sure, I understand, I understand, no pressure.</i>

123
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,580
<i>I leave in the morning,
I work three days. Call me.</i>

124
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,171
<i>If you're coming, I'll hang around,
if not I'll come back. That's it.</i>

125
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,118
<i>- I'll go get Kim.
- Okay.</i>

126
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:55,807
<i>Thank you, Bryan.</i>

127
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,509
<i>- She is definitely coming?
- I don't know.</i>

128
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,223
<i>- Come on.
- Come on, Sam, I don't know.</i>

129
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,958
<i>- You should have insisted.
- Come on, guys, cut me some slack.</i>

130
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,952
<i>She's going through a hard time,
I didn't want to make it harder on her.</i>

131
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,067
<i>- She was confiding in me.
- Oh!</i>

132
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,844
<i>Well, I didn't know you guys
were still so cozy, that</i>

133
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,815
<i>she shares her marriage issues with you.</i>

134
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,539
<i>Wait a minute, I mean, I mean,
I know you guys were close, obviously</i>

135
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:30,228
<i>but are you, like close again,
close like... you know?</i>

136
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,749
<i>- Lay money she still got something for him.
- Don't got there, friend.</i>

137
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:36,163
<i>- Whoa! Maybe he still has something for her.
- Well, that's...</i>

138
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:39,341
<i>Could we talk about basketball,
for God's sake! Come on!</i>

139
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,576
<i>Istanbul.</i>

140
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,111
<i>Thank you, Mr. Mills.</i>

141
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:11,012
<i>You made my stay feel very secure.</i>

142
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,135
<i>Thank you, have a safe trip home.</i>

143
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:18,579
<i>You also.</i>

144
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,955
<i>You reached Lenore,
leave a message after the beep.</i>

145
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,517
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

146
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,113
<i>No message from you</i>

147
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:42,824
<i>so I guess probably found some place to go.</i>

148
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,486
<i>I hope things are a little easier.</i>

149
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,061
<i>If you ever need to talk
or anything, well, I'm here.</i>

150
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,622
<i>I mean, I'll be there.</i>

151
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,103
<i>I'll probably ship-out tomorrow.</i>

152
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:58,066
<i>No news from Kim, so I guess
she's busy with the boyfriend, and all.</i>

153
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,446
<i>Dad!</i>

154
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,908
<i>- Surprise!
- My God, Kim, baby!</i>

155
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,110
<i>- Hello, Leny.
- Hello, hi.</i>

156
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,361
<i>I was just leaving you a message...
when I didn't hear...</i>

157
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,826
<i>- We wanted to surprise you.
- Well, you succeeded.</i>

158
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,518
<i>You guys could've been surprised,
I coulda been outta here and headed home.</i>

159
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,211
<i>- Mom's been calling Sam.
- Oh yeah?</i>

160
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,877
<i>- Uh-huh, yes
- We've been tracking YOU.</i>

161
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,622
<i>Not exactly, you're not the only
one who's got moves, you know?</i>

162
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:28,073
<i>Apparently not!
Welcome to Istanbul.</i>

163
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,546
<i>- Not too shabby, huh?
- Wow!</i>

164
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,834
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

165
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:43,494
<i>Mom, Mom, look at this.</i>

166
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,097
<i>- Oh my God!
- Crazy, right?</i>

167
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:49,627
<i>- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.</i>

168
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,680
<i>But, listen, I'll let you get settled and I'll come
and collect you, in what. half an hour?</i>

169
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,332
<i>Okay.</i>

170
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,425
<i>Later.</i>

171
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,722
<i>Pass.</i>

172
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,164
<i>The cause is still being investigated,</i>

173
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:11,207
<i>but a source... actually in the area at
the time of Thursday's crash.</i>

174
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,641
<i>on the island of Corsica.</i>

175
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,929
<i>After the... made an unauthorized entrance
the ship then keeled over on its side.</i>

176
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,265
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

177
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,727
<i>- You look great.
- You, too.</i>

178
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,387
<i>So, where are we heading?</i>

179
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,745
<i>Well, I am going nowhere, I'm beat,</i>

180
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,991
<i>so I'm just gonna take a
nice, long bath and get into bed.</i>

181
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,953
<i>- Leny, are you sure?
- Yeah.</i>

182
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,653
<i>I guess it's just you and me, Kiddo.</i>

183
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,842
<i>So, on this side is Europe</i>

184
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:48,294
<i>and the other side is Asia.</i>

185
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,486
<i>And every conquest since,
for the last 2 thousand 500 years</i>

186
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:56,618
<i>whether it was the West going east
or the East going west,</i>

187
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,378
<i>they all used this very same waterway.</i>

188
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,300
<i>- Do you want tea, Babe?
- Yeah.</i>

189
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,081
<i>Just one, please.</i>

190
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,066
<i>So, how do you know all this stuff.</i>

191
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:10,458
<i>How do I know? I read it in a book</i>

192
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:14,861
<i>on the flight over.
And you can borrow it if you wish.</i>

193
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,491
<i>Yeah, I would.</i>

194
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,712
<i>So... uh... this...</i>

195
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,524
<i>Jamie... is it... serious?</i>

196
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,096
<i>I wasn't really ready for this transition.</i>

197
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,882
<i>I don't know, it's only been a few months.</i>

198
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:34,063
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

199
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,665
<i>I guess I'm not sure yet.</i>

200
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:42,578
<i>- Have you ever been in love before?
- Not...</i>

201
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,570
<i>Not the way that mom talks about it.</i>

202
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,310
<i>How does she describe it?</i>

203
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,917
<i>She said when you guys he met... that...</i>

204
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,688
<i>- It was Super Special.
- Super Special.</i>

205
00:20:56,938 --> 00:21:00,600
<i>- She said that?
- I think the exact word she used was:</i>

206
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,411
<i>Magical.</i>

207
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,353
<i>Magical, huh?</i>

208
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:51,302
<i>It is good to see you again, my friend.</i>

209
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,364
<i>Is everything prepared?</i>

210
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,555
<i>As you requested.</i>

211
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,396
<i>Perfect.</i>

212
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,816
<i>- Yeah?
- They're in the lobby.</i>

213
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:48,288
<i>Wait until he's outside,</i>

214
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,568
<i>and remember... alive.</i>

215
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:55,441
<i>He's looking at me, I'm leaving.</i>

216
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,092
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

217
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,123
<i>I thought we were having lunch in the Bazaar.</i>

218
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,696
<i>Jet lag just hit me so I figured
I'd veg-out at the pool</i>

219
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:23,141
<i>and let you guys go and meet-up with you later.</i>

220
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,492
<i>- I guess, okay with you?
- Okay, fine.</i>

221
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:26,553
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

222
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,491
<i>- Hey, Kim.
- Yeah.</i>

223
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:30,025
<i>That book I was telling you about,
it's on my dresser.</i>

224
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,445
<i>- Definitely.
- No adventure.</i>

225
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:34,497
<i>- I’ll go call a car.
- Have fun.</i>

226
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:40,019
<i>- Hey, Kim. I know what you're doing.
- What?</i>

227
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,438
<i>Yeah?</i>

228
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,559
<i>The daughter is still here so what can we do?</i>

229
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,590
<i>I want all 3 of them.</i>

230
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,621
<i>Yes.</i>

231
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:01,974
<i>She thinks we just fell off the turnip truck.</i>

232
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,045
<i>- What do you mean?
- She's trying to play Cupid.</i>

233
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,515
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

234
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,707
<i>You know? When you first
came back and said you</i>

235
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,054
<i>wanted to make-up for all
the time you lost with Kim?</i>

236
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:14,483
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Is that right! Three weeks he's gone.</i>

237
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,184
<i>That was usually the full limit you stuck around.</i>

238
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:18,846
<i>Give or take a week.</i>

239
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,178
<i>We're too close.</i>

240
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,529
<i>You really proved me wrong,
I thought you'd never change.</i>

241
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,111
<i>- Why not?
- Ah... you're personality.</i>

242
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:32,262
<i>You know, when you commit to something, ya gotta</i>

243
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:36,298
<i>focus all your energy there,
like a dog with a bone.</i>

244
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,849
<i>Nice analogy.</i>

245
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,320
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

246
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,991
<i>When you give, it's 100 percent of 100 percent.</i>

247
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,893
<i>If I was on to something, it was just that thing,</i>

248
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:49,964
<i>even though I tell myself something should change,</i>

249
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:51,905
<i>I can never give it up.</i>

250
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,338
<i>- You gave us up.
- No, never.</i>

251
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:58,949
<i>Not in here.</i>

252
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:18,882
<i>Driver, turn left.</i>

253
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,974
<i>Leny, don't.</i>

254
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,880
<i>What?</i>

255
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,933
<i>- Will you tell me what's going on?
- It's okay.</i>

256
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,647
<i>Move!</i>

257
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,470
<i>See the gallery entrenched in
the middle of the block?</i>

258
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,695
<i>- Will you tell me what's going on?
- Do you see it?</i>

259
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,166
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.</i>

260
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,382
<i>When we stop, I want you to get out of the car.</i>

261
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,939
<i>While you're a shopper I want you to get inside.</i>

262
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,718
<i>Okay, but will you tell me what's going on!</i>

263
00:25:58,868 --> 00:25:59,619
<i>- Listen to me!
- Tell me what's happening!</i>

264
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:00,971
<i>Listen, Leny! There's no time for this!</i>

265
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,001
<i>- Please talk to me!
- Listen!</i>

266
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:05,872
<i>At the lights at the back of the
fabric store, turn right.</i>

267
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:09,464
<i>Take the first street on the right,
and then left on the very next street.</i>

268
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:12,044
<i>Go straight until you come to a set of steps.</i>

269
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,980
<i>There's a red corridor. It's a lane.</i>

270
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,652
<i>When you exit the lane,
there's a cab stand.</i>

271
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:22,425
<i>Go back to the hotel, get Kim,
get the head of hotel security</i>

272
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,235
<i>and demand they cordon-off your room.</i>

273
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:27,396
<i>Do not open the door for anyone.</i>

274
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,027
<i>No room service,
no police, no one!</i>

275
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,298
<i>- You wait for me.
- I can't believe this is happening.</i>

276
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:33,959
<i>I need you to focus.</i>

277
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,002
<i>- Are you ready?
- No.</i>

278
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,917
<i>Leny, I need you to be ready.
I need you to be ready!</i>

279
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:44,398
<i>Come on, focus.
Driver! Stop!</i>

280
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,041
<i>- Okay, go.
- Wait, what about you?</i>

281
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,161
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

282
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,452
<i>The guys following us are about to have a problem.</i>

283
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:54,182
<i>When the dog has a bone,</i>

284
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,244
<i>the last thing you want to
do is try to take it from him.</i>

285
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:04,372
<i>Be careful.</i>

286
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:08,684
<i>Out of the car.</i>

287
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,035
<i>Come on!
Move, move, move!</i>

288
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,428
<i>Sir! Please!</i>

289
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,479
<i>Please, Sir!</i>

290
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,901
<i>He knows.</i>

291
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,852
<i>Do it now.</i>

292
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:46,025
<i>Come on!</i>

293
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,640
<i>Shit!</i>

294
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:24,261
<i>Come on, Kim,
answer the God damn phone!</i>

295
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:27,789
<i>God, no!</i>

296
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,932
<i>Somebody help me!
The key! Open the door! Please!</i>

297
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,277
<i>Shit!</i>

298
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,078
<i>I'll blow his brains out.</i>

299
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,326
<i>Bryan!</i>

300
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:44,099
<i>- Please.
- Drop the gun.</i>

301
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,051
<i>- I really wish you were here.
- Me too.</i>

302
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:52,102
<i>You have no idea.</i>

303
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,694
<i>- What?
- My dad's calling,</i>

304
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:57,184
<i>he's on a date with my mom.</i>

305
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:00,590
<i>Don't go away.</i>

306
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>I miss you.</i>

307
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,734
<i>- How's it going?
- Listen to me carefully, Kim.</i>

308
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:15,067
<i>Your mother...
and I... are going to be taken.</i>

309
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:16,881
<i>Daddy!</i>

310
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:18,551
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

311
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,689
<i>People are going to come for you, too.</i>

312
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,430
<i>Leave the place where you are, call me.</i>

313
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,556
<i>Go to where the book is I told you about.</i>

314
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:28,118
<i>There's the door. Go into the room</i>

315
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,518
<i>and hide in the closet. You got that?</i>

316
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,510
<i>- Yeah.
- Good, I'll call you.</i>

317
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,111
<i>Go... now!</i>

318
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,151
<i>No!</i>

319
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,760
<i>She is in room 4-22.</i>

320
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:40,103
<i>1, 2,</i>

321
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,845
<i>3, 4, 5, 6...</i>

322
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,316
<i>Right turn...</i>

323
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,089
<i>Men singing...</i>

324
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:05,990
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

325
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,572
<i>4, boat...</i>

326
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,718
<i>The pool.</i>

327
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:35,477
<i>Security, 4th floor. Can you hear me?</i>

328
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,608
<i>Send someone now.</i>

329
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:42,220
<i>25, 26, 27...</i>

330
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,053
<i>28, 29, stop.</i>

331
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,940
<i>Hammer on metal.</i>

332
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:44,082
<i>Left, gear shift to second.</i>

333
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:47,403
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

334
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,384
<i>Birds.</i>

335
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,997
<i>Take them to the shop... straight.</i>

336
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,071
<i>Right turn, 27.</i>

337
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:56,798
<i>Then stop.</i>

338
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,401
<i>Come on, Sam, pick up.</i>

339
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:29,334
<i>Hey, this is Sam, leave me a message.</i>

340
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,054
<i>Shit.</i>

341
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,989
<i>- Are you guys okay?
- No, no.</i>

342
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,771
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yes</i>

343
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,973
<i>- I'm just scared.
- Kim, listen to me very carefully.</i>

344
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:52,789
<i>I need you to calm down
and pull yourself together.</i>

345
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,701
<i>The men who came for you, did they leave?</i>

346
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,802
<i>Yes, what did they want?</i>

347
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:04,104
<i>- I'm going to find out.
- Is Mom okay?</i>

348
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,677
<i>- Dad?
- Mom's fine.</i>

349
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:10,868
<i>Good.</i>

350
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,609
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

351
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,914
<i>I want you to go to the U.S. embassy.</i>

352
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:17,775
<i>- You'll be safe there.
- What about you and Mom?</i>

353
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,286
<i>I'll figure something out.</i>

354
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:26,129
<i>- Where are you now?
- I don't really know, Kim.</i>

355
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,630
<i>Dad, how can I tell them where to find you, then?</i>

356
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,680
<i>You can't. Now get going.</i>

357
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,041
<i>- No.
- Kimmy.</i>

358
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:37,084
<i>- No, tell me what to do.
- No, Kim.</i>

359
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,159
<i>Dad, if you tell me what to do, I can do it.</i>

360
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,850
<i>- Kim, this is not a game.
- I know that.</i>

361
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,681
<i>It’s my parents' lives.</i>

362
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,462
<i>Dad, please,</i>

363
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:47,543
<i>you're wasting time.</i>

364
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,516
<i>Please,</i>

365
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,287
<i>tell me what to do.</i>

366
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:59,869
<i>Can you get out of the closet safely?</i>

367
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,006
<i>Yes</i>

368
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:09,227
<i>If you can, take the case with you.</i>

369
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:11,814
<i>Okay.</i>

370
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,524
<i>- I'm aff!
- The combination is:</i>

371
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:28,140
<i>2-3, 2-8, 8-4.</i>

372
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:36,615
<i>It is open?</i>

373
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:37,294
<i>Yes!</i>

374
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,756
<i>- Okay, do you see a map?
- Yeah.</i>

375
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:42,575
<i>Take the map, you'll see a scale</i>

376
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,048
<i>on the top in kilometers.</i>

377
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:45,513
<i>Do you see it?</i>

378
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,762
<i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

379
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,221
<i>Take a shoelace from one
of my shoes in the closet.</i>

380
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:53,697
<i>Use it as a guide.</i>

381
00:41:56,287 --> 00:42:00,089
<i>There's a pen in the case, take it.</i>

382
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:00,913
<i>Draw a circle</i>

383
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:02,740
<i>with the hotel in the center of it.</i>

384
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:05,770
<i>It's done!</i>

385
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:06,737
<i>Make the diameter</i>

386
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,864
<i>3 kilometers. You got that?</i>

387
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,075
<i>It's done!</i>

388
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,553
<i>Draw another circle with the market in the center.</i>

389
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:24,917
<i>Okay!</i>

390
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:25,428
<i>Do the circles</i>

391
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,586
<i>intersect at any point?</i>

392
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:28,226
<i>No.</i>

393
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:32,238
<i>Now take one of those little cans.</i>

394
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:33,930
<i>The ones with the pins on the top.</i>

395
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:35,123
<i>It's a grenade. I want you to</i>

396
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,381
<i>go to the balcony with the grenade.</i>

397
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,633
<i>Is there a safe place you can throw it?</i>

398
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:47,920
<i>- There’s a parking garage.
- Anyone on it?</i>

399
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,472
<i>- No.
- I want you to pull the pin out of the grenade,</i>

400
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:52,913
<i>count to 3 so that I can hear it,</i>

401
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,903
<i>and toss it as far as you can.</i>

402
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:56,467
<i>Then run back into the room,</i>

403
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,466
<i>keep the phone on so
I hear the explosion.</i>

404
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:05,498
<i>1, 2, 3.</i>

405
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:17,751
<i>1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

406
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,230
<i>- Dad?
- Now draw a circle on the map.</i>

407
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:25,040
<i>Put the hotel on the mid-line</i>

408
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:28,684
<i>and the circumference
at 4 point 5 kilometers.</i>

409
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:36,028
<i>Okay.</i>

410
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,962
<i>Do the circles intersect at any point?</i>

411
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:40,402
<i>Yes, two points.</i>

412
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:42,753
<i>I'm at one of the two intersecting points.</i>

413
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:44,036
<i>Now, go outside and</i>

414
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:45,845
<i>look at the flags on the rooftops.</i>

415
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:48,497
<i>Do you see the flags?</i>

416
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,718
<i>- Yes
- Are they in the wind?</i>

417
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:56,124
<i>- Yes
- Going east, right?</i>

418
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,025
<i>I think so, yeah, how do you know?</i>

419
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:00,255
<i>Now look at the map.</i>

420
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:01,821
<i>I want you to go to the point</i>

421
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,261
<i>where the circles intersect at the east.</i>

422
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:06,139
<i>I want you to take one of the guns,</i>

423
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:07,810
<i>get to a rooftop, wait for my call,</i>

424
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,392
<i>And two of the grenades. You go to the
rooftop at the most easterly point.</i>

425
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:17,304
<i>Get up to the rooftop, wait for my call.</i>

426
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:20,870
<i>Be casual, Kim,
blend in.</i>

427
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,984
<i>Okay.</i>

428
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:25,302
<i>Dad?</i>

429
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:28,984
<i>Dad?</i>

430
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,151
<i>What are you doing?</i>

431
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:25,437
<i>This is an employees' locker room!
Wait! Stop!</i>

432
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,611
<i>Do you know this man?</i>

433
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,426
<i>This one?</i>

434
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:10,948
<i>- This one?
- No.</i>

435
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:13,889
<i>This one?</i>

436
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,041
<i>- What do you want?
- You recognize none of them.</i>

437
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:24,083
<i>To you they were nothing, but to
other people they are... sons,</i>

438
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,759
<i>and grandsons,</i>

439
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,271
<i>fathers and husbands.
And you killed them all.</i>

440
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:35,203
<i>Like they were so many nothings.</i>

441
00:46:42,037 --> 00:46:43,667
<i>And this one?</i>

442
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:46,959
<i>Do you recognize him?</i>

443
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,764
<i>You DO recognize him.</i>

444
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:53,456
<i>And you didn't just kill him,
you strapped him to a chair.</i>

445
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:56,527
<i>you touched electric cables to the chair</i>

446
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:58,206
<i>you turned the current on,</i>

447
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:02,190
<i>and you left it on until his heart burst.</i>

448
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,121
<i>He's the one who kidnapped dozens of girls</i>

449
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:06,702
<i>and ruined their lives.</i>

450
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,545
<i>He was my son, Marko</i>

451
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,366
<i>From Trepoja.</i>

452
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:18,011
<i>And I have come to take you to Trepoja</i>

453
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:21,973
<i>to face you to the people
whose lives you ruined.</i>

454
00:47:22,243 --> 00:47:25,324
<i>- To give them justice.
- You mean to give them their revenge.</i>

455
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:29,157
<i>Because it gives us peace,
call it anything you wish.</i>

456
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:33,209
<i>I killed your son because
he kidnapped my daughter!</i>

457
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,054
<i>I don't care what he did!</i>

458
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:40,505
<i>I will know...</i>

459
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:44,198
<i>I will never see his face again.</i>

460
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,110
<i>I will never hear his voice.</i>

461
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,594
<i>And if you held him responsible
for your daughter,</i>

462
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,794
<i>I hold YOU responsible for him.</i>

463
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:03,421
<i>Your death will not be quick,
it will not be pleasant.</i>

464
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:06,573
<i>But before you die, this is what you'll see.</i>

465
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:48,446
<i>How long will it take for
the blood to rush to her head</i>

466
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:50,747
<i>and have no place to go?</i>

467
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:56,994
<i>- About 30 minutes.
- You are right.</i>

468
00:48:57,094 --> 00:49:01,266
<i>You are next for this,
so you have 30 minutes to watch her die.</i>

469
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,297
<i>She had nothing to do with this.</i>

470
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:06,388
<i>Do what you want with me, let her go.</i>

471
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,190
<i>Don't play the hero with me.</i>

472
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,280
<i>Now we're going to get your daughter.</i>

473
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,813
<i>She will be sold to the
lowest brothel in this world.</i>

474
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:17,708
<i>She will be abused by so many men,</i>

475
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:21,230
<i>for she'll be nothing more than a piece of meat</i>

476
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:23,431
<i>that a dog would not have.</i>

477
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:39,848
<i>Don't listen to them, Leny.</i>

478
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:43,244
<i>Kim is safe, I talked to her.</i>

479
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,795
<i>She's safe.</i>

480
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,826
<i>You have to stay calm.</i>

481
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:48,827
<i>Breathe slowly, you have to.</i>

482
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:52,088
<i>I won't let anything happen to you,
or to her... I promise.</i>

483
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,416
<i>Quiet!</i>

484
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:02,433
<i>We lost the girl.</i>

485
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,864
<i>The girl has gone.
I'll be back as soon as we get her.</i>

486
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:07,859
<i>Then we move, let's go!</i>

487
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,990
<i>Hold on, Leny.</i>

488
00:50:32,815 --> 00:50:34,977
<i>Hold on, Leny, hold on.</i>

489
00:50:46,452 --> 00:50:47,784
<i>Sorry!</i>

490
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:54,133
<i>Leny!</i>

491
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,146
<i>Leny!</i>

492
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,757
<i>I put your things down here, I'm here.</i>

493
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,193
<i>Come on, call!</i>

494
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,809
<i>Please.</i>

495
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:45,452
<i>Leny, I'm coming back.</i>

496
00:51:57,897 --> 00:52:00,269
<i>- I'm here.
- Set-off another grenade.</i>

497
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,671
<i>- Dad
- You're close.</i>

498
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,982
<i>I want to keep moving east.</i>

499
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:20,494
<i>Count to 30</i>

500
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:21,663
<i>and then set-off another one.</i>

501
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:24,534
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

502
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:30,277
<i>18, 19...</i>

503
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:37,924
<i>27, 28, 29, 30.</i>

504
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:46,229
<i>Go out and check what's going on.</i>

505
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:54,668
<i>Kim.</i>

506
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:55,644
<i>Yeah?</i>

507
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,479
<i>Look east!</i>

508
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,019
<i>Look for a white cloud of steam!</i>

509
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,761
<i>- I see it!
- Run for it,</i>

510
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:04,411
<i>tell me when you're there.</i>

511
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:08,143
<i>I'm going down.</i>

512
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:26,546
<i>- Dad
- Where are you?</i>

513
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:27,998
<i>I'm right by the steam.</i>

514
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:30,066
<i>Drop the gun down the vent.</i>

515
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,799
<i>- Those guys are here, they're coming.
- Drop the gun, Kim,</i>

516
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:35,114
<i>and run!</i>

517
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,441
<i>Go!</i>

518
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:39,211
<i>Dad, they're coming!</i>

519
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:14,066
<i>I'll be back.</i>

520
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:42,294
<i>Hey, what are you doing in the hall?</i>

521
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:53,180
<i>Drop it!</i>

522
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,571
<i>On your knees!</i>

523
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,293
<i>Don't do this.</i>

524
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:16,240
<i>Dad!</i>

525
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:20,196
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

526
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:28,050
<i>Where's Mom? Is she okay?</i>

527
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,601
<i>She's safe, she's safe.</i>

528
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,480
<i>Slow down, slow down, slow down.</i>

529
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,161
<i>That man had the same
tattoo as the men in Paris.</i>

530
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:07,806
<i>It's not you they want
Kim, it's me.</i>

531
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:25,554
<i>I want you to wait here,
I'm going to get mom.</i>

532
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:30,238
<i>Wait five minutes and if I don't show up,
I want you to go straight here:</i>

533
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:31,861
<i>The American embassy.</i>

534
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,102
<i>- Tell them what happened.
- Dad.</i>

535
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,033
<i>No time, Kim, give me your phone.</i>

536
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,605
<i>You wait five minutes, not a moment longer.</i>

537
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:43,167
<i>No matter what happens, time runs out,
you go! You understand me?</i>

538
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:45,008
<i>Okay.</i>

539
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:20,148
<i>- Let me go.</i>

540
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:26,652
<i>Please.</i>

541
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:47,566
<i>Yes?</i>

542
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,832
<i>- Move!
- You killed him.</i>

543
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:16,164
<i>I had no choice, now move.</i>

544
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:18,474
<i>- Where's Mom?
- She's fine, she's not far.</i>

545
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,926
<i>- Where is she?
- Come on, Kim, move!</i>

546
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:24,091
<i>- I don't wanna do this.
- Go on, Kim.</i>

547
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,823
<i>- Where are we going?
- Go straight!</i>

548
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:27,473
<i>We have to go to the embassy.</i>

549
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:33,025
<i>- I'm not sure I can.
- You know how to shoot?</i>

550
01:00:33,275 --> 01:00:34,937
<i>- No.
- Then drive.</i>

551
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,411
<i>They escaped.</i>

552
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:50,698
<i>Shit! The Cops!</i>

553
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:55,480
<i>- Dad, I have to stop.
- No, I just shot one of them, now go!</i>

554
01:01:03,684 --> 01:01:04,885
<i>Come on, go!</i>

555
01:01:27,629 --> 01:01:28,433
<i>Go right!</i>

556
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,112
<i>Back, back, back!</i>

557
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:37,177
<i>Come on, move!</i>

558
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:41,360
<i>Come on, Kim.</i>

559
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:50,905
<i>Go! Go!</i>

560
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:57,966
<i>Come on, keep going!</i>

561
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:11,212
<i>Left!</i>

562
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:12,078
<i>Yes.</i>

563
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,102
<i>Keep going!</i>

564
01:02:22,353 --> 01:02:25,003
<i>- Oh, no, they're shooting.
- Stay low, keep going.</i>

565
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:31,041
<i>- Come on, faster.
- I can't!</i>

566
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,472
<i>- Do it!
- I can't!</i>

567
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:36,485
<i>Come on, move! Move!</i>

568
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:39,701
<i>- Dad!
- Keep going! Watch the road!</i>

569
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:42,156
<i>Right!</i>

570
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:55,817
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

571
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:23,004
<i>Come on, Kim, move!</i>

572
01:03:26,865 --> 01:03:28,026
<i>- Go! - Okay! - Go!</i>

573
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,540
<i>C'mon! Keep going!</i>

574
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:41,267
<i>Come on!</i>

575
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:51,212
<i>Shit!</i>

576
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:55,343
<i>- Dad!
- Keep going, stay low!</i>

577
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:10,214
<i>- Faster, Kim.
- I can't!</i>

578
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:17,037
<i>- Come on, faster!
- Dad!</i>

579
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:18,058
<i>Keep going!</i>

580
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,170
<i>You can make it!</i>

581
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,541
<i>Do it.</i>

582
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:52,308
<i>- Here, Don't stop!
- But there's soldiers.</i>

583
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:53,499
<i>They'll move!</i>

584
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:57,204
<i>Down, Kim!</i>

585
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:26,792
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah.</i>

586
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,555
<i>Keep your head down, Kimmy.</i>

587
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:40,279
<i>Hey, Bry.</i>

588
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:43,700
<i>Sam, we're in the courtyard of
the U.S. embassy in Istanbul</i>

589
01:05:43,964 --> 01:05:45,225
<i>with a smashed-up car.</i>

590
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,084
<i>Don't ask. Can you</i>

591
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:49,087
<i>call someone to make
sure we don't get shot?</i>

592
01:05:49,306 --> 01:05:50,548
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

593
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:51,788
<i>Thanks.</i>

594
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:54,239
<i>It's Bry, he's in trouble in Istanbul.</i>

595
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:58,822
<i>Mom didn't get away, did she?</i>

596
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:04,134
<i>- No.
- Oh, God, Dad.</i>

597
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,296
<i>- Tell me the truth, is she...?
- No, no, no, no, Kim.</i>

598
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:08,971
<i>No, no she's not.</i>

599
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:12,572
<i>But they have her.</i>

600
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:15,993
<i>And they will use her until
they get what they want.</i>

601
01:06:17,664 --> 01:06:18,595
<i>Me!</i>

602
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:23,757
<i>You'll be safe here in the
embassy until I come back.</i>

603
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:28,810
<i>- Kimmy, it's gonna be okay.
- Dad, it's okay.</i>

604
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,381
<i>Kim, Kim listen.</i>

605
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:35,597
<i>I have to find them,</i>

606
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:37,948
<i>and bring your mom back.</i>

607
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,707
<i>And then I have to make sure these
people never bother us again in our lives.</i>

608
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,671
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

609
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,603
<i>What I do best.</i>

610
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:24,247
<i>Mrs. Mills.</i>

611
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:28,790
<i>What should I do with you, Mrs. Mills?</i>

612
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,389
<i>I have nothing against you.</i>

613
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,519
<i>You didn't kill my son.</i>

614
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:07,952
<i>But your husband did.</i>

615
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:12,509
<i>Now he betrayed you,</i>

616
01:08:12,758 --> 01:08:16,260
<i>by choosing to save your daughter,
instead of you.</i>

617
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:20,401
<i>He left you here like a dog.</i>

618
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:25,445
<i>At least my daughter is still alive.</i>

619
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:39,066
<i>Mrs. Mills,</i>

620
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:41,106
<i>you are a good mother,</i>

621
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:44,778
<i>and a brave woman.</i>

622
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:48,489
<i>For that, I'm going to send you back home...</i>

623
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,621
<i>piece by piece.</i>

624
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,248
<i>Boris, shut the dog up!</i>

625
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:38,945
<i>Go and see what happened.</i>

626
01:12:48,293 --> 01:12:50,894
<i>Let's go! Move her here to the Hammond.</i>

627
01:12:51,164 --> 01:12:52,925
<i>Quick, quick!</i>

628
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:02,320
<i>You stay here.</i>

629
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:10,090
<i>Go!</i>

630
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,064
<i>Come on!</i>

631
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:49,406
<i>Get lost!</i>

632
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:40,439
<i>Honey?</i>

633
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:09,354
<i>I'm here, Baby, I'm here.</i>

634
01:19:09,923 --> 01:19:14,081
<i>I'm coming back, Leny, I'm coming back.
Okay.</i>

635
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:54,652
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

636
01:19:56,173 --> 01:20:00,545
<i>- You have other sons?
- Two.</i>

637
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:05,778
<i>And if I killed you, they will
come and seek revenge.</i>

638
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,614
<i>They will for sure.</i>

639
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:10,644
<i>And I will kill them, too.</i>

640
01:20:11,884 --> 01:20:13,896
<i>You can change that.</i>

641
01:20:14,496 --> 01:20:17,548
<i>You can go home, live your life,</i>

642
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:20,509
<i>enjoy your sons, your grandsons.</i>

643
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:26,202
<i>But my other son, Marko,</i>

644
01:20:29,623 --> 01:20:31,994
<i>the son you killed...</i>

645
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:35,960
<i>am I supposed just to forget it?</i>

646
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,561
<i>No, you'll just have to live with it,</i>

647
01:20:39,222 --> 01:20:41,942
<i>like the parents of all those kidnapped girls,</i>

648
01:20:43,044 --> 01:20:46,046
<i>or you can die... here.</i>

649
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:49,076
<i>- What are you telling me?
- What I'm saying is...</i>

650
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:51,817
<i>if you give me your word,</i>

651
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:56,560
<i>I will throw-down this gun,
and simply walk away.</i>

652
01:20:59,995 --> 01:21:01,556
<i>Why?</i>

653
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:05,258
<i>Because I'm tired of it all.</i>

654
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:16,474
<i>Leny, I'm here.</i>

655
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:20,335
<i>I'm here, baby. I'm here.
Come on.</i>

656
01:22:26,389 --> 01:22:27,569
<i>It's all right, Leny.</i>

657
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:29,540
<i>It's okay.</i>

658
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:33,931
<i>We're safe.</i>

659
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:37,615
<i>Bryan?</i>

660
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:43,070
<i>- Kim? Kim?
- She's safe.</i>

661
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,552
<i>She's safe.</i>

662
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:58,447
<i>We're all safe.</i>

663
01:23:06,499 --> 01:23:06,499
<i>Three weeks after</i>

664
01:23:28,309 --> 01:23:30,130
<i>Line it up!</i>

665
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:32,642
<i>That's it!</i>

666
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:39,194
<i>Now, begin to cut! Not too fast. Not so fast.</i>

667
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:43,888
<i>Straighten it out! Straighten! Straighten!</i>

668
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:47,880
<i>Stop, stop stop!</i>

669
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:50,503
<i>Perfect.</i>

670
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:10,404
<i>- Well... perfect score.
- Great!</i>

671
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:15,009
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

672
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:19,852
<i>I was perfect.</i>

673
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:25,944
<i>I've been saying that since the day you were born.
Congratulations!</i>

674
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:30,277
<i>So... what would you like to do to celebrate?</i>

675
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:34,458
<i>- I think I have an idea.
- Yeah?</i>

676
01:24:34,758 --> 01:24:37,211
<i>- Yeah, I'll drive.
- Of course!</i>

677
01:24:59,234 --> 01:25:02,676
<i>Here you go! 3 double chocolate fudge.</i>

678
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:06,092
<i>- Thank you.
- And who's having the strawberry?</i>

679
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:07,982
<i>I'm sorry, but I just ordered 3.</i>

680
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:10,183
<i>Well, actually the order said 4.</i>

681
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:13,314
<i>- I ordered a 4th one.
- Yeah? For who?</i>

682
01:25:15,536 --> 01:25:18,107
<i>- Oh, Jamie. Hey.
- Hey.</i>

683
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:21,069
<i>- Hi.
- Hi! Pretty good timing.</i>

684
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:21,789
<i>Jamie.</i>

685
01:25:22,769 --> 01:25:25,631
<i>- It's cool if he joins us, right?
- Of course he can, Kim.</i>

686
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:27,262
<i>Dad?</i>

687
01:25:28,396 --> 01:25:30,361
<i>- Right?
- Of course it is, Honey.</i>

688
01:25:30,448 --> 01:25:31,148
<i>Behave!</i>

689
01:25:31,197 --> 01:25:32,968
<i>It's nice to see you again, Sir.</i>

690
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:35,679
<i>Nice to see you, too. Sit down.</i>

691
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:37,980
<i>Hi.</i>

692
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,623
<i>- We got you a strawberry.
- Oh, please.</i>

693
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:44,654
<i>Thanks, Dad.
Do not shoot this one, I really like him.</i>
