I've already got authorization

494
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,300
for you to use it until you get Shaw.

495
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,340
You go from the hunted to the hunter.

496
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,761
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

497
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,684
More importantly,

498
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,563
you and your family
don't go to any more funerals.

499
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,206
You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye,

500
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,646
you get Shaw.

501
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,486
Well, that's the wind-up and the pitch.

502
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,860
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

503
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,967
and highly classified information,
what do you think, Toretto?

504
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,443
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

505
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,040
Good.

506
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,931
But it'll be my way.

507
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,780
And my crew.

508
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,928
I assumed you might say that.

509
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,727
Which is why I've taken the liberty
of gathering your team.

510
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,322
This is crazy.

511
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,245
What the hell is going on in here?

512
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,140
MR. NOBODY: Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

513
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,020
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

514
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,860
through the Caucasus mountain range.

515
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,060
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

516
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,860
Ramsey is as good as gone.

517
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,060
ROMAN: So let me get this straight.

518
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,700
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

519
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,820
sheer drops on every side,

520
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,540
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

521
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,165
from one mile in either direction?

522
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,802
Yeah, that's about it.

523
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,005
- You done?
- No, I'm not done.

524
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,180
So you all wanted me to break into

525
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,884
a police station. Fine.

526
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,010
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

527
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,924
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

528
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,140
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

529
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,660
to shoot down one
of the largest airplanes ever.

530
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,331
I shot that shit out of the sky. Mmm.

531
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
It's nothing.

532
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,205
But this right here, my friend,

533
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,540
happens to be

534
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,980
the stupidest idea
I've ever heard of in my life.

535
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,208
I forgot that you were the only one
to bring the plane down.

536
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,380
No, no. The only thing
I've ever seen him take down was

537
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,620
"No Knees" Denise.

538
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,500
Remember, at prom?

539
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,648
Really, Brian?
You're gonna do that right here?

540
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,260
- See, y'all trying to get me off my point.
- (LAUGHING)

541
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,460
All I'm saying is,
I'm tired of everybody around me

542
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,620
making all the decisions.

543
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,180
This time, I lead.

544
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,500
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I'm out.

545
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,364
All right, Roman.

546
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,086
What do you got?

547
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,940
I mean, I wasn't trying to get into
the whole leadership thing, like, now.

548
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,380
You know what I'm saying?

549
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,580
I was just, kind of, talking about,
like, at some point.

550
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,806
Like, you know, when we...

551
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,769
Whatever. I mean, I think...

552
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,780
Let's hit it from here.

553
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,100
- I don't think that that's...
- No, no, no, don't think.

554
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,089
That's my job. (SHUSHING)

555
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,521
Okay.

556
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,460
It is impossible to hit it there.

557
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,780
That is literally the most secure
spot on the mountain.

558
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,326
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

559
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,620
See, that's what makes it so sweet.

560
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,300
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

561
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,121
As much as I hate to admit it,
he's onto something there.

562
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,606
What do you think, Dom?

563
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,405
- Here?
- ROMAN: Yeah.

564
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,446
I think we got a plan.

565
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,300
Completely wrong thinking.

566
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,447
And I like it.

567
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,242
You see? I'm good at this.

568
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,922
"Good"? Okay.

569
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,284
SHEPPARD: How are you planning
on getting on that road?

570
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,289
Well, Tej?

571
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,881
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

572
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,128
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

573
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,441
Leader!

574
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,540
You know, when I was reading your files,

575
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,860
I was impressed with what
you've accomplished with your team.

576
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,601
But meeting them now,
I've gotta say, Dom,

577
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,044
you've truly got a gift.

578
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,580
Consider my workshop your new playhouse.

579
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,810
I think you'll find our
cars extremely appealing.

580
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,649
And your team is now complete.

582
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,162
I was looking for you everywhere.

583
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,562
You scared the shit out of me.

584

(INHALES SHARPLY)

586
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,844

587
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,289
Where did you find that?

588
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,520
Found in Han's car.

589
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,565
It was left as a message.

590
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,530
A message I plan on returning.

591
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,060
Can you ride?

592
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,780
Yeah, of course I can.

you're freaking out, ain't you?

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,451
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

612
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,847
I said no.

613

to embrace his feelings.

If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.

As your friend, you know I'm concerned
about your well-being,

616
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,091
which is why I took the precaution

00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,980
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,162
When I see you again

1621
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,527
Hey. You thought you could leave
without saying goodbye?

1622
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,886
DOM: I used to say I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.

1623
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,931
And I think that's why we were brothers.

1624
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,404
Because you did, too.

1625
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,244
- This is your car.
- My car?

1626
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,602
It's official.

1627
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,767
You're all free.

1628
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,122
Home sweet home.

1629
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,604
- What's happening, dude?
- Thanks for the invite.

1630
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,085
Wanna go for a drive?

1631
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:11,126
DOM: No matter where you are,

1632
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,887
whether it's a quarter-mile away

1633
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,571
or halfway across the world,

1634
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:28,242
the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

1635
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,562
Right here, right now.

1636
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:32,251
Salud mi familia.

1637
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,561
ALL: Salud.

1638
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,524
DOM: You'll always be with me.

1639
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:48,246
And you'll always be my brother.

1640
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:52,020
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1641
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,980
Everything I went through
you were standing there by my side

1642
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,765
And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1643
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,768
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1644

1645

with me for the last ride

1646

And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1647
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,124
I'll tell you

1648
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,929
Yeah, we came a long way

1649
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,410
I'll see you again
