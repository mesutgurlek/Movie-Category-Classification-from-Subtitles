gets a letter from the Ox.

317
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,630
He's down in Peru.

318
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:30,402
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

319
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,143
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

320
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:37,483
The one he found.
WOMAN: Nice jacket.

321
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:41,958
The Ox and I were obsessed with the
Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

322
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,227
How do you
know about it?

323
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:44,697
Are you kidding?
It's all he talked about.

324
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,500
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

325
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:48,470
What's it?
It's like an idol?

326
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,376
Deity carving.
Mesoamerican.

327
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,547
There are a number of
crystal skulls in the world.

328
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:56,687
I saw one
in the British Museum.

329
00:29:56,754 --> 00:30:00,394
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

330
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:03,300
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

331
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:07,342
He said this was real and he was
off to a place called Akator with it.

332
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:10,146
Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

333
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:13,921
That's what he said. He
said Akator. What is it?

334
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:17,628
It's a mythical
lost city in the Amazon.

335
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:20,700
Conquistadors
called it El Dorado.

336
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:24,842
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

337
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,716
to build a giant city
out of solid gold.

338
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:31,389
It had aqueducts
and paved roads

339
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:36,566
and technology that wouldn't
be seen again for 5,000 years.

340
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:42,510
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

341
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:45,282
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

342
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,488
I don't think it exists.

343
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,461
Why would Ox want to
take the skull there?

344
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:55,369
The legend says that a crystal
skull was stolen from Akator

345
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,406
in the 15th
or 16th century,

346
00:30:57,474 --> 00:31:01,113
and that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple

347
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,384
will be given control
over its power.

348
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:07,325
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

349
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:10,465
I don't know, kid.
It's just a story.

350
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,502
No.

351
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,740
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

352
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,477
You know,
smog in the noggin,

353
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:19,216
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

354
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:21,085
Now they've got her, too.

355
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:22,622
Now, Ox said he hid
that skull someplace,

356
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,758
and if my mom doesn't
come up with it,

357
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:25,962
they're gonna
kill them both.

358
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,834
Now, she said
you'd help me.

359
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,072
Me? What's your
mom's name again?

360

of Marys, kid.

362
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:37,484

you're talking about!

366

find the skull, it's you.

weeks ago from South America.

373
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:05,539
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

374
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,310
She said she'd just
gotten a letter from the Ox

Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

It was the fight against
Victoriano Huerta.

631
00:54:47,477 --> 00:54:52,084
Maybe the Spaniards found this
skull along with all this other loot.

632
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:55,190
They were headed for their
ships along the shore.

633
00:54:56,995 --> 00:54:59,967
Maybe the Indians
caught up with them,

634
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,571
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

635
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,079
over their prize,
kill each other off.

636
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:09,452
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

637
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,954
A couple of
hundred years later,

638
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:14,629
Oxley shows up here,
finds the skull.

639
00:55:14,697 --> 00:55:18,269
Takes it away,
maybe to Akator.

640
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,479
But then he returns it here.

641
00:55:23,548 --> 00:55:25,316
Return.

642
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:29,291
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

643
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,399
He put it back where he found it.
Why?

644
00:55:57,514 --> 00:55:59,050
Hello, Jonesey.

645
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:00,552
Hello, Mac.

646
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:28,440
(RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYING

647
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,721
You're lucky
I turned up, Jonesey.

648
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,059
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

649
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:41,700
That's the third time
I've saved your life.

650
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,904
Unshackle me.
I'll give you a big hug.

651
00:56:43,972 --> 00:56:46,877
You had a Luger pointed
at the base of your skull

652
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:48,746
the first time we met.

653
00:56:48,814 --> 00:56:50,650
I had the situation
under control.

654
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:51,919
You owe me.

655
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:53,222
What do you owe them?

656
00:56:55,594 --> 00:56:56,829
After the war,
when you turned,

657
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:58,098
how many names
did you give the Reds?

658
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,535
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

659
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:01,639
How many good men died
because of you?

660
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:04,010
Eventually, they're gonna let
me out of this chair, comrade,

661
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:07,483
and when they do, I'm
going to break your nose.

662
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:10,890
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

663
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:13,361
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

664
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,232
It's just about
money, isn't it?

665
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,668
No. Not only money.

666
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:23,281
A gigantic pile of money.

667
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:25,786
Don't worry about what
the Russians will pay.

668
00:57:25,854 --> 00:57:28,658
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

669
00:57:30,062 --> 00:57:32,332
An entire city of gold.

670
00:57:32,399 --> 00:57:35,638
It's what the
conquistadors were after.

671
00:57:35,707 --> 00:57:38,277
For God's sake, Jonesey,
we'd be rich!

672
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:40,381
Richer than Howard Hughes!

673
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:42,952
Blood money,
every nickel.

674
00:57:43,021 --> 00:57:45,258
I need you to see
the angle here, mate.

675
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:47,896
Be smart. Do the right
thing. Just like in...

676
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,605
Like in Berlin.
Got me?

677
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:54,776
Just like in Berlin.

678
00:57:54,844 --> 00:57:59,218
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

679
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:03,092
How fortunate our failure
to kill you, Dr. Jones.

680
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,199
You survive to be of
service to us once again.

681
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:09,238
Well, you know me,
always glad to help.

682
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:14,682
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

683
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:17,554
You recognize
those words?

684
00:58:17,622 --> 00:58:19,892
It was your
own Dr. Oppenheimer

685
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,063
after he created
the atomic bomb.

686
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,532
He was quoting
the Hindu bible.

687
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,704
It was nuclear intimidation.

688
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:29,777
But now this next level
of weapon is ours to have,

689
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:31,781
yours to fear.

690
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,287
Weapon? What weapon?

691
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:36,191
A mind weapon.

692
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:39,998
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

693
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:46,845
Now I know why Oxley put the
skull back where he found it.

694
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,180
He knew you were
looking for it.

695
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,285
That skull is no
mere deity carving.

696
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,389
Surely you knew that the
moment you laid eyes on it.

697
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:55,495
It was not made
by human hands.

698
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:57,098
Who made it, then?

699
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:01,674
Come on.

700
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:06,383
The body we found in New
Mexico was not the first.

701
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:10,357
We'd already dissected two others from
similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

702
00:59:10,426 --> 00:59:12,194
Saucer men from Mars.

703
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:14,432
The legends about
Akator are all true.

704
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,937
Early men could not have
conceived it, much less built it.

705
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:19,175
It was a city
of supreme beings

706
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:22,348
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

707
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:24,819
You got to be kidding me.

708
00:59:24,886 --> 00:59:27,925
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

709
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:33,737
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

710
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,908
Unlike the others
we'd found,

711
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:38,078
its skeleton was
pure crystal.

712
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,053
A distant cousin, perhaps.

713
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,691
Maybe they, too,
were sent to find Akator.

714
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,730
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

715
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:52,907
There is no
other explanation.

716
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:54,911
There's always
another explanation.

717
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:59,253
The skull was stolen from
Akator in the 15th century.

718
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:00,923
Whoever returns it...

719
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:02,994
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

720
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:06,000
I've heard that
bedtime story before.

721
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:09,073
It's a legend. Why do you
think Akator even existed?

722
01:00:09,174 --> 01:00:11,644
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN) You should
ask your friend that question.

Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

731
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:48,350
You were born
in Leeds, England.

732
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:51,088
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

733
01:00:51,156 --> 01:00:54,227
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

734
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,235
My name is
Henry Jones, Jr.

735
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,108
What have you
done to him?

736
01:01:01,176 --> 01:01:03,446
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

737
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:06,752
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

738
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,257
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

739
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:11,962
His mind, it seems,
is quite weak.

740
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,066
Let's hope
yours is stronger.

741
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,980
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

742
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:23,218
opening a psychic channel.

743
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:27,393
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

744
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:32,069
We believe you can get through to
him after you have done the same.

745
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:34,940
I've got a better idea.
You look at it.

746
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:38,047
The skull does not speak
to everyone, it seems.

747
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:42,088
Surely you're not
afraid, Dr. Jones.

748
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,760
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

749
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:47,933
Think of the truth
behind those eyes.

750
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:50,571
There may be hundreds
of skulls at Akator.

751
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,243
Whoever finds them will control
the greatest natural force

Power over the mind of man.

01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:04,064
Be careful, you might get
exactly what you wish for.

doing here?

not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

799
01:05:04,686 --> 01:05:06,723
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

it's not that hard.

No, I mean,

I would have a life
after you left.

That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

805
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:22,220
Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

It's me.

Closed eyes mean sleep.

844

The sun with the arc over the
sky stands for time, duration.

mean one thought.

The horizon stood
for the world,

It meant big, great.

"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

the Amazon, of course,

854

but "sleep,"
what water sleeps?

855

Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

Yes, good. Exactly.

No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

880
01:09:34,715 --> 01:09:36,751
Quicksand is a mix
of sand, mud and water.

881
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,655

viscosity, it's not as dangerous

So where's all the gold?

Look at the state
of this place.

What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

Ox was here before, but he
couldn't get into the temple,

1109
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:45,611

the cemetery, where he found it.
