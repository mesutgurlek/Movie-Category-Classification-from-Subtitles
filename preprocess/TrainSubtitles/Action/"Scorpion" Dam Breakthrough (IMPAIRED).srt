This El Niño is a real drag.

6
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:23,588
It's supposed to be

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,190
white Christmas,
not wet Christmas.

Uh, we are working on it.

I don't think the mix

I'm going very south
on Christmas this year.

13
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,868
This holiday nonsense
is killing me.

I think Ralph might say
Christmas is fun.

TOBY:
In a city that collapses

00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,140
into gridlock
over a light drizzle,

17
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:45,109
let alone seven days
of downpour?

18
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,444
Is that your idea of fun?

19
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,645
It is not.

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,247
Christmas spirit.

Apocryphal state of mind

We get it. "Humbug."

23
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,585
Humbug is right.
And it's about to go viral

24
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,687
when Cabe sees the dent
I put in his ride.

25
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,789
Anyway, I got the stupid
ammonium nitrate.

26
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,725
There's one more
bag in the car.

27
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,293
Where's Walter?

28
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,861
Walter, Toby's back!

00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,832
Walter?

30
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,668
No.

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,937
I swear I saw him
go upstairs.

32
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,373
I mean, it's not
a definitive failure.

33
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,874
I have put
some thought into this.

34
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,611
What if there was a way to take
the technology, and then...

35
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,380
Um, are you on the phone?

36
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,282
Huh? No.

37
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,584
Oh, so you were just talking
to Ferret Bueller?

38
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,718
Does he answer back?

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,987
Has Toby returned
with my ammonium nitrate?

40
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,622
He did.
Happy took it from him.

41
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,257
Okay. We should be ready.

42
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,993
Hold that.

43
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,395
Give me that.

44
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,297
Um, you do realize you were just
talking to yourself, right?

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,066
Must have been running
some calculations.

46
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,368
(ferret chittering)

47
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,103
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

48
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,441
PAIGE:
Whoa.

49
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,976
Where did this
come from?

50
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,077
It's my proprietary formula.

51
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,579
Now, this non-melting
snow project

52
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,714
could be
a massive windfall.

53
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,217
Imagine every ski resort
using non-melting snow

54
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,620
to cover their mountains
every seven or eight years.

55
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,221
The patent could
be worth billions.

56
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,157
This is snow density test A-1.

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,959
Now, on the count of three,
give me a hard shove.

58
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,127
Down a steep, icy ramp?

59
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,595
That would make me
an accessory to homicide.

60
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:12,863
And ferret-cide.

61
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,299
Or an assistant to
a groundbreaking discovery.

62
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,334
Now think positive.

63
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,635
CABE:
Hey, gather up!

64
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,070
We got an emergency!

65
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,705
And you...

66
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,773
what the hell
happened to my SUV?

67
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,542
It was Christmas.

00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,877
MAN:
<i>The situation is at</i>

the Augustine Power Station
on Mount Baldy,

70
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,781
and it's about to go critical.

71
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,016
I'm gonna send you a password

72
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,951
so you can access the
surveillance photos of the...

73
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,319
Don't bother,
I'm already in.

74
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:37,822
Wow, big tree.

75
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,924
Yeah, that 50-foot pine uprooted

76
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,792
and crushed
the power station wall

77
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,160
like it was made of sugar.

78
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,363
Yeah, the root system on
these pines can't handle

79
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,298
that sort of precipitation;
they just let go.

80
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,632
This rain is killing us.

81
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:51,802
Augustine DWP
has 58 repair crews,

82
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,704
all working 18-hour shifts,

83
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,406
and we can't get anyone
up to Augustine.

84
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,775
If that transformer
gets flooded and shorts,

85
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,378
100,000 people
lose power on Christmas.

86
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,879
Why us?

87
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,448
We're getting sporadic contact
from the computer system,

88
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,183
so that needs
rebooting or repair,

89
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,252
and we also need
engineering for the roof.

90
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,321
All up your alley, right?

91
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,655
I guess word's gotten around

92
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,090
how good
and professional we are.

93
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,726
Christmas Eve
is triple time.

94
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,863
It's a very important
holiday to me.

95
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,564
We'll be happy to help.

96
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,532
Walter, do you think...

97
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,634
There might be
a chance to show that...

98
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,269
Walter?

99
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,637
(mumbling)

100
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,139
Walter!
Yeah.

101
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,373
Uh, sorry.

102
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,875
Uh, Mr. Woodbury,
once we get there,

103
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,209
we can easily run

104
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,344
a system diagnostic.

105
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,012
Happy, check my engineering.

106
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,115
Now, if we can float a large
enough tarp over the structure,

107
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,617
we can give
it a new roof

108
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,419
and improve the
surrounding drainage

109
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,120
to prevent a mudslide
from this hill.

110
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,055
Why do you think
that hill's in danger?

111
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,757
Uh, surface area of the soil,
volume, porosity.

112
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,392
Standard geomorphology.

113
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,427
Okay, decent engineering,

114
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,895
but where do we get
the big balloons?

115
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,997
Didn't your father used to sell
used cars at his garage?

116
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,231
Yeah.
Then we're covered.

117
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,834
Okay, we will be at
the power station in an hour.

118
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,403
Now, we will need three cars
to gather the equipment.

119
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,038
I'll explain why
on the way.

120
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,478
Second time this morning I've
heard him talking to himself.

121
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,713
Ever since Megan died.

122
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:10,848
It's getting worse.

123
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,050
I'll ride with him.

124
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,153
(thunder rumbling)

125
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,858
(sighs)

126
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,560
You work with
the world's best mechanic.

127
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,396
You ever think to ask her
to fix this jalopy?

128
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,597
(mouthing)

129
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,998
Something
on your mind?

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,733
You're moving your lips
and nothing's coming out.

131
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,068
I'm running ideas, numbers.

132
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,403
What's the big deal?

133
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,672
It's just a new development.

134
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,340
And an odd one.

135
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,145
Can't shut you up today.

136
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,782
Do you at least have something
to dry off my leg?

137
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,883
Don't open that. Please.

138
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,087
Whoa.

139
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,789
What's so important about this?
Don't shake it.

140
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,057
Don't shake that, Toby!

141
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,326
Please, don't, don't.

142
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,061
Oh, God.

143
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,497
I told you not to open it.
But what you didn't say

144
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,898
was that your sister
was in there.

145
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,833
Well, I haven't had
the opportunity to spread them.

146
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,935
So you're keeping them
in the glove compartment,

147
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,103
in a coffee can?

148
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,972
The urn they gave me was black.

149
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,173
Megan hated black.

150
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,975
It's safe in there.

151
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,977
And that's enough on this topic.

152
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,481
(Sylvester humming)

153
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,852
Got a song
in your heart?

154
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,422
I'm just thinking about Megan.

155
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,857
And you smile about it?

156
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,592
Absolutely.

157
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,728
Even close
to the end,

158
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,530
when there was music she wanted,
we listened to it;

159
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,764
a book, I'd read it to her.

160
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,533
We were together
for a short time,

161
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,136
but we didn't waste
any moments, so...

162
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,905
there's nothing to regret.

163
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,240
Why?

164
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,375
What are you thinking about?

165
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,044
Nothing.

166
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,551
Excellent.

167
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,952
Now we have a break in weather.

168
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,987
Okay, let's set up
balloons and tarp.

169
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,822
Helium tank goes over there.

170
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:01,191
Now I'm gonna go inside and
start a computer diagnostic.

171
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,393
Happy, pick the lock.

172
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,327
We'll float the tarp

173
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,095
over the building
in under an hour.

174
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,363
TOBY (quietly):
You're not gonna believe

175
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,799
what's in his glove compartment.
Gloves?

176
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,734
If it was gloves, do you
think I'd be whispering?

177
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,270
He's got a can of Chock
Full 'O Sister in there.

178
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,438
What?

179
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,909
(whispering)

180
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,879
Oh, boy.

181
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,350
All right, let's get a move on
before there's another downpour!

182
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,686

183

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,002
CABE: All right, let's connect
it and turn on the valve.

185
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,003
(inhales)

186
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,671
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,609

194
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,202
Okay, so...

195
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,071
once this balloon is inflated,
we can lift everything up,

196
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,539
and the tarp will
cover the building.

197
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,341
All set. - Ready to roll.
Sure thing.

198
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,011
Okay, so the computer system
is back to full operation.

199
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,147
Now, one electric transformer
suffered water damage

200
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,483
from the roof rupture,
but I shut it down,

201
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,051
and the backup is compensating.

202
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,253
(Toby sighs)

203
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,622
It's the unexpurgated buildup
of stress and grieving.

204
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,225
His internal monologue
has gone external.

205
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,860
What's going to
get him out of this?

206
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,495
TOBY:
Well, if it was 1940,

207
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,063
shock therapy.

208
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,098
Past that, until he's willing
to deal with Megan's death,

209
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,400
there will be no progress.

210
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,734
He has to want it.

211
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,606
We're back online.

212
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,807
Okay.

213
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,211
Um, can I get
a minute?

214
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,080
I think that
this construction

215
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,082
should protect
the building nicely.

216
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,984
TOBY: Yeah,
it's pretty traditional.

217
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,485
I-I want to ask you
something else.

218
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,787
(loud rumbling)

219
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,889
Earthquake?

220
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,223
No, that was a pressure crack

221
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,592
from concrete
at least 15 feet thick.

222
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,830
I know my concrete.

223
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,399
Isn't there a dam
about a mile away from here?

224
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,571
(vehicle doors closing)

225
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,572
There. Mudslide.

226
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,973
WALTER:
It must have poured

227
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,308
millions of gallons
into that reservoir.

228
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,676
HAPPY: It's well over
the capacity line,

229
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,178
and there's a crack
in the dam face.

230
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,846
Is the dam gonna fail?
SYLVESTER: Is anyone else

231
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,081
thinking about the little town
down in the valley?

232
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,882
TOBY:
It's more like a small city.

233
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,251
Augustine has close to
100,000 people.

234
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:44,288
We need to get into
that dam's control room now.

235
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,522
Wait, why is no one here?

236
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,724
HAPPY: Most dams aren't
manned full-time,

237
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,660
and most definitely not
on Christmas Eve.

238
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,663
Okay! We're in!

239
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,568
(computer beeping)

240
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,240
The reservoir is
at 110% capacity.

241
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,541
This facility is run
by Augustine DWP.

242
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,043
We need to call our contact
right now.

243
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,845
CABE:
Just got off with him.

244
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,379
Flash floods took out
the only two roads

245
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,547
leading in and out
of the valley.

246
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,782
He can't get his crew up here,

247
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,916
and a chopper couldn't
make it up in the fog.

248
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,151
The town needs
to evacuate.

249
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,452
We need to get word
to the police

250
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,687
and the fire department.
They know.

251
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,888
They're holding back
the information

252
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,022
till they figure out a way

253
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,524
to evac 100,000 people
with no roads.

254
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,059
You've got to be kidding me.

255
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,827
Realistically, there's no
leaving the valley for 24 hours.

256
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,230
(loud rumbling)

257
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,099
Come on, come on.

258
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,636
I haven't seen a crack
that terrifying

259
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,138
since my proctology rotation.

260
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,340
Based on some quick
calculations for water volume

261
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,841
and the structural deficiencies,

262
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,278
I'd say we have 68 minutes
until the dam collapses.

263
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,747
Down there cooking hams
and trimming trees,

264
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,582
they have no idea how much
danger they're in.

265

267
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,877
Okay, so we have two problems:
the immediate and the eventual.

268
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:07,846
Immediate-- there's
a current crack in the dam.

269
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,181
We fix it, we buy time
to address the eventual.

270
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,248
The overflow.

271
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,084
Which, given the
tremendous weight from

272
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,685
the extra water volume,
will cause another crack

273
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:15,753
or topple the dam outright.

274
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,021
Killing 100,000 people.

275
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:18,255
I think it's insane
not to start an evacuation.

276
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:19,323
WALTER:
Not without viable roads.

277
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,558
There'll be panic, car wrecks,

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,026
and then when we're successful,

279
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,362
we'll know that that is
statistically unnecessary death.

280
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:25,796
Can you guarantee
we'll be successful?

281
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,932
I can guarantee that we're
the only shot those people have.

282
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:28,999
Damn it to hell.

283
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,368
Dam puns
at a time like this?

284
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,303
Not intentional.

285
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:34,572
(Walter mumbling)

286
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,644
Walter, not a good
time for that.

287
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,813
Mimicking nature
might be a possibility.

288
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,048
So, Toby, if there
is a rupture

289
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,916
in the body, a cut,
how would the body respond?

290
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:46,784
With clotting.

291
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,452
How do you clot water?

292
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,621
By freezing it.
The whole reservoir?

293
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,490
We're in the Southwest,
not the South Pole.

294
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:55,126
No, an isolated,
endothermic reaction.

295
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,594
Now we freeze just

296
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,162
the water directly
behind the crack,

297
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,030
so it will stop pouring
for long enough

298
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:03,134
for us to repair the wall
with a quick-drying concrete.

299
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,435
Concrete I can handle.

300
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,871
There's got to be a bag
up here for small repairs.

301
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,272
When I worked for my
grandfather's masonry company

302
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,141
in high school, he used
to add chalk to it

303
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:11,542
so the concrete
would dry quicker.

304
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:12,543
HAPPY:
Calcium carbonate.

305
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,577
Smart man.

306
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,745
So we have that covered,

307
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:16,280
but freezing a section of water
in the reservoir?

308
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:18,516
The ammonium nitrate for
the non-melting snow.

309
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:20,918
I never took the last bag
out of Cabe's SUV.

310
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,154
Okay, so we have enough for one
block of ice just one time,

311
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,488
which will
melt quickly.

312
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,856
Okay, we'll get it right
the first time, then.

313
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:26,824
Let's move.

314
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:27,825
Hey, hey, a quick question.

315
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:28,793
How do we get the concrete

316
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:29,827
through the crack
in the dam face?

317
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,028
There is a winch and a harness

318
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,563
on the dam's walkway
for repairs,

319
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:34,231
but someone will need
to rappel down.

320
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,800
Down a 200-foot face?

321
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:36,867
Here's the thing.

322
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,369
I have sciatica.

323
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,539
100,000 people are gonna die
if we don't take care of it.

324
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:44,842

325
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,144
Thank God.

326
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:50,181
Okay, the concrete
and chalk mix is ready.

327
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:53,150
About to load the sprayer.

328
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:54,919
Okay, 40 feet down
inside the crack,

329
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:57,621
approximately half a liter
of mixture, give or take.

330
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:00,024
Anything in that skull worth
discussing with actual people?

331
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:02,526
I'm filling
this section of pipe

332
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:05,296
with ammonium nitrate
solution.

333
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:08,199
We'll feed it down on the water
side of the dam to the crack.

334
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,203
Once it's released,
it will freeze a block of ice

335
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,572
inside the dam wall,

336
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:15,739
approximately 100 square feet,

337
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:17,875
and it will melt
in about 90 seconds.

338
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:20,878
I got 90 seconds
to fill that whole rupture?

339
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:22,980
Okay.

340
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:24,014
All right, let's move.

341
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,082
WALTER:
I don't think

342
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,117
muttering calculations
makes me less efficient.

343
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:29,053
It's the symptomatology
that's concerning.

344
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,021
It's not making me less
efficient, so please keep

345
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,990
your dime-store
psychoanalysis to yourself,

346
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,826
so that I can focus
on saving the dam.

347
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,027
With the number
of degrees I have,

348
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,195
it's more dollar-store
psychoanalysis.

349
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:41,065
Just FYI.
Can we please focus?!

350
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,400

Okay, good. Now hurry,

'cause if the ice melts
before you're done,

374
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:40,818
the water will gush back out

375
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,687
and knock you
out of your harness.

376

swinging around down there?

He leaves even part
of the crack unsealed,

381
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,542
when the ice melts,
the water pressure

382
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,077
will rip out
all the repair work.

Toby?

413
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,819
CABE:
What are we looking at?

414
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,688
A problem in the form of a clog.

415
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,324
Debris from the mudslide's
blocking the output pipe.

416
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,658
So the reservoir's not draining.

417
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,627
And if it doesn't drain,
the water builds up,

418
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,095
the pressure builds up--
bye-bye dam.

419
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,897
Capacity's at 110%.

420
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,799
Concrete gravity dams
don't survive

421
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:11,001
over capacity for more
than half an hour,

422
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,103
unless their water level can be
brought down substantially.

423
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,138
Is that even possible?

424
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,606
Not with the output
pipe blocked.

425
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,274
At least we got
a doctor in the house.

426
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,877
Who's got two thumbs
and rocked his G.I. rotation?

00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:21,979
What are you babbling about?

429
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:25,182
This place needs
a dam colonoscopy. D-A-M.

430
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,217
I'm talking about the dam.
I'll explain.

Picture a colonoscope

432
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,466
I'd rather not.
No, Toby's right.

433
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:42,035
We need to clear this like
a plumber clears a sink drain!

434
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,437
Problem is these pipes

435
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,839
are roughly 73 times
the diameter, like...

436
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,507
the length of my wingspan.

437
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,976
Oh, that's some rooter.

438
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,644
Think this place
keeps gear like that on hand?

439
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:54,615
Uh, nope, but we can build one
with an outboard motor.

Uh, that will do.

And with 60 feet of cabling and
the car battery from your SUV,

00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:50,564
You clocking this?

485
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,631
Crystal clear.

486
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,833
Okay, off Sylvester's
calculations,

487
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,068
we have 26 minutes
until dam failure.

488
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,170
You need to get that rig
in the water now.

489
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,672
Let the procedure begin!

490
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,342
(motor whirring)

491
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,585
Okay, there's a fork in the pipe
coming up. Steer right.

492
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,653
Once we clear
this blockage,

493
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:16,590
this water's gonna turn
into a raging river.

494
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,626
So we got to get ready
to clear out quick!

495
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:20,927
Oh, you're about
to hit the clog.

496
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,297
Doc, let 'er rip!

497
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,499
(motor whirring loudly)

498
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,338
So far, so good.

499
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:35,242
Water's already speeding up!

500
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,244
PAIGE:
And the reservoir is going down.

501
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,179
It's reducing stress on the dam.

502
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,581
Whoa, Nelly!

503
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,383
We are stuck!

504
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,421
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

505
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:48,989
Okay. Clarifying the image.

506
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,793
Oh, no.<i> Pinus muricata.</i>

507
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,262
What-what is that,
a fancy word for pine tree?

508
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,663
Uh, this puppy can handle pine!

509
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:57,631
Toby, hit the throttle!

510
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,599
(motor whirring loudly,
Toby grunts)

511
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:04,371
Ah, what did I tell ya?

512
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,674
Let go and get out!
Quick!

513
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,643
(grunts)

514
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:12,846
(grunts)

515
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:15,549
Happy just got pulled in!

516
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,550
Happy!

517
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:17,984
Where the hell does
this thing go?!

518
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,519
I'm going after her!

519
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:20,754
PAIGE: Toby, that goes
straight to the turbine.

520
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:21,988
You'll both be sucked in
and cut to pieces.

521
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,390
Okay, we only have
one shot to save her.

522
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,424
The pipe she's in curves here.

523
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,393
We can beat her to the drain
and catch her!

524
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:27,727
CABE:
You're smarter than that!

525
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:28,695
Trust Walter!

526
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:30,697
He has been talking
to himself all day.

527
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:31,798
Would you?

528
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
Toby, it's her only shot!

529
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:35,902
Based on her size
and lung capacity,

530
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,237
she only has 64 seconds.

531
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,772
Okay, okay.

532
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:41,908
We can make it
and save her in 55.

533
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,844
Here, grab those two sandbags
and follow me!

534
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,912
Okay!

535
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,682
29 seconds
until she drowns.

536
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:51,084
Okay, we have to wait till
the rig goes through the drain.

537
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,920
Otherwise, we risk it
cutting through the catch

538
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:55,055
and then Happy slipping
straight through.

539
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,623
Now, if she gets pulled
down that whirlpool,

540
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,692
oh, it's straight
to the turbines.

541
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,193
That's a tight window;
we're talking seconds.

542
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,661
Ready?
Yeah.

543
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:03,130
Hold on, hold on.

544
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,798
There's the motor.

545
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,299
Wait for it.

546
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:07,834
It's being sucked
into the whirlpool.

547
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,004
Here she comes. Now!

548
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:13,206
Okay.
Happy!

549
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,610
Happy, we got you!

550
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:19,980
My foot's still attached
to the motor!

551
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,851
Help! It's pulling me down!
Come on!

552
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,786
Yeah! I think...

553
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:27,988
I got you.
Come on!

554
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,725
I can't get out!
It's pulling my leg.

555
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:34,594
(coughs)

556
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,766
Oh, it's too strong!

557
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,902
Happy! Cabe, get
her other arm!

558
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:42,936
CABE:
All right, on three!

559
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:45,939
One, two, three!

560
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,975
(all grunting)

561
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:52,179
(coughing)

562
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,248
TOBY:
Come on, look at me.

563
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:58,018
(panting)

564
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,519
Look at me,
look at me.

565
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:00,554
Hey, hey.

566
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:01,988
Are you all right?

567
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:08,195
I'm not really big on
involuntary swimming,

568
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,863
but I'm fine.

569
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,467
PAIGE:
Guys?

570
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:16,603
The turbines are not fine.

571
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,205
(computer beeping)

572
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,773
What's happening?

573
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,275
Uh... two of the three
turbines broke

574
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,476
when the rig went through.

575
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,678
There's only one left working.

576
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,213
Uh, one turbine doesn't
have enough power

577
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:27,581
to drain the
reservoir in time.

578
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,317
We have 24 minutes
until dam failure.

579
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,052
Don't even say failure.

580
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,120
The people in that town don't
know what's happening up here.

581
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,355
Dam doesn't care, Paige.

582
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,923
Earlier, while you were
building the rooter,

583
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:38,458
I went on the city's home page.

584
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,893
This is from yesterday.

585
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,127
Footage of the Christmas parade

586
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,829
in their town square.

587
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:44,598
Have you been
a good girl this year?

588
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,899
Yes.
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

589
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:47,167
PAIGE:
This is what's at stake.

590
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,936
Not population statistics--
people.

591
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,839
Individuals, little girls,
parents, grandparents.

592
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,007
It is Christmas, guys.

593
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:55,642
We cannot let this happen.

594
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,446
Any bright ideas, Walt?

595
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:01,615
(mumbling)

596
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:07,420
Hey, Walt, you missed
a rousing speech

597
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:08,755
while you were
mumbling to yourself.

598
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,123
And the gist of it?

599
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,359
Lots of people need
Walter O'Brien on his "A" game.

600
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:14,294
So I'm not letting you
talk to yourself anymore.

601
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:16,263
You're gonna fight your
nature. Talk to me.

602
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:19,966
You have no idea
how right you are.

603
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,002
This I have often been told.
No, no, no.

604
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,304
The river needs
to fight its nature.

605
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,672
River? What? No, no.

606
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,973
That's not what I meant.
What are you talking about?

607
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,175
The only way to save the dam
and the people in town

608
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,245
is to make the river that feeds
the dam flow in reverse.

609
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,201
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

610
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,012
Okay, explain to me how you
make a river flow backwards.

611
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:52,250
Two miles upriver,
the Kesselman Reservoir

612
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,583
is stable at 48%.

613
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:56,919
Now, if we can force 52%

614
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,522
of our reservoir's water
back up into it...

615
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:01,324
We'll decrease pressure
on this dam just enough

616
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,025
so that failure is
no longer a threat.

617
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:05,061
You know, Doc always says
you have a god complex,

618
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:06,929
and I'm starting
to think he's right.

619
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,230
You're not Moses.

620
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,865
How you gonna part this water?

621
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,100
We fight nature.

622
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:12,501
With a tsunami bomb.

623
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,671
A bomb at a dam
that's about to give?

624
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:16,772
HAPPY:
During World War Two,

625
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,808
the U.S. developed
these bombs in secret--

626
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,644
tectonic weapons to
create monster waves

627
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,279
to wipe out enemy cities.

628
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,047
Won't the bomb blow out the dam?

629
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:25,982
Here.

630
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,117
Okay, so...

631
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,519
the dam ends here.

632
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:34,290
Bedrock starts down here
at a depth of 128 feet.

633
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,826
We drop the bomb here,

634
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,327
using the bedrock

635
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,097
to direct 100%
of the blast force upriver.

636
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,198
Dam safe.

637
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,799
This is nuttier than

638
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,167
George Washington Carver's
lunch box.

639
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,203
Okay, we got to move
theory into practice.

640
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:50,272
Just under 19 minutes to save
the Whos down in Whoville.

641
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:51,407
Don't forget about us.

642
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:52,908
If that dam goes, so do we.

643
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,077
(loud rumbling)

644
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,584
Speaking of which...

645
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:02,885
HAPPY:
Okay, one thing, Walt.

646
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,521
We cannot reverse the river
without stopping it first.

647
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,390
That's right,
but I have a plan for how.

648
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:08,724
Reversing the turbine.

649
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:10,292
That stops it
from draining water out.

650
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:11,994
You-you said
that was a bad thing.

651
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,096
Reversing it momentarily would
take pressure off the dam wall

652
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:16,165
and make it easier
for us to create a tsunami.

653
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,166
But we have to move fast.

654
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:19,735
<i>Now, the road</i>
<i>to the substation</i>

655
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:21,003
<i>that we repaired is still open.</i>

656
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,538
<i>Paige and I will</i>
<i>head back there</i>

657
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,074
<i>to send maximum power</i>
<i>back to the dam.</i>

658
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,375
<i>In the meantime, you two seal</i>

659
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,610
<i>the cracks in the wall</i>
<i>with concrete,</i>

660
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:29,278
<i>'cause if water</i>
<i>kills the computers,</i>

661
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,914
<i>this plan falls apart</i>
<i>and we lose the dam.</i>

662
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,783
<i>Happy and Toby</i>
<i>will build the bomb.</i>

663
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:36,118
<i>As far as</i>
<i>the explosive substance,</i>

664
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,686
<i>she should be able</i>
<i>to find rubidium</i>

665
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:40,322
<i>in the dam's</i>
<i>thermoelectric generator.</i>

666
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,691
<i>Rubidium explodes</i>
<i>on contact with water,</i>

667
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,495
<i>so we'll need to keep it dry</i>
<i>as it sinks to the bedrock.</i>

668
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:49,532
<i>The casing needs to dissolve,</i>
<i>so I'm thinking rock salt.</i>

669
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,534
So, in summary,
we stop the river,

670
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:54,003
drop the bomb, reverse
the river, save the town.

671
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:54,970
Easy.

672
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:56,772
TOBY:
See?

673
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:59,041
Those are the kind of thoughts
you should only say to yourself.

674
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:02,545
PAIGE: Walter, look at
all those Christmas lights.

675
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:04,513
Can we really revert
enough power back to the dam

676
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,116
to save all these people?

677
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:09,885
No. Those Christmas lights are
gonna kill all those people.

678
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:10,441
What?

679
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:11,888
You need to get Ralph
on the phone right now.

680
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:12,955
Get him on the phone.

681
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,356
We're running out of concrete!

682
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:16,192
Happy, how's that bomb coming?!

683
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,393
Uh, slow and steady.

684
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:18,861
You do not rush rubidium,

685
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:21,630
not with all this water around.

686
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:24,200
Now, we need
to turn it to paste.

687
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:25,234
Okay.

688
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:26,702
Oh, no, no, da-da-da.

689
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:29,004
What? You got a faster way
to turn liquid solid?

690
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,873
Considering how explosive it is,
maybe the prudent...

691
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,042
(shrieks)

692
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,080
See? It worked.

693
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:39,782
We're almost done
building a tsunami bomb.

694
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,817
Th-That's a real thing.
I just said that.

695
00:27:44,655 --> 00:27:45,921
SYLVESTER:
Walt, nine minutes!

696
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:47,923
We need that power stat!

697
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,125
Almost there.

698
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,659
We should be calling
the police, not Ralph.

699
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:52,094
They handle
the emergency alert system.

700
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:54,163
No, if we call them,
it will take a half hour

701
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,764
to convince them that
we're not crackpots.

702
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,133
Ralph, have you
accessed the system?

703
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,868
Almost there.
PAIGE: Uh, by the way,

704
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,869
where's your sitter?

705
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,836
Downstairs on her phone.

706
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:02,004
I gave her a soda.

707
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,507
I'm in.

708
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:05,508
WALTER:
Great work, Ralph.

709
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,343
Now send an
emergency alert.

710
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:09,245
It will go out to
every cell phone,

711
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,213
TV and radio in town.

712
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:13,082
And be blunt, so they
understand, okay?

713
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,283
No, no, Ralph.

714
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:16,085
Uh, appeal to
their emotions, okay?

715
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,153
So type these words.

716
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,521
(phone beeping)

717
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:20,789
Cabe, the Emergency
Alert System.

718
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:24,093
"We know this is scary,
but please trust us.

719
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,561
"You must turn off
all your power--

720
00:28:25,563 --> 00:28:28,030
"Christmas lights,
appliances, everything--

721
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,433
so we can divert as much power
as possible to the dam."

722
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:33,469
"We all have families
and loved ones."

723
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,371
TOBY: "Please follow our
instructions, so we can be

724
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:36,772
with them tomorrow
on Christmas."

725
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,207
That must be Walter.

726
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:40,309
That kind of language?
That's from Paige.

727
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:48,884
Oh, no.

728
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:53,489
Don't tell me Toby's right
about the Christmas spirit.

729
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:58,460
Yes! Everyone's turning
off their lights!

730
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,663
Sending over the power now!

731
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,431
Okay, while that's
not a miracle,

732
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:05,000
I will concede that
is miracle-adjacent.

733
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,236
We are super-juiced
over here, Walter.

734
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:08,837
Reversing the turbine.

735
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,973
(computer beeping)

736
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,209
Toby, you have
to throw that bomb.

737
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:14,710
Doc, you ready?

738
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,178
Damn right I am.

739
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:22,451
Okay, that's the mark,
and you got to nail it.

740
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:23,485
Let it fly.

741
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,455
Okay, here goes.

742
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:27,990
(grunts)

743
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,660
Not good.
Not good.

744
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:44,518
We are two minutes away
from complete dam failure.

745
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,153
Toby, you sure
you missed that mark?

746
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:47,254
Well, you saw me box.

747
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,623
How well do you
think I can throw?

748
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,293
If I unintentionally
killed anyone,

749
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,694
I am sorry.

750
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,129
SYLVESTER:
Guys!

751
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:57,698
Bomb goes off in five, four,

752
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,568
three, two, one!

753
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:08,509
Wow, we really suck
at making bombs.

754
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:11,245
Yeah, we also suck at saving
that dam and that whole town.

755
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:13,514
(explosion)

756
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,062
Looks like your throw
was good enough, Doc.

757
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:29,064
(whoops)

758
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:34,702
(laughs)

759
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:35,869
It's working!

760
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,173
Who's the bomb?

761
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:41,241
(laughs)

762
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,910
Uh, what are
the reservoir levels?

763
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:45,045
Uh, Kesselman is at 82%.

764
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:47,848
And we are down to 57, 56, 55%!

765
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,083
We are good!

766
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,417
Well, it worked.

767
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:51,819
Dam structural integrity's
back up in the green.

768
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,487
Someone call Augustine DWP.

769
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:54,788
Let them know
we're in the clear.

770
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,789
On it.

771
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,057
RALPH:
You guys okay?

772
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,126
Yes. Great work, Ralph.

773
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:00,294
Now, why don't you tell everyone

774
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,996
to turn their Christmas lights
back on?

775
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,798
Your mom seems
to really enjoy them.

776
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,601
Oh.

777
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:10,938
I know I really don't

778
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,375
get involved in the holidays,
but this is a welcome sight.

779
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:16,310
Yeah, it is.

780
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:19,346
Uh, you know what else
would be welcome?

781
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,148
And something
you might find that is,

782
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,084
uh, efficient
and rewarding...

783
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:28,022
is opening up a little bit
and sharing with other people,

784
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:30,391
instead of just
with yourself.

785
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:36,397
Walter?

786
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,399
Yeah, sorry.
You were saying?

787
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:43,270
Um, just...
we should be getting back.

788
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:51,345
♪ Up on the housetop,
reindeer pause ♪

789
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,147
♪ Out jumps
good ol' Santa Claus... ♪

790
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:55,649
Okay, let's fire this thing up.

791
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,051
I call first on the sled.

792
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:59,186
Uh, we used up
the ammonium nitrate, remember?

793
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:02,456
Tomorrow, I call
first on the sled.

794
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,757
I'm surrounded by children.

795
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,026
Is that gingerbread?
Can I have some?!

796
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,996
(beep)

797
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:10,464
DREW:
Hey, Paige, it's Drew.

798
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:11,732
I talked to Ralph earlier,

799
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,333
but I wanted to wish you
a Merry Christm...

800
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:15,369
AUTOMATED VOICE: Deleted.
(beep)

801
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,105
WOMAN: Mr. O'Brien,
this is Margaret Crosier.

802
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:19,773
I'm calling from
the Karman Prize committee.

803
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,809
Guys, Karman Prize called!

804
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:23,243
Our panel of judges
was duly impressed

805
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,978
by the research you submitted
on rocketry.

806
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,848
So it's our pleasure
to inform you that you have won

807
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,917
the $15 million grant.

808
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,119
We just need to schedule
a site visit inspection

809
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,322
to make sure your rocket
matches the specs you provided.

810
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,024
Call us as soon as possible.

811
00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:38,625
Congratulations, Mr. O'Brien.

812
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:41,128
And Merry Christmas.

813
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,664
Hey, Walter, ever
been to a dog track?

814
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:46,166
Son, that's life-changing money.

815
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:48,302
Oh, I know this is all very...

816
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,111
Where's the ferret?

817
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:59,379
Huh?

818
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:01,682
Where'd the ferret go?

819
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:06,386
Ferret?! Guys?

820
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:08,222
PAIGE:
You left him

821
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:09,957
in its upstairs cage.
No, no, no. I didn't.

822
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,725
I brought him down and then
I closed the door. Where is he?

823
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,293
Well, he couldn't have gotten very far.
Okay, I'm gonna

824
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,395
go out the back. You start
looking around for him now!

825
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,564
Now!

826
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:23,537
Bueller?

827
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:27,574
(ferret chittering)

828
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,545
Bueller? Oh.

829
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:34,915
I found him! It's okay.

830
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,450
It's okay. It's okay, pal.

831
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:38,819
Nice and safe.

832
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:40,587
Who left the cage open?
CABE: Pretty sure you were

833
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,688
the last one to touch it.

834
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,891
I closed the cage.
I always close the cage.

835
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:45,859
Okay. Well, it's okay now,
'cause the ferret is safe.

836
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:46,894
Well, I could've lost her!

837
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:49,429
Don't any of you
comprehend that?!

838
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:52,065
I don't want that!

839
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:58,539
I don't want to lose her.

840
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,951
I didn't want to lose her.

841
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,494
I didn't want

(exhales)

846
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:42,749
I miss her so much.

847
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,918
I'm sorry.

848
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,589
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is unprofessional.

849
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:50,791

I have a great idea.

853
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:16,783
Okay. Think of it
as a California snowman.

854
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,688
HAPPY: I've been working
on this launchpad

855
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,590
for the last few months.

856
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:24,992
If I knew
we were using it today,

857
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:26,593
I would've painted it
or something.

858
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:28,262
It's perfect. Thank you.

859

CABE:
Okay.

860
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,401
Thank you.

861
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:35,736
Thank you very much.

The sentiment's beautiful,
but $15 million--

someone like you could do
a lot with that.

867
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,353
I built the rocket
so I could win money

868
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:54,788
to help with
Megan's research.
