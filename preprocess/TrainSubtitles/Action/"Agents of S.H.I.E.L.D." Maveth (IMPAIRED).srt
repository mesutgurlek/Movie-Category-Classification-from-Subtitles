Agent Mackenzie, to take Ward
out, I need to cross some lines

7
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,718
the director of
S.H.I.E.L.D. shouldn't cross.

Wake up, Ward.
This is a snark hunt,

jumping out of the Quinjet like that?

56
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,720
I would say he wasn't so
much thinking as feeling ...

57
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,657
- feeling that Ward needs to die.
- And you didn't try to stop him.

I was planning on jumping, as well.

"Our people" ...
what are you talking about?

62
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:53,868
We believe that Ward
took Fitz or Simmons

through the portal with him.

64

Hopefully, Coulson can find
them and bring them back safely.

All we have to do is
take control of the castle

this is the part where
the plan turns to rubbish.

Whatever the new plan, we need to
make sure those Inhumans are safe.

And find Fitz and Simmons.

we got his fancy new plane blown up.

Now, the only way to take the castle
and secure the portal is on the Q.T.

00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:26,025
That means no gunfire and no backup.

12 seconds might not seem like much,
but on that planet,

00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,016
it can be the difference
between life and death.

"Maveth" carved around the castle?

- Death.
- That's right.

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,434
Well, death is the only thing
returning through that portal.

Fitz was just... an offering
to show him the door.

The original machinery
used to open the portal

00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,081
was hydroelectric,

126
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,283
but the nearest river is
almost a half a mile away,

127
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,752
which got me wondering
how they powered it.

- May: Aqueducts.
- Yep.

129

milk outside the door at night?

- Not milk.
- Ah, yes, you're right.

00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:56,732
some kind of alien contagion.
Call themselves Inhumans.

312
00:19:56,767 --> 00:20:00,402
I'm not thrilled about it, but
the wind's blowing that way, so...

313
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:03,405
It's gonna be a bad one!

[Wind howling]

315
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,346
I'm used to it.

316
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:16,984
Simmons told me about an
area called the no-fly zone.

317
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,753
You're leading us there, aren't you?

318
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:21,069
We're already in it.
Stay close.

- Mack: Pretty sure that's us.</i>

321
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,706
Brilliant...
Just confirming it's really us.

322
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:42,510
It is.
You're welcome.

323
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,545
If we're here and we want to go there,

324
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,048
we need to get past about
a dozen Hydra soldiers,

325
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,849
and we need to do it
as covertly as possible.

326
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,318
Copy that.

327
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:55,742
Are we supposed to wait here or help ...
[fighting sounds, groans]

328
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,631
We need to stay hunkered down, sir!

329
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,966
We don't have time for this!

You have a better idea?

Okay. Let's see what we've got.

Unh!

No, Lincoln, don't! There's
no way they didn't hear that.

342

- Come on. We've got to go.
- Did you see that?!

343
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:35,595
I'm bulletproof! Ha!

344
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:38,932

- Fitz....
- Ward took him through the portal.

350
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,004
Come on. We're gonna get him back.

351
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,373
- Andrew's here.
- You saw him?

352
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,043
- He saved my life.
- Andrew or Lash?

353
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,377
Technically, I think it was both.

354
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:01,647
- We could find him, maybe ...
- No. That's not the mission.

355
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:05,117
Daisy, I've got Simmons.
Heading your way now.

No.

362
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,777
You'll never find Fitz without me.

363
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:34,814
- I'm not here for Fitz.
- Maybe.

364
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,716
But you're not gonna
let him die here, either.

365
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:39,719
Fitz is a smart guy.
He'll find his way back.

366
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,454
He'll be dead within the hour.

367
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:45,357
The creature who lives
here can smell blood.

368
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,792
Fitz is bleeding.

369
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:53,432
So are you.
Now get up.

Watch your step.

Left a few breadcrumbs
to find our way home.

375
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,916
Simmons.

376
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:25,052
Hydra knows we grabbed her.
How secure are we in here?

377
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:26,553
Rough estimate? Not very.

378
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:28,573
We've sealed and barricaded
the doors, but Hydra

379
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,557
has plenty of big-boy
toys to smash their way in.

380
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,226
I might be able to reinforce the doors.

381
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,428
You know, using my, uh ...

382
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,697
- my, uh ...
- Amazing new superpower.

383
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:39,400
- Yeah. That.
- Let's give that a go, then.

384
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:40,968

[Footsteps approaching]

386
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:50,741
There she is.
That's what I'm talking about.

387
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:55,179
Now, do you have any idea
how the hell these rocks work?

388
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,914
Is that counting down to a
good thing or a bad thing?

389
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,183
It's the time remaining
until the portal reopens.

390
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,484
And answering your question,

391
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,586
I don't believe we have to
do anything to these rocks.

392
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,122
They're configured so they'll
activate at the designated time.

393
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,557
So that's a good thing.

394
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,526
That depends on whether Fitz
can locate the extraction point

395
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:12,429
- and who or what is with him.
- He'll make it. Coulson's there.

396
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,164
I know, but it's more
complicated than that.

397
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,016
- Ward's mission is to ...
- Where's May?

398
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,402
Oh, no.

399
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:22,940
Dr. Garner is here on the premises.
I spoke with him.

400
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:26,143
- He's actually the one who saved me.
- He's free?

401
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,514
- May must have gone back for him.
- To do what?

402
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,251
I'd say that depends on
what she finds. [Sighs]

<i>When I say "terrible,"
I mean ancient and powerful.</i>

407
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:08,217
It's changed how I see things.

408
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:12,688
I've never believed
I was worth anything...

409
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:15,291
that what I said or did had any meaning.

410
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,293
Maybe that's why I'm a spy.

411
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:20,897
Or why I agreed to come here.

412
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,566
If you're trying to talk me out of this,
you can save your breath.

413
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:27,270
I'm not looking for mercy or absolution.

414

I just want you to know,
I've been where you are right now.

Filled with rage, wanting revenge...

416
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:41,584
I chose Hydra for petty,
personal, selfish reasons ...

417
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:45,688
for a father figure, for vengeance...

418
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:47,657
for closure.

419
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,029
But what I saw today
gave my life meaning.

420
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:58,133
<i>For the first time ever,
I have a sense of satisfaction</i>

421
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,138
that I never experienced
when I was seeking revenge.

[Gunshot]
[Inhales sharply]

423
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:10,445
Got to say,
feels pretty satisfying to me.

424
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,306
Now turn around and keep walking.

425
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,384
You know, everyone had this place wrong.

426
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,388
It isn't death.
It's a new beginning.

427
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:24,493
Malick was right.
This is all meant to be.

428
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:30,165
And the fact that you followed me here,
that we're in this together,

429
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:35,737
that just confirms the fact
that I am part of a grand plan.

430
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,090
I see that now.

431
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,682
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

432
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:43,775
You will.

433
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,019
Malick sent Ward to bring
back some ancient Hydra god?

434
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:55,323
Well, he didn't use those exact words,
but that's the general idea, yes.

435
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,325
It's why he had the
ATCU collect Inhumans,

436
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,227
why he shipped them
here to the castle ...

437
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,629
as some kind of army
for this powerful alien.

438
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,232
Look, we all want Fitz and Coulson back.

439
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,235
What if that thing comes back, too?

440
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,370
Your mother was terrified
of the Monolith for a reason.

441
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,205
You think the Hydra thing
is what she was afraid of?

442
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:14,242
Bobbi: When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,
Fury sent us onto the Iliad

00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,077
to keep Hydra from getting
their hands on that Monolith.

444
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,930
What if he knew that
they wanted to bring

445
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,749
- this creature back through it?
- Oh, come on.

446
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,885
[Scoffs]
What, an ancient alien god?

447
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,287
Are you people hearing the
words coming out of your mouths?

448
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:30,691
- The world's changing. Deal with it.
- You were there.

449
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:35,529
- Did you see it? What's it like?
- I did see it.

450
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,164
But I can't really describe
what it looked like.

451
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,167
It's more how it felt,
which is old and pained,

452
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,269
as if it once had
great power but lost it.

453
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,405
And the entire planet is a wasteland.

<i>I can't really say, not
in any scientific terms,</i>

456
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:52,880
but my sense and certainly
Will's heartfelt belief

457
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,517
was that the creature is
the one responsible ...

458
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:58,886
that it caused the desolation.

459
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,492
- We have to destroy all this.
- You mean once Fitz and Coulson

460
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:06,927
find Will and come back through.

461
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,230
I mean, what if they're not
the ones who come back through?

462
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,832
We can't risk that!

463
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:14,000
Whatever we decide to do
isn't the end of the mission.

464
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,203
There are a dozen
Inhumans in this compound

465
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:19,139
- that we can't leave behind.
- May: Yes, you can.

00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,577
They're dead.
Lash or Andrew ...

467
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:27,080
honestly, I'm not sure
there's a difference anymore...

468
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,248
he killed them all.

469
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,165
Sir, S.H.I.E.L.D. has
infiltrated the castle,

470
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,501
barricaded themselves
inside the portal chamber.

471
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,293
<i>We need to get you off the premises.</i>

472
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,406
You have less than 15 minutes
to breach their barricades

473
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:54,807
and regain control of that chamber.

474
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:57,977
- Sir, I really ...
- That's an order, soldier.

475
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,698
Hold up.

476
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,959
How long before that portal opens?

477
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:40,884
There's a timer on my watch.

478
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:57,670
Come on.
We need to move faster.

479
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:01,206
I could move faster
if you hadn't shot me... twice.

480
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:04,843
[Loud thud]

481
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:05,944
What's that?

482
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,779
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and guess Hydra.

483
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:09,948
We reinforced the barricades,

484
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,084
but it won't take them
long to break through.

485
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,952
[Loud thud]

486
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,188
No way they're taking us again.

487
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:17,856
We can't destroy it before
Fitz and Coulson return,

488
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:18,891
not when we're this close.

489
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:20,959
What if the creature
comes through instead?

490
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:23,862
- We'll be waiting for them with these.
- And what if we can't kill it?

491
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,931
Can't speak for everyone,
but I'll probably run.

492
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:29,301
Get everyone through the tunnel
and back up to Zephyr One.

493
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,375
I'm going to stay here until
the last possible second

494
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,766
for Coulson, Fitz, and Will.

495
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,525
Now, if Hydra or that alien
thing gets inside here,

496
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,493
you light this castle and compound up

497
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:39,419
- with every missile on that plane.
- Daisy: What? No, I'm not...

498
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:42,544
Or Bobbi and I can cover
a couple of the barricaded entrances,

499
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,169
buy us enough time
for the portal to open.

500
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,460
Yeah, I'm down with that plan.

501
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:46,617
if Hydra tries to get through
the barricades, I can ...

502
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:47,907
<i>Mack: Hey!</i>

503
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:50,866
What part of "that's an order"
do you not understand?!

504
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:54,125
Coulson put me in charge
to make the hard call,

505
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,493
and that's what I'm doing.

506
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,296
We can't afford to lose our
best agents in one fell swoop ...

507
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:59,998
not here, not tonight!

508
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,500
Now, if I don't get out...
May's the new director.

509
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:11,485
<i>- That's what Coulson would want.
- Okay.</i>

510
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,379
But one thing ...
I'm staying with you,

511
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:17,315
because, "a," I can keep the portal
open if something goes wrong,

512
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,450
and, "b," I'm your partner.

513
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,902
Technically, that's two things.
[Loud thud, rumbling]

514
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,658
Daisy stays.
Everyone else, get the hell out of here!

515
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:29,025
[Music]

516
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,106
- Is your leg gonna be okay?
- I don't really feel it.

517
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:44,075
The portal's just over this rise.

518
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,011
It's gonna be close, but I
think we're gonna make it.

519
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:51,382
Jemma's gonna be
really happy to see you.

520
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:53,952
This must be very difficult for you.

521
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:57,939
Getting you off this godforsaken
planet is all that matters...

522
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,365
Jemma never told me there was
an ancient civilization here.

523
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,468
[Cellphone beeps] She never saw it.
We're still in the no-fly zone.

524
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,670
[Camera shutter clicking]

[Wind whistling]

526
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,315
What else do you know
about the ancient city?

527
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,984
What happened to it ...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

528
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,355
Hey, hey. Hang on, hang on.
Let me fix that.

529
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,057
There used to be nine
cities on this planet.

530
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,826
The beings who lived
there were fairly advanced.

531
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:38,663
But they feared change.
They were easily divided.

532
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:42,133
They warred among themselves,
destroyed their entire race.

533
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,704
You seem to know a lot about them.

534
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,341
They had a chance to become something

535
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:53,011
great, something beautiful, but...
in the end...

536
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:57,515
How do you know so much about ...

537
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:01,786
Because I was there.

538
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,688
[Exhales sharply]

539
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:07,525
- You're not Will.
- No.

540
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,029
Will died saving Jemma...
from me.

541

548
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:08,590
Bobbi.

549
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:12,661
Looks like Hydra's inside the castle.

550
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:16,631
They're gonna make it, right?

[Thudding, rumbling]

552

- That's just them getting closer.

00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:26,341
Okay, tremors, let's hope this works.

Forgot about this part.

Get out of here. I
can handle everything.

559
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,209
I'm not leaving. I'll be fine.

560
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,280
Did you see that?

561
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,918
One minute left.
We don't have much time.

562

up instead of our peeps.

Anything other than
our people comes out,

565
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,629
we give May the high sign
and blow it to hell.

566
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,564

It's open. There's the portal.

00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:58,302
- That's good.
- But that's not. Hydra's almost in.
