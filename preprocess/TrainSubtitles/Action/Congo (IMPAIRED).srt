- I can't repeat it here.

4
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,079
- It's Charles.
- It's Charles.

5
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,150
- It won't work.
- You changed the code already?

6
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,828
The old man's got me changing it
every three hours now.

7
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,033
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
- Very inventive.

8
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,991
We should have a visual momentarily.

9
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,668
- They said they found it.
- You're kidding?

10
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,078
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the
right one. His luck's finally changed.

- <i>Karen?</i>
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

<i>Well, eureka and all that.</i>
<i>I found the bloody thing.</i>

Charlie, I think this
may be really something.

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,229
- We haven't got much time.
- I'll show you.

34
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,756
Jump in.

35

- I'll go first.

This is a big deal, Charles.
This is a big find.

I can't believe
it's just sitting here.

- He found it. He was right.

- Has he found a source?
- Jeffrey's into it.

Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

- Activate the remote.
- Yes, sir.

Charles. Charles!

67
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,997
- I'll get help.
- You can't get out. I changed the code.

- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

- What's the code, sir?
- Do what I say!

- No one knows this happened but us.
- Families must be notified. Your wife.

72

We didn't see him.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

- Baboon.

- I need those diamonds, Dr. Ross!
- Are you for real?

It's the future.

Most people think

I've got 40,000 people working

81
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,114
This satellite is our
communications cash cow.

82
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

83
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,313
Charles knew it. That's why he went
to that godforsaken place.

84
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,590
Charles went into the Congo
to please you.

85

- I know you had feelings for him.
- I almost <i>married</i> him.

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,071
Listen to me. I'm talking like he's...

87
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,077
You have to go down there, Dr. Ross.

88

You're good in the field.
You were good in Panama.

89

Once you're local, the laser's power
pack should give off a readable signal.

- Take over an existing expedition.
- What are you talking about?

91

There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

Never mind, I'll have some waiting.

OK. But if I have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

No, Amy, on the paper.
Yeah. Good.

- No nightmares?
- Not a one.

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,994
Good girl. That's my Amy.

116
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,910
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.

117
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,391
When we started out it was so simple.

118
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,878
Communication was what separated
human from animal. Speech.

119
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,949
And for those who had an impairment
which inhibited speech - sign language.

120
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,197
An alphabet in gestures.
Words in motion.

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,197
Then came virtual reality.

122
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,633
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.

123
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,195
Professor Arliss Wender at MIT

124
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,313
was the first scientist to apply
this technology to sign language.

125
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,150
<i>Our subject, William,</i>
<i>was born without the organs of speech.</i>

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,158
<i>Isn't that right, William?</i>

127
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,148
<i>That is absolutely right.</i>

128
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,797
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>I have ever heard my own voice.</i>

129
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,877
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

130
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,871
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlor trick. A gag.

131
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,310
But it's no gag, ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,715
With this new technology
I can demonstrate it

133
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,276
in a way that it hasn't been possible
to demonstrate it before.

- It's spooky. Very spooky.

147
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,990
Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

148
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,749
What she has learnt, other gorillas
have learnt and can learn,

149
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,958
but it takes money, of course.
Isn't that right, Amy?

152
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,152
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
- She won't be fine. Nightmares again.

153
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,954
It's happened before. Gorillas
in captivity degenerating mentally,

154
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,276
having to be destroyed.

155
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,029
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?

156
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,151
Hey, hey...
What's this room starting to look like?

157
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,113
- She's been painting the jungle!
- I don't know, Peter.

158
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,594
She wants to go home.

159
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,999
Peter, you did a great job.
You taught a gorilla to talk, to paint.

160
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,954
You can get a grant for anything
for Amy except for setting her free.

161
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,833
How about this? I taught her,
now she can teach them.

162
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,553
- Who?
- The mountain gorillas.

163
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,558
Teach an animal to talk and we can
translate what other animals are saying.

164
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,797
Oh, please!
Making you what, Dr. Doolittle?

165
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,551
No foundation would fund
an expedition with that objective.

166
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,716
I will pay.

167
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,198
- I will pay for Amy to go home.
- And who are you, sir?

168
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,437
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

169
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,710
Free now
of the chains of Ceaucescu.

170
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,992
Traveling the world, doing good.

171
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,315
- A Romanian philanthropist?
- Herkermer Homolka.

172
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,795
- Something's voodoo.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

173
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,678
- I don't know.
- It hasn't penetrated.

174
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,677
We're taking Amy home.
Get packed.

175
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,350
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?

176
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,189
- <i>Jungle. Me jungle.</i>
- She's really excited.

177
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,674
Are you excited?

178
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,871
- Me? I'm terrified.
- <i>Jungle.</i>

179
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,356
Safari? I don't even like picnics.
Nice glasses.

180
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,630
<i>Jungle. Me, jungle.</i>

181
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,152
- That's right. Jungle. Home.
- <i>Tickle me. Tickle me. Tickle me.</i>

182
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,232
Come on, time to go.

183
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,750
Someone looking for me?

184
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,074
Herkermer Homolka, hello.
The transport.

185
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,998
Oh, yeah. Um...

186
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,876
- Is there a problem?
- Not unless there's a problem.

187
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,517
Are you excited? That's a camera.
Be careful, it's expensive.

188
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,393
I think she's got a real eye.

189
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,832
- Professor Karen Ross.
- Professor Peter Elliot.

190
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,314
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

191
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,273
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,277
- I'm sorry. You're the one.
- I'm the one.

193
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,473
- It's a hastily put together expedition.
- To the Congo. The talking gorilla.

194
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,238
- <i>Jungle.</i>
- That's right, the jungle.

195
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,590
- <i>Jungle. Tickle Amy.</i>
- Just a minute.

196
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,156
- I need to join up with you.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

197
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,588
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

198
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,314
- I have all the visas.
- This is ready to load on the plane.

199
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,715
- We're taking this stuff off the plane.
- Off the plane?

200
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,150
I can make it worth your while,
pay part of the cost.

201
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,191
Why are they taking stuff
off the plane?

202
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,758
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
- You can easily find room for me.

203
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,748
- It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
- <i>Ugly woman.</i>

204
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,757
- The gorilla?
- She gets jealous very easily.

205
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,999
- Why are you unloading the plane?
- Talk to the operations guy.

206
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,474
- Can't you tell me?
- No.

207
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,959
I have to be on your manifest, or my
visas are worthless. Name your price.

208
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,594
I don't have any. I'm not
a pound of sugar, I'm a primatologist.

209
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,791
Don't be hasty, Dr. Elliot.

210
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,789
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,228
Dr. Karen Ross.

212
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,118
There seems to be some glitch.
They're unloading the plane.

213
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,833
Yes.

214
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,436
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

215
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,030
- I am unable to pay for the fuel.
- I'll pay for it.

216
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,199
- <i>I'll</i> pay for it. How much is it?
- $56,000.

217
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,191
- 56,000? What are you smiling about?
- You need me, Dr. Elliot.

218
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,791
<i>Three-three-zero.</i>

219
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,958
Oakland ground, Omni 901.
I'd like to taxi to the active.

220
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,435
<i>Taxi to runway three-one left.</i>

221
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,315
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>
<i>We've been cleared for take-off.</i>

222
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,798
<i>Make sure that your seat belts are</i>
<i>fastened and luggage safely secured.</i>

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,673
We're returning her to the jungle
from whence she came.

224
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,911
From the look of it
not a moment too soon.

225
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,510
- You're the reason she's upset.
- Me? What did I do?

226
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,679
- <i>Ugly woman.</i>
- Yes. Now let's get your seat belt on.

227
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,429
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.

228
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,191
- We're all buckling our seat belts.
- You can do it. Go on.

229
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,316
That's it.
Good girl. Here's an egg.

230
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,797
- Amy, we do not throw things.
- Is that animal dangerous?

231
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,037
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are very gentle.

232
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,631
You think she may be dangerous?
Maybe so.

233
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,559
- Don't perpetuate a myth.
- What myth?

234
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,956
The King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.

235
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,280
- Are you sure some gorillas don't kill?
- Please. You can't be serious.

236
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,632
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?

237
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,674
- Communications technology.
- So you're a geek with a cellphone.

238
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,510
I'm a scientist. But you
and your protégé belong in the circus.

239
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,717
Just because you came up with
a wad of cash at a crucial moment...

240
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,148
It's OK, Amy.

241
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,831
- <i>Where ground? Where ground?</i>
- It's fine. We're flying.

242
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,875
- We're going to the jungle.
- <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

243
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,471
- No.
- <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

244
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,114
All right, all right.

245
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,959
You'd swear they were married.

246
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,869
The notion of the "killer ape"
may be politically incorrect,

247
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,718
but that's not to say it's untrue.

248
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,069
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Clichés usually contain some truth.

249
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,311
- Are you serving that ape a martini?
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

250
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,798
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story.

251
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,994
Many a bizarre story
containing bizarre truth.

252
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,192
(AMY BURPS)

253
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,033
- I'm sorry I called you ugly. If I didn't...
- I know, it was for Amy's benefit.

254
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,037
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

255
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,349
Why teach an ape to talk?

256
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,032
Why teach anything to anyone? It
doesn't make you rich or get you girls.

257
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,438
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to give it away?

258
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,393
There's an inherent generosity
in the human spirit.

259
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,750
One of its faces
is the face of the teacher.

260
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,670
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?

261
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,236
- No practical reason.
- Then why did you do it?

262
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,595
"A lonely impulse of delight."

263
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,758
- William Butler Yeats.
- Very good.

264
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,437
- Did it work?
- What do you mean?

265
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,995
You're not lonely anymore?

266
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,232
Why are you going to Africa?

267
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,551
To find something I lost.

268
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,469
- There you go. Watch your step.
- Dr. Ross!

269
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,350
- Dr. Ross!
- Hello.

270
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,712
Eddie Ventro. Mr. Travis asked me to
meet the plane, set up your expedition.

271
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,879
- Hers? She's just along for the ride.
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

272
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,437
- Who is this guy?
- Ventro, transportation and equipment.

273
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,872
But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Let's see your new plane.

274
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,275
Let's go. Hold on.

275
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,396
- You want to sell that gorilla?
- No, I don't.

276
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,874
- It's worth a lot of money.
- How much?

277
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
- I can't believe you could ask that.
- I'm just curious.

278
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,796
20-25 grand for a female.

279
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,869
- <i>Amy want to go home. Go home.</i>
- I'm taking you home, Amy.

280
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,958
Whoa, a talking gorilla!

281
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,958
I feel the money hairs
on the back of my neck going "woo!"

282
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,993
Mr. Travis told me
to load you up. The works.

283
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,270
- You know how to use all this stuff?
- I'll get by.

284
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,234
- Do you really need a balloon?
- No, I don't. Let me see that.

285
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,477
- Who are they?
- Hi, fellas!

286
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,148
Fuck if I know.
It don't pay to ask.

287
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,078
We're on our third government
in two years.

288
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,589
- So you're our guide?
- No way. I stay at the airport.

289
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,153
You've got Monroe Kelly.

290
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,591
- Is he good?
- Very good, and very late.

291
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,276
- Holy shit, now what?
- What was that?

292
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,439
I haven't a clue, but why do I feel like
this airport's just gone to shit?

293
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,039
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)

294
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,431
All right, give me your passports.

295
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,794
Excuse me, but we've already got
a guide, Robertson Reynolds.

296

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,154
- Would you! Who's firing on us?
- Kahega!

448
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,828

- Sure.

450
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,357
- Eat this, darling. She'll feel great.
- What do you mean?

451
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,438
Something to keep her calm.
Gorilla Prozac.

- Can we make it to Bondo?
- I don't know.

454
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,873
The last one was a heat-seeker.
We're done.

- Figure it out.

459

- Here.
- Oh, no!

460
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,671
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yes, it is. I'll take Amy.

461
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,033
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it.
- You know how to fly this plane?

462
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,912
The pilot and co-pilot

463
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,429

Go, go, go!

She woke up on the way down.

472

- Sorry, but we have to call this off.

473
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,912
- Pardon?
- I'm in over my head.

474
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,793
- I'm not James Bond.
- I'll take care of you.

475
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,833
I don't want you to take care of me.

476
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,669
Fine. I'm taking a safari
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

477

If you don't want to go, go wherever.

But this is a dangerous place,
and people die here very easily.

Do you think she was drawing
something from real life or a dream?

484
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,913
- I think she was drawing home.
- What about those oval shapes?

485
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,113
- Just a shape she likes.
- Perhaps.

486
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,710
- Video game?
- It gives latitude and longitude.

487
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,755
- More than that, from the look of it.
- Well, it's a gadget. It has features.

- Why did you quit the CIA?
- I never worked for the CIA.

491
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,119
Of course you didn't.
But if you had, why would you quit?

- All right. You can call me Mr. Kelly.

502
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,432
- I wonder what she's about.
- What do you mean?

503
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,758
She's after something.
What you're after, I've got figured.

504
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,439
What she's after, I don't know.

He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

Well, I can tell you
your thoughts, Herkermer.

509

You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

- I've given it up.
- You'll never give it up.

The problem is, it doesn't exist.

Solomon must have got his diamonds
from Cartier, like everybody else.
