1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,274
Thank you.

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,109
I can't believe
you remember that.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,344
What, are you kidding me?

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,913
You singing
"Everybody Hurts."

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,047
Jules:
Oh sorry.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,682
Yeah, my R.E.M phase.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
(Chuckles)

8
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,452
Well, I couldn't take
my eyes off you, so...

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,087
Are you sure it didn't have
anything to do

10
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,588
with what I was wearing
maybe?

11
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,758
Uh, black leather miniskirt,
white tank top...

12
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,593
Seriously though,
you guys were good.

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,594
You coulda went
on the road.

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,262
I don't think so.

15
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,631
Yeah,
I got a confession.

16
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,767
Your best show -

17
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,702
five am,
morning after graduation,

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,836
on the roof
of the gym.

19
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,271
What?

20
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,739
You just got dumped
by Curtis

21
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:45,043
at that party...

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,544
Oh God,
I don't believe this.

23
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:47,946
You took your guitar,
you went up to roof

24
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:50,815
and you came up
with this...

25
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,183
Really gentle song-

26
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,384
you were up there?

27
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,751
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,654
It's just after I heard that
I thought...

29
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,123
I felt like I knew you.

30
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,126
You know there's this
wine tasting thing,

31
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,795
Niagara on the lake,
next weekend.

32
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,030
<i>I was thinking, you know,</i>
<i>maybe we could go.</i>

33
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:08,565
Um...

34
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,133
I mean we don't have
to stay over,

35
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,734
it could just be
a day trip.

36
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:12,635
I was just thinking 'cause
we've been seeing each other

37
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:12,868
for a while.

38
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,806
I... I just-

39
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,407
(loud pop nearby,
someone screams)

40
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,408
What was that?

41
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:20,275
That was gunfire.

42
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,777
(Screaming nearby)

43
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,079
Steve:
Hold on.

44
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,546
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Steve, wait!</i>

45
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:25,547
(Car tires and brakes screech)
Steve: Hey watch!

46
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:26,848
(Tires screech,
horns honk)

47
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,983
Jules:
Stop!

48
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,253
Man:
Somebody's been shot.

49
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,688
Jules:
Winnie, it's Jules.

50
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,023
Oh hey, how are you enjoying
your day off?

51
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,591
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>I've got shots fired.</i>

52
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,294
Inside the Sultan Grill
on the Danforth.

53
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:41,730
Guys! Guys!

54
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,196
Sam: What's happening?
Winnie: Are you okay?

55
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:44,498
We're outside the restaurant
right now.

56
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,100
Is the shooter still inside?

57
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,601
I can't see.

58
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,237
Someone's shot, Jules.
I gotta get in there.

59
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:51,471
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>No, Steve, we need to wait</i>
<i>for backup.</i>

60
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,007
<i>The shooter might</i>
<i>still be active.</i>

61
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:54,474
Sam:
Jules, hang tight!
We're coming!

62
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,209
Team one, hot call!
Suit up!

63
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:57,377
He may be dead
before they get here.

64
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:58,746
Jules:
You don't go in there.

65
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,480
<i>Steve!</i>

66
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:01,981
<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>Shots fired at the Sultan Grill</i>
<i>on the Danforth.</i>

67
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,117
<i>There's one confirmed</i>

68

<i>Gunman:</i>
<i>I warned you!</i>

69

<i>I ask you a simple question,</i>
<i>all you have to do is answer.</i>

70
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,855
Waitress: Eric...
Gunman: Now one more time!

71
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,423
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
tell me where he is!

72
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,159
I don't know!

73
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:15,927
Where's Riyaz?

74
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,296
I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.

75
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:19,398
Where are your hands?
Where are your hands?!

76
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:20,832
No, no cell phones.

77
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,101
Hey, all cell phones
on the floor now.

78
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,970
Now! Go get 'em!
Collect them!

79
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,239
<i>Now!</i>

80
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,408
Anyone caught attempting
to communicate with him

81
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,809
will be shot.

82
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,742
Do you understand me?!
It's gonna be okay.

83
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,444
Total communication blackout.

84
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,712
<i>Steve:</i>
<i>I'm a medic,</i>
<i>I'm gonna help you.</i>

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,913
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

86
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,582
All right.
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

87

<i>What're you doing?</i>

88
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,084
He just wants to make sure
that he's okay.

89
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,919
Okay, well get away.
Come on get away.

90
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,754
Get away from him!

91
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:45,623
You, lock it.

92
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,957
Lock the door!

93
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,292
You, barricade it -
tables and chairs.

94
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,859
<i>Come on!</i>

95
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,895
Nobody's leaving
until I get some answers.

96
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,863
All right.
Okay.

97
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,333
You - knives, forks, uh...

98
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,867
Corkscrews,
any sharp implements.

99
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,836
If I find anything
that can be used as a weapon...

100
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:01,205
Go!

101
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,839
Come on, come on, come on!

102
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,342
That's good.
Get against the wall.

103
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,443
Hands where I can see 'em.

104
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,578
Go! Move!

105
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:12,748
(SUV's rumble up)

106
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:19,654
Set up a perimeter.

107
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,223
Get the uniforms
to keep these people back.

108
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,857
<i>Let's do it now.</i>

109
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,025

We're dealing with at least
one shooter.

110
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,194
Wordy:
How many hostages?

111
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,195
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Ten, maybe more.</i>

112

<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules?</i>

113
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,531
Limited vantage.

114
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,065
Looks like the front doors
are barricaded.

115
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,435
Maybe Jules can feed us
information from inside.

116
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,769
Sam:
No, if that gunman finds out
Jules is a cop...

117
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:40,641
All right.

118
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:41,975
Hey, quiet!
Hey, hey!

119
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,477
You guys clear outta here!

120
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,778
Go!

121
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,414
I want everyone to keep quiet,
I gotta think.

122
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,082
You, on the floor.

123

<i>Knees. Here.</i>

You know what this place is,
right?

126
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:56,289
It's, it's a restaurant.

127
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:58,458
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

128
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,361
It looks very much like
a restaurant, but do you...

129
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,597
(Exasperated exhale)
Do you know what it is?

130

<i>You know what</i>

On it.

You told him not to come

didn't you?
I don't even know who you mean.

00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,575
No, I don't.

163
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,776
But maybe I could help you
find him.

164
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,345
Oh well, he knows him.

165
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:07,380
And if he had just told me
where he was when I asked,

166
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,982
then this wouldn't have
happened.

167
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,583
(Sirens blip and wail)

168
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,317
No, oh no.

169
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,819
(Panicking)
No, no, okay...

170
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,654
Uh, everybody...

171
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,790
Go! Go!
Everybody against the door!

172
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,459
<i>Uh, go to the front.</i>
<i>Everybody, go, go, go!</i>

173
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:21,694
Get to the front.

174
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,696
Go. Get to the front.

175
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,563
Go now!

176
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,299
He's lining up hostages
against the window.

177
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,067
He's making a human shield.

178
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,569
Sam?

179
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:33,705
No vantage.
I'm coming down.

180
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,072
Hey, hey,
what're you doing?

181
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,440
Sir, this man is losing
a lot of blood.

182
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,876
He needs to go
to the hospital.

183
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:39,644
I said no one's leaving.

184
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:40,311
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Okay, well this is my friend,</i>
<i>Steve.</i>

185
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,845
He's a paramedic.

186
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:42,880
<i>If you let him look at him,</i>
<i>maybe he can help him</i>

187
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,548
and then you can find Riyaz.

188

<i>That's what you want,</i>
<i>right?</i>

189
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,050
(Laboured breaths)

190
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:49,052
Yeah.

191
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,591
Just hang in there, buddy,
hang in.

192
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:56,693
Okay,
he's barely conscious.

193
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,827
Look, I'm gonna need
some napkins,

194
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,461
clean water
and plastic wrap.

195
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,330
I can get them.

196
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,933
Okay, go.

197
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,468
<i>Stay where I can see you.</i>

198
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,004
Come on, come on.

199
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,471
Move fast!

200
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:12,909
Okay, we know who
we're looking for.

201
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,045
The owner of the restaurant
is Riyaz Fayad.

202
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,180
Parker:
Good, now let's find out
who's got a beef with him.

203
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,849
<i>Neighbours,</i>
<i>disgruntled employees.</i>

204
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,617
What's going on, Eddie?

205
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:23,919
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>All right, we got an air vent</i>
<i>on the roof.</i>

206
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:25,820
Might be able to feed
a snake cam through that.

207
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,356
All right, go for it.
Let's do it.

208
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,428
Is Eric gonna be okay?

209
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,229
He's got decreased breath
sounds on the left side.

210
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,397
What does that mean?

211
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:37,398
His lung collapsed.

212
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,666
Oh my God.

213
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,401
Look, he needs chest
decompression.

214
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,403
Wouldn't happen to have a kit
in your purse, do you?

215
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,704
Can you improvise?

216
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,940
Yeah, but I need a pen,
I need some vodka...

217
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:46,973
A knife.

219
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,078
A knife.

220
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,312
What do you think I am?
An idiot?

221
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,680
Sir, I promise.
We're gonna hand it back

00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,657
I'm gonna shoot her.

227

Okay, go.

I don't see any other wounded.

259

There's a lot of buzz
on Riyaz Fayad.

260
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,763
<i>Terror watch blogs,</i>
<i>mainstream press,</i>

they're all suggesting

Eddie, Fayad's being
investigated for terrorism.

267
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,776
You think he's connected

Yes. There's a gentleman here,

00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,295
he's looking for a man

Get me his name, Jules.

They'll help you find Riyaz
if you give them your name.

It's Davis Lagosto.

Why do you need
to find Riyaz?

305
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:26,412
Riyaz Fayad is using
this restaurant as a front

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,081
for his terrorist operations.

<i>I'm just here to stop him</i>
<i>before he strikes.</i>

00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:35,054
Tell him Fayad's being
investigation by the ATU.

310
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:38,124
Riyaz is already under
investigation by the ATU -

the anti-terror unit.

312
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:40,893
And if he's a terrorist,

313
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
they're gonna do everything
they can

314
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:42,995
to bring him to justice.

315
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:46,031
No, by then
it'll be too late.

316
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,099
Why?

317
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,366
It's gonna happen
any day now.

now we need to know why.

His name is Davis Lagosto.
You ever seen him?

431

No, I've never seen him
before.

Soldiers are all out
in the middle east, you know,

but where are they
when we need them here?

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,877
Why do we need soldiers
here?

435
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,878
Davis:
There are terror operatives
in every major city

00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,647
in North America.

437

Of course we need them here.

Sounds really scary.

439
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:20,688
He thought his mother
was under orders to kill him.

440
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:23,691
So he came into our bedroom
one night

441
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,693
while we were sleeping,
with a rope,

442
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,663
tied it around her neck,
tried to strangle her.

443
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,266
I'm sorry.
That sounds terrifying, sir.

Gladly.

475
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,488
Wordy, uncuff him.
Ma'am?

476
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,760
Is he on any medication
right now?

477
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:40,830
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>I really don't know.</i>
<i>I...</i>

478
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,998
I haven't seen my son
in over a year.

479
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,867
Why not, sir?

480
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,301
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>The last time I checked him</i>
<i>into the hospital,</i>

481
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:47,769
he got very angry;

482
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:50,472
he thought I was trying
to have him committed.

483
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,207
<i>When he got out,</i>

484
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:55,310
I tried to get him
to come home, but...

485
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,945
He didn't want any part of me.

486
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:59,281
Okay, where's he living now?
Do you know?

487
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,349
Robert:
He's, uh, at Harmony House.

488
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,552
It's a group home.
St. George Street.

489
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,587
Okay, just hang on one second,
Mr. Lagosto.

490
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,821
Get a hold of Harmony House.

491
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,022
I'm sure he's got
a social worker there.

492
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,358
Let's get in touch
with him.

493
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,162
Parker: Mr. Irwin?
Clive: Yeah.

494
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,397
How're you doing?
I'm sergeant Parker.

495
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:17,597
Thank you for coming.

496
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,333
Will you follow me
please, sir?

497
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:22,569
So you're Davis's
primary social worker?

498
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,738
Yeah, I've known him
for over two years.

499
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,872
Look,
this is all my fault.

500
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,307
Davis is my responsibility.

501
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,709
Look, we understand
that Davis has been charged

502
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:30,910
with assault in the past.

503
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:32,279
Now,
these violent outbursts,

504
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:33,545
do they happen often?

505
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,547
He's not some kind of monster.
He's sick.

506
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:37,015
Yeah, I understand that,
Mr. Irwin.

507
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,485
Look, paranoid schizophrenics
are prone to suspicion.

508
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:40,819
If they feel threatened,

509
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,554
they sometimes lash out
to protect themselves.

510
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:43,889
But Davis believes
that terrorists

511
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,891
are planning an attack
on the city.

512
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,559
What did he say?

513
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:49,794
He said that restaurant
is a front for a terror cell.

514
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,230
Has he mentioned
Riyaz Fayad before?

515
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,666
I don't think so,

516
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,101
but he's been talking a lot
about terrorists lately.

517
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,936
Do you know what might have
triggered that?

518
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,406
Terrorism's all over the news
these days.

519
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,241
Bombings in Madrid,
Chechnya...

520
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,375
Yeah.

521
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,478
Eric?

522
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,149
<i>Waitress:</i>
<i>Oh my God!</i>

523
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,551
What's happening?

524
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,487
His pulse is thready.
There's no breath sounds.

525
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,855
Angela:
Oh my God.

526
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:21,090
Come on, Eric,
hang in there!

527
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,758
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

528
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,862
<i>Hang in there, buddy.</i>

529
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,163
Steve.

530
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,532
<i>Waitress:</i>
<i>Why're you stopping?</i>

531
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,267
Help, please!

532
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,902
Tell him to keep going.

533
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,271
<i>Why're you stopping?!</i>

534
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:36,873
I'm sorry, it's...

535
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:37,973
No!

536
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,309
Man: Oh my God.
Davis: Hey!

537
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,877
Is he dead?

538
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:43,411
Yes.

539
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,546
Oh.

540
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:46,648
Oh?

541
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,050
Okay, Angela...

542
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,952
That's all
you have to say?!

543
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,954
<i>Eric never did anything</i>
<i>to you.</i>

544
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,155
<i>Davis:</i>
<i>Okay, shhh.</i>

545
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,688
He harboured
a known terrorist.

546
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:57,391
Riyaz is not a terrorist!
What's wrong with you?!

547
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,860
Okay, she's escalating him now.

548
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,061
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Angela, you know what?</i>

549
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,729
We need to stay really calm
right now.

550
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,265
<i>Davis:</i>
<i>Hey! All right, just shut up!</i>
<i>Quiet!</i>

551
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,499
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Both of you!</i>

552
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,601
You come in here
on a Muslim witch hunt...

553
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,303
No, you're not listening to me,
all right?

554
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,504
This is a front
for a terrorist operation.

555
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,572
You are not listening to me.

556
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:13,974
So then what does that
make me?

557
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,542
All right, oh my God,
you're one of them.

558
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,245
You're a black widow.

559
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,247
So now I'm a terrorist too?!

560
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,915
Aw crap!

561
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,449
Davis:
Everybody, get back!
Stay back, everybody!

562
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:24,851
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

563
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,585
Davis, what do you see?

564
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:27,686
All right, she's got a bomb.
She's about to detonate a bomb.

565
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,088
Angela:
We're all terrorists!

566
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,123
Get down!
She's got a bomb!

567
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:32,224
All right.

568
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,625
Hey.

569
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,094
(Gunshot pops)

570
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,528
Shots fired!

571
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:37,662
Davis: Why'd you do that?
Jules: Are you okay?

572
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,299
I think so.

573
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,867
Oh my gosh!
Steve?

574
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,098
It's Steve.
He's been shot.

575
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,127
Steve.

576
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,128
I'm okay.

577
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,130
Just lay still,
Angela.

578
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:56,765
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules needs backup,</i>
<i>I wanna go in.</i>

579
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,167
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>From where?</i>

580
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:59,969
This back door leads
right into the basement.

581
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,803
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Okay. Sam?</i>

582
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,304
You're just covering on this,
all right?

583
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:04,472
She knows what she's doing.

584
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,774
I know she does.

585
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:08,576
Just saying.

586
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:09,710
Yes, sir.

587
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:14,849
Jules:
We gotta stop the bleeding.

588
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,184
Steve:
(Low pained grunts)

589
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,452
It's okay.
I got it, I got it.

590
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,622
Get back, get back!
Get back!

591
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,491
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>All right, let's slow down.</i>

592
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,925
Shut up! Shut up!

593
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,861
Hands above your head!

594
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,463
Hands above your head!

595
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,964
All right, I know that
you're afraid right now, Davis.

596
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,299
All right,
we have to find something

597
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>to bind her hands and feet.</i>

598
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:34,433
<i>We have to dismantle the bomb.</i>

599
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,834
She's not gonna hurt you.

600
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,603
She's got a bomb!
Are you blind?!

601
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,038
Patron:
Oh my God.

602
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,539
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>He's turning on Jules.</i>

603
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,674
We gotta find a way
to get past his delusions.

604
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,742
He said we needed soldiers here.

605
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,277
Maybe I can talk to him as one.

606
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Go for it, Sam.</i>

607
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,347
But, boss, this place has serious
security for a restaurant;

608
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,882
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>at reinforced steel.</i>

609
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,083
After 9-11, a lot
of middle eastern businesses

610
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,585
have been targets for vandals.

611
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm gonna have
to torch my way through.

612
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,322
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

613
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,393
Riyaz:
This brick was thrown
through our window.

614
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,861
(Reading)
Die Arab pig.

615
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,630
Sayid was in the room
when it happened.

616
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,697
<i>He was terrified.</i>

617
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,799
Go back
to the middle east.

618
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,167
He was born in Vancouver.

619
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,937
Why didn't you report this?

620
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,471
You think anyone cares
about death threats

621
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,107
against a suspected
terrorist?

622
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,577
Why were you accused
in the first place?

623
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,879
Back in, uh... 2004,

624
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,082
I started donating money
to an Islamic charity.

625
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,751
I was told
it was a scholarship fund

626
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,118
for underprivileged kids.

627
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:33,656
I found out later that
the charity was a front

628
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:35,658
used to fund
terrorist activities,

629
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,125
including the London bombings.

630
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:39,261
And from that they assumed
you were the leader

631
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,596
of a terrorist cell?

632
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:42,264
I convinced a lot of other
members of my mosque

633
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,732
to donate
to the same charity.

634
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,935
We thought we were doing
something good.

635
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:50,672
ATU dragged us from our homes
in the middle of the night.

636
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,774
<i>They interrogated us</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

637
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:55,376
They froze our bank accounts,
confiscated our passports...

638
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:56,711
Once it got leaked
to the press,

639
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,846
that's when all the threats
started to happen.

640
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,481
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Hey, Ed?</i>

641
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:01,949
<i>Just got off the phone</i>
<i>with the anti-terror unit.</i>

642
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,350
Excuse me one second.

643
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,720
Any intel
on a possible attack?

644
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,221
No. And they checked
with other agencies -

645
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,556
no chatter, nothing.

646
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,324
And Mr. Fayad?

647
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,659
Spike:
Well, he's gonna be on
a no-fly list for a while,

648
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,260
but they're wrapping up
their investigation.

649
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:15,896
He's been cleared
of any wrongdoing.

650
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,529
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, good to know.</i>
<i>Thanks, Spike.</i>

651
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,533
The ATU is clearing you.

652
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:22,635
What?

653
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,636
Really?

654
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,004
Oh my God.

655
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:27,372
Oh my God! It's over!
(Elated laughter)

656
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,541
Hey, Spike,
a lot of these email threats

657
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,444
<i>are being sent from the same</i>
<i>I.P. address.</i>

658
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:34,846
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I'll run a trace,</i>

659
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,047
<i>see if we can connect them</i>
<i>to Davis.</i>

660
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,029
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>All right, I'm just gonna</i>
<i>change this, okay?</i>

661
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:54,364
Don't try to be the tough guy.
I know what it feels like.

662
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,767
I've been shot before.
I know how much pain you're in.

663
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,702
So, how do you like the date
so far?

664
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,138
You really know how to keep
a girl on her toes, huh?

665
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,007
Wait 'til you see what...
Ungh!

666
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:04,341
I have planned
for the next one.

667
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,977
Woman:
We can't. He's just gonna
start shooting again.

668
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:09,479
Man:
That's why we gotta do it fast.
Disarm him.

669
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,681
Woman 2:
There are a lot of us
and only one of him.

670
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:12,915
Steve, you're shivering.

671
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,618
(Steve shivers)

672
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,053
The room's spinning.

673
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:18,622
Your heart's racing
really fast.

674
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,290
Yeah, I'm cold.
I'm just going into shock.

675
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm gonna go try
and get your jacket.

676
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,894
N-no...

677
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,196
Okay,
I want you to look at me.

678
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:28,531
I want you to look at me.

679
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:31,400
I want you to keep
talking to me, okay?

680
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:32,934
I'm an idiot.

681
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:34,570
You're not.
It's not your fault.

682
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:38,005
No, I mean, I shouldn't have
waited so long to ask you out.

683
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:39,474
Let's save the deathbed
confession

684
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,409
for 50 years from now,
okay?

685
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,411
You gonna be there?

686
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:46,414
(Torch whirs loudly)

687
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,016
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Sam, let us know</i>
<i>when you're close.</i>

688
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,751
Hey, guys,
those threats against Riyaz?

689
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,320
You were right;

690
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,754
the I.P. address traces back
to Davis's group home.

691
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:57,023
So he did make those threats.

692
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,426
Hey, Ed,
take a look at this one.

693
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,261
Okay, boss,
listen to this.

694
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:03,197
<i>With one bomb,</i>
<i>you killed 26 people.</i>

695
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,532
<i>Time for you</i>
<i>and your followers</i>

696
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,766
<i>to get a taste</i>
<i>of your own medicine.</i>

697
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,034
Taste of his own medicine...

698
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,768
Think Davis built a bomb?

699
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,170
His father mentioned
that he had a degree

700
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,572
in chemical engineering.

701
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,207
So why show up at the restaurant
with a gun?

702
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:15,941
Maybe he'd already
planted it somewhere;

703
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,643
he wanted to take the leader out
personally.

704
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,645
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Sounds like Riyaz</i>
<i>wasn't his only target.</i>

705
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,380
Okay, boss, we're gonna head
to the group home.

706
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,416
Okay, Eddie, check Davis's room,
check everywhere.

707
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,350
Find out what he's building
and who he's targeting.

708
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:26,951
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

709
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:27,952
Mr. Fayad?

710
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,087
Riyaz:
Yes, officer?

711
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,391
An officer's gonna take you
downtown for processing.

712
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,126
<i>It's just procedure.</i>

713
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:36,228
Uh, I'll go with you.

714
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,762
No,

715
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,031
you and Sayid go to the mosque.

716
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,700
Pray for Eric and the others
at the restaurant.

717
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,034
Cashmira:
Okay.

718
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:49,240
Man:
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.

719
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:51,275
Get back!

720
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:52,376
Sam, hostages are turning
on him.

721
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:53,510
Get in there now!

722
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,612
Get back against the wall
now,

723
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,946
or I'll shoot you all
one by one.

724
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:57,380
Jules:
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapons.

725
00:24:57,448 --> 00:24:58,448
<i>Drop...</i>

726
00:24:58,515 --> 00:24:59,749
(Glass shatters)

727
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,817
Sam:
Everybody do what the man says!

728
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:05,054
<i>Drop your weapons</i>
<i>and go back to where you were.</i>

729
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,522
<i>It's all right, buddy,</i>
<i>you can stand down.</i>

730
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,625
I got this area of operations
contained.

731
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,060
Go back to where you were, now,
all of you!

732

<i>Do it now!</i>

733
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,229
Who are you?

734
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:16,798
Master Corporal Sam Braddock,
Special Forces.

735
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,500
I'm here to help.

736
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,603
You knew this place
was a front for terrorists?

737

<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Sam, don't lie to him.</i>

738

He's sensitive to deception.

739
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,874
I know what it's like
to feel afraid;

740
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,744
I served two tours
in Afghanistan.

741
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,244
I know what it's like
to walk down the street,

742
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:32,680
<i>and wonder where they're</i>
<i>gonna strike again.</i>

743
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,914
You feel helpless,

744
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,215
like you're never
gonna be safe.

745
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,717
That's what they want -

746
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,586
all of us to live
in a state of fear.

747
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:41,422
Yeah, that's why we gotta
fight back.

748
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,590
<i>You know that operation</i>

major components in both ricin

watch is the timer...

00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,268
But we could really use
your help right now.

789
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,636
We know that made
some kind of chemical bomb

790
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:25,639
and we need to know
where it is.

791
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:27,775
Davis, a bomb like that

792
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:30,511
could kill a lot
of innocent people.

793
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,646
Sam:
I don't think we're gonna
get anything out of him.

794
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,049
Parker:
Get him to the hospital,
regulate his meds.

795
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:37,617
Parker:
Keep an eye on Mr. Lagosto.

796
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:41,020
When he becomes coherent,
you question him again, okay?

797
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:43,556
Eddie, couldn't get anything.

798
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:45,525
You need to tear
that place apart

799
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,761
and figure out where
his next target may have been.

800
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,896
Let the social worker, Clive,
know that he's there,

801
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,431
he's safe,

<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

817

What does that mean,
Spike?

821
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,503
It means someone was using
his computer

822
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,471
as a proxy server.

823
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,605
Davis didn't send
those threats.

824
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:36,807
Someone was setting him up.

825
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:38,308
Can you trace it?

826
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,208
Yeah, I'm running a tunneling

His social worker.

<i>Spike:</i>

Boss, it looks like Clive's
been conducting

836
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:14,976
his own investigation
of Mr. Fayad.

837
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:16,343
What'd you find?

838
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,612
We've got articles
on domestic terrorism,

on Mr. Fayad

Suspected cell members.

842
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,752
Clive's the one who's paranoid
about terrorism.

843
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,387
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I think I know why.</i>

<i>Clive never got over</i>
<i>losing his wife.</i>

847
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:35,461
Ed:
Did he ever discuss it
with Davis?

848
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:36,629
It's funny,

849
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,130
he never talked
about it to anyone,

850
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:41,601
and then a few months ago
they were playing chess...

851
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:44,604
When the bomb went off,
the train split in half.

852
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:48,306
She was thrown
onto the tracks.

853
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:52,176
I tried to go to her,
but I couldn't stand up.

854
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:54,846
Both my legs were broken.

855

(Long drawn out inhale)

856
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:01,252
I didn't know
if she was alive or dead.

857
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:04,955
Her face was turned away.

858
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:09,226
I just kept
calling her name.

859
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:15,032
I'm almost convinced
it's been a bad dream.

860
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,837
(Breathes deeply)

861
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,211
They say that Riyaz Fayad

862
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,649
was connected
to those suicide bombers.

863
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:35,951
There must be a way
to stop him.

864
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:45,260
I mean you can't blame Clive
for how he feels.

865
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,228

Yeah.

868

Sounds like Clive's been
whispering in Davis's ear

869
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,236
for months.

870
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,605
Feeding his paranoia
about an attack

00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,540
and convincing him
to build a bomb.

872
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,075
Well, Davis probably had
no idea

873
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,509
his friend was using him
as a weapon.

874
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,344
Setting him up
to take the fall.

875

<i>Wordy:</i>
<i>One of the residents</i>

No idea.

<i>Just said he's moving fast.</i>

879
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,052
Well, if he was using Davis
to keep his own hands clean,

880
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,519
why would he take the bomb
himself?

881
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,689
'Cause Davis can't now
and the job isn't done.

882
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,523
It's gotta be the mosque.
Remember?

883
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,059
Clive didn't just threaten
Riyaz.

884
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,894
He said, "you and your followers
are gonna get a taste

of your own medicine."

I'm heading up
the medical team.

898
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,211
Any idea what kind of toxin
we're dealing with?

899
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,412
It could be a nerve Agent,

900
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,148
maybe a derivative of ricin
or sarin.

901
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,850
It's hard to be specific
'cause it's a home brew.
