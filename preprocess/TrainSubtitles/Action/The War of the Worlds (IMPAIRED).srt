1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>In WWI, for the first time ever,</i>

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,835
<i>nations combined to fight nations,</i>
<i>using the crude weapons of the day.</i>

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,479
<i>WWII involved every continent.</i>
<i>Science provided new tools of war.</i>

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,639
<i>These reached an unparalleled peak</i>
<i>in their capacity for destruction.</i>

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,037
<i>Now, fought with the</i>
<i>terrible weapons of super-science,</i>

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,233
<i>menacing every creature</i>
<i>on Earth, comes...</i>

7
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,478
<i>No one would have believed,</i>
<i>in the middle of the 20th century,</i>

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>human affairs were being closely</i>
<i>watched by a greater intelligence.</i>

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,877
<i>Yet, across the gulf of space,</i>
<i>on the planet Mars,</i>

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,757
<i>intellects vast and unsympathetic</i>
<i>regarded our Earth enviously,</i>

11
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,272
<i>slowly and surely</i>
<i>drawing their plans against us.</i>

12
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,075
<i>Mars is more than 140 million miles</i>
<i>from the sun.</i>

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,239
<i>For centuries it has been</i>
<i>in the last stages of exhaustion.</i>

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,878
<i>At night, temperatures drop</i>
<i>far below zero, even at its equator.</i>

15
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,790
<i>The inhabitants of this dying planet</i>
<i>looked across space with instruments</i>

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,514
<i>of which</i>
<i>we have scarcely dreamed,</i>

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,679
<i>searching for another world</i>
<i>to which they could migrate.</i>

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,031
<i>They could not go to Pluto,</i>
<i>outermost of all planets,</i>

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,553
<i>and so cold that its atmosphere</i>
<i>lies frozen on its surface.</i>

20
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,710
<i>They couldn't use Neptune or Uranus,</i>
<i>twin worlds in eternal night,</i>

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,914
<i>both surrounded by an atmosphere</i>
<i>of methane gas and ammonia vapour.</i>

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,318
<i>They considered Saturn, attractive</i>
<i>with its moons and rings,</i>

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,799
<i>but its temperature is</i>
<i>close to 270 degrees below zero,</i>

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,312
<i>and ice lies 15,000 miles deep</i>
<i>on its surface.</i>

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,640
<i>Their nearest world was Jupiter,</i>
<i>with giant cliffs of lava and ice,</i>

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,354
<i>with hydrogen flaming at the tops.</i>

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,839
<i>The atmosphere is awful. Thousands</i>
<i>of pounds to the square inch.</i>

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>They couldn't go there, nor to Mercury,</i>
<i>nearest planet to the sun.</i>

29
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,315
<i>It has no air. The temperature at</i>
<i>its equator is that of molten lead.</i>

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,072
<i>Of all the worlds the life forms</i>
<i>on Mars could see and study,</i>

31
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,355
<i>only our own Earth was green</i>
<i>with vegetation, bright with water,</i>

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,759
<i>and possessed a cloudy atmosphere</i>
<i>eloquent of fertility.</i>

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,511
<i>It did not occur to mankind that a
<i>swift fate might be hanging over us.</i>

34
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,716
<i>Or that from the blackness of outer</i>
<i>space we were being scrutinised.</i>

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,277
<i>Till the time we drew close to Mars'</i>
<i>orbit, during a pleasant summer...</i>

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,955
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big.

37
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,108
(EXPLOSION SOUNDS)

38
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,440
- I wonder where it hit?
- Probably halfway to Pomona.

39
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,756
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,952
This is Pine Summit. I got a smoke.

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,870
- 160l30.
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,277
Big? I bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California.

43
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,439
Better get something over there.
It's started a blaze already.

44
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,077
Number Three to D.O.

45
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,195
- <i>D.O. To Number Three, come in.</i>
- We're getting this under control.

46
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,190
<i>Okay, send the tanker in, but you</i>
<i>stand by until that thing cools off.</i>

47
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,077
- Someone ought to check on it.
- <i>There's scientists fishing nearby.</i>

48
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,750
<i>They probably saw it come down.</i>
<i>I'll tell them. What's it look like?</i>

49
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,879
It's too hot to get near enough
for a good look, but it's enormous.

50
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,279
I got a message for you. You're the
guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,231
- Looks like the fishing was good.
- Have some?

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,954
Well, I might just do that.

53
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,155
It's about that meteor.

54
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,310
They say it's a whopper.

55
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,031
They phoned us up on the summit.
I thought you might be interested.

56
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,995
- About 10 miles from here.
- It didn't come down like a meteor.

57
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,476
That's right.
It came down in spurts.

58
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,917
You fellows figure it out.
You're scientists.

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,714
It's big as a house and red-hot.

60
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,030
- I'll borrow your car and take a look.
- We ought to get back.

61
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,631
- I'll fly Bilder back down in your plane.
- Okay, the insurance is paid up.

62
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,991
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.

63
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,468
Did you watch it come down?
I saw it from my window.

64
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,314
Harold, look here a minute.

65
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,115
Step over a little. Smile.

66
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,551
It must have skidded along the gully.

67
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,435
Then the loose earth
shook down over it.

68
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,235
- I guess most of it's buried.
- That's <i>12</i> feet thick.

69
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,797
They run heavy. They won't be able
to haul this one away to no museum.

70
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,229
A good attraction for Sunday drivers.

71
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,999
Better than a lion farm or
snake pit. We won't have to feed it.

72
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,318
- We can sell tamales and hot dogs.
- Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.

73
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,991
- We should put up picnic tables.
- Then they'd bring their own lunch.

74
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,838
- Gonna dig for gold, Buck?
- You think you're kidding?

75
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,397
It’ll be like having a gold mine
in your own back yard.

76
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,034
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,918
- That's it over there.
- It's still pretty darned hot.

78
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,553
- Be careful, Buck.
- Watch it.

79
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,316
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes, I was fishing in the hills.

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,548
- That's a lot of tackle.
- The others flew back in my plane.

81
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,354
Why didn't it make a bigger crater?

82
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,509
It hit sideways and skidded in.
That's what I think.

83
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,190
A scientist's coming, he'll tell us.

84
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,518
- Ever hear of Clayton Forrester?
- What's that fellow trying to do?

85
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,430
He's top man in astro and nuclear
physics. He knows all about meteors.

86
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,510
- You seem to know all about him.
- I did a thesis on modern scientists.

87
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,713
- Did it do you any good?
- Sure, I got my degree.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,117
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't smoke.

89
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,269
They had Forrester on the cover of
Time. You have to rate to get that.

90
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,836
- He isn't that good.
- You don't even know him!

91
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,794
- I do know him, slightly.
- What's he like?

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,150
Well, he's like...

93
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,039
You don't look like yourself in that
get-up, but I'm happy to meet you.

94
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,312
Sylvia Van Buren.
I teach library science at USC.

95
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,152
- I didn't know how to stop you.
- You didn't wear glasses in Time.

96
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,115
They're for long distance. To look
at something close, I take them off.

97
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,108
- You could fry eggs on that thing.
- The sand is keeping the heat in.

98
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,633
Uncle, Dr Forrester. Dr Matthew
Collins is the pastor here.

99
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,310
- Well, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

100
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,431
Hey, you!

101
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,196
What have you got in here?
It's ticking like a bomb.

102
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,712
This is a Geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity.

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,878
- It's that meteor.
- It's radioactive?

104
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,789
Yes. It's difficult to account
for a reaction like that.

105
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,273
- Look at it. It's going crazy!
- Maybe we should keep people away.

106
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,233
I'll post a few deputies.

107
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,750
That meteor is either very light,
which is unheard of, or it's hollow.

108
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,034
If it were heavy and solid, it would
have made a tremendous crater.

109
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,076
I'll wait around until it cools off.
Is there a place I could clean up?

110
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,319
- I'd like you to stay at my house.
- Thank you.

111
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,310
It won't be cool for <i>24</i> hours. What
do people do here on a Saturday?

112
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,479
- Not much of anything.
- There's a square dance tonight.

113
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,551
Allemande left and the ladies star.
Gents walk around, but not too far.

114
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,834
Allemande left and the gentlemen star.
Ladies walk around, but not too far.

115
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,158
First and third balance and swing.
Promenade the outside ring.

116
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,353
Three quarters round the outside ring.
Through that couple and not too far.

117
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,599
Meet in the centre with right hand star.
Swing your corner with left hand round.

118
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,555
Let's take another look at it.

119
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,034
- It's almost cold now.
- We might as well go home.

120
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,789
- No sense staying out here.
- Let's go.

121
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,634
Hey, it's moving!

122
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,435
- It's a bomb!
- It didn't go off last night...

123
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,918
- Maybe it's gonna go off now.
- It's a sneak attack. Let's go.

124
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,031
Wait a minute.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,230
Bombs don't unscrew.

126
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,152
It's no meteor. That's for sure.

127
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,151
Darnedest thing I ever saw,
the way that's unscrewing.

128
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,200
- Thank you, Doctor. Having fun?
- You know what I was thinking?

129
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,111
The energy from one square dance
could send the meteor back home.

130
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,312
- Must be somebody in there.
- Who? Where do they come from?

131
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,356
I read that Mars is near Earth now.
It happens every <i>20</i> years, they say.

132
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Men from Mars...

133
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,391
- What do you think?
- Maybe these are not men, like us.

134
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,115
Everything human doesn't
have to look like you and me.

135
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,913
If it's men from Mars, we ought to
let them know we're friendly.

136
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,478
- No, you don't know what it is.
- We'd be the first to make contact.

137
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,956
We'd be in all the papers.

138
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,039
We could walk out there
with a white flag.

139
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,038
I got an old sugar sack in my car.

140
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,153
What are we going to say to them?

141
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,473
"Welcome to California."

142
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,432

wrong with my hearing aid.

midnight, anyway. It's near that now.

- Mine's stopped, too.
- Mine ain't working. What is this?

They've all stopped
at the same time.

There's only one explanation for a
thing like this. Do you have a pin?

See that? My watch is magnetised.

162

That's what
knocked the phones out, too.

- But everyone's watches all together?
- Do you have a pocket compass?

- It's pointing toward the meteor.

- Dr Forrester?

they're from some other planet.

They're an advanced civilisation.

they should be nearer the Creator.

No real attempt has been made

00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,599
Everything about them
seems to be in threes.

434
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:17,272
Their eyes have three lenses,
three pupils. Strong light shocks them.

435
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,109
Sunlight on Mars is approximately
half as strong as we get it.

436
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,836
Add their clouds and dust,
it amounts to no more than our twilight.

437
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,797
Now, if you'll step over here, please.

438
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,835
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect
whatever the Martian lens picks up.

439
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,993
Move in a little. Thank you.

440
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,552
There's how the Martians see us.

441
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,832
Evidently there's a shift
in their spectrum.

442
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,349
Their colour absorption
must be different from ours.

443
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,873
Let's see why they were so curious
about you, Miss Van Buren.

444
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,068
- Time we got started, gentlemen.
- Let's go.

445
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,597
- Let's make an analysis of their blood.
- It might give us something.

446
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:11,238
You can get all the Martian blood you
want after the plane drops the bomb.

447
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,993
The Flying Wing is going to carry it.

448
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,629
Tower, this is Flying Wing,
ready for take-off.

449
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,230
<i>Flying Wing, this is the tower.</i>
<i>Clear for take-off.</i>

450
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,510
Wish us luck.

451
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,518
The target is the nest of
Martian machines in the Puente Hills,

452
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,474
where more cylinders came down
last evening.

453
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,116
A plane will pinpoint the target
from six miles up.

454
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,394
This bomb is ten times more powerful
than anything previously used.

455
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,750
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

456
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,636
Nothing like it has ever been exploded
before. We're going to be pretty close,

457
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,153
but there are observers in a forward
bunker who will be a lot nearer than us.

458
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:36,198
The whole world is waiting.
This will decide the fate of civilisation.

459
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,949
Whether we live or die
may depend on what happens here.

460
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,597
<i>Attention! Four minutes to bomb time.</i>

461
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,231
There must be a couple of million
people behind us in the hills,

462
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,592
waiting to find out
whether they can go home again.

463
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,196
All around the world, people
have been driven from their homes.

464
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,756
Direct cable communication
is being maintained with Washington,

465
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,398
but there's no radio at all. Not even
with the bomber that's coming over.

466
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,637
All radio is dead,

467
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,279
which means that these recordings
are for the sake of future history, if any.

468
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,114
Future history, he said.

469
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,313
Yes, if any.

470
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,795
Bilderbeck's calculated how long
we have until they take over the world.

471
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,348
If the A-bomb fails, the Martians
can conquer Earth in six days.

472
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,349
The same number of days
it took to create it.

Hello? What can you see?

487
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,634
There's something moving!

488
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,557
They haven't even been touched!

489
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,709
It didn't stop them. Guns, tanks, bombs,
they're like toys against them!

490
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,390
It’ll end only one way.
We're beaten.

491
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,714
No... Not yet.

492
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,552
Washington ordered all cities in danger
of attack evacuated if the bomb fails.

493
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:44,278
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.
We'll fight them back to the mountains.

494
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,589
Our best hope lies in what you people
can develop to help us.

495
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,912
Six days, you said. Six days...

496
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,759
They'll stamp the city flat.

497
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,594
We'll establish a base laboratory
in the Rocky Mountains.

498
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,429

- We may get a lead from the blood.

- We can't beat their machines.
