00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,440
This way! Take it!

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,920
More pressure!

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Reposition those rigs!

15
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
IC from Ladder 42,
we are on side two...

16
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Jack! Jack!

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,680
Everybody, listen up.

18
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
The battalion chief says
we've got a report of people...

19
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,000
...trapped on the 12th floor or above.

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,080
He says the place is full of grain dust,
which could explode at any time.

21
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,120
So everybody keep together,
maintain radio contact.

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,160
Check that
on the three side of the building.

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Is that all right? You got that?
Roger, IC. Three side of the building.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,520
Why does it always have to be
the 12th floor?

25
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,440
Why can't they be on the fourth?

26
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Les move it, Grandpa.
Come on.

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Ladder 49 to Command.
We're on the 12th floor.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,360
Commencing search.

29
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm getting too old for this shit.

30
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Lenny! Lenny!
Take Jack.

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,440

Come on, Jack.

33
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,000
This is Baltimore City Fire Department!
Can anybody hear me?

34
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,040
Fire Department!

35
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,440
Baltimore City Fire Department.

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Hey! Jack!

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,840
He's over here!

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,240
I got a pulse.

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
Ladder 49, Portable three to Portable one.

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,160
We found one of 'em.
He's alive.

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,360
We're bringing him out.
Jack, get his hands.

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,360
Portable one to Portable three.

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,800
Copy that. We got one, too.

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,000
We'll meet you at the stairwell.

48
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Give us a hand here!
Breathe through my mask.

49
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,880
Go ahead, just take a breath
outta my mask.

50
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,320
I got him! I got him!
Ladder 49 to Command.

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,640
I got his legs.

52
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,960
Be advised we have
two trapped occupants.

53
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
We're bringing 'em down the stairs now.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Where's Phil?
What?

55
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
Phil.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Cap, they said there was two of 'em.

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,400
He was with us.
They said there were only two.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,280
On this level!
On this floor. Over there.

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm gonna go look for him.
Jack! You stay in radio contact.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,920
Ok.

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,480
Fire Department!

62
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,400
Aah!

63
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Portable three to Portable one.
Explosion blocked my rear exit.

64
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
Looking for alternative,
but still searching for a victim on level 12.

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,240
Ladder 49, Portable one to Portable three.
We copy, Jack.

66
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
Hey! Hey!

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Come on. Get up!

68
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360

Ladder 49, Portable one to Portable three.

71
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,440
Jack, you all right?
Yeah. I got another one.

72
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Portable three to Command.
Be advised I have the victim.

73
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,160
We're moving toward side one,
the roll-up door.

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,560
Get a bucket up there
and I'll drop him down!

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Command, do you copy?

76
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,360
Copy that. We are repositioning truck 51.

77
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,520
Come on!

78
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,680
Nice and easy.

Hey! Come on, get it up here! Up!

80
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,600
Truck 51 to Ladder 49 Portable.

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,840
We're right underneath you.
Bring him down, Jack. Bring him down.

82
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Whas your name? Phil?
Yeah, is Phil.

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
Here, Phil, can you hold this?

84
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
Can you hold this against your face?

85
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,280
Listen to me. I'm gonna
tie you off right now, all right?

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
Nice and easy.

87
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Portable three to Command,
ready to lower the victim down.

88
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320

Now trust me.
Keep your eyes on me, Ok?

92
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,600
You keep your eyes on me.
I got you. Trust me.

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,400
Hey, Phil, you look at me.

94
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
You look at me and stay right there.

95
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,080
I can't do this.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm right here.
You could do it, Phil.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,600
I can't do this.
Yes, you can. I'm gonna help you.

98
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,760
I got guys on the ground.
Trust me, Phil. Trust me.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,760
Please, I can't.
You have to go.

100
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Now, I'm not leaving till you leave.

101
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
And you're going, Phil.
Down! Get down!

102
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,040
Go down. I got you.
I promise. I got you.

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
Go. You just look right here.

Stay right here, partner!
Stay right here!

Aah!

111
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
We got heavy black smoke up here.

112
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,600
We got a four-by-four hole cut.
We can't get in there yet.

113
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
Ladder 12, this is Ladder 6.
We need the big booster.

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Bring in a big line.

115
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,040
Hey. You the new rookie?

116

Drop your bag.
Uh, take the spiral staircase.

119
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Look for the door
that says "Captain's Office."

120
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Thanks.

121

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah, in the kitchen.

123
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
You're the rookie, right?
Yeah.

124
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,040
Uh, probationary firefighter
Jack Morrison reporting, sir.

125
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
Sir?

126
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Sir?

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,920
Your shift started at seven, son.

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Uh, well, sir, I was already here.
Ah, save it. Sit down.

129
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,800
Now, let me tell you somethin', boy.

130
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Engine 33 is the busiest...

131
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,360
...and most disciplined firehouse in the city.

132
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,600
No room for slackers.
You got that?

133
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,160
I know that, sir.

134
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
We get over 4,000 calls a year.

135
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
Thas a lot of action.

136
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,240
Gotta be willing to go the extra mile.

137
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Are you, Jack?
Are you willing to go the extra mile?

138
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,440
Well, yes, sir.
I don't think so.

139
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,080
I can.

140
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,840
Sorry, Cap.
Uh, Father Hogan's here.

141
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Uh, I'll go last. I'll go last.
Let him go first.

142
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,040
Go ahead. Go ahead, Jack.

143
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,960
Yeah, so, Jack... Ok.

144
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,360
Welcome to, uh, Engine 33.

145
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Good to have you onboard, son.
Get out.

146
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, thank you, sir.

147
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,320
Hey. Ray Gauquin.
How are you?

148
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,200
Jack Morrison.
Good to meet you.

149
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,600
Uh... so, the captain...

150
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
He's a great guy.

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,960
Uh, right down here.
You can use this one.

152
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,680
This one?
Yeah.

153
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
You Catholic?
Yeah.

154
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,480
Most of the guys are.
Uh... we have a thing here.

155
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
A priest comes around twice a year.

156
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,680
We all go to confession.
In this job, you need it.

157
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,200
I mean, you get enough fires, you find God.

158
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
Yeah.

159
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
A good confession now, son.
"Bless me, Father..."

160
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,560
Uh, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,880
Is been, uh...

162
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,480
...seven years since my last confession.

163
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,120
Seven years is a long time.
Yes, Father.

164
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,840
All right, where do we start?

165
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Theft? Robbery?
Fraud? Taxes?

166
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,840
Well, you know.

167
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Taxes? Always taxes.

168
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,720
How 'bout sex?
Lmpure thoughts?

169
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
Well, yes, quite a bit.

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,000
Try to cut back.

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
Are you married?
No.

172
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,800
Are you a virgin?
No, Father.

173
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,480
Oh, you think is funny to
fornicate with loose women?

174
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,800
What? Wait a minute.

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
No, you wait a minute.

176
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,640
You come across any more loose women,
you let me know.

177
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
Tommy Drake.
Jack Morrison.

178
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, man. Don Miller.
Good to meet you.

179
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Dennis Gauquin.
Hey.

180
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
My older and, as you
can see, uglier brother.

181
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,920
Frank McKinney.
Father.

182
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,560
Lenny Richter. Father Lenny Richter.

183
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,080
Pleasure to meet you.
Good sport.

184
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
Cap.

185
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,040
You think we'll get
something today or what?

186
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,640
I don't know, kid.
I think you put a hex on us.

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,280
Uh, did you report a fire, ma'am?

188
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,280
I burned some bread
in the oven, thas all.

189
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,760
Oh, well,
can we come in and check, please?

190
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,360
You put one foot in here,
this dog'll tear your ass off.

191
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,240
Get in there, probie.

192
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,520
Come here.

193
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
Yeah?

194
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,040
What the hell's this?

195
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
What?
Are you stupid?

196
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,000
There's no paper.
Yeah, is right there.

197
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,320
Is not on the holder.

198
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,680
Why don't you use your hand?
You're used to it.

199
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,800
Hey, who asked your opinion?

200
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Get outta the bathroom.

201
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh, God...! Goddamn it.

202
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
All right, who's the wise guy?
All right.

203
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,760
Interrupting my sh...
Goddamn it!

204
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
All right, somebody's gonna pay for this!

205
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,920
We got one, rook!

206
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,840
Come on, come on!

207
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,360
About three more blocks.
Right after North Avenue.

208
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,080
All right, Cap.

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Move out of the way, asshole!

210
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,800
How you feelin', kid?
Is your first fire.

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,760
Are you ready to break your cherry?

212
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,360
That one. Grab that plug!
Got you, Cap.

213
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,880
Three-story brick building.
Flames showing second and third floor.

214
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,040
Go! Go! Go! Go!

215
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,440
Go, go, go!

216
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Your helmet!

217
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
Slow down. Slow down.

218
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,920
You're getting tangled up.
Let it go, let it go.

219
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,800
Single line, single line.
Come on. Let it go.

220
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,520
All right, there you go.

221
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,040
Go in low.
All right, stop here.

222
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Stop, stop.
Charge the line!

223
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Charge it!

224
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,920
All right.

225
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
Go! Go!

226
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
Over the side!

227
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,320
Slow down!
Slow... slow down!

228
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,560
Whoa. Whoa.

229
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,160

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
Jesus Christ!
They're just rats.

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,000
Come on, les go.
Cap... Huh?

233
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,200
Go!

234
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,880
Hey, Cap...
Ignore it! Go!

235
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
Ok.
Just keep goin'.

236
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
Drop it. Drop it.
Drop down.

237
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
Ok, Ok...
This is it.

238
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
You ready? Move it in!
Come on, move it!

239
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
What?
No, not yet. Not yet.

240
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
When? When?

241
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,880
Move in. Now, now!
I got it, Cap, I got it!

242
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,800
Easy, easy. Hit it! Hit it!
Ok! Ok!

243
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm with ya,

244
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,440
Hit it high.
Hit it high!

245
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm trying, I'm trying!
Good.

246
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440
Move in. Now, now!
Thas it.

247
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,920
Aah!

249
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,080
Get up!

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm doin' it, Cap!

252
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,640
Up! Up! Hit it high!
Hit it high!

253
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,920
Hit it high!
Easy. Easy.

254
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,120
Hit it! Hit it!
Ok!

255
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,760
Ok!

256
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,560
You did it, man. Good job.

257
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,480
Whoo!

258
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
Hey, how 'bout that?

259
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,440
She go easy on you?

260
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,840
Get me up to speed.
We've got a 20-story building.

261
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Most of it concrete.
Most of the fire's on the top eight floors.

262
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
And after that explosion on 12,
one of our guys went missing.

263
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,360
Jack Morrison, Ladder 49.

264
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Any radio contact with him?
None.

265
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Anybody with him?
The others of Ladder 49 made it out.

266
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,000
They're in the stairwell with the victims.

267
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,520
You reported this?
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,400
Ok. Deputy Chief One to communications.

269
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm on location assuming command.

270
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Strike out a fourth alarm.

271
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,200
Ok, shut down all exterior operations.

272
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,160
Get your asses in there
and find him. Go, go, go.

273
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

274
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,160
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

275
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

276
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,480
Jack, come in.

277
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
Ladder 49, Morrison to Command.

278
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Jack. Jack, is Kennedy.
How you holdin' up?

279
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,000
Chief, the floor collapsed.

280
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,240
I don't know.
I'm pretty busted up.

281
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,000
Do you know where you are?

282
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,480
No. I was on 12 when it gave way.

283
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
I was on 12.

284
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,200
How you doin' on air?

285
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,360
Tank is no good. Air's out.

286
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,160
Ok, hold tight.
We got units comin' in after you.

287
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,520
Hey, Mike.

288
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
Mike, the vic get out?
Did he get in the bucket?

289
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
Thas affirmative, Jack.
He made it.

290
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,000
He's gonna be Ok.
You did a great job.

291
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
Jack, switch to a different channel.
Try eight.

292
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,000
Switch to a different channel.
Try eight.

293
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,400
Hey, Mike... imagine me getting myself...

294
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,560
...trapped in here like some dumb rookie.

295
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,760
You should've taught me better.

296
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,440
Well, what do you expect? I did the best
I could with what I had to work with.

297
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,680
No. No academy fire was ever that hot.

298
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,320
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?

299
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Nothing compares, right?
Nothin'.

300
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,480
I can't believe it.

301
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,960
Hey, we need ketchup.
Right.

302
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,840
Maybe more.
Ok.

303
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Thas it.

304
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
I'm goin' in.

305
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,200
Uh, excuse me. Hi.

306
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,240
Hi.
So, can I ask you a question?

307
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,800
Sure.

308
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Now, who are these for?

309
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,920
For us.

310
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Really?
Yeah.

311
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,960
Um, you can't eat these.

312
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
Why not?

313
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,720
These, these are,
these are for fat, lonely girls...

314
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,000
...who stay at home at night watching TV.

315
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,320
Lasagna is for the fat girls?
Yes!

316
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,840
Lieutenant, right?
Yeah, thas right.

317
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,560
Lieutenant Jack Morrison.

318
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,080
Hey.
Hey.

319
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm Captain Dennis Gauquin.

320
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,320
Uh, Cliff's Crab Shack,
you ever heard of that?

321
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,160
No.
Best seafood in town.

322
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,240
Thas what you need.
Oh, really?

323
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,040
Sorry, we can't do it.
We already planned dinner.

324
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
Thanks, though.
Yeah.

325
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,360
Ok.

326
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,680
Hey, you know where the ketchup is?

327
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,360
Maybe.

328
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,520
All right, can you show me?
Sure.

329
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
Ok.

330
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,080
Ketchup, huh?
Been fightin' fires all day.

331
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,680
I need some help finding the ketchup.

332
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,920
Sorry. The captain's been
under a lot of pressure.

333
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,440
We had a big fire today and I think
the, uh, smoke probably went to his head.

334
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,800
It doesn't seem to be his head
thas the problem, Lieutenant.

335
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Thas funny.

336
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,000
Hey, I'm Jack Morrison.

337
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Yeah.
He told me, remember?

338
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh, yeah, thas right.

339
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,920
So, you guys usually pick up girls
in the supermarket, for fun or...?

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,360
Well, usually I just throw 'em over
my shoulder and carry 'em down a ladder.

341
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,520
Sort of a Tarzan-Jane thing?

342
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,080
It was nice to meet you.
I should get going.

343
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,800
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

344
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Bye.
Bye.

345
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,720
Eight o'clock.

346
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,760
What?
Cliff's.

347
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
With those girls?

348
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,640
You mean, like if you lock yourself out?
Yeah.

349
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,840
Well, if you lock yourself out...

350
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,240
...and you say that you
left the stove on, yeah...

351
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,440
...the fire department
has to come let you in.

352
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,440
But we try to stop people from doing that...

353
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,920
...by knocking down their door
with an ax. Right, Jack?

354
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
Wanna go outside for a smoke?
Oh, more than anything.

355
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,200
Les go.
You guys Ok?

356
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,960
We're goin' outside for a smoke.

357
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,360
Bye. Behave.

358
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,040
So, what do you do?

359
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,320
I work in a jewelry store
where people make their own jewelry.

360
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
Did you make those?
Do you make your bracelets?

361
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,080
I made this one, and I made this.

362
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,000
Is nice.

363
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,800
So, whas that called?
Would you be, like, an artist?

364
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,400
No, I just help people make jewelry.

365
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,440
Is just a job for now.

366
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,960
Do you like what you do?

367
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,960
Yeah, I love it.

368
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah? Why?

369
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,920
'Cause you'll just be sittin' around like this,
and all of a sudden that gong goes off.

370
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,200
You go tearing out of the firehouse,
go down the street...

371
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
...and fight your way into some building...

372
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,080
...dealing with that heat,
helping people, you know.

373
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,600
Saving people.
Is an amazing feeling.

374
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,880
I can't even imagine what it must feel like
to save someone's life.

375
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,560
I mean, how many people
do you think you've saved?

376
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,600
Well...
Look, actually, I'm...

377
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,720
I'm not a lieutenant.
I just...

378
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,600
We were just screwing around.
I actually just started, uh...

379
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,800
You suck.
Yeah, I got my first fire today, though.

380
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,880
But I did. I got my first fire.
It was amazing.

381
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,360
Captain Dennis sent them over.

382
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,560
Thank you.
Thanks.

383
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,000
I hate you.

384
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,920
He's gonna be Chief Dennis
in another hour.

385
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You suck!
Is he even a fireman?

386
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,640
No, he's a truckie. He's a step man.
Truckies are search and rescue.

387
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
He actually goes in and pulls people out,
you know. Dennis has saved people.

388
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,040
Are you a steppie, too?

389
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,440
Not a steppie, a truckie.
Oh, Ok.

390
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
But, no, I'm on the engine.
I'm a pipe man.

391
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,880
I actually hold the nozzle
and put the fire out.

392
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,320
Thas cool.

393
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
I think is amazing what you guys do.

394
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,640
I mean, you go into burning buildings...

395
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,240
...when everyone else is running out.

396
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,680
I mean...
I couldn't do that.

397
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Is the job.

398
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,560
Whas goin' on, guys?
Not much, man.

399
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,760
Nice. Nice one, guys.
How you doin'?

400
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,440
Jack Morrison! Phone call!

401
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,360
Jack Morrison! Phone call!

402
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,520
Some woman named Linda claiming you
to be the father of her child.

403
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,040
Ohh!

404
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,880
Hello.
Hey, how you doin'?

405
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,680

406
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,080
Uh, fires, no.
But I did have a goose.

407
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,920
A goose in my locker.
It was huge.

408
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
Crapped all over my stuff.

409
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,080
Come on, Jack, you startin'
a phone-sex business here?

410
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,840
Go ahead and tell her you love her, Jack.

411
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,800
Hey, look, I gotta go.
Can I call you later?

412
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Ok. Bye.

413
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,920
Aw!

414
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,240
Sweet stuff!

415
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,120
Irish Car Bomb?
Come on, Mike.

416
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,040

417
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,640
Linda! Linda!
Hey!

418
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,640
Hey, hold up.
This must be the lovely Linda.

419
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,160
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Frank, Linda.

420
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,400
This is Don.
Hey, Linda.

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,640

423
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Uh-huh. Margarita sends her love.
Ah, Margarita.

424
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,080
Thas Captain Kennedy.
How do you do?

425
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,680
Hi. I've heard a lot about you.
Yeah?

426
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,840
Yeah, you wear really sexy boxers, right?
With red love hearts on them?

427
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, gosh.

428
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,040
A little too tight.
Ah, sit, have a seat.

429
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
What are you...?
I had to.

430
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,760
Linda, have you ever had one of these?
No, don't do it.

431
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,560
What is this?
Oh, is an Irish Car Bomb.

432
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Yeah. Here, you put it in like this...

433
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,600
...let it drop right in there,
and chug it all at once.

434
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Are you doing one?
You're gonna love it. Ready? You ready?

435
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,120
Oh, is gonna make me sick.

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,160
Wow.

441
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Oh, my God.

442
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,600
What was that?

443
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm going to be so sick tomorrow.

444
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,920
Ohh!

445
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,480
Les get another shot!

446
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
I think I gotta slow down a bit.

447
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,480
No, you gotta get wasted at a shift party.
Thas tradition.

448
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,680
No, no, no, Jack, the lady knows her
limitations. Let her go. Send her home.

449
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Are you calling me a lightweight?

450
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah.
Lightweight.

451
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Ohh!
Stand back!

452
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,880
Ok. Last one to empty their glasses
runs naked around the bar.

453
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
We got a challenge!
Oh, we got a race here!

454
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
We got a challenge.
Ok, Ok.

455
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,240
All right. Loser takes off all their clothes.

456
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,400
Call it.

457
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,080
Ready, on three.
One, two, three.

458
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,480
No, no, no.
What the hell is that?

459
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,320
I said last to empty their glass.
Did I say anything about drinking it?

460
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,720
Tom, the lady's right, Tommy.
Ohh.

461
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,200
See, oh, we got a cute one here now, huh?

462
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,120
Take it off! Take it off!
I was very clear.

463
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,040
Take it off!
Take it off!

464
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,600
Take it off!
Take it off!

465
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,520
Take it off!
Take it off!

466
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,840
Take that.

467
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,520
Oh, please kill me.

468
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I like this.
Hm?

469
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
Oh. My mom gave it to me.

470
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
You know what this is?
Mm-mm.

471
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,880
Is a Claddagh ring.

472
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
You know, if is pointed down...

473
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,560
...then it means that you're free.

474
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
And if is pointed up
towards your heart...

475
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,640
...then it means that you
belong to someone.

476
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,320
Clear.

477
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,600
Come on, Lenny.
Les go.

478
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,840
Go.

479
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,800
Oh, God.

480
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,400
Jack!

481
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
Jack!

482
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
IC, Ladder 12.
Requesting air rescue to deploy.

483
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Jack.

484
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,520
Oh, God. Oh, God.

485
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,800
Jack!

486
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,400
Oh, God.

487
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,080
I need a goddamn progress report,
Ladder 49.

488
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
Ladder 49 to Command.

489
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,640
Be advised we have
structural collapse inside.

490
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,920
There's a huge amount of debris.
There's no way around it.

491
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,320
I don't care what your problem is.
Just keep goin'.

492
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,440
We're gonna need
some equipment up here.

493
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Equipmens on its way.
Copy that, Chief.

494
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,360
IC from Ladder 42.

495
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,640
We are on side two,
awaiting instructions. Over.

496
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,040
Lenny. Lenny!

497
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,120
Cap, how are we gonna
get through all this?

498
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,320
Squad 47 here!
What do you need?

499
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,840
We need that equipment over here!

500
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,360
You got it!
Give me a saw!

501
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
Come on!

502
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,000
We need to shore this.

503
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,920
Come on, we gotta shore this up!

504
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
Clear!

505
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Watch your heads through here!

506
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,960
Jack!

507
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,880
Uh, Ladder 49, uh, this is...

508
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,800
Aah!

509
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
Son of a bitch!
We got a flare!

510
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
May the Lord bless you
with many happy years together...

511
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,800
...so that you may enjoy
the rewards of a good life.

512
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,680
And after you have loyally
served in His kingdom on Earth...

513
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,640
...may He welcome you into
the kingdom in heaven. Amen.

514
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,760
And may Almighty God bless you
in the name of the Father...

515
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,720
...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

516
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,440
Amen.
Amen.

517
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,480
You may now kiss the bride.

518
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,400
I now present Mr. And Mrs. Jack Morrison.

519
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,440
Your husband's an excellent firefighter.

520
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,920
Look after him for me, will you?

521
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,760
I'll help him look after himself.

522
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Even better.

523
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
Whoa.

524
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,280
Teach Jack this stuff.

525
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,560
All right, this next song
goes out to our newlyweds...

526
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,840
...by special request.

527
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,960
Uh, Frank, Don...

528
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
I need you up here, uh,
immediately, please.

529
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
Whoo!
Come on, guys.

530
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,760
Come on, get up here, man!
Come on up here right now.

531
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
Uh!

532
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
Jack. Jack.

533
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,520
Hey, Jack, get up here!

534
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,440
Here we go.
No, no, you goin', you goin'.

535
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,680
We'll be right back. Come on, buddy.

536
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,680
Come here and sit down.
Join the club.

537
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,320
Well, honey, we aren't
sitting far enough away.

538
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
How you doin'?

539
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Captain Kennedy?
You the new rookie?

540
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
Yeah.
Jack Morrison.

541
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,560
Keith Perez.
Office is back there.

542
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,080
Thanks. How you guys doin'?
Whas up?

543
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,880
Welcome to Engine 33.
Ok, all right.

544
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,760
Thank you. Thank you, Captain.
All right. See ya.

545
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,280
So, Keith, you Catholic?

546
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,480
Yeah.

547
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,760
Are you a virgin?
No, Father.

548
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,720
So you think is funny to
fornicate with loose women?

549
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,480
Uh, no, no, not at all.

550
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,840
Well, if you wanna have sex,
you should get married.

551
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,160
I can't.
Why?

552
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,280
Is not allowed.
What do you mean, is not allowed?

553
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,920
Well, the church doesn't allow two men
to get married, Father.

554
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
Excuse me?

555
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I'm gay.

556
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,600
Hey, how did you know that?
Yeah, we got him, baby!

557
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,800
Ohh, really?
What?

558
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,400
Did you tell him?

559
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
Whas up with that?

560
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,480
God, is like they're having a love affair.

561
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,400
Girls. Green beers.
Here we go. Green beer.

562
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,360
I'm good.
What?

563
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm good. I'm not drinking.
You can have it.

564
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,680
Uh, Linda, is Saint Paddy's.
Is Ok.

565
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,960
I'm not gonna drink.
I'm just gonna grab a Coke from the bar.

566
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,280
What, are you pregnant?

567
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,440
What? You're kidding.

568
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,000
Baby, I was gonna tell you later tonight...

569
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,320
...but I wanted to surprise you.

570
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,160
You're kidding? No!
Linda's pregnant.

571
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,440
Linda's pregnant.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

572
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,840
Turn down the music!
No more drinks for Linda.

573
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,440
Doubles for Jack.
He's gonna be a father!

574
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,680
Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!

575
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,080
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!

576
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,880
Drinks are on Jack!
Drinks are on me!

577
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
Drinks are on Jack!

578
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,880
Uh-oh.

579
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,080
Keep your money.
Save it for the baby.

580
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,640
Hey, you know, Jack,
you can't have a baby...

581
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,240
...without a shower.

582
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,080
Great.

583
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,400
Eighteen hundred block of Suffolk Street...

584
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,040
...between Lafayette and Harris Place.

585
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,560
Investigator reported smoke in the area.

586
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,040
Charge the line!

587
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,560
I'm getting too old for this shit.
You got that right.

588
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,000
All right, les see if this fire's walking on us.

589
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,440
Dennis, cut a hole in that roof.

590
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Ray, open up that skylight.
Yes, sir.

591
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,440
Engine 15 to Engine 12,
uh, switch to Command channel.

592
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,920
This is bullshit, man.
A two-story dumpster.

593
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,360
Let it burn.

594
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,560
This whole block is vacant.
Let it all burn.

595
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,680
Stop your bitchin', little brother.

596
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,880
We'll be back next week.

597
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,240
Hey, Ray, I got an idea.

598
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,600
Why don't you stop talking
and start doing...

599
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,560
Ray?
Dennis!

600
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,960
Aah!

601
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,360
Dennis!

602
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
Dennis!

603
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,480
Man down!
Dennis!

604
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,920
Man down!

605
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,240
Tommy! Get the door!

606
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,240
Mayday! Mayday!
Firefighter down!

607
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,400
Mayday! Mayday!
Firefighter down!

608
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,360
Come on! More line!
I need more line!

609
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,880
Evacuate now!
Evacuate now!

610
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,880
Activate the alarm!
Come on! Evac!

611
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,160
Evac! Is comin' down!
I need more line!

612
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,440
No! We can get him!
Is no good. Is no good!

613
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,480
Is no good!

614
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,480
Yep. Marlene keeps
askin' me to come home.

615
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,960
She's cryin'. Thankin' God
I wasn't up on that roof.

616
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,840
I just wanna go home
and hold my kids.

617
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
This is it.
Les line up, guys.

618
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,320
I want you guys to take
as much time off as you need.

619
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,040
Ok?

620
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,640
Nothin' like this
has ever happened in this house before.

621
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,680
It was the beams.
Never saw a roof go down so quick.

622
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,680
It shouldn't have happened.

623
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,720
What do you mean?

624
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,520
He wasn't paying attention.

625
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,560
What? Are you saying
it was Dennis's fault?

626
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,040
Just shut up and wash
them dishes, rookie.

627
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,680
You know, you're real good
at pickin' on rookies, man.

628
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
Fuckin' asshole.

629
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,920
Hey! Hey!

630
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,320
What the hell's goin' on here?

631
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,400
Huh?

632
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,040
I come back from tellin'
a mother that her son is dead...

633
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,360
...and this is goin' on in my house.

634
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,360
In my house!

635
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,480
We deal with this by sticking together.

636
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,400
We take it.
We learn from it.

637
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,320
And we get back on the goddamn truck.

638
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,520
And thas how we honor Dennis!

639
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,440
You got that?

640
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,880
Anybody think of lowerin' the flag?

641
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,120
Do it.

642
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,720
Gathering our prayers together...

643
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,720
...let us pray now in the way
that Jesus taught us.

644
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,600
Our Father, who art in heaven...

645
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,600
...hallowed be Thy name.

646
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,000
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

647
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,200
...on Earth as it is in heaven.

648
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,600
Give us this day our daily bread...

649
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,000
...and forgive us our trespasses...

650
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,960
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

651
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,360
...and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

652
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,440
Eternal rest grant to him, O Lord.

653
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,560
And let perpetual light shine upon him.

654
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,880
May he rest in peace.

655
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,080
May his soul and the souls
of the faithful departed...

656
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Detail, present arms!

657
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,880
Color guard, present arms!

658
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,400
Detail, order arms!

659
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,480
Color guard, order arms!

660
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,040
You don't think that might fall apart?

661
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,920
Well, I hope not.

662
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,000
So I'm thinking about changing jobs.

663
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,320
What do you mean?

664
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,680
Uh, goin' to search and rescue.
Move the truck.

665
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,400
Does that mean you'd
be taking Dennis's place?

666
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,560
Oh, no, you can't think that way.

667
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,360
Well, would you?

668
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,160
Hey, Cap, this stuff is great.

669
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,920
Thas my grandfather.

670
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,960
And, uh, thas his helmet.

671
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,880
These are my dad's.
Thas him.

672
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,960
One of these he got,
uh, after he passed away.

673
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,160
This one.

674
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,840
Is a Medal of Valor.
Yeah.

675
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,480
So, whas goin' on?

676
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,640
Oh, there's something I wanted
to talk to you about. Um...

677
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,800
I was thinkin' about
transferring to the truck.

678
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,560
Well, jeez, what the hell
you want to do that for?

679
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,720
You're an engine man.
Truck's a whole different thing.

680
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,440
You know... no water
between you and the fire.

681
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,440
No hose line to guide you out
if you get lost in the smoke.

682
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,520
Is not a good idea.

683
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,720
Yeah, I know all that, Cap.

684
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,080
I love being on the pipe.
Is just...

685
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,480
Is just what?

686
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,240
Is what I want, Mike.

687
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,600
Well... you know, give it a try.

688
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
But you gotta tell me somethin'.

689
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,200
If this isn't for you, you tell me right away.

690
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,000
You promise?

691
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,320
Yes, sir.

692
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
Oh, my God.

693
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,520
Somebody!

694
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,860
Its over there.

695
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,060
Can you see me?

696
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,140
Stay down! Stay down!
We're comin' to get you!

697
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,700
I got this.
I'll try not to drop you.

698
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,380
You're not afraid
of heights, are you, Jack?

699
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,700
All right, lets gear up.

700
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,140
Number ten this side, hold your position.

701
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,540
Hold your position.
Do not attempt.

702
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,140
Here, grab this.

703
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,940
All right.
Check your rigs.

704
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,580
Put that around your leg.

705
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,900
Take your time.
Do your buckles.

706
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,620
All right, tighten that.

707
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,300
You got it?
Hey, Lenny, grab the rope.

708
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,100
Its comin'.
Here's your end.

709
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,180
Thanks.

710
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,020
Help!

711
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,940
All right, I got it goin' through.
You're cinched.

712
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,620
Make sure thats tight.
You cool with this?

713
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,540
Yeah.

714
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,140
Stay down!

715
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,900
You ready?

716
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,340
All right, hold on, Jack.

717
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,580
Ladder 49 to Command.
We got a man comin' over the top.

718
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,100
All right, Tommy, nice and easy.

719
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,980
Oh, God, its hot!

720
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,660
Try not to look down, Jack.

721
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,180
Thanks, Lenny.

722
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,700
You got it, man.

723
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,900
Lenny!
All right, give me a foot.

724
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,100
Nice and easy, guys.
No race.

725
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,580
All right, Tommy, let it down.

726
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,660
All right, hold on, Jack.

727
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,540
How much further?
About 25 feet.

728
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,380
25 feet, Tommy.

729
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,780
Oh, God! Oh!

730
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,860
We got you, Jack.
You're good.

731
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,300
Come on. Down!

732
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,820
Keep it comin'.

733
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,540
Uh, yeah, Bob, we're on
the scene in chopper seven.

734
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,860
Hey! Hey! I'm here!

735
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,980
Down! Down!

736
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,060
You almost there?

737
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,460
About 15 feet!

738
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,300
Hey! Hey, I'm here!

739
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,100
I'm coming for you.
Just wait!

740
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,060
Down!

741
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,300
All right, keep it comin'!

742
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,820
Almost!

743
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,620
We've got a burning building...

744
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,860
...in downtown on Calvert Street.

745
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,140
A lot of flames, a lot of smoke.

746
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,500
I'm right here!

747
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,700
Down! Down a few more feet!

748
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,420
No, wait! Wait!

749
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,900
You stay there, all right?
Wait. Wait till I'm set!

750
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,820
Just wait till I'm set.

751
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,660
Ok, stop! Stop!

752
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,300
All right, ho, ho, ho, ho!

753
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,860
Your eyes start to burn
and the heat from the flames...

754
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,500
Get over!

755
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,340
Just wait! Just wait!

756
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,020
Hold it, Tommy!
Hold it!

757
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,940
Oh, there they go!

758
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,460
Calm down! Calm down!

759
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,460
Calm down or you'll kill us!
Oh, God.

760
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,980
I swear to God I'll drop you.

761
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,460
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Close your eyes.

762
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,900
Close your eyes.
Put your head against me.

763
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,140
Ok, Ok.
All right?

764
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,700
I'm gonna push off this window.

765
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,620
Is gonna be Ok.
You just stay calm, Ok?

766
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stay calm.

767
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,700
Agh, jeez! Jeez!
Oh, God.

768
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,500
Oh, he shatters the glass!

769
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,660
They're inside now.
We're gonna try and get this guy's name.

770
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,580
Les go, come on!

771
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,220
Oh, God.
You got him?

772
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,460
Is he in?

773
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,860
Give him some slack.

774
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,100
He's in.

775
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,460
Lets get in closer, Jerry.

776
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,700
See if we can get in closer for a look.

777
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,060
He's off-line.

778
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,780
Hon?

779
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,140
Whoa, hey.

780
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,700
Hello.

781
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,820
Hey, baby.
How was your shift?

782
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,740
Hi, baby.
It was great.

783
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,540
Been drinking?

784
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,900
Yes, I had a few drinks with the boys.

785
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,220
Whats the matter?

786
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,860
I saw you on the news, Jack.

787
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,100
Linda, what is wrong?

788
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,420
I saw you on the news, Jack.
Dangling from a rope!

789
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,020
How could you tell me
that its not dangerous?

790
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,420
I didn't say it wasn't dangerous.
When we talked about it...

791
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,940
I asked you,
and you said it wasn't dangerous.

792
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,980
I said it wasn't any more dangerous
than being on the engine.

793
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,700
I never said it wasn't dangerous.

794
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,140
Do you see me right now?
Do you?

795
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,460
'Cause this isn't just about us.

796
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,020
Have you thought about that?

797
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,300
Don't.

798
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,980
Don't.

799
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,900
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.

800
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,900
I can't sleep.
I keep having that dream...

801
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,820
...about the red car turning up in front of
the house when you don't come home.

802
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,420
I'm sorry.
Don't.

803
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,540
I saved that man today.

804
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,660
Did I miss it?
They just took her to the delivery room.

805
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,700
Is she Ok?
She's fine.

806
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,900
Aah! Aah!

807
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,900
Hey, Chief.

808
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Yeah, Jack, go ahead.

809
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,820
Chief, its getting pretty unstable in here.

810
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,140
I got all sorts of shit
falling down around me.

811
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,700
I understand.
Now, Jack, listen up.

812
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,020
Ok.

813
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,820
Can you identify anything around you?

814
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,980
There's a sliding access door to my left.

815
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,980
But I can't get to it.
There's too much debris.

816
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,220
Chief, the problem is every floor
eight through eleven are identical.

817
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:09,300
Well, look, if the collapse happened here,
and he's anywhere near this control room...

818
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,820
...if we can get him in here,
it could buy us some time.

819
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,700
My best guess is that he's
right about here in this area.

820
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,100
And if he can break through this wall
and get into the control room...

821
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,500
Right, right. And if my guys
can get through the debris...

822
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,380
...they can meet here,
and go down the back stairwell.

823
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,380
Might work, Chief.

824
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,180
Ok, now, look, Jack,
this is very important.

825
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,620
Right behind you there's a wall.
Behind that wall is a control room. Ok?

826
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,220
If we can break through that wall,
we can buy some time.

827
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,140
Can you do that?

828
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,100
I'll give it a shot.

829
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,100
Where do you need us, Chief?

830
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,100
I need two men up there on eight,
helping Ladder 17.

831
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,780
And I need a two-and-a-half-inch
supply line right now up on eight.

832
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,420
Go.
Copy that, Chief.

833
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,700
Ladder 49,
I need a situation report.

834
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,140
The progress is that
we're working on it, Chief.

835
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,780
I need another blade!

836
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,580
Sir, there's no way to tell.
Its tough.

837
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,180
All hands are working.
Just keep at it.

838
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,220
Copy. Go.

839
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,340
Just give me another saw.
We need a saw!

840
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,980
Get me a saw!

841
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,260
Gotta make a wish first.

842
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,020
I wish for a Barbie car.

843
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,380
No, you're not supposed
to say it out loud.

844
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,420
But won't I get it now?

845
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,820
Blow out the candles, baby.
We'll open your presents in a minute.

846
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,820
Yay, Katie!

847
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,620
Happy birthday.

848
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,860
Sorry I'm late.

849
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,980
This is for the birthday girl.
This is for Nicky.

850
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,300
You shouldn't have.

851
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,140
I didn't want him to be jealous, you know.
Thank you.

852
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,300
Hey, happy birthday.

853
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,980
What?
You want a hot dog?

854
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,540
You want a burger, no?

855
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,900
Dog-pile on Daddy.

856
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,220
Cute.

857
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,220
Very cute.
Cute?

858
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,340
You know what I love about this place?

859
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,380
Sitting here at night, watching
the romantic lights of the oil refineries.

860
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,700
Beauty and the Beast is a hell of a book.

861
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,940
Its good. I haven't read it before.
Put the kids to sleep.

862
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,500
Good night.
You ever consider baby-sitting full time?

863
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,380
What do you think I do at the firehouse?

864
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,500
Good night.
Good night.

865
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,260
Night, Mike. Thanks.
You're welcome.

866
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,780
I think we're alone now.

867
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,820
You all right with that?
Yep.

868
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,020
Hon, shouldn't you have left by now?

869
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,820
Yeah, I can't find my keys.
You seen 'em?

870
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,140
Yeah, they're by the door,
where you left them.

871
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,900
Where I left them?
I left them there?

872
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,940
Oh, hey, Dad?
Yeah.

873
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,140
Can we take PJ to the game on Saturday?

874
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,540
Game on Saturday?
Yeah, definitely.

875
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,020
If its Ok with his parents, yeah.

876
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,620
Did you forget?

877
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,340
No, the guys planned a fishing trip.

878
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,140
I completely forgot.
I'll take him.

879
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,140
No, no, I want to.
Its fine.

880
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,500
What is it?
Its a tree.

881
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,620
Yeah, it is a tree, isn't it?
Its pretty.

882
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,540
You want to put it up on the fridge?

883
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,380
Show it to your mama.
Love you guys.

884
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,500
See ya tomorrow.
Bye, hon.

885
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,900
All right, buddy, I'm off.
Ok.

886
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,300
Whats the matter? Need tightening?
Yeah, I think so.

887
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,220
All right, well, I'll take a look at it
when I get back from work.

888
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,660
Engine 33, Engine 13...

889
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,940
Truck 49, Truck 16,
Battalion Chief six...

890
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,460
...respond to box alarm 33-4
for alarm bell sounding...

891
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,420
...at the BG & E Power Plant
on Broening Highway.

892
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,780
Units on box alarm 33-4,
alarm system is active...

893
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,980
...with possible steam leaks
and pipe ruptures.

894
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,460
Units are to exercise extreme caution.

895
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,020
They say the parents got to dress up.
I'm not gonna do it like last year...

896
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,220
...where I go looking like a fool,
'cause you got nothin' on.

897
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,340
Are you dressin' up?
What do you think?

898
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,340
Yeah, you better.

899
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,460
That can't be good.

900
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,380
Tommy, check out downstairs.

901
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,820
All right.

902
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,140
Ok, lets go. Come on.
Come on, lets go!

903
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,140
Cap, lets find Tommy
and get the hell outta here.

904
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,220
Hey! Over here!
I'm coming!

905
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,180
Tommy!
Hey, Jack.

906
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,580
Did you find anyone?
No, nobody.

907
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,060
Lets get the hell outta here.

908
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,660
Tommy!

909
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,380
Come on, lets go!
Lets go!

910
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:15,140
You're going in the chopper,
Tommy. Taking you to Gilford.

911
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,780
We got you, partner.
You're gonna be all right.

912
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:28,380
Tommy, we're puttin' you on the chopper
and taking you to Gilford!

913
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,940
Oh, shit.

914
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,140
Ok, lets go!

915
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,780
Ok, back off, guys.

916
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,460
How were they?
Angels.

917
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,300
Whats wrong?

918
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,900
I hurt myself at work.

919
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,900
You Ok?

920
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,020
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go to bed.

921
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,460
We'll be up in a second.

922
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,540
Come on, Nicky.
Head upstairs and brush your teeth.

923
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,140
Hey, Nick, did you brush your teeth?

924
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,660
Whats going on? You Ok?

925
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,820
No fever.
You got a little tummy ache?

926
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,220
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.

927
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,700
Does steam really melt your face away?

928
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,180
Who told you that?
Joey Costo.

929
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:04,180
He said that Alex's dad's face
melted away 'cause of steam.

930
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,060
Uh, yeah, well, steam can burn your skin.

931
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,900
But new skin grows back in its place.

932
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,700
Tommy's face got burned,
but his skin will grow back.

933
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,740
Does it hurt?

934
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,540
Yeah, when it happens.

935
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,740
I don't want you getting hurt anymore, Dad.

936
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Well, we're trained not to get hurt, Nick.

937
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,220
And long before you were
even born, I was trainin'.

938
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,580
But, uh, you know,
sometimes things do go wrong...

939
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,540
...like with me and Alex's dad.

940
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:53,180
But, you know, we're not afraid,
because we do it to save people.

941
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,700
You know, its worth it
to save people, isn't it?

942
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,420
Yeah.
And you know, if things do go wrong...

943
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,500
I got your uncle Mike and all
my friends at the firehouse.

944
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,860
You know they'd never let
anything happen to me.

945
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,780
Yeah.

946
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,060
Can you do me a favor?
Mm-hmm.

947
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:15,060
You tell Joey Costo that Alex's dad
got burned trying to save people...

948
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,820
...and that he's gonna be Ok.

949
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,340
Will you do that for me?

950
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,220
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah, Tommy Drake's room.

951
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,340
Room five, right down there.

952
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,140
You're not gonna go in?

953
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,100
There was a nurse inside, and I thought
maybe I oughta come back another time.

954
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,820
No, its fine. You can go in now.
She's almost done with his dressing.

955
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,500
Oh, excuse me.

956
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,940
How's he doing?

957
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,140
We have him on medication
to control the pain.

958
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,220
He's over the worst.
Ok.

959
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,060
We'll leave you alone for a few minutes.
Thank you.

960
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,660
Jack, how are you, man?

961
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:35,540
I'm doing fine, buddy.
How are you doin'?

962
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,460
Doctor says I'm gonna make it.
Yeah.

963
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,460
You know what I have?
They put dead men's skin on me.

964
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,620
Marlene wants to bring the kids by...

965
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,180
...but I don't want her to.

966
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,500
Hey. Of course she wants to bring the kids.
They wanna see you.

967
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,740
I'm scared, Jack.

968
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,540
I was their hero, you know?
I was their hero.

969
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,340
Kids, they don't forget things like this.

970
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,780
I don't know, man. Maybe it would've been
best if I just didn't make it. You know, I...

971
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,580
Hey. Don't say that.
Don't say that.

972
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:33,060
Hey, Tommy, you know, this is one of
the best burn centers in the country.

973
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,260
You know?

974
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,100
I don't think your kids loved
you 'cause of your looks.

975
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,980
They miss their dad.

976
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,540
I don't know.

977
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,900
How did he look?

978
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,420
Good.

979
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:06,340
Is he in a lot of pain?

980
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,060
They're medicating him,
Linda, so, you know...

981
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,620
I'd like to go see him.

982
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,420
Why?

983
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,740
Because he's our friend.

984
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,140
Do what you want.

985
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,620
Are you telling me
you don't want me to go?

986
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,740
No, I don't want you to go.
Why?

987
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,660
'Cause you're gonna see him,
and you're gonna get freaked out.

988
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,460
Its gonna be more for you to worry about.

989
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:38,580
More for me to worry about
or more for you to worry about, Jack?

990
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,500
Linda, don't tell me you don't worry.

991
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,260
You're always talkin' about being honest.
Be honest.

992
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:48,260
Are you trying to pick a fight?
I'm not trying to pick a damn fight.

993
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,300
I'll tell you the job, good ones.

994
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,420
A big office, secretary.

995
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,380
Too much paperwork, though.

996
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,700
Oh, you have got to cheer up.

997
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,100
Hey, Jack, stop your pouting.
Everybody's got to work Christmas.

998
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,100
Ho-ho-ho!

999
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,540
Ah, here's trouble.
Ho-ho-ho!

1000
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,220
Ho! Ho-ho!

1001
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,860
77 and a Sea Breeze, dear?

1002
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,860
Get it? "Deer."

1003
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,460
Whats eating you?

1004
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:33,700
Hey, Santa, who is this?
Thats not Mrs. Claus.

1005
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,700
'Cause I met Mrs. Claus,
and that is definitely not her.

1006
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:42,820
Yeah, well, maybe I have to come
slide down your chimney tonight.

1007
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,100
What the hell are you doin'?

1008
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,940
I'm Ok. I'm Ok.

1009
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,260
What the hell's wrong with you?

1010
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,100
He had it comin'.
I'm gonna kick his ass!

1011
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,980
This isn't about Lenny.
Whats wrong with you?

1012
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,980
Huh?
Nothing.

1013
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,420
We gotta talk. Come on,
lets get some coffee.

1014
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,820
I kicked his ass, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.

1015
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:25,500
You want anything else?
No, thank you.

1016
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,900
Did we calm down?

1017
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,780
So, you still love the job like you used to?

1018
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,980
Look, you've been through a lot.

1019
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,180
What can I say? I mean,
you lost your best friend...

1020
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,940
...you've been through some bad fires.

1021
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,420
You seen a lot of buddies hurt.

1022
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,100
It festers. It does.

1023
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,540
How are Linda and the kids?

1024
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,820
You know, its tough.

1025
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,820
Yeah, it is tough.
See, I never had that problem...

1026
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,740
...because when I was married...

1027
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,780
...my wife hated me being a firefighter.

1028
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:20,540
We were divorced nine months later.

1029
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,180
But you're different.
You're a good father.

1030
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,540
You worry.
But you should worry.

1031
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,780
You know, maybe its time
for a change of scenery.

1032
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,860
Yeah, what does that mean?

1033
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,700
Well... I was thinking...

1034
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,220
...there's this, uh, job down at headquarters.

1035
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:44,900
There's this aide's position
that I can put your name in for.

1036
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,820
Are you saying I need to
get out of the firehouse?

1037
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,900
Well, I'm saying that
you should ask yourself that question.

1038
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,700
Maybe go home, talk to Linda.

1039
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,460
You know, be honest with yourself.

1040
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,220
There's nothing wrong with moving on.

1041
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,340
I did it.

1042
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,460
So, what did he say?

1043
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,380
Mike offered to take me
with him as an aide.

1044
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,140
What does that mean for us?

1045
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,060
Well, I'll be home nights,
unless they call me in.

1046
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:22,980
And, uh, 70 cents an hour increase in pay.

1047
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,860
No fighting fire.

1048
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:33,060
Is that what you want?

1049
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,460
I don't know.
Um... You know?

1050
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:47,900
Things have been... so crazy lately and...

1051
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,860
You know, the kids are scared,
and I see you upset...

1052
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:56,180
...and, uh, you know, its my fault.

1053
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,380
So this is about me
and the kids again, is it?

1054
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:23,020
Look, we've been married ten years.

1055
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,540
And what you do is hard for me sometimes.

1056
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,940
And I do get scared.

1057
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,940
But I deal with it.

1058
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,380
'Cause I'm proud of you, baby.

1059
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,180
You know, Mike asked me tonight...

1060
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,260
...if I still love the job the way I did.

1061
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:59,940
And, for the first time in my life,
I didn't know what to say.

1062
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,380
...from midnight
through the current hour...

1063
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,420
...how this has been progressing
on into our area.

1064
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,700
And you can see just at the midnight hour...

1065
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,780
...in and around the immediate
Baltimore metro area...

1066
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,500
...we already have winter storm warnings...

1067
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:15,780
Man, we're gonna get six calls tonight.
Doubt it.

1068
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,620
They're gonna bullshit all night,
you're gonna tell me.

1069
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,500
Mm, tell you...

1070
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,980
Firebox 13-13.
Please respond, 0-1-Charlie-1.

1071
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,060
Engine 13, Engine 52,
Engine 8 and 6...

1072
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,500
Lenny! Lenny!

1073
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,020
You'll ladder up to the third floor.

1074
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,780
I got it! I got it! Go!

1075
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,060
Over here!

1076
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,380
Whats going on?
Its frozen!

1077
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,380
Our pipe's running low.

1078
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,860
Don! Don!

1079
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,900
We got a frozen plug.
We gotta pump it to 'em.

1080
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,500
Comin' at ya.

1081
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,020
You Ok?
Yes.

1082
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,980
How old are you, son?
Nine.

1083
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,860
Hey, buddy, where's your mom and dad?
Shopping.

1084
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,980
They leave you alone?

1085
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,100
I... I was with Jenny.

1086
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,780
Who's Jenny?

1087
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:15,460
My cousin.
She was baby-sitting.

1088
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,220
Where do you live?
Which apartment? Show me.

1089
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,740
Top one?

1090
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:56,220
Hello? Fire Department!

01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,220

Grab her legs! Lets go!

1108
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,540
Got her?

1109
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,460
All the way down, all the way down.

1110
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,780
All the way down.
Go, go, go, go.

1111
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,860
One, two, three, four, five.

1112
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:31,980
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

1113
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:36,420
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

1114
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,940
Come on, breathe.

1115
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,020
One, two, three, four, five.

1116
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:45,020
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

1117
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,860
Go.

1118
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,420
I got somethin'!

1119
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,340
Good job.
Thank you.

1120
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,260
Nice work, guys.

1121
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:12,100
Jack, you're bleeding.
Huh?

1122
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,100
You're bleeding.
Get it treated.

1123
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,300
Your shifts over.
Merry Christmas.

1124
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,940
Lenny!

1125
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,300
On the night of Christmas Eve,
Baltimore firefighters...

1126
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,700
Jack Morrison and Leonard Richter...

1127
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,820
...entered a blazing apartment block...

1128
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,700
...despite enormous danger to themselves...

1129
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,900
...and saved a young girl's life.

1130
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,900
Now, normally I'd present the medals...

1131
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,500
...but today we have someone
more important...

1132
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,180
...and certainly better looking:
Jenny Buckley.

1133
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,460
Firefighter Jack Morrison.

1134
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,260
Congratulations, Jack.
Thank you, sir.

1135
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,420
Thank you.

1136
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,140
You're welcome.

1137
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,660
Firefighter Leonard Richter.

1138
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,620
Come on. Come on!

1139
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,460
Aah!

1140
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,140
We're through!
Come on, les go!

1141
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,980
Give me your hand.

1142
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:58,140
Come on, this way!
Lets go!

1143
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,020
We got a rebar! Come on!

1144
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,580
Come on!
We need equipment up here!

1145
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:24,500
All units report to the 11th floor now.

1146
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,140
Jack. Its me, Jack.

1147
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,540
Chief, I'm through the wall.

1148
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,940
Coming down!

1149
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,900
Oh, God!
Get down!

1150
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,980
Is everybody all right?
Ladder 49 to Command.

1151
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,620
We're through the debris.

1152
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:22,540
And conditions deteriorating rapidly!

1153
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,820
Ladder 49, there's a control room
straight ahead.

1154
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,940
Jack's in there.
You keep going. Just keep going.

1155
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,060
Jack, they're on their way.

1156
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,740
Command, stand by.
I see a door.

1157
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,140
I see a door!

1158
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,860
Jack, they're getting close.

1159
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:45,620
You just hang on there, Jack.
Just hang on.

1160
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,700
Come on, guys!
There's the door.

1161
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,140
Jack, hold on!
We're right here!

1162
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,060
Open it up!
Hold on, Jack!

1163
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:05,700
Open the door!
Come on, les go!

1164
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,940
Close it! Close it!

1165
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,220
Ladder 49 to Command!

1166
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,420
The room is blast over.
We can't get in!

1167
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,980
Its fully engulfed, Chief!

1168
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,100
We're attempting to find
another way to get to Jack!

1169
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:31,180
We have a lot of falling debris here.

1170
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,780
We have falling debris!
We need help.

1171
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,900
Jack, talk to me.

1172
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,940
Jack, talk to me.

1173
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:03,620
Mike, its too late.

1174
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:07,620
Listen to me.
Its no good.

1175
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,900
Pull 'em out.

1176
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,820
Mike...

1177
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,460
...tell Linda I love her...

1178
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:35,540
...that I loved her from the second I saw her.

1179
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,300
Do you hear me?

1180
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,820
Yeah, I hear you.

1181
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:50,020
Promise to take care of my kids.

1182
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:55,700
Tell them that I'm always with them.

1183
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,780
You tell... you tell them that.

1184
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,820
You hear me?

1185
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:10,740
I will.

1186
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,780
Command to all units.
Evacuate the building immediately.

1187
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,260
Truck 16 checking in here, Chief.

1188
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,060
Uh, all units reporting clear.

1189
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,940
The building's clear.
We're all out.

1190
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,460
Copy that.

1191
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,540
Its never an easy thing...

1192
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,220
...saying goodbye to a brother firefighter.

1193
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,140
Its not.

1194
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,980
And this time particularly is difficult for me...

1195
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:52,340
...because I watched Jack grow into a...

1196
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:57,340
...well, into one of the finest
firefighters I've ever known.

1197
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:01,740
He joined this department
because he wanted to help people.

1198
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:04,620
Who knows how many homes are
still standing because Jack was there...

1199
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,300
...or how many lives were spared?

1200
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:12,580
He gave his life for that cause.

1201
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,900
We'll never forget you, Jack.

1202
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:20,620
And we're better for having known you.

1203
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,860
But I make you this one promise:

1204
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:30,140
Tomorrow, when that bell rings...

1205
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:32,700
...we will be back on the truck...

1206
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:35,580
...because you were
the bravest of the brave.

1207
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,940
People are always asking me...

1208
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,100
...how is it that firefighters
run into a burning building...

1209
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,620
...when everyone else is running out?

1210
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,580
Well, Jack, you answered that question...

1211
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:49,980
...by saving another man's life.

1212
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:52,860
Your courage is the answer.

1213
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,820
And today we will be as brave as you...

1214
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,940
...by not mourning you,
but by celebrating your life.

1215
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:10,100
So I'd like everyone to stand up
and celebrate the life...

1216
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:12,020
...of Jack Morrison.

1217
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,020
Thank you.
