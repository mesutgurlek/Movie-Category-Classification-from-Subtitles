[ Ron ] This product has been tested

You know what I'm talking about.

Usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal's in his habitat.

You have a very active imagination.

goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.

one of the world's most important
zoological finds of this century.

This is the home of what is believed
to be the world's largest primate,

a 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.

Joe has been at the California
Animal Conservancy for
a little over a month now.

00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,557
He was brought here from Africa
by Dr Gregory O'Hara,

by Jill Young, the daughter of
famed primatologist Ruth Young.

Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

Both Joe and Jill's mothers
were killed by poachers
12 years ago in the Pangani Forest.
