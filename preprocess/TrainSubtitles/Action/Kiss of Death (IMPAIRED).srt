1

When'd you buy these? They're beautiful.

2
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,071
Bed sheets.

3
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,711
- So where are the drapes? On your bed?
- Gotta try to find the second life in things.

4
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,588
- How's your school?
- Good. Hard.

5
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,513
- I would love to go back.
- So go!

6
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,398
I think it's a little late in the game, no?

7
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,238
School would be a piece of cake
compared to what you've been through.

8
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,198
Thank God for this one, huh?

9

She saved our lives, this little girl.
She really did.

- Hi, Jimmy.

11

Hey, little girl.

12
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,710
Hey, little girl. Big girl.

13
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,594

- Rosie's gonna sit for Corinna, study here.

- Yeah, we got the meeting.

15

I caught the one by work. The nooner.

16
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,910
We were supposed to go tonight.

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,913
Yeah, but I gotta go to Albany tomorrow.
I gotta check out that body shop.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,276
I think it's better when we go together,
don't you?

19
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,069
Huh...

20

Jimmy fucked up?

21
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,750
How much I owe?

22
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,229
Gimme a dollar.

23
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,311
OK.

24
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,992
You go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby.

25
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,231

- No big thing.

26

I can go back to jail just for talkin' to you.

Little Junior Brown.

Ronnie, this is your problem.
I don't give a shit.

43

Look what he did to my hand last week.
He thought I shorted him $50.

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,835
Now I got $350,000 worth of this guy's cars

Get outta here.

You don't want my fuckin' money? Huh?

55
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
I remember after your mom died.
You remember?

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,711
And your father used to go on his benders.
Whose people came to get you, man?

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,394
Whose people came to get you?
Where'd you live?

58
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,948
When you had no place to live,
where'd you live?

59
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,238
- That was a long time ago.
- My family's never asked you for nothin'.

60
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,317
Jimmy, I never asked you for nothin', man.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,109
Jimmy, this guy's gonna cripple me, man.
He's gonna cripple me.

62
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,351
I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy.
I'm your blood cousin.

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,431
It'll take two hours, man.

64
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,072
Please don't let this happen. Please don't let
this fuckin' guy hurt me. He's gonna kill me!

65
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,551
The babysitter from upstairs, get her down.
It'll take two hours. Pay her double.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,631
Please, Jimmy. Please...

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,991
Please.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,797
- Hey. I wake your parents up?
- Don't worry about it.

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,269
- OK. I should be back in two hours.
- OK.

70
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,351
- Thanks.
- Sure.

71
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,792
Since you went away, man, we got big, man.
No more smash-and-grab bullshit.

72
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,670
You know I got a half-size difference in my
shoes and gotta put three insoles in the left?

73
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,832
Now when I see some shoes I want,
I buy two pairs - 10½ and 11.

74
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,913

- I don't give a fuck about your shoes.

75
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,479
Mr. Jimmy!

76
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,189
I'm talkin' $200, $300 kicks.
When you want back in, you let me...

77
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,196
You playin' time games with me?

78
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,512
Whoa. Junior, I'm your man.
It's gonna happen.

79
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,911
Remove the fucking hand.

80
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,075
I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here.
There's no problem. Let's just do it.

Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault.

He's fuckin' socked.

Half now. He'll throw you the rest after.

- I wanna visit my daughter.

316

She's livin' upstate with my mother-in-law,
who won't let her come and see me.

317
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,839
And I want a one-day trip
to go up there and see her. One day.

318
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,358
- No.

Tell me something. Surprise me.

John Amato. Call him Johnny A.

...they'll know who did the talking.

331

So, throw me in a line-up.
I'll take my chances.

332
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,508
That's all I have to say about this.

333

Tell me about the navy yard.

Same guys: Johnny A, Bobby B and me.

335
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,710
That's three. There were four transporters.

336

I didn't know the fourth driver.
I never saw him before.

I've got no reason to lie.

Everybody's got a reason to lie.

343
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,559
Astro Jewelers? That was four years ago.

344

Who ratted us out?

345
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,873
Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear.

346
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,317
I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes
on me. Did they pick Ronnie up too?

347
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,031
- Ronnie Gannon?
- Yeah. The whole job was his idea.

348
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,032
No, his name didn't even come up.

349
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,271
Did the prosecutor's office
contact you about this?

350
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,194
No. How stupid do ya think I am?
I wouldn't talk to anybody without you.

351
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,918
Yeah. Well, they also got picked up
on the navy yard thing.

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,798
- Who did?
- Bobby and Johnny.

Ronnie too?

354
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,189

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,235
So if that means I need to deliver up
this Junior Brown, I'll do that.

461
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,756
If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there,
I will.

462
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,195
But all I've got on you is your word.

463
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,078
So I'm asking you: if I serve him up...

464
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,595
...as a man of honor, will you say to me now
that you will cut me loose once and for all?

465
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,871
Absolutely.

466
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,593
D'you want my hand on it or something?

467

<i>(guard)</i> OK, let him pass.

That's my daddy!

00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,591
Let's go.

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,149
See the brother here with Junior?

483
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,711
His name's Omar. Now, Omar's down
with some posse outta Philadelphia.

484
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,191
Must got cash as long as train smoke
cos he's Junior's biggest customer.

485
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,831
Cars, drugs, guns. He's buyin'
everything he can get his hands on.

486
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,150
So when you hook up with your scumbag
pals, I want you to get 'em talkin' about Omar.

487
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,676
He must be new. The Philadelphia PD
ain't got no jacket on him yet.

488
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,751
Wait.

489

This is <i>about</i> Little Junior.

just relax. Don't push for nothin', all right?

492
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,750
Guy starts talkin', just ask for more details,

Yeah.

519
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,273
I heard you lost your wife.

520
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,995
I lost my father last week.

521
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,308
Whaddaya think is worse?

522
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,789
Losin' a wife or losin' a father?

523
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,671
I don't know.

524
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,838
I guess it depends on the individual,
the relationship, whatnot.

525
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,478
You know what an asthma attack feels like?

526
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,354
Feels like you're tryin' to breathe air
through a flattened straw.

527
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,877
But if I take a hit of this, most times I'm OK.

528
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,191
Like that.

529
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,720
But my old man?

530
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,791
In the end?

531
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,630
He had less than five per cent
of his lung capacity.

532
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,318
I mean... he went out hard.

533
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,309
I'm sorry to hear that.

534
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,792
If that starts happenin' with me -
with genetics and shit - it's silver-bullet time.

535
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,950
I'll do it myself.

536
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,873
At least your wife, she went out fast, right?

537
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,915
I'm tellin' ya, man,
you gotta be grateful for that.

538

So, Sing Sing... You got through that.

539

makes you stronger, right?

Which hand did you grab her with?

550
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,636
Put it on the table.
I'm only gonna say that once.

You should give yourself an acronym.
Cos it helps you visualize your goals.

<i>What the fuck did you do?</i>

777
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,789
<i>You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.</i>
<i>That's what I did.</i>

778
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,996
- You finished with me now?
- You gotta be dreaming.

779
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,070
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

780
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,030
State or federal?

781
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,791
Both.

782
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,191
Come on, scumbag.

783

786
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,432
Can I take her on the beach at least?

787
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,354
- I'm tellin' ya, there ain't gonna be no trial.
- They're gonna cop a plea.

788
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,991
- Cop a plea? He killed a fed.
- He didn't know John was a fed. OK?

789
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,709
- He can't chance a trial.
- I don't like this cereal.

790
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,271
- We'll do all we can to keep you off the stand.
- You really think I'm that stupid?

791
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,193
Fellas, am I tellin' it the way it is or what?

792
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,314
- You're a fuckin' maniac, you know that?
- So where they hidin' him?

793
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,516
Atlantic City?

794
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,629
How many times you gonna move us?

795
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,110
We can't stay in one place too long.
It's not smart.

796
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,596
Can't you even play with her a little,
goddamn you?

797
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,272
You hangin' on, honey?

798
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,635
Juicy? Hang on.

799
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,551
Hang on. Whoo!

800
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,837
There you go. Hang on.

801
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,951
Oooh!

802
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,992
Hey, sweetie.

803
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,675
Looky here what I got.
Your wife's final exams.

804
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,834
- Think we need to monitor her for cheating?
- She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin.

805
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,036
We're all goin' fuckin' nuts.
I'm losin' my mind.

806
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,315
Ready, honey? Here we go.

807
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,751
Look.

808
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,434
I gotta go into the city tonight.

809
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,159
My youngest daughter, Coral?

810
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:28,631
Maybe tomorrow when I come back
I can bring her with me. You know.

811
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,837
They're about the same age an' all.
Her and Corinna.

812
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,514
That would be really good of you, man.

813
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,953
Hey. Hey!

814
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,951
Ready? Here we go.

815
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,910
Whoa, a space ride!

816
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,992
My guy was in fear of his life,
and he fired in self-defense.

817
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,992
Dover's gun was holstered
when they pulled him outta the car.

818
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:07,552
My guy claims that Agent Dover - Omar -
made a move for it without provocation.

819
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,474
I can produce witnesses to testify that
Agent Dover had drawn a gun on my client...

820
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,437
...at least three times in the past...

821
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,913
...who can testify that they had seen
Agent Dover taking cocaine, repeatedly...

822
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,879
...and that his behavior in the last few
months was bizarre and paranoid.

823
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,270
Mafia shrinks!
The autopsy came up negative on drugs.

824
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,477
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No.

825
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,591
No, huh?

826
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,917
I wanna know if Agent Dover
had assassination clearance.

827
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,514
- Had what?
- All right, let me rephrase.

828
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,230
Had clearance to shoot first if he perceived
that his cover had been blown.

829
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,040
- You goin' fishin' here, Jack?
- Not at all.

830
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,396
I wanna find out if we got
a drug-taking federal agent, strung out...

831
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,471
...with shoot-first clearance.

832
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,790
In all due respect, if that's what we got...

833
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,758
What a bunch of slanderous horseshit!

834
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,951
<i>(car horn)</i>

836
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,957
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hotel called Tesselers.

837
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,871
I'm sorry. You got me.

838
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,748
- It's near Allenville.
- Allenville? You just drove through it.

839
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,037
- Why don't you backtrack and ask there?
- OK, thank you.

840
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,875
You're welcome.

841
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,231
Corinna...

842
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,391
Corinna!

843
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,830
Number three to base. I don't have Corinna.

844
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,469
I want an inventory of all guns,
drugs and cars acquired in New York.

845
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,393
I wanna know how they were
disposed of in Philadelphia.

846
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,952
Was this stuff put back into the community
to establish Dover's street credibility?

847
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,157
I wanna know how many
other agents were involved.

848
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,070
Judge, this is an ongoing operation.

849
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,151
We'd jeopardize agents still in the field.

850
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,878
How can I prove self-defense...

851
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,397
...if I can't show the pressures on the guy or
find out if the guy had shoot-first clearance?

852
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,156
OK. Why don't you bring me all the files?
I'll read them in chambers...

853
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,030
...try to sort out what's privileged
and what's appropriate for discovery.

854
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,988
- I can't do that, Judge.
- What d'you mean? I'm ordering you to.

855
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,358
Either you produce the files
or I dismiss the indictment.

What did...? Honey!

867
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,390
You guys really weren't putting guns back
on the street just for credibility, were you?

868
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,836
I mean... that was just
an educated guess on my part.

869
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,112
If you try to indict him on anything else
I'll still wanna know where the goodies went.

the same thing!

926
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,191
You know the worst part about this job?

927
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,068
Dealing with one lowlife CI after another.
It's enough to make you sick.

928
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,676
Well, I guess you won't have to bother
with that any more, huh, Judge?

929
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,954
Where'd you hear that?

930
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,751
Let Junior Brown walk, win yourself a federal
judgeship. At least you don't come cheap.

931
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,431
You know...

932
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,234
...the Junior Browns of the world
will always be with us.

933
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,151
What's one Junior Brown more or less...

934
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,596
...compared to the work that I can do
as a federal judge?

935
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,912
I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a great judge.

936
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,910
Let's see what happens
when I go to the papers.

937
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,074
With what? "Fuck with the bull,
you get the horns"? What is he, a matador?

938
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,832
Besides, the last I heard that tape
got ate by the garbage monster.

939
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,554
<i>(footsteps)</i>

Jimmy?

941
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,394
You got a phone call.

942
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:35,072
<i>- Hello?</i>
- How soon can you get to Baby Cakes?

943
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,878
<i>- What you doin' there?</i>
- How long?

944
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,712
<i>I don't know... 20 minutes.</i>

945
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,951
- 20 minutes. Don't be late.
<i>- Jimmy...</i>

946
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,557
Shit!

947
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,439
Hey!

948
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,791
Hey! Junior.

949
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,999
What's shakin'?

950
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:18,153
- What are you doin' here?
- I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

951
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,231
You killed a fed.

952
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,152
- How the hell did you walk on that?
- Shit happens.

953
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,198
You blew his brains all over me,
his people know that...

954
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,716
How did they even let you live?
"Shit happens."

955
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,313
"Shit happens." I guess so.

956
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,029
Did you tell the cops
how metal in my mouth makes me gag?

957
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,831
Cos it was a funny thing.

958
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,069
I couldn't get plastic forks in jail.

959
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,480
I had to eat everything with my fingers.

960
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,911
What the hell...?

961
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,988
How did you swing it, Junior?

962
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,877
I'm dyin' to know.

963
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,556
Now is not the time, my man,
but I'm gonna see you real soon.

964
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,479
Let's go.

965
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,471
Get back. Easy. Easy...

Get over there.

968
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,990
See me now.

969
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,119
Jimmy, answer me this. Who do I visit first?

970
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,838
You at your house,
or your wife and kid up at Grandma's?

971
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,157
You don't like the taste of metal
in your mouth, huh?

972
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,071
Open up.

973
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,355
Come on, Junior.

974
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,431
Say "ah".

975
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,669
<i>(wheezes asthmatically)</i>

976
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,115
You saw what I did to Omar?

977
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,671
Guess who's next.

978
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,912
No!

979
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,191
Don't touch him!

980
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,672
<i>(roars)</i>

981
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,474
You know this don't end with you, right?

982
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:31,198
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take your baby girl
for another walk in the woods.

983
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,793
No!

<i>(wheezes)</i>

985
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,631
Hold on. Whoa!

986
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,151
Now you did it.

987
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:51,114
Don't you know you can't go around
hittin' the police. Huh?

988
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,475
What's wrong with you?!

989
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,710
Come on. Get up. Get up!

990
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,758
Don't move. Huh?

991
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,831
<i>(siren)</i>

992
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,635
- What do we got?
- Assaulting an officer.

993
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,711
<i>(Junior)</i> Nobody can touch me!

994
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,311
Nobody.

995
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,351
Jesus, I'm sorry.

996
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,598
You got anything you wanna explain to me,
you suicidal son of a bitch?

997
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,595
<i>- (Junior)</i> Fuck.
- I ain't suicidal.

998
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,912
With this tape, you can drop Junior
down the hole for 30 years.

999
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,871
You still gotta get Zioli to prosecute.

1000
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,750
<i>(Junior) You saw what I did to Omar?</i>

<i>Guess who's next.</i>

1002
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,913
So what?

1003
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,468
What'd he do to Omar? He didn't specify.

1004
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,437
You don't like that tape?

1005
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,511
Well...

1006
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,389
How about this one?
They would love it on TV.

1007
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,436
<i>What's one Junior Brown more or less...</i>

You like that one better?

1011
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,715
I reindict Junior, you gotta take the stand,
start all over again.

1012
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,916
Nah. I think I'm gonna get lost.

1013
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,391
My family's health is in your best interest,
so you better do a good job.

1014
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:42,192
Listen to the part where he says
"You saw what I did to Omar."

1015
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,791
Listen to that again.

1016
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,309
- It's probably better than you think.
- Kilmartin, wait. Jimmy!

1017
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,436
Don't do this to me!
