1
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,164
No time for niceties.

2
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:55,132
Way to be stealthy, Luther.

3
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:58,037
The moment I shut down the grid,
it sent a silent alarm.

4
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,302
They're already on their way here.

5
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,314
Dibs.

6
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,160
The quantum trigger.

7
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,624
Now we have a chance.

8
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,166
Run.

9
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:54,431
That's not going
to slow them down for long.

10
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,539
That's not gonna slow them down at all.

11
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,677
What are you waiting for?

12
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,742
Hurry.

13
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,853
It's time to get serious, Lex.

14
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:22,424
No. We can make it together.
We can do this.

15
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:26,195
Get your shiny bald head out of here.
It's hurting my eyes.

16
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,442
What can I say?

17
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,489
Okay, okay.

18
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,561
I'm down to my Last Joke, anyway.

19
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,958
But this one will kill you.

20
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,773
It won't be in vain, old friend.

21
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,915
ULTRAMAN:
Luthor.

22
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,754
You think you can hide
from my ultra-vision?

23
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:31,919
You're gonna pay
for what you've done, mate.

24
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:35,031
- That's a promise.
- I've gotta a promise of my own.

25
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,294
I'm going to finish the Job
the Jester started.

26
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:42,631
But not Just yet.

27
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:43,783
The work would go a lot faster
if l were up there with you, guys.

28
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,355
Patience. I'm almost ready for you.

29
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,554
How much is all this costing, Bruce?

30
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,320
I don't like to think about it.

31
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,794
All right, Flash. Beginning test run.

32
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,991
l don't know, Batman.
This is pretty radical.

33
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,692
You're absolutely sure it works?

34
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,798
Pretty sure.

35
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,167
Pretty sure? That isn't--

36
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,004
--good enough.

37
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,479
TeIeporter's on-line.

38
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,177
Are you crazy?

39
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:14,710
Is he crazy?

40
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,286
How could he use that thing on me
if he wasn't sure?

41
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,685
- He was Joking.
- Yeah, how can you tell?

42
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:22,925
You really think he would risk your life
if he wasn't sure?

43
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:25,318
Well, maybe.

44
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,657
I mean, I don't think he likes me
very much.

45
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:30,858
I don't think he likes anyone very much.

46
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,044
Good morning.

47
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:54,590
Would you be kind enough to tell me where
I could find the nearest police station?

48
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:06,028
Excuse me, it's very important that I--

49
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,899
Yeah, yeah. Cool your Jets.

50
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,700
This is a police station.
Everything's important he--

51
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,672
Luthor.

52
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,970
No need to make a scene.

53
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,581
I want you to contact
the Justice League for me.

54
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,808
Or else?

55
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,878
Oh, I don't know.

56
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,918
I'll destroy the world?

57
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,817
Is that sufficient?

58
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,357
Superman. Go ahead.

59
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,690
BATMAN:
We've got a problem.

60
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:34,991
One of yours.

61
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,168
It's okay. We'll take it from here.

62
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,338
Oh, and they call me The Flash.

63
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:53,177
- What do you think you're doing?
- I've come to talk.

64
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,911
As you can see, I'm not armed.

65
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,816
You're going to find what I have to say
very difficult to believe.

66
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,654
You're from a parallel Earth.

67
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,489
How could you possibly know that?

68
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:09,224
Your internal organs are reversed,
your heart is on the wrong side.

69
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,662
It could be a trick.

70
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,262
Could be.

71
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,437
But our Luthor's still in his cell
on Stryker's Island.

72
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:21,806
And now that we've clarified the matter
of my evil twin...

73
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,641
...I've got quite a story to tell you.

74
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,473
Pants.

75
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:28,776
Oh.

76
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:38,254
My world is similar to yours in many ways
but very different in others.

77
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:39,919
Oh, wait, wait, don't tell me.

78
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:42,725
On your world,
you're the leader of the Justice League.

79
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,499
As a matter of fact, I was.

80
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:47,061
Past tense.

81
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm not Just the Leader
of my world's Justice League.

82
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:53,543
I'm its only surviving member.

83
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:57,841
We were systematically destroyed
by a group of super powered beings...

84
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,846
...known as the Crime Syndicate.

85
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:04,013
They've run rampant for years,
doing whatever they pleased.

86
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,012
They rule through fear...

87
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,690
...occasionally turning their powers
against the populace, Just to remind us.

88
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,592
In the hope of maintaining
some minimal order...

89
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,324
...the authorities simply pretend
they aren't there.

90
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,594
But increasingly,
they refuse to be ignored.

91
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:23,332
The Syndicate
has completely intimidated civil authority.

92
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:24,974
The police won't arrest them...

93
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,077
...and prosecutors
wouldn't press charges if they did.

94
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,515
The only thing keeping them from
completely overthrowing the government...

95
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,674
...is the threat of a nuclear response.

96
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:38,379
You people are my world's last hope.

97
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,523
We have to discuss this.

98
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:47,926
Please wait out here.

99
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,749
- I don't trust him.
- There's a surprise.

100
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,320
Maybe he's on the up and up.
You said yourself, he's not our Luthor.

101
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,753
Still, never met a Luthor I liked.

102
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,625
I've read his mind, he's telling the truth.

103
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,625
Regardless, we have a responsibility...

104
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:21,458
...to the millions of people
being oppressed on his world.

105
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,430
For all my power, when it comes down to it,
I'm a beat cop.

106
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,662
There are rules. Another dimension
may be out of our Jurisdiction.

107
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,836
I can't believe we're having this discussion.
Of course we're going to help.

108
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,943
She's right. That's what we do.

109
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,750
- Not this time.
- Why not?

110
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:43,277
We've got too much on our plate
right here.

111
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:46,184
We haven't even finished constructing
our new headquarters.

112
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,985
Our first responsibility
is to protect the Earth.

113
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,321
That's right. Our Earth.

114
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,020
We don't have enough manpower
to even do that properly.

115
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:57,295
Fair enough.
But we're talking about millions of people.

116
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:01,063
We can't Just turn our backs.
We have to go.

117
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,476
All right, Luthor, we'll help.

118
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,974
But we need a plan.

119
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,716
I have one, of course.

120
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,243
What's so fascinating?

121
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,147
Luthor has solved
the decoherence problem.

122
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,256
Darling, unless there's money involved,
you're still boring me.

123
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:55,286
Parallel Earth's.

124
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,825
Luthor is not only proven they exist...

125
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:00,987
...he's figured out
how to travel between them.

126
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,024
Any sign of the quantum trigger?

127
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:07,230
We've searched the entire complex.
If it was here, it's not now.

128
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:08,829
Right.

129
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,237
Download all these records
into my personal computer.

130
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:17,275
The rest of you, strip this place
of anything useful, then destroy it.

131
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,761
This could be disorienting,
but there are no other side effects that--

132
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,022
What the hell?

133
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,392
We're compromised.

134
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,590
What tipped you off?

135
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,536
I don't have time for this.
I need that data.

136
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,034
Take them down.

137
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:49,442
That will be enough of that.

138
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:18,196
- That's what I call tuning somebody up.
WOMAN: Excuse me.

139
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:22,037
Can I talk to you for a minute?

140
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,111
Hera.

141
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,438
I've played this game before.

142
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,242
You don't wanna fight me.

143
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,577
You wanna help me.

144
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:11,313
I don't wanna fight you, I want....

145
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,683
Hey, this is like the Jedi mind trick.

146
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,752
This is not like the Jedi mind trick.

147
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:20,357
This is not like the Jedi mind trick.

148
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,594
Sorry.

149
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,098
J'onn J'onzz:
Stop that.

150
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:01,803
We've got to retreat.

151
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,439
Why? We're winning.

152
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,336
Superwoman's called in the cavalry...

153
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,000
...and if it's who I think it is,
we're not prepared.

154
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:10,112
Don't make us guess.
What are we in for?

155
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,182
At least three Made Men,
almost as tough as Superwoman.

156
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,175
- Made Men?
- Later.

157
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,842
I don't have time to explain.

158
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,784
Follow me.

159
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,695
FLASH:
Oh, crap.

160
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,204
GREEN LANTERN:
I've got you.

161
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,380
Heads up.

162
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:16,912
More trouble.

163
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,329
Get off my plane.

164
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:22,035
Is that one of us in Owlman's plane?

165
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:24,174
Two of us. Wonder Woman swiped it.

166
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:27,105
Then there may be a way out of this.
Swing around for me.

167
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,731
Stay on top of him. The plane is mine.

168
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:59,904
Where is it? What are you looking for?

169
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:03,069
Chameleon circuit.
Owlman used to drive me crazy--

170
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,742
Found it. What's it do?

171
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,664
Lantern, we're cloaked right above you.

172
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,967
Hold fire, our ride's here.

173
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,106
- Hang on.
- Whoa!

174
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:39,539
Ooh!

175
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,915
Strafe the skies.

176
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:04,935
Well, that's fried.

177
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:07,542
It doesn't matter, we're still cloaked.

178
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:10,111
WONDER WOMAN: And we've lost them.
At least for the moment.

179
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:13,710
So, genius, where to now?

180
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,243
JOHNNY QUICK:
Yeah, handed them a right thumping...

181
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,254
- ...I heard, let the blinking side down a bit.
ULTRAMAN: Come to order.

182
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,418
First business.

183
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,687
We've gotta decide
who we're calling up to replace J'arkus.

184
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:26,988
God rest his soul.

185
00:22:27,464 --> 00:22:29,955
There's no managerial talent
in that organization.

186
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,761
We should dissolve them
and spilt up his territory.

187
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,269
Right, seems to me you've already helped
yourself to the Martian's crew.

188
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,305
You had the whole bunch this morning.

189
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,236
Made Men need to be associated
with one of the family heads...

190
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:43,777
...if you want some of them.

191
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,177
We can horse-trade
for manpower any time.

192
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,614
- What about the turf?
SUPERWOMAN: I'm with Owlman.

193
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,912
We'll divide his action
between the five of us.

194
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,646
Who died and made you boss?

195
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,818
You wanna arm wrestle for it?

196
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,254
Knock it off.

197
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,053
We'll work out details later.

198
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:01,095
For now, Owlman can keep
J'edd J'arkus' guys.

199
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:04,495
From what I hear, sounds like
you could have used a few dozen more.

200
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:08,230
Luthor's new Justice League
is not be underestimated.

201
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,771
Neither are we. They'll fold.

202
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,135
Or we'll fold them.

203
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,675
Just like everybody else
who gets in our way.

204
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:17,245
Which brings us to the topic at hand.

205
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:21,578
Last meeting, five of six family heads
approved of Project Damocles.

206
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:26,712
Per our vote, I have begun construction
on this, the quantum eigenstate device.

207
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,487
Once completed, the QED will give us
life-and-death power over the entire planet.

208
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:36,228
We spent 37 billion on government bribes
last year.

209
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,891
No more of that.
We'll be the government.

210
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:42,732
I still don't see why they would give up
the little bit of power they got left.

211
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:46,398
Because if they don't, we'll do this.

212
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,874
The device's Heisenberg
uncertainty override...

213
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:53,073
...allows us to tap into a limitless pool
of destructive energy.

214
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,880
Which leaves the governments
of the world with two choices:

215
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:04,255
Bow down to us or die.

216
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:06,990
ROSE:
The thing to remember...

217
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,758
...is we don't have to be afraid
of the Crime Syndicate.

218
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,094
REPORTER: If that's true,
why do you have bodyguards?

219
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,035
Come on, my father's the president.
I had guards before I started speaking out.

220
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,175
Isn't it irresponsible of you
to be out here making speeches...

221
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:21,776
...in direct contradiction
of your father's policies?

222
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:26,609
I love my father, but we disagree about this,
and I have the right to free speech.

223
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:29,547
If we leave the Syndicate be,
they'll Let us live our lives.

224
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,950
- We don't have the power to fight them.
- No.

225
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,885
Might doesn't make right.

226
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,116
It may seem that way,
but in the long run...

227
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:37,851
...it's the other way around.

228
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:41,555
We are always stronger
when we're doing the right thing.

229
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,635
LEX:
Lights.

230
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,079
I love what you've done with the place.

231
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,344
LEX: It's not mine.
It used to belong to a friend.

232
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm sorry, Harley.

233
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:12,894
The Jester's never coming back.

234
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:20,695
We should consider ourselves lucky
there's any place left to hide.

235
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:24,671
We're not here to hide, Luthor.
We're here to clean up your planet's mess.

236
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:27,373
Then by all means, let's get started.

237
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,772
And call me Lex.

238
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,113
These are the big guns,
the heads of the six.

239
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,114
I should say, five families.

240
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:40,655
Ultraman is the boss of bosses,
but they all front formidable organizations.

241
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:42,951
Where do all those
super powered guys fit in?

242
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,457
LEX:
Each of the family heads...

243
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,653
...have thousands
of criminals working under them.

244
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,288
They reward their most trusted lieutenants
by giving them superpowers.

245
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,230
They're called Made Men.

246
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:53,699
Cute. How many?

247
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,065
LEX:
No more than seven or eight at a time.

248
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,706
Perhaps 50, total.

249
00:25:57,874 --> 00:26:00,968
We'll conduct a series of attacks,
coordinated by me.

250
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,738
The six of us
will hit specific Syndicate operations...

251
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:04,972
...one after the other.

252
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,981
- That's a waste of time.
- I beg your pardon?

253
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,552
We're going to hit multiple targets
at the same time. Teams of two.

254
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:13,522
We'd be hopelessly outnumbered.

255
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,955
- When my Justice League fought them--
- All due respect, Lex.

256
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:18,651
We aren't your Justice League.

257
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,960
- What's the call?
- You and J'onn.

258
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:23,156
Diana and GL. He's with me.

259
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,527
That's insane.

260
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:27,329
- Don't worry, Lex. He's got your slack.
- Flash.

261
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,833
Well, you do.

262
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,847
You're supposed to call first.

263
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,921
What's the point of having your keys
if I can't drop in unexpectedly?

264
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,921
Still Looking for the quantum trigger?

265
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:53,422
Yes, but in the meantime, I've been working
on something equally interesting.

266
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,662
We can use it to travel
to any of the alternate Earth's.

267
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,733
It's based on Luthor's design.

268
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:00,494
I've made some improvements.

269
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:05,600
Do you realize
what we could do with this?

270
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,767
The philosophical implications
are tremendous, of course.

271
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,037
Philosophy.

272
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,944
There's an infinite number of Earth's
out there to conquer. You and me.

273
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:17,348
We wouldn't have to share our cut
with the Syndicate.

274
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,452
That's certainly one way to go.

275
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:02,997
Whoa!

276
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,989
- Right, then. Abandon ship if you can.
- Oh! Oh!

277
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:18,859
- I got her.
- No.

278
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:21,202
She's mine.

279
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,774
Ultraman, I know you can hear me.

280
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,938
Bring your arrogant ass out here
or we'll come in and get you.

281
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:13,454
Not Looking for the hired help, Olsen.
I want your boss.

282
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,647
He ain't here.

283
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,349
If you want an appointment,
you can call his secretary.

284
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:19,358
Clear our airspace.

285
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,229
Make me.

286
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,763
I can do that.

287
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,831
You take care of Ultraman's pal.
I got the big guy.

288
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:34,575
I'd rather not have to hurt you, Jimmy.

289
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,557
You sure you want to do this?
I can take him.

290
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:52,058
If it's going to mean anything
after you're gone, it has to be me.

291
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,924
Get your hands off my boy.

292
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,298
You've got problems of your own.

293
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,739
Getting cocky, Lex?

294
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:18,180
You think you can come
to my place of business and call me out?

295
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,060
Ooh!

296
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:33,359
Did you forget who I am?
How I got to be the boss of bosses?

297
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,369
I'm here
because I'm the baddest of the bad.

298
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,939
Anybody whoever stood in my way
is dead.

299
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:41,076
Everybody.

300
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,576
I brought you a present.

301
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,587
[WEAKLY]
Blue kryptonite.

302
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,622
The only thing that can hurt you.

303
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,218
But I--

304
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,191
Destroyed the last piece on Earth?

305
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:03,355
True. But I've been visiting other Earth's.

306
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:21,775
You are so gonna regret this.

307
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,284
Got a message for you, big man.
Things are changing.

308
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:26,683
When you do wrong...

309
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:29,620
...there are more and more of us
who aren't afraid to set it right.

310
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,410
United States Secret Service.

311
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:58,076
The president would like a word with you.

312
00:33:58,254 --> 00:33:59,983
WILSON:
This is unacceptable, Lex.

313
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:03,683
- What do you think you're doing?
LEX: That should be obvious, Mr. President.

314
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,589
We're taking it to the bad guys, sir.

315
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,730
Well, you should be very proud.

316
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:11,355
Have you given the slightest thought
to the consequences of your actions?

317
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,092
Don't talk to me like a child.

318
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,067
I was fighting this battle long before
your administration...

319
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,298
...decided to roll over for the Syndicate.

320
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,998
We didn't roll over.

321
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:23,509
We've worked to achieve
a delicate balance with the Crime Syndicate.

322
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,013
It's the only way the American people
can live in relative safety.

323
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:30,243
Forgive me, Mr. President,
but that's a load of crap.

324
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,217
Be that as it may,
I've already ordered the release of Ultraman.

325
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,587
You did what?

326
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,319
You wanna watch your tone?

327
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,986
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

328
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,895
I Just don't understand
how you could Let them go free.

329
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:47,593
You clearly don't understand
much of anything.

330
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,967
Do you think anybody would testify
against the Crime Syndicate?

331
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,906
Do you think if anybody were willing,
we could keep them alive until trial?

332
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,405
- We can.
- Oh?

333
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,673
Are you going to protect
their families too?

334
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,340
Are you going to stay here
and watch over us forever?

335
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,542
Obviously not.

336
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,156
But we can stop them right now.
Put an end to their hold over you.

337
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:09,447
Kill them?

338
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,149
No. We don't do that.

339
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,622
WILSON:
Then I've got a better idea.

340
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:17,994
Why don't you go home
and end all crime on your own planet?

341
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,761
Why don't you grow a backbone.

342
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,294
Not now, Rose.

343
00:35:22,472 --> 00:35:24,963
Then when, Dad? We've got a chance.

344
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:26,165
That's a fantasy.

345
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:30,301
We can't fight these guys
without risking the lives of millions.

346
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:32,576
ROSE:
My God, Dad.

347
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:35,684
You were a war hero.
When did you turn into a coward?

348
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:37,114
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
He is not a coward.

349
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:38,685
Men who have seen battle...

350
00:35:38,855 --> 00:35:41,119
...are often among those
who hold life most dear.

351
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,054
- How did you know what I was thinking?
- It was an accident.

352
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:45,785
I didn't mean to read your mind.

353
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:47,930
There's a saying on my world:

354
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:52,796
"The only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing."

355
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,295
It's easy for someone like you
to be brave.

356
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,063
But most of us aren't bulletproof.

357
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,142
Sir, I stand up to guys more powerful
than I am all the time.

358
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,743
You can do the same.

359
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:04,745
That simple, huh?

360
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:08,680
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but we're not about to give up this fight.

361
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,581
Not when we finally have a chance
to win it.

362
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:38,844
- Aren't you supposed to be helping?
- I am helping.

363
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:40,539
I'm improving the ambiance.

364
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:42,616
In a way, that's what I'm planning to do.

365
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:46,854
After all, what good is a bomb
if you don't detonate it?

366
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,295
You never had any intention of using
the QED for blackmail.

367
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,227
You're going to use it to kill everybody.

368
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,726
What if I am?

369
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,899
Just tell me. Why?

370
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:03,834
Why not?

371
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,030
I'm serious.

372
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:08,234
I'm a murdering psychopath.
It's part of my charm.

373
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:09,878
I do find it attractive.

374
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:12,446
But you never make a move
without a reason.

375
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,480
Why would you want to destroy
the world?

376
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,711
Because it's the only action one could take
that would have any purpose.

377
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:20,719
You Lost me there.

378
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:26,555
Every decision we make is meaningless...

379
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:31,457
...because somewhere, on a parallel Earth,
we have already made the opposite choice.

380
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:33,124
We're nothing.

381
00:37:33,302 --> 00:37:34,894
Less than nothing.

382
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:36,566
How can you say that?

383
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,969
We're rich. We're conquerors.

384
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:41,672
And here we're poor. We're slaves.

385
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,904
And here, our parents never met,
so we were never born.

386
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:47,782
Here, the world ended in nuclear war.

387
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,113
Here, no fish was ever brave enough
to crawl up on land...

388
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:52,754
...and humans never evolved.

389
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,288
And so on, ad infinitum.

390
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,655
So even if you destroy the world,
there are a billion others, right?

391
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,762
What difference would it make?

392
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,889
Somewhere in the multi verse,
there is a world I call Earth Prime.

393
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:08,161
Every Earth is a variation of this one,
the original.

394
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:12,273
And once I destroy it,
all reality will follow.

395
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,581
I take it back.
You're much crazier than I am.

396
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,179
Don't get in my way.

397
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:26,844
To the contrary.

398
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,917
I'm in.

399
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:41,269
I thought I might find you here.

400
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,962
- I'm not talking to you.
- Then listen.

401
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:49,106
You're going to have to stop speaking out
against the Syndicate. At Least in public.

402
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:53,009
You know, when I was a little girl,
you were my hero.

403
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:55,412
What's happened to you?

404
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,982
Maybe we both grew up.

405
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:14,566
ULTRAMAN:
Kids, huh?

406
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:19,299
They drive us crazy, but we'd still
do anything to protect them. Am I right?

407
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,309
What do you want?

408
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,972
Saw your daughter on the news
the other night.

409
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:28,343
- She's got a mouth on her.
- It's a free country.

410
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:30,144
We both know better than that.

411
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,386
You get your little girl under control,
or I'll do it for you.

412
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:37,157
Remember what happened
to the First Lady.

413
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:40,022
If you come near my daughter,
I will nuke you.

414
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,322
You hear me?

415
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,394
ULTRAMAN:
Yeah, the nukes.

416
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:48,162
- Great equalizer, huh?
- Uhn!

417
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:51,400
Well, Let me tell you something,
Mr. President.

418
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:54,975
My boys are working up a bomb
of our own.

419
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,210
Nice place.

420
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,245
I think I'm gonna like it here.

421
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,950
I'm getting bored again.
Did you find Earth Prime?

422
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,856
Still Looking. But I found something else.

423
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,025
Luthor took the quantum trigger
to a parallel Earth.

424
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,523
Would you be a dear...

425
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,794
...pop over to the universe next door
and pick it up for me?

426
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,580
COMPUTER VOICE:
Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert.

427
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:44,692
Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert.

428
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:53,030
It's here. Spread out and find it.

429
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,285
You're on my property. Stand down.

430
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,190
You're in over your head.

431
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,793
Back off before I come over there
and hurt you.

432
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,323
Insect.

433
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,728
Stay down. You're outnumbered.

434
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,541
Count again.

435
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:17,709
You guys are in trouble.

436
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,847
Take them.

437
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,698
Careful, Aquaman.
They're stronger than you are.

438
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:36,327
That remains to be seen.

439
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,811
Okay, this is gonna be tougher
than I thought.

440
00:43:35,798 --> 00:43:37,197
Wanna hear a secret?

441
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:05,780
You've got possibilities, little man.

442
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:11,216
But, sadly,
I don't have time to play with you.

443
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:16,058
Let's go.

444
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,880
- Take this to Owlman.
- Yes, mistress.

445
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:35,209
What about him?

446
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:40,889
Oh, I'm sure I'll think of something.

447
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:44,824
ROSE: We're all here for the same reason.
We're tired.

448
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:46,723
Tired of living in fear.

449
00:45:46,895 --> 00:45:50,661
Tired of our elected officials
bending over for vicious criminals.

450
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:54,536
It doesn't have to be that way.

451
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:58,366
Joining me today are elected officials
who aren't afraid to act.

452
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,270
Judges, prosecutors, police officers...

453
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:03,911
...and brave people
like each and every one of you.

454
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:08,014
Together we can win. Together we--

455
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:11,476
Excuse me.

456
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,761
No. Stay away from me.

457
00:46:49,324 --> 00:46:50,951
How Long have you been watching me?

458
00:46:51,126 --> 00:46:54,721
My apologies for the deception.
I doubt this will be the Last attempt.

459
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:58,230
With your permission,
I'll continue to keep close watch on you...

460
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,561
...until the immediate crisis has passed.

461
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,297
That would be Just fine.

462
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:17,913
Nice moves.
You remind me of my boyfriend.

463
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,153
Whatever will I do with you?

464
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:28,494
I could use this to send you away.

465
00:47:28,997 --> 00:47:30,123
Perhaps to here...

466
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:35,100
...an Earth where humanity has mutated
into hideous creatures of the night.

467
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,935
No. You might like that.

468
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:39,768
Oh. Here's a good one.

469
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:44,302
A cold, uninhabited Earth,
where you'll slowly starve to death...

470
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:47,038
...if you don't freeze first.

471
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:49,651
Or it might be fun to keep you as a pet.

472
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:55,046
Here. Let me do that.

473
00:47:57,826 --> 00:48:00,158
- Your call.
- Sorry.

474
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:01,626
You're not my type.

475
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:07,493
That's going to cost you a rib.

476
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:11,366
Aah! Ow!

477
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,468
I like my lovers to make a little noise.

478
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:18,738
What else can I break?

479
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:28,719
You think you can hide from me
with a smoke bomb?

480
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:35,357
BATMAN:
It's not smoke.

481
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:41,559
It's anaesthetic gas.

482
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:58,148
Batman to Justice League.

483
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:06,591
Aah.

484
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:11,788
You sure that will hold her?

485
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:16,694
- What did you hide on my satellite?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

486
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:22,136
What was so valuable
that the Crime Syndicate...

487
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,005
...would cross dimensions to get it?

488
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:26,806
- Did you keep it from her?
- Her henchman escaped with it.

489
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:28,539
Whatever it was.

490
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:32,049
It's the quantum trigger,
the detonator for a bomb they're building.

491
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,780
Without it, we could fight them,
but now--

492
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:36,446
Why didn't you Just destroy it?

493
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:39,218
It's pure energy. It can't be destroyed.

494
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:41,221
Okay. They've got it.

495
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,863
What's the worst-case scenario?

496
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:47,467
LEX: They could use it to set off an explosion
that would wipe out the entire Earth.

497
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:54,236
You think too small.

498
00:49:58,946 --> 00:50:00,072
Where's Superwoman?

499
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,648
Probably Just blowing us off.
Like I should have.

500
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:05,411
We're not waiting anymore.
Let's get started.

501
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,781
People aren't as intimidated
as they used to be.

502
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:10,651
I should go down for a Jog
and terrorize the straights.

503
00:50:10,825 --> 00:50:13,692
Even regular law enforcement's
starting to show some backbone.

504
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:15,328
Archer got himself arrested.

505
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:18,397
Public opinion wouldn't be an issue
if the bomb were ready.

506
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:21,228
The QED is nearly complete.

507
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:23,267
I have agents out
gathering some equipment.

508
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:27,365
Sorry, sorry to come in
without permission...

509
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,568
...but Superwoman said
to bring this right to you.

510
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,949
You don't have to wear that disguise.
No one can see in here.

511
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,182
I thought it would make you
more comfortable.

512
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,020
Just the opposite.
I'd like to get to know the real you.

513
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:52,832
That's better.

514
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:55,867
- Are you really from Mars?
- Yes.

515
00:50:56,037 --> 00:50:58,164
And can all Martians read minds?

516
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,967
Could. I am the Last survivor.

517
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,802
I apologize for reading your mind before.

518
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,143
It is considered extremely impolite to do so
without permission.

519
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:13,481
I didn't mind.
It seemed, I don't know, natural.

520
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,346
We are attuned.

521
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:22,186
Our minds are in sync to a degree
that was rare even among my own people.

522
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:25,855
I never imagined I'd meet a human
so complimentary to myself.

523
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,470
I feel it, attuned.

524
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,229
What are you doing?

525
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:33,600
Trying to kiss you.

526
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:36,971
On Earth, it's a way of sharing affection.

527
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:40,581
This is how we do it on Mars.

528
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,313
Know me.

529
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:40,268
That was.... Wow.

530
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:43,706
Now we know each other.

531
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:48,547
All the battles the Justice League
have won.

532
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,684
You think you can beat
the Crime Syndicate?

533
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,411
If we could find them, I have little doubt.

534
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:57,615
I could find out where their base is.
My father's known for years.

535
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:26,985
You wanna give us a hand here?

536
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:29,782
Final calculations. Very delicate.

537
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,135
FLASH:
Are we there yet?

538
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,139
That wasn't funny the first 15 times
you said it, either.

539
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,243
Enjoy yourselves while you can.

540
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:54,347
- My friends are going to tear you apart.
- Told you we should have Left her.

541
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:57,643
We couldn't take the chance she'd escape
and warn them we're coming.

542
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:02,152
When I get loose,
I'm killing you right after Batman. Uhn!

543
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,053
Doesn't mean we have to listen to her,
though.

544
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:12,923
How are we supposed to get in again?

545
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,898
Multi-frequency band,
encryption analyser-replicator pack.

546
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,004
Some of us don't speak Star Trek.

547
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,902
Think of it
as a fancy garage-door opener.

548
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,711
Come on, then.
Pitch in, you miserable git.

549
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:34,014
JOHNNY QUICK:
Having a kip, are we? I'm talking to you.

550
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,546
The hangar doors Just opened.

551
00:54:44,832 --> 00:54:48,131
Is it Just me,
or does this seem a little too easy?

552
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:13,884
We were Just about to come
Looking for you.

553
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,394
The QED is armed now.
You'll want to surrender.

554
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,499
ULTRAMAN:
You heard him. We've got the bomb.

555
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:22,295
Everybody does what we say, or else.

556
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,494
You're bluffing.

557
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:26,731
As Long as the bomb's here,
all you can blow up is your own house.

558
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,933
Maybe you should surrender.
We've taken down dozens of you.

559
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,272
And now the odds are 6-to-3.

560
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:35,006
SUPERWOMAN: Count again.
- Uhn! Uhn!

561
00:55:35,182 --> 00:55:36,649
Look who I found in the hangar.

562
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:31,089
Submit.

563
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:50,241
Bugger.

564
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:32,709
No.

565
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:44,329
- What Just happened?
- He's taken the QED to Earth Prime.

566
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,331
If he detonates it, he'll destroy all reality.

567
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:50,431
- I'm not liking the sound of that.
- Don't listen to him.

568
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:52,834
Owlman's Just taking the bomb
to a hiding place.

569
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,874
Don't try and con me.
What are you two doing?

570
00:59:57,277 --> 00:59:58,608
LEX:
There's no way to follow him.

571
00:59:58,779 --> 01:00:00,872
- It's over.
- Not yet.

572
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,715
How many coordinates
does this thing keep in memory?

573
01:00:03,884 --> 01:00:05,283
The Last dozen or so, but--

574
01:00:05,452 --> 01:00:07,113
That's more than enough.

575
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:22,234
Owlman's way ahead of us.
We're locked out.

576
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:23,870
Unless....

577
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,563
Someone vibrating at the right speed
could piggyback...

578
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,709
...on Owlman's carrier wave
and open a portal.

579
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:31,742
But he'd have to be fast.

580
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:34,779
- I'm your man.
- No, you're not. You're too slow.

581
01:00:34,948 --> 01:00:36,711
- What?
- I know your limitations.

582
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:40,320
You can't possibly reach the speed
necessary to pull this off.

583
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:42,148
- But I can.
- Listen.

584
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:43,346
- I--
- No, you listen.

585
01:00:43,524 --> 01:00:46,220
He's talking about my world.
I'm not letting that happen.

586
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,362
- It could be dangerous--
- The bloody universe is at stake.

587
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:50,963
Of course it's dangerous.

588
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:55,363
All right, when you reach the proper speed,
I'll give you a mark.

589
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,314
LEX: You have to hold that speed precisely.
Got it?

590
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:17,923
Faster.

591
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:20,121
Faster.

592
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,252
Hold that speed.

593
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:07,331
I'm next.

594
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:11,535
You don't have a transit device.
You'd be torn apart by the event horizon.

595
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,494
OWLMAN:
Welcome to Earth Prime.

596
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:38,867
Before there was thought,
there was this place.

597
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,337
One Earth, with a single history.

598
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,409
But with the coming of man
came the illusion of free will...

599
01:02:45,312 --> 01:02:48,110
...and with that illusion came chaos.

600
01:02:48,282 --> 01:02:51,945
With every choice we make,
we literally create a world.

601
01:02:52,753 --> 01:02:57,087
History branches in two, creating one Earth
where we made the choice...

602
01:02:57,257 --> 01:02:59,122
...and a second where we didn't.

603
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:01,924
That's the secret of the universe,
you know.

604
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:05,064
Billions of people
making billions of choices...

605
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:07,524
...creating infinite Earth's.

606
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,329
Some so similar to each other
you can spend a lifetime...

607
01:03:10,504 --> 01:03:13,564
...searching for any distinction,
others so radically different...

608
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,298
...they defy comprehension.

609
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:17,705
And all of the branches originate here.

610
01:03:18,111 --> 01:03:23,879
Every version of reality balances
precariously on this singular Earth.

611
01:03:24,651 --> 01:03:27,119
It seems so different
from the Earth's we know.

612
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:32,350
I can't imagine what series of decisions
led to this world hurtling out of its orbit.

613
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:33,686
But I know this:

614
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,954
The source of the cataclysm
was the same as it always is.

615
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:38,960
Man.

616
01:03:39,132 --> 01:03:40,622
You can't be sure of that.

617
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,234
- Anything--
- You know better.

618
01:03:42,703 --> 01:03:44,102
Man is a cancer.

619
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:46,466
And I've chosen to cut out the disease.

620
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,164
You're talking about killing--

621
01:03:48,342 --> 01:03:51,277
Everyone who ever lived.
Who ever will live.

622
01:03:53,113 --> 01:03:56,742
I choose to make
the only possible real choice.

623
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:02,182
You're insane.

624
01:04:02,356 --> 01:04:03,618
Does it really matter?

625
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:07,851
There are alternate versions of me
that you would find quite charming.

626
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:31,544
OWLMAN: From what I gather,
we're very much alike.

627
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:33,845
Everything about you tells the tale.

628
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:37,548
Your attitude, your costume,
your tactics...

629
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:43,156
...they all scream of outrage,
despair, vengeance.

630
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:47,699
What terrible wrong was done
to set you on this path?

631
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:51,800
It doesn't really matter.

632
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:54,067
Nothing matters.

633
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:57,907
What are you planning to do,
talk me to death?

634
01:04:58,445 --> 01:04:59,742
Actually....

635
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,518
I thought I'd beat you to death.

636
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,950
You should have sent your flying man.

637
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:41,045
With his strength,
he might have had a chance.

638
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:44,281
But you don't trust anyone else
to do what needs to be done.

639
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,157
Hah. I feel the same way.

640
01:05:48,328 --> 01:05:53,027
If we're really alike,
you know this is wrong.

641
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,234
You must have been a good man, once.

642
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,463
No. Not good.

643
01:05:58,638 --> 01:06:02,938
Never good. After all, I'm only human.

644
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:24,759
- Uhn!
- No more debate.

645
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:28,498
I'm going to kill you now,
then everyone else.

646
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,268
There is a difference
between you and me.

647
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:44,780
We both looked into the abyss...

648
01:06:46,987 --> 01:06:49,649
...but when it Looked back at us...

649
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:52,149
...you blinked.

650
01:07:19,186 --> 01:07:20,949
It doesn't matter.

651
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,475
Are you all right?

652
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,652
Johnny, I'm back. Stop vibrating.

653
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,517
Stop.

654
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,523
Oh, God.

655
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,276
Did we save the world, then?

656
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,711
We did.

657
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:27,380
And all that rubbish about me
being faster than Flash?

658
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:30,355
You knew this was gonna happen.

659
01:08:35,495 --> 01:08:37,588
Good one, mate.

660
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:53,542
That's real sad, ain't it?
Now, get your asses off my moon.

661
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:54,975
What's wrong with you?

662
01:08:55,148 --> 01:08:57,048
We almost Lost everything.

663
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,377
That was then.

664
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:01,453
Now you're a bunch of wanna be cops
trying to take me in.

665
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:03,282
Going to take you in.

666
01:09:03,456 --> 01:09:09,053
Two things: You ain't got the authority
and you ain't nearly tough enough.

667
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:13,028
We're more than tough enough.

668
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:14,427
Brought the cavalry?

669
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:16,796
I brought the Marines.

670
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,915
The president was displeased
by the attempt on his daughter's life.

671
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:39,417
There are nuclear weapons in the shuttle.

672
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,453
I brought enough for everybody.

673
01:10:02,582 --> 01:10:05,813
WILSON: There's no way to thank you.
You've given us back our world.

674
01:10:05,986 --> 01:10:09,683
I've already ordered the national guard
to support local Law-enforcement teams.

675
01:10:10,156 --> 01:10:13,216
We're rounding up the bad guys
everywhere.

676
01:10:16,363 --> 01:10:17,660
I don't want you to go.

677
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:21,597
I don't want to go either,
but I don't belong here.

678
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:25,465
You could.
You could belong here with me.

679
01:10:26,106 --> 01:10:29,803
Excuse me, J'onn,
but would you stop acting like an idiot?

680
01:10:30,243 --> 01:10:33,144
- What?
- This is what we fight for.

681
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,441
If you love her, stay.

682
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:44,420
I've already Lost one home.

683
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:48,220
I made a promise to protect my new one.

684
01:10:49,062 --> 01:10:52,156
Then this is how we say goodbye.

685
01:10:59,406 --> 01:11:01,897
Maybe there's another one like her
back on our Earth.

686
01:11:02,075 --> 01:11:05,010
With my luck, she'll be evil.

687
01:11:24,964 --> 01:11:27,296
Ah. It's good to be back home.

688
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,528
- Ow!
- Mind your head.

689
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,762
FLASH:
I can't believe you kept that thing.

690
01:11:31,938 --> 01:11:34,031
Spoils of war. I like it.

691
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,607
What do you need a plane for, anyway?
You can fly.

692
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:38,437
You drive a car.

693
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:40,306
That is so not the point.

694
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:44,714
I owe you an apology about this mission.
You were right.

695
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,317
We were both right.

696
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,153
Still, more help around here
wouldn't be a bad idea.

697
01:11:50,523 --> 01:11:51,956
I'm glad you agree.

698
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:54,491
I've been thinking
about a membership drive.
