Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

339
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,839
Because he was trading
with them.

340

in the business of killing

your precious Viktor betrayed me.

Betrayal was something
he did very well.

is even harder to absorb
than light?

354

You know, I tried to stop him,
of course.

355
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,238
A travesty,
committing such
a horrible crime.

Toward the end of his ruthless life,

when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold,

384
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,239
Marcus came with an offer,

385
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,035
a reprieve from sickness
and death.

386

387

And in return, Viktor was
to use his army-turned-immortal
to help him.

To do what?

389
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,916
To defeat
the very first Werewolves,

390
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,998
a dangerous
and infectious breed

391
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,668
created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

392
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,153
His twin brother, William.

393
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,672
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

394
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,156
Disgusting though
your brethren may be,

395
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,237
they at least are evolved.

396
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,590
No, these were raging monsters.

397
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,951
Never able to take
human form again.

398
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,152
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

399
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,909
And William's appetite
for destruction and rampage
was insatiable.

400
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,513
He had to be stopped.

401
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,029
And so once Viktor's army
was turned,

402
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,515
the legions of Vampires
under his control

403
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,792
tracked down
and destroyed the animals,

404
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,228
then captured William

405
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,239
and locked him away.

406
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,796
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

407
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,549
Why let him live?

408
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,833
For the very same reason
that Viktor never conspired
against Marcus: Fear.

409
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,196
He was warned that,
should Marcus ever be killed,

410
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,558
all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

411
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,431
So in Viktor's mind,

412
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,234
William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans,

413
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,475
his slaves.

414
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,833
Yes.

415
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,031
Yes, a clever deception,

416
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,879
but one Viktor was hardly
willing to put to the test.

417
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,077
And so Marcus was protected
