You owe me 300 euros.

Hah!

9
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,962
- Cheeky boy.
- You were... Wow.

10
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,752
- Did you see the face on that nun?
- Yeah. And that old guy.

11
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,496
I thought he was going to faint.

12
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:15,544
He will when he finds his Rolex gone.

13
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,456
Come back to mine and we'll get high.

14
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:21,214
It don't get better than that.
That was a high.

15
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:24,174
Yeah, but that was only an appetiser.

16

You can do better than me.

MAN: Special Agent Briar,
they're ready for you.

18
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:22,001
Are you familiar with Deep Net
cryptocurrency transactions?

19
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,884
I don't bank online.

20
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,079
Right. You're a field guy.

21
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,497
Your last op, Anbar,

22
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,134
you were tasked surveillance,

23
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,789
but you did a little more than that.

24
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:37,786
Without clear visual evidence,
you broke cover to take down six suspects

25
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,247
who you alone had ascertained
were carrying concealed explosives.

26
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,286
I'm curious, are you saying you knew

27
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:47,037
what they were carrying underneath
their clothing before engaging?

28
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,626
Oh, yeah.

29
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:50,581
Like I could tell you, Tom...

30
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,247
got tighty whities on, right?

31
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,831
But in the process, you exposed
your key informant, Fatima Hamza.

32
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,961
Two years building her trust,

33
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,496
infiltrating the terror network, wasted.

34
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,246
- It was a calculated risk.
- Really?

35
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:10,326
Because your Baghdad CO describes you
as reckless, insubordinate

36
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,459
and irresponsible toward human assets.

37
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,782
You recognise that description?

38
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,424
No, but I recognise an asshole
when I see one.

39
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,631
Tom, a minute.

40
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,924
I stuck my neck out
trying to get you this position.

41
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,001
- You have to play the game.
- Oh, yeah.

42
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:37,496
And you know how good I am at that.

43
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,544
Welcome to Paris.

00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:30,751
Baba, that's a genuine Reverso. I could
get two grand for that on George V.

55
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,044
So sell it there.

56
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,246
Nine.

57
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,079

You must have enough now, Michael,
to go back home.

61
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,077
Nothing to go back to.

62
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,039
Then, forward.

63
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,916
Everyone has to have a dream.

64
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:15,077
I'm gonna put myself through med school,
find a cure for Alzheimer's.

65
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,459
Last week, wasn't it Parkinson's?

Really?

67

- Voilà.

162
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,746
Fuck.

163
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,252
(grunts)

164
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,627
(grunts)

165
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:03,959
(tiles clatter)

166
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,246
(cries out)

167
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,291
(tiles dislodge and clatter)

168
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,132
(grunts)

169
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:33,924
Ugh!

170
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,421
(metal clangs, man cries out)

171
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,961
- (car alarm blares)
- No!

172
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,541
(man shouts in French)

173
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,877
Agh!

174
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,959
Ugh! Agh!

175
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,166
Arrêtez!

176
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,877
Urgh!

177
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,167
(commotion)

178
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,376
Move! Come on!

179
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,331
Urgh!

180
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:05,794
(engine splutters)

181
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,416
(engine starts)

182
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,629
- Urgh!
- (women gasp)

183
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,129
(panting)

184
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,921
Yeah, motherfucker, now what?

185
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:29,206
C'est parti.

186
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,417
(breathes heavily)

187
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,461
- Agh!
- Shut the fuck up.

188
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,291
Hey.

189
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:43,129
- Are you in love?
- Love?

190
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,789
- No.
- Are you writing a novel?

191
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:47,576
- What? No.
- What the fuck are you doing in Paris?

192
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,879
- I just...
- What organisation do you work for?

193
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,039
Your manifesto says
this is the first strike.

194
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:55,786
- My...
- Where are you bombing next?

195
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,826
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Is this not you?

196
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,377
That is... I put the bag in the trash.

197
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,462
But I didn't know there was a bomb in it.

198
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,422
- I'm sorry, man.
- Somebody gave it to you?

199
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,251
- I stole it.
- You stole it?

200
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,254
I'm a pick-pocket. It's what I fucking do.

201
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,674
- You didn't look inside?
- Yeah, I looked inside.

202
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,041
- You didn't see the bomb?
- There was just crap in there.

203
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,417
It was a wig, a toy. I put it back.
I swear to God. I'm really sorry.

204
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:19,081
- I didn't... I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

205
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,131
Focus!

206
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,249
I didn't know what was in that bag.

207
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:26,997
But you ran and you made me chase you,
and innocent people do not run.

208
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:29,504
You were coming after me.
Have you seen yourself?

209
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:41,921
What I need you to understand
is this does not look good for you.

210
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,711
One phone call and you're on a phantom
flight to the middle of nowhere,

211
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,794
off the grid.

212
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:51,456
You would not be missed.

213
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,131
It wasn't my bag.

214
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,879
I swear to God.

215
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,627
Whose was it?

216
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,879
Er... this girl.

217
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:06,669
- Describe her.
- OK. She was pretty.

218
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:09,081
She had brown hair and a blonde wig.

219
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:13,251
She had a bag. Her body language made me
think there was something valuable in it.

220
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,964
Two pounds of Semtex. Well done.

221
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,382
That's her phone. That was in the bag.
It rang and I answered it.

222
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,419
Some French guy, he called her Zoe.

223
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,581
- Where'd you steal it?
- Pigalle.

224
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,287
If I go to surveillance cameras,
I see you stealing it?

225
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,497
- I only work blind spots so no cameras.
- Yeah.

226
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:31,576
Because you don't have a record in Paris.

227
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,919
No thefts, no pick-pockets,
no stolen bags.

228
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:38,001
- Just this motherfucking terrorist money.
- That is from selling the stuff I steal.

229
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,834
- Who do you sell it to?
- I have a guy.

230
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,877
- Where?
- In Barbès.

231
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,539
You must be really good.

232
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:47,499
Overall number one draft pick
of pick-pockets.

233
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,544
I'm the best.

234
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,416
You'd better be.

235
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,826
Walk up to me and steal my wallet.

236
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,667
(groans)

237
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:18,834
OK.

238
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:22,997
I wouldn't have a guy come up to me in
the street and ask me to steal his wallet.

239
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:25,084
- It doesn't work like that.
- Just do it.

240
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:26,789
OK, OK. Er...

241
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:30,834
Well, I'd walk up to the guy,
avoid eye contact,

242
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,917
step to the side, look him in the eye
and then I'd be gone.

243
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:39,831
- Still there.
- But the money's gone.

244
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:43,924
See, I took the wallet the first time

245
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,462
and then put it back the second,
only without the money.

246
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:48,286
It's all about the distraction.

247
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,536
You were too busy watching me
to see what I was doing.

248
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,207
Give me that.

249
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,249
Sit down.

250
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,292
(buzzer)

251
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:23,916
(buzzing continues)

252
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,539
Bonjour.

253
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,206
Bonjour.

254
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,669
Zoe Naville?

255
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,286
Sorry, I think you got the wrong address.

256
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,627
American?

257
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,459
Yeah.

258
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,922
It's cluite specific, this address.

259
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,381
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.

260
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:57,207
- Sorry to have disturbed you.
- Yeah.

261
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,077
No problem.

262
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,792
Christophe!

263
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,126
Agh!

264
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,999
Allo? Allo? La police, s'il vous plaît.

265
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:37,084
Oui.

266
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,042
(speaks French)

267
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,384
(groans)

268
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:25,419
- You lost him?
- We were compromised.

269
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,882
They were tactical. G-19s and gas masks.

270
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:31,669
And now we have French police crawling
through an unlisted agency safe house.

271
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:35,542
This was a bag job, not urban warfare.
How the hell were you compromised?

272
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,037
Two ops looking for a girl called Zoe.
All right?

273
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,577
Mason said he stole a bag from a girl
called Zoe. She's the key.

274
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,877
<i>Uploading her phone data now.</i>

275
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,789
You need to get Mason before the French
know we're digging in their front yard.

276
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,996
They tracked her phone.
Get me everything off it.

277
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,684
- Briar...
- Mason has a fence at Barbès.

278
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,882
We get him, we get the girl,
we get 'em all.

279
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,291
Your mission is Mason.

280
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:58,327
Karen's put herself on the line for you.
She's stalling the French.

281
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,457
Get Mason before this blows up
in our faces.

282
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,464
Our prime suspect.

283
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:12,832
A witness came forward
and identified him as an American.

284
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,167
American?

285
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:18,129
Do you have a name?

286
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:21,829
Not yet, but a possible sighting.

287
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,787
Paris police are investigating
a violent disturbance

288
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:27,167
in an apartment block
in Rue Saint Vincent.

289
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:29,791
Neighbours placed the suspect
at the scene and...

290
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,786
...a black man with an American accent.

291
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:36,456
Go on.

292
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:40,172
The police report says the apartment
had some sort of...

293
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,166
...hidden interrogation room.

294
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,129
Terror links?

295
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:48,579
No, it smells like...

296
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,417
...intelligence.

297
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:57,672
And what does intelligence smell like?

298
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:04,751
Karen... we go way back.

299
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:09,714
I have four bodies on the street
on the eve of Bastille Day.

300
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,042
- If you have any information...
- If I did... I would tell you.

301
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,457
You know that.

302
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,504
Of course.

303
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:20,541
- Of course.
- How's the wife?

304
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,997
Expensive.

305
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:22,794
Monsieur.

306
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,206
Bon. Alors, messieurs...

00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,792

Hey, Baba.

You plant that bomb?

316
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:21,501
I stole the bag.
I didn't know what was in it.

317

Please, Baba, I need somewhere to hide.

00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,706
told you
you're the only one they could trust,

482
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:54,214
that they'll look after you,
but they lied, Zoe.

483
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,832
You're in a lot of trouble.

484
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,246
No one was meant to die.

485
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:03,079
Who built that bomb?

486
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:06,794
Jean. I only knew Jean.

487
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,166
Jean. Where is he?

488
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:12,461
The guy that gave her that bomb
is at 14, Rue Kleber. Send backup.

489
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:16,544
Briar, we're a fucking surveillance team.
Your job was to find Mason.

490
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:18,746
<i>- They're both with me.</i>
- You what?

491
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:21,714
KAREN: <i>Briar, bring them in.</i>
- No time. Heading there now.

492
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:23,542
You are way off the reservation here.

493
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:26,789
If you do this, you are on your own,
do you understand?

494
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:28,166
Understood.

495
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:37,377
- So we're taking her to the cops, right?
- Not yet.

496
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:39,589
That wasn't the deal.
We turn her in, I'm clear.

497
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,326
You wanna go? Go.

498
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:43,457
I can't cos the cops still think I did it.

499
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,422
I did everything you asked.
I thought we were a team.

500
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,081
Sorry, man. You're not Ivy League.

501
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:49,787
You fucking played me.

502
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:53,127
All that shit about your past, was that
a lie too? You even from Belize?

503
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:55,039
No, Connecticut, actually.

504
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:08,712
(yells)

505
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,632
- I fucking trusted you, man.
- Hey. Shut up.

506
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,459
(shouts)

507
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:14,882
Get down!

508
00:55:24,126 --> 00:55:25,206
Shit!

509
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,332
You OK?

510
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:33,827
- Are you hit?
- No.

511
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:36,251
I'm OK too, thanks.
Who the fuck are these guys?

512
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,826
Who are they, Zoe? Was that Jean's crew?

513
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,707
No, Jean is not like that.
He would never hurt anyone.

514
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,002
He gave you a bomb.
Zoe, we don't have time for this.

515
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:46,206
Are they planning another bomb?

516
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:48,962
No, we were not planning anything
and we only had one bomb.

517
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,634
Well, what are they doing?
Give me something. Come on.

518
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,209
Jean said we were fighting back
against the fascists,

519
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:57,214
- that we were trying to disrupt them.
- How?

520
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:59,712
I was supposed to bomb
an empty office building.

521
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,884
- Right.
- But I changed my mind.

522
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,379
- And then he came along.
- You can't put this all on me.

523
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:07,131
- It was your bag.
- I was going to throw it in the river.

524
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:56,634
Where?

525
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,629
First floor.

526
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,379
Please don't hurt him.

527
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:37,634
(sobs)

528
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,461
Get her out of here.

529
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,881
Come here.

530
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,077
(sobs)

531
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,037
So you first met him at a demonstration?

532
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:03,132
- You know why he chose you?
- Chose?

533
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,709
- No, we were in love.
- Zoe, listen to me.

534
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,832
When a man is an undercover cop,
relationships are not what they seem.

535
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,417
No, it's not true.

536
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:13,542
I believed in him and I believed
in what we had together.

537
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,417
That was his skill.

538
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,461
He had to gain your trust.

539
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,537
Have you done this?

540
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:26,999
Lie, screw, fuck, use people
to get what you want?

541
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:28,794
Yeah, he's done that and more.

542
00:59:30,251 --> 00:59:31,831
It's what he does for a living.

543
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,667
Hey, I don't need judgement from you.

544
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:52,039
BRIAR:
<i>They're cops, Karen. It's a RAPID team.</i>

545
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,747
<i>They planned the bomb to go off
in the Nation Pure offices.</i>

546
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,326
To pin it on a mosque?

547
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,959
Karen, someone's playing chess
with the city right now.

548
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:00,714
<i>Briar, this is out of control.</i>

549
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:03,002
I have to give this
to French Intelligence, OK?

550
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,714
Yeah, who are you gonna talk to?

551
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:07,456
<i>Victor Gamieux. He was my contact
back in Libya. He's OK.</i>

552
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:09,382
And what about my assets?

553
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:12,879
- He's gonna want us to turn them over.
- A pick-pocket and a bomb mule?

554
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:14,791
<i>What do you care?</i>

555
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:17,999
- I don't.
<i>- Good.</i>

556
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:19,916
I'll set a pickup.

557
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,542
D'accord?

558
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:08,667
Victor.

559
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,746
The bomb was made
by an undercover police officer.

560
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,214
His name was Pascal Fibbert.

561
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:19,254
He was found hanging last night,
but he was most likely strangled.

562
01:01:19,584 --> 01:01:23,084
Victor, you have a terrorist conspiracy
in the heart of the police force.

563
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:26,287
The mosque was a setup.
There's something going on.

564
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,577
And you have evidence?

565
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:32,207
I have a witness. Currently in the company
of one of my agents.

566
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:35,834
- The other American?
- We're prepared to hand them over to you.

567
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,727
But can you get them into safe custody?

568
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:47,502
Witness handover needs to be off the books
until I know how far the rot spreads.

569
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:50,666
They're near the Stalingrad Square,
in Aubervilliers.

570
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:52,922
OK, call him. I'll arrange a pickup.

571
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,041
Tell him the safe word is Mike Alpha.

572
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,787
Thank you, Victor.

573
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:04,539
Gamieux's hand-picking his men.
Safe word Mike Alpha.

574
01:02:06,376 --> 01:02:08,036
Thank you for coming to me.

575
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:09,536
You owe me dinner.

576
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:12,921
(two more gunshots)

577
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,672
Mike Alpha?

578
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,376
(mobile phone rings)

579
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,126
Allo?

580
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:42,419
OK, à toute à l'heure.

581
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:13,787
(horn blares)

582
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:38,667
Agh!

583
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,286
(horn blares)

584
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,294
(tyres screech)

585
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:21,829
(panting)

586
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:36,752
Come on, Michael.

587
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,131
TV: <i>While the Bastille Day procession
gets underway,</i>

588
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:42,461
<i>protesters have opened up
a new front of attack.</i>

589
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:45,212
<i>The hashtag, Attack The Bank,
has gone viral</i>

590
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:47,962
<i>in a highly co-ordinated online campaign.</i>

591
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:50,384
<i>In unprecedented numbers,</i>

592
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:52,749
<i>demonstrators are surrounding
the National Bank of France.</i>

593
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:02,829
(protesters chanting)

594
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,207
- Where is she?
<i>- We can't locate her.</i>

595
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:29,002
All the devices have gone dark.

596
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:31,504
She went to meet Gamieux
this morning to arrange a pickup.

597
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,294
<i>His guys just tried to kill us.</i>

598
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,829
He's Head of French Intelligence.
Do you know what...?

599
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,957
Karen's dead, Luddy, all right?

600
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:40,249
She's dead.

601
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:43,206
Gamieux is dirty
and we need to find out what he's doing.

602
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:45,044
He is protecting the Bank of France.

603
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,666
He's put RAPID cops in charge.
They've gone to Code Five.

604
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,332
Right, so he's put RAPID cops
to protect the bank

605
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:53,249
from the riots that he started.

606
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:55,834
It's all about the distraction, right?

607
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:58,997
These guys aren't terrorists.
They're thieves.

608
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:01,876
- What are you talking about?
<i>- How much money's in that vault?</i>

609
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,711
It's the French National Reserve.

610
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:06,712
- And we just gave them the keys.
<i>- This is fantasy, Briar.</i>

611
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,844
It is impossible to walk out
with that money.

612
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:10,717
The eyes of the fucking city
are on that bank.

613
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:13,457
<i>And I order you to come in now
and hand over...</i>

614
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:16,042
Briar.

615
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:17,537
Briar!

616
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,577
(klaxons blare)

617
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:11,536
(keypad bleeps)

618
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:15,326
I'll be on the comms. Listen in.

619
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:17,879
- And stay here till it's over.
- You're ditching us?

620
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:22,132
- You won't be any use to me.
- Why are you doing this?

621
01:08:22,626 --> 01:08:25,496
Well, let's just say
I can't stand thieves.

622
01:08:27,626 --> 01:08:29,626
They killed a good CIA officer.

623
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,791
She deserved better.

624
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:33,416
I mean, what are you doing?

625
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,632
Going in alone, no plan, no backup?

626
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:39,711
You read my report.
I'm reckless and irresponsible.

627
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:43,916
(chanting and shouting)

628
01:09:33,376 --> 01:09:34,666
J'y arrive.

629
01:09:36,167 --> 01:09:37,457
(electricity buzzes)

630
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:48,831
(bleeping)

631
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:06,252
- (whistles)
- Christophe.

632
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:06,079
Hey.

633
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:51,417
- He's trapped.
- He told us to wait here.

634
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:55,711
- This isn't our fight.
- Four people died because of us.

635
01:11:56,792 --> 01:11:58,422
What can we do? There's only two of us.

636
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:02,576
No, there's a lot more.

637

À bas la police!

639
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,882
- Bande de fascistes!
- They just need a push.

640
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:37,709
Zoe!

641
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:42,712

Briar!

650
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:30,827
Put your hands up.

651
01:14:33,584 --> 01:14:34,834
Now!

652
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:39,424

653
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:24,081

655
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:09,211
Non!

656
01:16:11,251 --> 01:16:12,921

01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,456
- Michael, can you hear me?
- Briar.

661
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:09,384
A man from the safe house is coming your
way with half a billion in his pocket.

662
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,329
- What?
<i>- Listen to me. It's not gold.</i>

663
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:14,077
It's digital currency.
It's in his chest pocket, on a hard drive.

664
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:16,827

01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:01,036
BRIAR:
<i>Don't move, Michael.</i>

676
01:19:03,751 --> 01:19:05,001
Give it to me.

677
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:27,376
Give it to me.

678
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:32,542
The drive.

679
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:35,417
Descendez-le.

680
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:40,876
Police! Police!

681
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,039
(panicked shouting)

682
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:43,669
Allez! Allez!

683
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:12,496
- You OK?
- Yeah.

684
01:20:16,251 --> 01:20:19,041
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

685
01:20:30,251 --> 01:20:31,831

688
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:49,582
<i>The suspected bomber is still at large</i>

Sergei?

- Fuck.
- Don't worry, Michael.

694
01:22:14,751 --> 01:22:16,631
I'm here alone.

695

I'm not here to arrest you.

696
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:22,041
I'm here to make a deal.

697
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:25,584
It was a passport you wanted?

698
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:33,377
I'll give you tickets to Brazil
and $100,000 cash

699
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:35,169
for the hard drive.

700
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:37,171
For half a billion?

701
01:22:37,834 --> 01:22:41,544
Trust me, you're not in
a position to negotiate.

702
01:22:54,376 --> 01:22:56,246
You got the cash?

703
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:03,877
This way. Follow me.

704
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:16,541
Where are we going?

705
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:18,789
Just out through there.

706
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:35,962
Get in there.

707
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:48,292
Drop your gun... or I shoot your friend.

708
01:23:49,709 --> 01:23:50,879
Who, this guy?

709
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:58,132
Now what?

710
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:21,962
(coughs)

(gasps)

712
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:28,461
I didn't know you were gonna shoot me.

713
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:30,712
You're still alive. Come on.

714

(exhales)

715
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:56,209
Drive.

716
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,792
I gave it to Gamieux.

717
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:08,826
So where do I go from here?
I didn't even get the money.

718
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:10,879
Are the CIA gonna reimburse me?

719
01:25:11,001 --> 01:25:12,961
- Guess you gotta get a job.
- A job?

720
01:25:13,084 --> 01:25:14,794
The CIA got anything going?

721
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,246
- Yeah, you can clean the cars.
- Like swept for bombs?

722
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:19,246
No, buddy. Soap and water.

723
01:25:19,334 --> 01:25:21,134
- What about surveillance?
- I don't think so.

724
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:22,631
- The mailroom?
- No.

725
01:25:22,792 --> 01:25:25,502
- Come on, man, I got skills.
- I should have shot you in the face.
