Callie and Decca were two sisters.

3
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,176
They were on a boat.

4
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,053
They're in the water,
and Callie said to Decca,

5
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:03,474
"Decca, will you tell me the story about
the upside-down tree again please?"

6
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,436
And Decca said, "Once upon a time,

7
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,980
"there was an upside-down tree.

8
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:12,984
"And anyone who walked in
through the door of its trunk

9
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,987
"would be immediately turned to good

10
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,822
if they were bad."

11
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:22,160
Callie said, "I would really
like to see that tree sometime."

12
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,120
They went on and on in the water.

13
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:26,289
Can you make water?

14
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:28,750
Yeah.

15
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,877
And then all of a sudden, they hit land. Oh.

16
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:32,670
And all the animals joined them,

17
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:35,590
'cause they wanted to see
the upside-down tree, too.

18
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:37,759
They had a bunny rabbit.

19
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:39,677
Can you make a bunny rabbit?

20
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:43,514
Yeah, the bunny rabbits went,
and there were...

21
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,516
wolves.

22
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,394
And there was a cheetah.

Are you a monster?

26
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,318
Are you a monster eating my nose?

27
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,153
I'm so scared of monsters.

28
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:59,197
"I wish I could find the upside-down tree,"

29
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:03,034
and they ran and they found the
upside-down tree, but outside was a lion.

(ROARING SOFTLY)

This is my tree."

33
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,750
And Callie said,

34
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,003
"Well, if it's your tree, Lion,
why don't you go inside it?"

35
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:16,756
Lion said, "All right, I will."

36
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,717
And he went inside his tree.

00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:24,263

00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,641
He started smiling.

40
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,393
He started relaxing.

41
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,937
He said, "You're my friends,

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,648
and all my friends are welcome here."

43
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:36,984
And so Callie and Decca
went into the upside-down tree,

44
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,529
and they all lived happily ever after.
