<i>Previously on Continuum...</i>

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:04,774
I'm not sure that you've got
what it takes.

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:06,743
I'm a really hard worker
with some fresh ideas,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,877
I won't let you down.

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,746
Why all of this?

6
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,682
Leaving home so suddenly,
giving up your work?

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,916
I have to make my own way
for myself.

8
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:16,452
It's not for you, or Roland
or anyone.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,154
I wanna protect my future.

10
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,089
Here are the new companies
I want you to invest in.

11
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,892
I'm looking for situations
that are win-win.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,593
What can I do for you
agent Gardiner?

13
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:28,164
- Kiera Cameron.
- Agent Cameron is with Section 6.

14
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,765
I saw you...

15
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:32,267
I saw you survive
the explosion and fireball

16
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,535
and then vanish.

17
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,137
You can't do this,
not to me!

18
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:36,471
If you can't be with
the person you chose to...

19

[Grunting]

20
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,810
I spent the last couple of weeks
in a prison hospital recovering.

21
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,945
- Recovering from what?
- Sonya.

22
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:10,246
I think the term
"fighting machine"

23
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,081
has become something
of a cliché

24
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,949
in the development of
the enhanced soldier,

25
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:15,384
but what we've
accomplished here

26
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,018
is nothing short
of extraordinary.

27
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,987
Very impressive.

28
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,457
I speak for the entire corporation,
job well done.

29
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,726
However we've had to make
our funding decision

30
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,430
based on factors beyond
performance metrics.

31
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,565
It's too damn expensive.

32
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,186
We're cutting our losses,

33
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,628
the program's being terminated
effective immediately.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,904
What does that mean?

35
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,839
What happens to these
soldiers?

36
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,340
Well we can't leave
anything operational

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,878
once we've shut down,
way too risky.

38
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,548
Terminate means terminate.

39
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,015
I've got two CPS officers
in the lobby

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,718
I just need to call them.

41
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:55,288
That won't be necessary.

42
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:59,125
I can take care of it.

43
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,394
Very good.

44
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:09,100
Everything okay, doc?

45
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,537
How's the CMR adjustment?

46
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:13,505
Quite the upgrade.

47
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:17,810
Civilian version is already
in the works.

48
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:21,011
I don't need any tech to tell me
you're upset about something.

49
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,379
You would be right.

50
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:26,050
Well maybe I can ease
your mind over dinner later?

51
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,553
It's gonna be difficult
for me.

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,755
I understand.

53
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:35,092
Well, maybe when
the project's finished...

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,093
What I mean is I hope when...

55
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,495
I hope when the program
is over,

56
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:41,030
that we're not also.

57
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,936
What's that?

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,131
You okay?

59

You shot him...
didn't you?

72
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,025
You shot Travis.

73
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,730
What if Garza sees this?

74
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:30,166
I would certainly appreciate
your discretion.

75
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,235
You have it...
but now what?

76
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:34,737
She wants to bust
Travis out.

77
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:37,139
Let me worry about that.

78
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,415
- Alec...
- What?

79
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,984
Now's not the time okay,
I'm gonna be late.

80
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,418
What are you doing here
anyways?

81
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:52,187
I just wanted to see
where you work,

82
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:55,791
- I was in the neighbourhood...
- You're checking up on me.

83
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,659
Look, you don't have to
worry about me, okay?

84
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm fine.

85
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:00,361
All right.

86
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,029
You don't have to do this.

87
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,699
What, the job? Actually I do.

88
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,834
I mean, I'm broke and frankly I
need to look at all my options.

89
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,703
Well good, that...
that's why I'm here,

90
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,772
to talk about your options.

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,307
Go on.

92
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:14,842
I know you don't have
all the answers

93
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,844
you're looking for right now.

94
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,213
But if you don't follow
the path of destiny

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,416
that shapes the future
as I know it,

96
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,784
the world won't end up
as it did in my time.

97
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,754
Is that necessarily
a bad thing?

98
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,556
I wanna go home.

99
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,426
I wanna get back to my family

100
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:34,878
and the only way I'm
gonna be able to do that

101
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,354
is if things stay on track.

102
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:38,231
Kiera... when you tried
to stop that bombing,

103
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,865
did you know that you were
possibly throwing away a chance

104
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,134
of getting home?

105
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:44,337
- I didn't have a choice!
- Yes, you did.

106
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,905
Choose to let hundreds of
innocent people die?

107
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,174
Don't be so naïve!

108
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,942
These decisions are going to
keep coming up.

109
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,344
At a certain point you're
gonna have to choose

110
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:53,911
between protecting the future
for your unborn family

111
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,413
or protecting the future for
yourself and those of us

112
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,984
who are alive now.

113
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:01,286
I gotta go okay,
I'm gonna be late.

114
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,155
I'll call you later.

115
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,625
Sorry.

116
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,933
Lois, you wanted to see me?

117
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,169
Operations tells me

118
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,770
you're still working the
mayor's assassination,

119
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,237
I thought we were
done with that.

120
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,672
Yeah, the police got
their guy.

121
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,240
So what's left to talk about?

122
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,841
Kiera Cameron.

123
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,470
I know that you asked
me to stay away...

124
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,944
She's vouched for.

125
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,079
Escher, remember?

126
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,681
The CEO of a corporation
giving orders

127
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,383
to our intelligence services?

128
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,817
That just doesn't add up.

129
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,386
My superior vouches for him,

130
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:39,021
for all we know
Pyron is Section 6.

131
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,289
Cameron is a cipher.

132
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,357
This Section 6,
a federal security branch,

133
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:45,227
doesn't really seem to exist.

134
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:50,398
Yeah, it is a puzzle
by any measure.

135
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,000
What's your gut telling you?

136
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,903
Cameron is connected to the
Liber8 organization somehow,

137
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,405
I'm sure of it.

138
00:06:57,472 --> 00:07:00,875
She may be the key to stopping
them before the next attack.

139
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:03,177
You're not gonna let
this go, are you?

140
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,212
No.

141
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,549
Okay, I'll make
some arrangements,

142
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,185
put you in the crosshairs.

143
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:15,089
Liber8, Section 6, the bombing,
assassination...

144
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,424
Kiera Cameron.

145
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:19,726
You keep it under wraps
for now, no paper trail.

146
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:22,128
Of course.
Thank you.

147
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:25,031
And Gardiner...

148
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,667
don't embarrass me
or this office.

149
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,508
Sonya seems to be taking
her sweet time.

150
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:39,711
With what?

151
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,314
Busting Travis out.

152
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:44,883
I'm with you.

153
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,018
I just don't think
she's telling us everything.

154
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:50,955
Look, we both know that Sonya
would never let anything

155
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,256
happen to Travis.

156
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:55,425
She's just... following
Kagame's orders.

157
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,795
You know what?
Kagame's dead!

158
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:02,332
Yes... Kagame is dead
but he lives on in us.

159
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,768
And if he were here,

160
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,769
he's say leave no
comrade behind.

161
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:09,072
He would, but he'd also say
think before you act.

162
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,975
So when do we stop thinking
and start acting?

163
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,343
I've already initiated
a plan.

164
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,712
You won't need to lift
a finger.

165
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,691
Look, I know who you are,
I'm not interested, okay.

166
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,393
You know who I am?

167
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,428
The whole world knows
who you are.

168
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,063
A terrorist?

169
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,132
That's gonna change.

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,766
The truth about what was
going on in that building

171
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,036
you and Kagame brought down,
it's already filtering out.

172
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,104
The truth?

173
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:46,674
Some are calling you a hero
for killing those bastards.

174
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,110
I didn't kill anybody.

175
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,782
The White Guard,
Bulgakov.

176
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,052
Ukrainian nationalists
dying for their beloved Kiev.

177
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,254
- Sound familiar?
- It's just a book.

178
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:03,623
Okay?

179
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,958
We could protect you.

180
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,426
I already have protection.

181
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:09,829
Your movement is growing,

182
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,699
my soldiers there are prepared
to offer guardianship

183
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,201
until the day we can
all leave here together

184
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,536
to face the same enemy.

185
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:19,638
We can mobilize hundreds
more behind you,

186
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,607
it could get pretty messy
in here, Mr. Randol.

187
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,609
I think you're right
about that.

188
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,815
Stay away.

189
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,624
That wasn't necessary.

190
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,292
Just because you got your
own little fan club in here

191
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,161
doesn't mean you're safe.

192
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,863
Stay close to me until
I get us out of here.

193
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,765
- When's that gonna be?
- Soon.

194
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,667
I've already made contact.

195
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,502
Yeah, it better be soon.

196
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,737
I go on trial in a few weeks,

197
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,244
I think we know how
that'll turn out.

198
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:58,207
No, there won't be
any trial.

199
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,042
You have a destiny
to fulfill.

200
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,810
My destiny is dead.

201
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,346
They'll have to find
another way.

202
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:07,083
No, this is how it's supposed
to play out.

203
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,288
Was I not clear?

204
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,489
Time you went to school,
boy.

205
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:25,219
[Fighting noises]

206
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:48,254
[buzzing sounds]

207
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,272
Hey coach, you want
to see us?

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,841
Thanks guys.

209
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:03,313
Our friend Travis Berta
killed 6 members

210
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,581
of the Arian Nation
in prison today.

211
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,916
Worse things could happen.

212
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,118
I don't disagree but
it's still a problem.

213
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,253
Warden wants him transferred
out immediately

214
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,856
before a full-scale
riot erupts.

215
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,859
It's probably a good idea.

216
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:17,584
The further we keep Travis and
Julian Randol from each other, the better.

217
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,229
We still need to take every
precaution during the transfer.

218
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,732
Travis is unpredictable and far
more dangerous than you realize.

219
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,701
Are you offering your
services, agent Cameron?

220
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,634
I am.

221
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:30,604
Well I expected as much.

222
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:32,874
Ah, excellent timing.

223
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,508
Agent Gardiner has
been reassigned

224
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,612
to the Liber8 task-force
as our official liaison.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,742
Regardless of the hiccups
that our joint operations

226
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,474
have experienced as of late,

227
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,019
we're ready to provide
any support that we can.

228
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,354
Well, thank you for that.

229
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,356
I'm sure all of us can agree
that we could always use

230
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:52,125
another ally in the war
against terrorism.

231
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:54,627
Now, Travis Berta is
a high value member

232
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,963
so I expect Liber8 to make
a move of some kind.

233
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:59,465
Now with all due respect, I'm
not sure that agent Cameron's

234
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,901
considered all the
variables in this case.

235
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:04,169
I don't know, maybe
she has and she's uh...

236
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,671
counting on them.

237
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,440
I'd be surprised if you could
find someone who understands

238
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,809
them better, agent Gardiner...

239
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,744
and I have a plan that will
keep any of your concerns

240
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,212
at a minimum.

241
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,382
You stay out of my way and
we all get what we want.

242
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,750
I look forward to that.

243
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,852
Excuse me...

244
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,255
No love lost, huh?

245
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,525
That guy needs a serious
attitude adjustment.

246
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:30,161
Easy, that is a shortcut
to an early retirement.

247
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,349
He's gonna be looking for
anything to call you out on.

248
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:33,831
Oh, I'm sure of it.

249
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,300
You're setting yourself up for
trouble if it goes sideways.

250
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,201
I know.

251
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,339
Hey, how about we hear
about this plan?

252
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:45,609
It's uh... it's gonna play out
something like this.

253
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,413
Sadler... do you have any idea

254
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,515
why all of the network
passwords aren't working?

255
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh yeah, sorry... I forgot to
tell you about that.

256
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:56,319
I had to flash the
router with an open WRT

257
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,187
in order to put up
a new firewall.

258
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,922
Why did you do that?

259
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,924
Well, um... actually
you'll be happy to know

260
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:02,992
that I recalibrated the network

261
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,193
so that 46 percent
of the customers

262
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,595
can now use the automated
checkout system.

263
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:08,030
That'll save on labour
costs by 15 percent

264
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,531
and decrease
customer wait times

265
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,899
by a minute and 30
seconds on average.

266
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,234
Is that right?

267
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,469
Yeah, and you don't have
to do sales reports anymore,

268
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,137
it's all automated now.

269
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,373
- No sales reports?
- Nope, poof, gone!

270
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,740
Straight to head office.

271
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,509
In fact, the efficiency
of the system as a whole

272
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:25,546
has nearly tripled, it's
256 percent to be exact.

273
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:29,183
Okay... Sadler, here's what's
gonna happen.

274
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,551
First, you're gonna get me
a coffee.

275
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:33,387
Then you're gonna undo
all this mumbo jumbo,

276
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,389
none of this was even approved
by head office.

277
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,823
This'll save the
company money...

278
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,593
Look, I know what it's like
to be young and ambitious

279
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,628
and think you have the
answers to everything,

280
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,662
but you can't go messing with
the system just because

281
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,098
you think you have a better
way of doing things.

282
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:46,031
But I'm telling you...

283
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:47,825
No look, I'm telling
you to reset the network

284
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,603
to the way that it was and do
the job that I hired you to do.

285
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,671
I can un-hire you just
as easily.

286
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,075
Oh, and that coffee?
Make it black.

287
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:06,385
[Sighs]
Incredible.

288
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,020
What do you want?

289
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,222
You know who I am?

290
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,357
Right... well believe it
or not I know a little bit

291
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,326
about who you are as well.

292
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:17,629
Maybe even more than
you know about yourself.

293
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,532
Look, if Kiera sent you here
to talk me into whatever...

294
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:24,335
Kiera didn't send me.

295
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:27,939
You know I had a job like
this once, way back...

296
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,674
or is that way forward?

297
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:32,576
Mopping floors
and cleaning toilets.

298
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:36,079
Good, honest work my
father called it.

299
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,516
I hated that job but I guess
it did teach me something.

300
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,518
And what's that?

301
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,720
Well first off, money
and power doesn't mean

302
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:45,956
your shit doesn't stink.

303
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,489
More importantly,

304
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:52,595
the only thing separating me and
the future I wanted was will.

305
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:55,798
I had the talent
and the ambition,

306
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:58,367
all I needed was a chance.

307
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,603
The problem is, of course,
you're rarely given that chance,

308
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:03,137
more often than not
you've gotta take it.

309
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,575
So one day, on my
knees cleaning up

310
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:11,345
where some idiot had missed
with his piss, I did.

311
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,881
Then what did you do?

312
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,348
I quit.

313
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,385
I scratched and clawed
and willed myself

314
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,987
into my own business.

315
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:27,227
I put all that hard work
into Kellog Incorporated.

316
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,464
And here you are today...
you've come a long way.

317
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,701
That's one way to put it.

318
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,702
Look, what does any of this
have to do with me?

319
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,436
Oh, I don't know...

320
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,238
let's just say that
both of our futures

321
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:44,010
rely on your own will.

322
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,846
All you have to do is
look down and realize

323
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:53,319
that you're on your knees too.

324
00:15:53,386 --> 00:16:01,386
The only difference is
you're a genius.

325
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,430
Anyway... listen, I'm uh...

326
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,232
I'm looking to set up
a new venture,

327
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,599
cutting edge stuff.

328
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,234
Also looking for
talented visionaries

329
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,369
to do visionary work.

330
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,105
You know, mold the future,
all that jazz.

331
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:19,644
Hey, money is no object.

332
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,080
Uh... are you being taken care
of, sir?

333
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,649
Why yes, thank you.

334
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,817
Alec here is taking
very good care of me,

335
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,753
he knows his stuff!

336
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,322
You know something, I'd
be careful if I were you.

337
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,024
'Cause someone might just uh,

338
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:38,162
just come along
and poach him away.

339
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:39,829
Wonderful.

340
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,532
Uh... have a good day, sir.

341
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,233
Alec, when you're done
with this customer

342
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,169
can you drop by my office?

343
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:49,572
My printer's jammed.

344
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,976
Printer jams, how novel.

345
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,211
You know there's no paper
in the future?

346
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,547
Or should I say no future
in paper.

347
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:07,756
Drop by for a chat unless
you've made up your mind.

348
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,592
Incredible.

349
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:24,405
[Clears throat]

350
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:27,374
Um... I just got word
from our prison connection.

351
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,710
They're dead, all of them.

352
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,245
- It's not a problem.
- How can you even say that?

353
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:35,782
- If Garza finds out who's behind this...
- Listen,

354
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,483
Do you honestly think any
of those Neanderthals

355
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,854
ever stood a chance
against Travis?

356
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,255
You planned this?

357
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,424
Killing Travis would
be a nice solution,

358
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,025
but we don't need him dead

359
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,461
so much as we need
him out of the way

360
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,130
and as far away from
Thaseus as possible.

361
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,911
I should've known you were
behind this circus.

362
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,580
I'll take that as a compliment.

363
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,414
You would.

364
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:42,483
Listen Travis.
I'll cut you a deal...

365
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,985
You tell me where I can
find Sonya and the others

366
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,087
and I'll put you out of
your misery quickly,

367
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:50,157
save you the trouble of
the long incarceration.

368
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:54,027
And miss all the fun?

369
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:55,962
It seems like you two
are getting along.

370
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,765
Seeing her makes me homesick.

371
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,067
Your new home's a four by
four cell, Travis.

372
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,335
No fear, this one.

373
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,137
Tell me something
I don't know.

374
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,707
Why don't you take shotgun, I'll
sit back here with Mr. Happy.

375
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:16,755
You look good in orange.

376
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,253
Hey Simon.

377
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,089
Think about behaving yourself

378
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,557
so I don't have to come over
there and keep you in line, huh?

379
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,028
- Please do.
- Oh that can be arranged.

380
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,097
Ready?

381
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,531
Let's get this show
on the road.

382
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,204
Convoy's pulling out.

383
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,973
Nothing like a nice drive
through the countryside.

384
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,942
The day is young.

385
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,878
I guess being a pessimist is part
of your job description, huh?

386
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:52,648
Well, I'm rarely disappointed
so that's a bonus.

387
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,058
It's not too late for you,
protector.

388
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:06,061
Join the fight, make this world
a better place.

389
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,495
What do you think
I'm doing?

390
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:09,731
I think you're fighting
for the wrong side,

391
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,935
you just don't know it yet.

392
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,703
Doesn't it ever bother you?

393
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,172
Oh yeah, it's starting
to bother me now.

394
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,607
I'm talking about the
inequality in the system.

395
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:22,209
Bankers and corporate
CEOs raking in fortunes

396
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:25,246
while the rest of us
fight just to survive

397
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:28,415
and take care of
the ones we love.

398
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,950
I guess I'm just used to it.

399
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,019
That's your problem
right there.

400
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:35,522
You're the reason these thieves
get away with it,

401
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,558
they need your complacency,
your unwillingness to fight,

402
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,861
to challenge the rules,
to tear down walls...

403
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,062
Blow up a building?

404
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,964
If that's what it
takes to prevent us

405
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:49,235
from becoming slaves, yes.

406
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,505
It's like I said,
no strings attached.

407
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,639
You're the brains,
I'm the money.

408
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,341
The lab?

409
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,977
It's yours to run,
hire some help if you like.

410
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,245
I don't need any help.

411
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:01,814
Even better.

412
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,581
Kiera will probably
appreciate the privacy.

413
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:06,185
Look, this has nothing
to do with her.

414
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,220
Okay.
Understood.

415
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:10,754
Look, I've seen what
you can do alone

416
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:13,724
so I really don't think we'll
have much of a problem.

417
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:18,262
Please... can I offer
you a coffee,

418
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,364
tea, soda, beer?

419
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:23,868
Soda please.

420
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,902
You seem pretty sure this
is a sound investment.

421
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,639
Yeah, an investment when you
know the payoff is not a risk,

422
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:30,841
it's a sure thing.

423
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,275
There are no sure things.

424
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,845
Well then I'm happy with
getting as close as I can.

425
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,083
Where are we?

426
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,550
It's all routine.

427
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,688
They'll come for me.

428
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:50,326
You know how all this
plays out, Cameron.

429
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,694
She hasn't told you,
has she?

430
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:53,863
[Laughing]

431
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,865
How does she do it?

432
00:21:55,932 --> 00:22:00,568
It must suck to be you,
always two steps behind her,

433
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:04,239
almost like she can see things
before they happen.

434
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,677
Hey, can I ask you something

435
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,812
that might sound
a little bit weird?

436
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:14,882
I'm a time traveler, kid...
weird is my specialty.

437
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:17,885
What am I like in 2077,
like old me...

438
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:19,019
what's my deal?

439
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,188
Straight to the point,
I like that.

440
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,424
What did Kiera tell you?

441
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,093
Nothing.

442
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,197
Here's the deal, kid.

443
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:36,735
In 2077, you are
in today's terms...

444
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:43,776
Zuckerberg, Jobs, Buffett
and Gates all rolled into one.

445
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:44,877
Rich...

446
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,178
No, no, no... beyond rich,
epic wealth.

447
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,680
No, you don't understand, what am
I like as a person?

448
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,117
Uh... as a person?

449
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,919
Who gives a shit!

450
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:59,057
You're loaded, powerful,
like a... like a king.

451
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:04,094
I just really need to know, am I
a good person or am I a bad person?

452
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:07,798
Well it's not like we hung
out, you know.

453
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:11,001
Okay, I guess it depends
on your point of view.

454
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:15,039
Personally, I admire someone
who could work the system,

455
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:18,608
influence the masses,
execute a vision.

456
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:22,512
It's not for everyone but...

457
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,248
where are you going with this?

458
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,584
What if you're here
for a reason,

459
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:31,020
what if you coming back in time
wasn't an accident?

460
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,089
- You're talking about fate.
- No, I'm talking about design.

461
00:23:34,157 --> 00:23:37,726
I'm talking about me.

462
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:42,397
Yeah, I put some of
the pieces together.

463
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:45,434
That we were sent back
by you.

464
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:48,170
So why did I send you back
here to help me?

465
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:55,610
Well that's obvious, to...
to change the future.

466
00:23:55,678 --> 00:24:01,449
Your destiny is not to become
Santech CEO Alec Sadler,

467
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:06,520
it's bigger.

468
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:10,191
How do I know I can
trust you?

469
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:13,660
Well, I have been accused
of many things...

470
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,029
You know what, I'd better
get back to work.

471
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:18,832
Hey, kid...

472
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,801
Alec...

473
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:30,276
Here's some free advice,
detective...

474
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,446
cash in that shitty pension,
turn in that badge,

475
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,355
buy that motorcycle you've
always dreamed about

476
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:37,250
and a shitload of guns.

477
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:38,683
You're gonna wanna be prepared

478
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,553
for the changes
that are coming.

479
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,156
They really did a number
on you in prison,

480
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:46,158
we should be taking you
to the psych ward!

481
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,627
Yeah, I guess that's
where time travelers

482
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:52,231
would fit in best, huh?

483
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:53,698
Time travelers?

484
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,635
Time travelers,
we're all time travelers.

485
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:00,471
Brother, you have no idea
who the delusional one

486
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,573
in this relationship is.

487
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:06,610
I can tell you it's not me
and it's definitely not her,

488
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:11,181
so you do the math.

489
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,650
I don't know why you
don't just tell him,

490
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:16,053
we've already changed
the future.

491
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,557
You're never going back to what
you left behind, Cameron.

492
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:24,827
Why don't you just tell him?

493
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:28,230
Or maybe you just don't care
about him enough...

494
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,232
Tell him, Cameron!

495
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,635
Tell him, Cameron!

496
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,371

The signal's down,
I'm trying to reestablish.

521

Just forget that, warn Carlos.

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,378
Carlos, come in.

00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,915
that decoy must've worked.

Decoy?

526
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,819
Radio Betty, get an update.

00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:07,690
Hey Betty, this is Carlos...
you read me?

528
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:08,991
- Anything?
- Nothing.

What did I tell you?

534
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:35,827
Decoy huh?

535
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:37,829
I think you'd better fasten
your seatbelt.

536

You're in for one
hell of a ride!

of this one, Protector!

Here we go, stay with them.

Nicely done. What do we do now?

578
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:12,131
I'll get on the radio, see if I
can find out what's going on.

Okay, well let's get
them some.

587
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,452
Redirect the decoy convoy
to their last known position

588
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,021
and send in air support
to cover the area.

get wind of this?

You think we have someone
inside feeding intel to Liber8?

Well, I wouldn't rule
it out.

minute now.

How did they know where
we were, Carlos?

There's only one reasonable
answer to that question...

596
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,479
A mole inside the VPD.

597
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,215
Either way, we can't risk
calling in for backup again.

finally arrived.

I don't really need to,
do I?

609
00:32:58,064 --> 00:32:59,765
You and I know there's
only two versions of this

610
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,066
that make any sense,

611
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:04,236
so you need to decide.

612
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:09,107
Do you have a problem
inside this department

613
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:13,411
or do you need to take a
closer look at Kiera Cameron?

614
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,213
She might not make it
out of this alive.

615
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,382
From what I've seen,

616
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,784
making it out alive
is her specialty.

617
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:21,118
Any sign of them,
are they gone?

618
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:24,889
I don't know where they are,
I can't see them.

00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,083

- Get out of here, go!

623
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:57,221
- Go!
- Hold on!

624
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:58,855
There we go!

What do we do now?

627
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,807
I have no idea.

for us.

Get me out of here!

Come on! That was no accident!

634
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,763
These two are fighting
over us?

And yet you couldn't make
out any identifying features

The second group...

it was like a military strike,
they were precise.

What matters here is
that both groups

were apparently going
for the same thing.

You know what astounds me

Is that these two were put in

that we're not even sure
