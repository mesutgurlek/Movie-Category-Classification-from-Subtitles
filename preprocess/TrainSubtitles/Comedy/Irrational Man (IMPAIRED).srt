00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,938
(CAR ENGINE RUNNING)

2
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,548
ABE: Kant said human reason is troubled by
questions that it cannot dismiss,

3
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,759
but also cannot answer.

4
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,095
Okay, so, what are we talking about here?

5
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,347
Morality? Choice?

6
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:41,226
The randomness of life?
Aesthetics? Murder?

7
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,192
JILL: I think Abe was crazy
from the beginning.

8
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,320
Was it from stress? Was it anger?

9
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:56,866
Was he disgusted by what he saw
as life's never-ending suffering?

10
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,702
Or was he simply bored

11
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,955
by the meaninglessness
of day-to-day existence?

12
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,333
He was so damn interesting.
And different.

13
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,876
And a good talker.

14
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,879
And he could always
cloud the issue with words.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,632
ABE: Where to begin?

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,884
You know, the existentialists
feel nothing happens

17
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,554
until you hit absolute rock bottom.

18
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,223
Well, let's say that when I went
to teach at Braylin College,

19
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,892
emotionally, I was at Zabriskie Point.

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,522
Of course, my reputation,
or should I say a reputation, preceded me.

21
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,067
JOE: I hear Abe Lucas is gonna be
joinin' the faculty this summer.

22
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,360
JUDY: Really?

23
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,238
That should put some Viagra
into the philosophy department.

24
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,741
He's this really interesting guy,
but he looks totally wasted.

25
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,159
I kind of like the burned-out look, though.

26
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,327
Oh, my God, me too.

27
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,662
Well, yeah, and he has affairs
with some of his students, I heard.

28
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,206
- Really?
- Yeah, like full... Yeah.

29
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,667
Abe Lucas is teaching
my Ethical Strategies class

30
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,877
for summer session.

31
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,587
- Have you read any of his papers?
- Mmm-hmm.

32
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,881
He's very radical.
Very original.

33
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,424
You either love him or hate him, really.

34
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
Faye Cohen knows someone who knows him,

35
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:01,431
but she says, he had a serious depression
when his wife left him.

36
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,725
The story is, she ran off with his best friend.

37
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,101
Really?

38
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,728
'Cause, actually,
what I heard through the rumor mill

39
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,438
was he had a breakdown
when his best friend was killed.

40
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,066
He was a TV crew guy in Iraq
and he got beheaded.

41
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,942
Isn't that gruesome if it's true?

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,029
Jesus, I haven't even met the guy yet,
and I'm already jealous.

43
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,032
(CHUCKLING) Jealous?
I love that you're jealous.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,617
That makes me feel desired.

45
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,119
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
Everybody on campus desires you.

46
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,580
- Oh, come on.
- But I have you.

47
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,791
I don't know, suddenly the thought of you

48
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,710
coming under the spell
of some charismatic professor...

49
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,547
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
I'm under your spell.

50
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,926
Good. Let's keep it that way.

51
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,135
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

52
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,070
Excuse me.

53
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,906
Uh, do you know where Jessup Hall is?

54
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,826
Yes, Jessup Hall is that building
over there, the red one.

55
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,286
Uh-huh, all right.
Thank you.

56
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,790
ASSISTANT: Doctor Reed?

57
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,834
- Oh.
- ASSISTANT: Professor Lucas.

58
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,504
- Professor Lucas, welcome to Braylin.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,507
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

60
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,595
- I'm sure you've had a long trip.
- Mmm-hmm. It was, yeah.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,181
- Well, um...
- Thank you.

62
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,517
We've just concluded our spring semester,

63
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,687
and summer's always very active at Braylin.

64
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,814
(SIGHING) Uh-huh.

65
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,943
We're all very happy to have you here
in the philosophy department.

66
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,820
Mmm, thank you.

67
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,365
This is it.

68
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,951
Now, the faculty housing
is pretty much spread out,

69
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,661
but, you know, everything you can get to.

70
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,038
It's within walking distance of the campus.

71
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,874
And you're really gonna like Newport.

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,960
It's beautiful here, but it gets
a little crowded in the summer.

73
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,378
That can be a drag.

74
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,048
It's a small house, but it's really comfortable.

75
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,553
Um, right over here is the living room,
and there's a little kitchen that way.

76
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,889
And there's a little dining room
right next to that.

77
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,182
Upstairs...

78
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,058
This way.

79
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,478
Bathroom to the right.

80
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,065
And this is the bedroom.
It's small, but really comfortable.

81
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,401
And there's an office over there.

82
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,362
I think you'll really love
the philosophy department, you know?

83
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,240
It's in this old, beautiful part of the campus.

84
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,992
And there's a more modern wing,

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,037
that's got state-of-the-art stuff for science,

86
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,039
and computer technology, if you're into that.

87
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,918
Oh, and if you want to go away,
we're just 45 minutes from Providence.

88
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,252
Thank you.
Do you want a drink?

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,588
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no! God, no.

90
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,009
There's a little cocktail reception
to welcome you at 6:00.

91
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,428
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

92
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,849
You know, I have to tell you,
I loved your essay on situational ethics.

93
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,435
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

94
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,940
It caused a little, uh, static
with the philosophy department at Adair.

95
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,442
- This is my husband, Paul.
- Hey, how you doin'?

96
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,237
- This is Abe Lucas, philosophy department.
- BOTH: Good to meet you.

97
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,905
- Yeah.
- How you doin' on that?

98
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,198
I'd like another one, please.

99
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,450
- What is it?
- Vodka martini, extra olives.

100
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,119
- Anything for you?
- Sure, I'll have another.

101
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,746
- Uh, scotch?
- Mmm-hmm.

102
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,081
- Okay.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,793
I'm Rita Richards.
It's so good to have you here.

104
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,921
Hey, if you're ever bored
and you want someone to give you

105
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,091
the real lowdown of
who's fucking who at this college,

106
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,968
just let me know.

107
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:31,432
So, Kant would argue
that in a truly moral world,

108
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,644
there is absolutely no room for lying.

109
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,106
And even the smallest lie

110
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,609
destroys his precious categorical imperative.

111
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,072
So, Kant would say,
if a killer came to your house,

112
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,243
looking to kill the man hiding upstairs
and asked where he was,

113
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,662
you'd be obliged to tell him.

114
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,250
In his perfect world,
you know, you couldn't lie.

115
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,836
Yeah, I can see the logic

116
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,172
that if you open the door, even just a crack,

117
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,967
you accept a world where lying is permitted.

118
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,468
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,180
Okay, then, then you'd say
if the Nazis came to your house,

120
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,349
hiding Anne Frank and her family,

121
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,685
and asked if anyone
was in the attic, you'd say,

122
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,187
(IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT)
"Ja, the Franks are upstairs."

123
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,814
I doubt it.

124
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,276
Because there's a difference between

125
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,529
a theoretical world of philosophy bullshit,

126
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,533
and real life, you know?

127
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,661
Real, nasty, ugly life

128
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,790
that includes greed, and hate, and genocide.

129
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,545
Remember, if you learn nothing else from me,

130
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,883
you should learn that much of philosophy
is verbal masturbation.

131
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,386
EDGAR: Have you talked to him at all?
MS. LEONARD: Mmm.

132
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,640
You know, I asked him
if he wanted to eat with us.

133
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,142
- I like the guy, but he's in a world...
- He likes to eat alone.

134
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,685
Yeah, he's in a world all his own.

135
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,062
I think he likes to keep to himself a bit.

136
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,355
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

137
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,065
Yeah, so, let him be. Right?

138
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,359
- Could take some time.
- Right.

139
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,861
ABE: Okay, Kierkegaard.

140
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,237
Um...

141
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,240
You know, when making everyday decisions,

142
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,077
we have absolute freedom of choice.

143
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,872
All right?
You can do nothing, or anything.

144
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:23,086
And this feeling of freedom
creates a sense of dread.

145
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,505
A dizzy feeling.

146
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,092
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

147
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,094
RITA: The students love you,

148
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,264
but, of course, you've raised
some eyebrows with the faculty.

149
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,185
- Do you ever get discouraged teaching?
- No.

150
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,270
You don't ever ask yourself
what the hell is it all about?

151
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,438
Mmm-mmm.

152
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,025
Another school, another batch of kids.

153
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,194
Sweet kids.

154
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,446
Mmm. Average kids.

155
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,032
Nice, but mostly mediocre.

156
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,452
They'll grow up to be those people
who shape the world with their ignorance

157
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,038
or misinformation, or passivity.

158
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,793
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

159
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,753
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,548
You want to come in?
This is where I live.

161
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,218
Paul's in Aspen at a symposium.
I've got great grass.

162
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,888
- (CLICKS TONGUE) Some other time.
- Are you sure?

163
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,307
Yeah.

164
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,060
Thanks. Thanks anyway.
I'll see you.

165
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,151
Tomorrow we're gonna discuss
phenomenology and Husserl.

166
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,278
So, be sure you do the reading, you know?

167
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,280
It can get a little complicated.

168
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,489
All right?

169
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,421
Hi, you wanted to see me?

170
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,007
Yes, your paper was quite good.

171
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,177
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,512
I read so many papers and,

173
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,015
usually the students are merely
paraphrasing what they've read,

174
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,518
but I found your thinking
fresh and well-presented.

175
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,439
Oh, thank you.
I'm flattered.

176
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,528
I have to say, I was very influenced by
your ideas on randomness and chance.

177
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,324
Well, the truth is, what I found most exciting

178
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,659
was when you took issue with my ideas.

179
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,703
When you disagreed with me,

180
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,540
your arguments were
well-reasoned and original.

181
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,711
(LAUGHING) Am I blushing right now?

182
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,215
That's a really big compliment.
Thank you.

183
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,512
Um, I did actually find
some parts of your book

184
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,722
a little hard to follow though,

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,060
and I would love if you
could explain some things to me.

186
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,523
Sure, can we get out of here,
though, before I die of suffocation?

187
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,985
I found your view of existence
too bleak for me.

188
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,198
It was like there were
no redeeming joys or pleasures.

189
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,407
Okay.

190
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,370
Why are you taking philosophy?
What do you want out of it?

191
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,038
Because if your goal is to try and figure out

192
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,166
what all this bullshit's about, forget it.

193
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,837
You write books, you write papers.
You've done so much.

194
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,882
Well, let me tell you, when I look back
at all that verbal posturing,

195
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,468
my group thought we were
going to be so special.

196
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,930
I marched in every bullshit
political demonstration.

197
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,599
I spent six months in Darfur
getting food to starving families,

198
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,309
I wind up with meningitis.

199
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,562
- Mmm.
- I was in Bangladesh.

200
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,147
Yeah, you know, you want to see
a difference, to save the world.

201
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,860
(SIGHING) But when you see
what you're up against...

202
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,321
Do you like vintage single malt?
You drink?

203
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,074
You mean here?

204
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,286
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLING) Right now?

205
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,913
(CHUCKLING) No, no, I couldn't.

206
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,751
JILL: There was no way I could have
realized from that first conversation

207
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,504
that a lot was very wrong with Abe.

208
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:58,092
He was so damn fascinating and vulnerable,
and I must say, I found him attractive.

209
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,428
I guess it helped that
he felt comfortable with me.

210
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,138
I drove a cab.

211
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,099
- I was a handyman in a building.
- (CHUCKLES)

212
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,894
I ran an elevator.
But I always read.

213
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,355
Always, always loved the Russian writers.

214
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,774
Especially Dostoyevsky.
Dostoyevsky got it.

215
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,944
I've read all of it.

216
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,946
- Really?
- Mmm.

217
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,241
JILL: Oh, I had a great conversation
with Abe Lucas the other day.

218
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,451
Uh-huh.

219
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,745
He said my paper was
well-organized and original.

220
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,954
- All right.
- Right?

221
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,414
Yeah, I can see where this is goin'.

222
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,541
Oh, stop it, please.

223
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,711
He's just fascinating because he's brilliant,
but he's a sufferer.

224
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,005
Perfect. Great, you always
became attracted to the sufferers.

225
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,673
Right? That's how we first met.

226
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,717
He's a real sufferer, Roy.
You had shingles.

227
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,968
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,305
He was traumatized
when his best friend was killed in Iraq.

229
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,100
- He was a journalist, just horrifying.
- Didn't he get his head cut off?

230
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,728
His head cut off?
No, no, it was an explosion.

231
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,938
ROY: Oh.

232
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,691
God, it's amazing how people
embellish these stories.

233
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,569
You know, Abe actually says
that people just manufacture drama

234
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,447
so they can get through their lives
because they're so empty.

235
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,408
Can we just change the subject
of Abe Lucas, please?

236
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,994
You've been, like, singing
his praises for half an hour.

237
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,038
All right, well, then, how about I sing yours?

238
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,749
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. Good.
- How's that?

239
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,250
I love you in that sweater.

240
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,586
Of course, you love me in this sweater.
You bought it for me.

241
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,714
Well, you look great in that shade of blue.

242
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,508
You really do.

243
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,427
You know Abe's mother committed suicide?

244
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,679
Abe again?

245
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,181
I mean, can you imagine?
He was 12.

246
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,017
She drank bleach!
It's so sad.

247
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,355
You know, Simone de Beauvoir pointed out,
and quite correctly,

248
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,774
that in a society shaped by men,

249
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,111
women are seen as relative beings
existing only in relationship to men.

250
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,405
- Hmm.
- You agree with that?

251
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,700
- I agree with that completely.
- Mmm-hmm.

252
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about you.

253
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,123
That you've had a lot of
experience with women.

254
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,208
You mean slept with.

255
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,003
You find that fulfilling?

256
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,588
Many women and one-night stands?

257
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,049
I did at the time.

258
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,094
It had a certain frantic quality.

259
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,139
One day, it stopped being exciting.

260
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,516
I couldn't find distraction anymore

261
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,936
in that usually reliable painkiller, the orgasm.

262
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,022
Why not?

263
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,608
I couldn't remember the reason for living.

264
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,154
(SIGHING) And when I did,
it wasn't convincing.

265
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,364
That sounds scary.

266
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,660
It's very scary when
you run out of distractions.

267
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,246
Well, what if it wasn't a distraction?

268
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,250
What if you just decided
to commit yourself to one person?

269
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,713
If I met someone now,
I'm too far gone to appreciate her.

270
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,260
(SIGHING) I have to go to my piano lesson.

271
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,056
What are you doing on Friday night?

272
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,477
(SIGHING) Oh, I don't know.
Why?

273
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,146
I think you should come to a party.

274
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,814
- Uh...
- I do.

275
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,650
Roy and I will take you.
We can go and it'll...

276
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,569
There'll be music and it'll be fun.

277
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,112
There's a lot of students that like you.

278
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,490
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
- There really are.

279
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,867
And I think it's better than
just wallowing in your room.

280
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,369
I don't think that's healthy.

281
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,414
You should think about it.
You want to come out?

282
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,459
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

283
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,843
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

284
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,648
- Yes?
- Hi.

285
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,319
I'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but,

286
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,448
I was shopping today at the liquor store, and,

287
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,619
I came across these two very fine bottles
of single malt scotch,

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,246
and I got one for Paul and myself.

289
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,124
And I know how much
you love single malt scotch.

290
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,211
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.
How much do I owe you?

291
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,381
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, God, no, I bought it for you.

292
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,550
Oh, thank you.

293
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,304
You could have waited to give it to me.
You didn't have to come in the rain.

294
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,224
I couldn't wait.
I was excited over it.

295
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,853
Will you have one with me?

296
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,147
I thought you'd never ask.

297
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,943
Um... Hmm.

298
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,779
What have you been doing?

299
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:33,242
I'm trying to finish this book
I started a long time ago.

300
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,579
- What's it about?
- About Heidegger and fascism.

301
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,456
Just what the world needs.

302
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:44,128
Another book about Heidegger and fascism.

303
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,089
How's it coming?

304
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,635
I'm blocked.
I can't write.

305
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,054
Why?

306
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,099
Oh, I...

307
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:02,813
I can't write 'cause I can't breathe.

308
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,154
What would get you breathing again?

309
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,323
(SIGHS)

310
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,117
I, you know...
The will to breathe.

311
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,828
- Hmm.
- Inspiration, you know?

312
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,331

00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,630
Don't do this.

468
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,924
(SCOFFING)

469
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,678
Well, we spend a lot of time together, Abe.

470
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,347
- You know, and I...
- We're friends.

471
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,057
I know it's...

472
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,811
All right, well, I thought you could tell
that I cared about you.

473
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,856
I mean, it's pretty obvious to everyone.

474
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,984
Including your boyfriend?

475
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,946
I don't... I'm not ready to make
an exclusive commitment to him.

476
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,365
He's...

477
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,160
- I just have a lot of questions and...
- All right, Jill.

478
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,913
Maybe we're spending
too much time together.

479
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,874
Maybe I shouldn't monopolize your time.

480
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,923
- Okay.
- (SIGHING)

481
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,052
ROY: Why are you in such a bad mood?

482
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,262
Roy, I'm fine.
All right?

483
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,598
Can't I just be a little bit edgy
every once in a while?

484
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,518
Well, have you thought
any more about what I said?

485
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:20,852
What?

486
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,814
That after graduation, we go to London,
we move in together

487
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,816
and we do our postgrad work at Oxford, no?

488
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,944
(STUTTERING) It's a very
big idea and I don't know.

489
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,946
I think it would be a great experience.

490
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,656
Jill, stop, stop.

491
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,826
Come on, you know I love you.
What's wrong?

492
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,912
I just can't talk about this right now, Roy.

493
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,789
I feel very achy.

494
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,375
Like maybe I'm coming down
with something, or...

495
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,919
- Okay...
- I don't know, like a flu or...

496
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,921
(SIGHING) All right.

497
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,509
Isn't it a lovely spot?

498
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,636
I love it.

499
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,390
I come here when I want to be alone.

500
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,311
You're looking a little glum.

501
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,732
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

502
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,319
I thought maybe some time had passed,
you know?

503
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,697
And you took the Cialis?

504
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,449
Against my better judgment.

505
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,368
Can I confess something?

506
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,999
When I heard you were coming here,
I'd walk along these rocks,

507
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,296
and had fantasies that we'd meet
and something special would happen.

508
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,716
If you're unhappy,
why can't you just up and leave?

509
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,801
(SIGHING) I...

510
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,013
I can't do it alone.

511
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,849
You know, I just can't.

512
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,351
I need somebody to leave with.

513
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,439
ABE: Jill had been right
in her appraisal of me.

514
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,816
I was teetering on the brink
of some kind of breakdown,

515
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,112
unable to deal with my feelings
of anger, frustration, futility.

516
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,201
They say that drowning
is a painless way to go.

517
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,790
Despair is what Kierkegaard called
the sickness unto death, Abe.

518
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,251
And you suffer from despair.

519
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm well aware of what Kierkegaard thought.

520
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,593
But he was, in the end, a Christian.
How comforting that would be.

521
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:21,014
So, are you looking forward
to your piano recital tonight?

522
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,265
Did you settle on the Bach?

523
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,725
- We'll figure this out.
- CAROL: I don't know.

524
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:24,935
This is wrong.

525
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,687
Are you aware of
what's going on at this table?

526
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:28,897
ABE: What?

527
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,609
- It is a messed-up situation.
- (MOUTHING)

528
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,653
CAROL: And my kids
feel like I'm not comin' back.

529
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:35,862
EVE: Aw, that's not true.

530
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,907
CAROL: I know.
I don't know what to do.

531
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,408
I'm at my wit's end.

532
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,244
Who's the judge?

533
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,246
CAROL: Uh, Spangler. Thomas Spangler.

534
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,873
How'd this guy ever wind up
in family court? It's just...

535
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,250
They're political appointees.

536
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,127
Some are okay, but a lot of 'em are
just bums who are getting paid off.

537
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,629
It's not right.

538
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,924
He awards the kids to Frank.
Frank doesn't even look after them.

539
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,717
- BIFF: It's true...
- Frank doesn't even want them.

540
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,345
BIFF: He doesn't care about his own kids.

541
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,681
CAROL: I deliver them to him,
they don't want to go.

542
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,891
They're crying.
They're crying.

543
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,352
What does Frank do?

544
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,355
He sticks 'em in a corner
of the garage he works at.

545
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,816
And they sit underground all day.

546
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,527
I mean, they should be outside,
in the fresh air.

547
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,990
(SOBBING) And now he's gonna
switch custody to Frank?

548
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,576
- On what grounds?
- On no grounds.

549
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,496
Because he's friendly in some way
with Frank's lawyer.

550
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,623
(SIGHING) Switching custody
would be a disaster.

551
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,125
HAL: It doesn't make sense.

552
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:33,044
I brought in the kids' teachers,
I brought in the kids' doctors.

553
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,462
It doesn't matter.

554
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,215
And you're sure he can't be recused?

555
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,385
CAROL: We tried.
My lawyer tried and failed.

556
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,724
I can't keep payin' all these legal bills
and the judge knows it.

557
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,059
So, every time I want something,
he says, "Make a motion."

558
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,604
And we do, but he turns me down.

559
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,565
And it's costin' me everything I got.

560
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,859
- (SOBBING) And I'm gonna lose my kids.
- Aw.

561
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,069
HAL: And you're sure he's cozy
with Frank's lawyer?

562
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,698
CAROL: Oh, God,
they look at each other, they smile.

563
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,160
(SCOFFING) I got a bad break,
drawin' this judge.

564
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,454
It's just so unfair.

565
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,123
(SNIFFING) I'm due in court in six weeks.

566
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,875
If he doesn't postpone it again,

567
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,211
which he does,
because he knows it helps Frank.

568
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,716
I can't get a decent night's sleep.

569
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,803
(SNIFFING) I wish I could take the kids
and move to Europe.

570
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,348
I mean, I actually thought of
taking them out of the country.

571
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,184
What, and hide for the rest of your life?

572
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,061
You'd be a fugitive.

573
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:35,231
I feel for you, Carol, I do.
And you're such a good mother.

574
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,486
I hope the judge gets cancer.

575
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,239
ABE: He won't get cancer.

576
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,700
Because wishing doesn't work.

577
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,913
If you want him dead,
you have to make it happen.

578
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,915
But you'd never be able to pull it off,

579
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,251
and even if you did,
you'd be a prime suspect.

580
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,713
On the other hand,
I could kill him for you, lady,

581
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,716
and no one in the world would dream I did it.

582
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,595
I could rid you of this roach
and end all your suffering.

583
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,100
It was at this moment
that my life came together.

584
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,061
I could perform this blessing
for that poor woman

585
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,981
and no one would ever connect me to it.

586
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,483
I don't know any of the parties involved,

587
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,735
I have no motive,
and when I walk out of here,

588
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,071
I'll never lay eyes on
any of these people again.

589
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,573
All I need to know is the name.

590
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,243
Judge Thomas Spangler.

00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,295
Are you okay?

593
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:43,091
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Wow, God.
I got a little dizzy in there.

594
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,427
What, you're shaking.

595
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,137
- I guess, um...
- Are you all right?

596
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,430
An anxiety attack or something.

597
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,807
- I have medicine at home.
- Okay.

598
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,144
(PANTING)
Yeah, I don't know why I feel so dizzy.

(PIANO PLAYING)

601
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,282
ABE: Everything about killing
Judge Spangler turned me on.

602
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,493
The idea of helping this woman,
of taking action,

603
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,328
of ridding the world of the kind of vermin

604
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,123
that makes the world
an extra hell for all of us.

605
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,793
I was intrigued by the creative challenge
of bringing off a perfect murder.

606
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,506
It was a high-stakes risk,
but the risk made me feel alive.

607
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,846
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

608
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:40,148
- Sorry. Hey, you were great.
- Oh, thank you.

609
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,400
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

610
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,153
I've been thinking about that woman
that we overheard all day. Have you?

611
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,364
- Yeah, me, too, yeah.
- It's amazing what happens to some people.

612
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,658
God, I don't blame her for wishing him dead.

613
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,702
I'd be rooting for him to have a heart attack,

614
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,245
as awful as that sounds.

615
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,582
No. I mean, don't you think
that there are some people that die

616
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,833
and with their death,

617
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,378
the world becomes
a slightly better place instantly?

618
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,006
Mmm, I don't think it's
quite as simple as that.

I mean, he could be a terrible judge,
but a decent loving father.

620
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,721
- First off, he's not a father.
- How do you know?

621
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,891
I was so fascinated, I couldn't help
but check him out on my computer.

622
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,935
My God, you remembered his name?

623
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,187
Even if he was a good family man,

624
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,857
that's like those, you know,
Mafia bosses who do horrible things,

625
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,692
and, what, we're supposed to cut them slack

626
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,695
because they're wonderful
to their wives and children?

627
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,908
You have to resist the temptation
to overthink a very clear-cut issue.

628
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:35,954
You know, he's a rotten judge,
not impartial as he's vowed to be,

629
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,082
crushing a woman and her kids
simply because he has the power to do it.

630
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,042
No one can stop him.

631
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,460
(SCOFFING) I mean...

632
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,547
It's not that ambiguous,
even though it's ugly to say it.

633
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,591
He's a roach who'd be better stamped out.

634
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,264
ABE: The dizziness and anxiety
had disappeared,

635
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:58,893
and I accepted completely, in fact,
embraced my freedom to choose action.

636
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,812
I was too excited to fall asleep.

637
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,732
My mind was racing with ideas,
plans to kill Judge Spangler.

638
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,152
Thanks to a serendipitous encounter
with an unknown woman,

639
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,654
my life suddenly had a purpose.

640
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,825
When I finally did fall asleep,
I slept the sleep of the just.

641
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,093
- Morning.
- WAITRESS: Morning.

642
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,428
Oh, I know what I want.

643
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:37,932
I want the orange juice, French toast,
hash browns and double bacon.

644
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,518
Hey, what happened to
the usual black coffee?

645
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,187
Can I help it if I'm famished?

646
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,106
Well, bravo.
You want cinnamon on the French toast?

647
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,275
- Yes, I want cinnamon.
- Okay.

648
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,027
ABE: Hi.
RITA: Hi!

649
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,486
Good morning.

650
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,615
Whoa, you're full of energy this morning.

651
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,116
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

652
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,076
- I made a big decision last night.
- You did?

653
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,287
Mmm-hmm.
To take control of my own life.

654
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,164
Well, that's good.

655
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,793
What prompted this reawakening?
Did you have a religious epiphany?

656
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,213
I just decided it's time to stop whining

657
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,382
and to take matters into my own hands
and make something happen.

658
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,551
Well, that's good, because, uh, to be honest,

659
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,220
some of us here were
kind of worried about you.

660
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,138
- Huh.
- You seemed at such a low point.

661
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,182
The trick is not to
examine things too closely.

662
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,227
Not to debate every issue,
but to go with your gut feeling.

663
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,729
You know, and choosing action, to do,

664
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,815
rather than to observe
and get lost in conventional clichs.

665
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,653
I think I follow. Philosophy is
not a strong suit, you know, so...

666
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,987
Yeah, I think I know
what your strong suit is...

667
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,073
I'm a little slow.
Oh, really?

668
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:51,839
I knew you'd love that lighthouse.

669
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,675
It's one of my favorite places in the world.

670
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,510
Oh, it's so beautiful here.

671
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,429
I can't help thinking of
that phrase by Emily Dickinson,

672
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,014
"Inebriate of air."

673
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,684
To be drunk on air. (INHALING)

674
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,728
Not to have to rely on single malt scotch.

675
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,858
You know, you once said that
you used to fool around with poetry.

676
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:15,405
Mmm. Yeah, I destroyed
all my poems in a fit of rage,

677
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,867
when my funny, sweet friend,
this guy I grew up with my whole life,

678
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,705
stepped on a fucking land mine in Iraq.

679
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,290
Oh, Jesus.

680
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,294
But you know, maybe if you like,
I could try writing again for you.

681
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,045
I mean, I'm not very good,

682
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,549
but you know,
I might enjoy trying again for you.

683
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,264
You know I'm in love with you.

684
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,559
ABE: You think you are.

685
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,728
What you are is in love
with the romantic concept

686
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,897
of being in love with your college professor.

687
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:54,068
The correct road for you is
with that terrific guy you're going with.

688
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,113
Is that really what you think?

689
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,491
I'll always be your friend.

690
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,119
And even your poet laureate.

691
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,090
RITA: That was fantastic.

692
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,759
My God, what have you
been eating for breakfast?

693
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,929
ABE: Aw. I don't deserve all the credit.
You are hot stuff, lady.

694
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,682
What happened to the philosophy professor?

695
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,268
Christ, you were like a caveman.

696
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,438
For the first time in so long, I felt free.

697
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,775
You know?
Just a limitless freedom.

698
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,278
Run away with me.

699
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,280
Where? To Tahiti?

700
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,283
Like Gauguin?
To make love in the tropics?

701
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,827
I want to leave Paul and move to Spain.

702
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,454
- Yes?
- Yeah.

703
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,122
Why Spain?

704
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,875
I always found Spain to be so romantic.

705
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,168
Hmm.

706
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,964
- Now, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yes?

707
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,468
Yeah, have you been sleeping
with that student Jill Pollard?

708
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:04,305
I've been sleeping with no one
for a year, till tonight.

709
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,350
Not that I haven't tried, as you sadly know.

710
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,144
- You tried with the student?
- No, never.

711
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,813
We're only friends.

712
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,481
Well, because there's talk around the school.

713
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,316
Mmm, it's just talk.

714
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,486
People fill their lonely hours with gossip.

715
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,155
Now put it out of your mind.

716
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,826
ABE: My zest for life had returned

717
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,496
and the driving force of this rebirth
was my rock-solid determination

718
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,540
to perform a service for a mother of two

719
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,252
and rid the world of
Judge Thomas Augustus Spangler.

720
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,215
He lived alone on a pretty street
within walking distance to the courthouse.

721
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,679
One day a week, he played bridge
with his cronies at the Pavilion Club.

722
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,765
He was a member and ate there pretty often.

723
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,354
Saturday mornings,
he jogged at Lippitt Park.

724
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,274
He was not well-thought of as a judge
and had been censured once or twice,

725
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,943
but had never been reversed
on appeal because he was smart

726
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,195
and also one of the boys.

727
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,783
Why continental philosophy?

728
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,370
Because, you know,
continental philosophy deals with

729
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:14,250
problems much more exciting and,
and personal than the analytic tradition.

730
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,210
You know, the existentialists
were tryin' to find out

731
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,548
not just what does something mean,
but what does it mean for me?

732
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,217
(SCREAMING)

733
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,057
I never thought I would get you
to go to an amusement park.

734
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,101
Where's Roy tonight?

735
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,603
Studying.

736
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,939
ABE: Well, I'm mellowing in my old age.

737
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,318
And now that we're here,
I'm determined to win you a prize.

738
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,740
JILL: There was no question
there was something lighter about Abe.

739
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:46,908
His spirits seemed up,

740
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,745
he seemed more focused,
more optimistic, more charming.

741
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,498
He said he was determined to win me a prize.

742
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:58,085
And after one of his standard lectures
on the impact of luck and random chance,

743
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,255
he managed to pick the winning number
on his first spin.

744
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:05,092
I want to go with my first instinct.
There's my first hunch, 17.

745
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,762
Okey-dokey, here we go!

746
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,556
Round, and round, and round it goes.

747
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:14,644
And where will it stop?
Nobody knows.

748
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,729

- (LAUGHING)
- Unbelievable.

752
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,070
- I won.
- You're a lucky man.

753
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,780
- How did you do that?
- Luck rules the universe.

754
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,281
Oh, you think so?

755
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:31,494
Correction, not luck, chance.
We're all at the mercy of chance.

756
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,496
All right, what, what do you want?
What prize do you want?

757
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,498
- Um, okay...
- Anything, anything you want!

758
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,459
Oh, uh, the flashlight, please.

759
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,294
- Flashlight?
- Yeah.

760
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,463
- A nice practical choice.
- Thank you.

761
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,174
- This isn't practical.
- That's not practical?

762
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,134
- No, it's cool...
- I mean, look at your other options.

763
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,469
You're saying that you picked a flashlight?

764
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,971
- I like the color...
- Come on.

765
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,598
I hate that you think I'm practical.

No, it's a bad idea.
It's a bad idea.

I think it's a little late for that.

I know.
And I love Roy.

795
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,563
But maybe it was just that
he wasn't in love with me

797

I tried telling myself the reason
he wasn't letting anything go too far

798
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,113
was because a relationship
between a professor and a student

799
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,531
was against Braylin's rules,

Abe was too romantic to shy away from risks.

JILL: All I was sure of was
that as much as I cared for Roy,

803
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,626
and I really did,

804
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:46,587
I was swept off my feet by Abe Lucas.

805
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:50,091
The more he tried not to let
anything serious happen,

806
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,635
the more I wanted something to.

807
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,309
ABE: I was right in thinking
the killing would be an act of creativity.

808
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,479
It was artistically challenging
to plan how to do away with Spangler

809
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,398
and bring it off perfectly.

810
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,233
Weighing all the options,
I came to the conclusion

811
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,943
that the only practical way I could do it,

812
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,445
and hope to get away with it,
was to poison him.

813
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,115
Careful not to leave
any record on my computer,

814
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,658
I researched all the poisons

815
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:18,452
and it was clear why cyanide
had become the popular clich

816
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,454
of mystery writers and spies.

817
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,124
Cyanide would be quick and painless.

818
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,669
And while it would be impossible
to obtain any legally,

819
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:30,798
I knew where I might get some
without having to fill out any forms.

820

Yeah, but the only reason I got the tickets

is because you said you wanted to go.

I'm not up to it, all right?

ABE: It was Judge Spangler's
jogging routine

856
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,992
that gave me the idea I was looking for.

857
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,870
That is, once it became clear to me
that it was a routine.

(CHUCKLING)

928
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,345
You know, life's ironic, isn't it?

929
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:43,642
One day a person has a morass
of complicated, unsolvable problems,

930
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:49,022
you know, the world seems black,
and her troubles seem overwhelming,

931
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,442
and then, in the batting of an eye,
the dark clouds part

932
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:53,986
and she can enjoy a decent life again.

933
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,280
- It's just, it's astounding.
- Hmm.

934
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,657
Sometimes, just a little thing.

935
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,368
Like a sudden heart attack. (LAUGHING)

936
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,997
- Or, you know, hitting the lottery.
- Right, hmm.

937
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,459
I'm actually celebrating
for the second time in three days.

938
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,295
Second time?

939
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,464
My birthday was the day before yesterday.

940
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,049
Mmm.

941
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,676
No, I know.

942
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,513
I knew that you knew.
I made sure that you knew.

943
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,684
I was actually a little upset that you
didn't call to wish me a happy birthday.

944
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,312
Aw, Jill. You know, I wanted to.

945
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,566
I even got you a present
and then I thought, you know,

946
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,651
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

947
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,904
What wrong idea, that you like me?

948
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,325
Well, you know that I like you.
I just...

949
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,077
I don't want you to have fantasies.

950
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,538
Why not?

951
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,583
Because you can do better than me.

952
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:53,920
Oh, God. Really, Abe?
Don't you think I can decide that?

953
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,256
All right. Here.

954
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,342
Happy birthday.

955
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,760
Oh, my God.

956
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,720
Is this my present?

957
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,096
Yeah, come on, it's nothing.

958
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:07,017
It's not nothing, Abe!
This is beautiful.

959
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,563
And it's Edna St. Vincent Millay.

960
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,441
You really are a romantic, aren't you?

961
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:18,403
I marked off the poems
I thought you'd like most, you'll see.

962
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,030
Mmm.

963
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,076
Well, what I know of hers,
I absolutely love.

964
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,370
(CHUCKLING)

965
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,417
What am I doin' sittin' here
opposite you over candlelight?

966
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,420
I said I wouldn't let this happen.

967
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,881
But it has happened.

968
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,884
Hey, come on.
We're celebrating, right?

969
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,427
It's been a pretty good day.

970
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,762
You had a birthday.

971
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,807
I don't wanna eat, I wanna go to your place.

972
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,141
Jill.

973
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,726
I want to.

974
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,728
- No.
- Yes.

975
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,564
It's my birthday.

976
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:01,321
ABE: I swore I wouldn't,
but I don't know what's come over me.

977
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,618
What's come over you
is that you're finally celebrating life...

978
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:11,665
Instead of romanticizing death
with your crazy Russian Roulette.

979
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,795
(SIGHING) You have a boyfriend.
I'm not going to get in the way of that.

980
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,173
Roy and I aren't exclusive, I told you that.

981
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:22,134
- I don't believe you.
- (SIGHING)

982
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,677
Roy would say different.

983
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,346
I don't wanna talk about it.

984
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:29,182
I loved making love with you.

985
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,852
Yes, it was very nice for me, too.

986
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,187
Oh, it was just very nice?

987
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,317
I feel like I've accomplished
something worthwhile.

988
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,361
Like my life has meaning.

989
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,657
Well, I'm very flattered
that you think making love to me

990
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,451
has given your life meaning.

991
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:05,719
ABE: My writing was flowing,
the creative juices unblocked.

992
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,054
I was happy and enjoying
a sense of well-being,

993
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,850
and I'd begun an affair with Jill,
something I'd been determined not to do,

994
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,727
and yet was carried along
on the sudden momentum

995
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,812
of the sheer joy of living.

996
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,231
The thought that I had once been
indifferent to existence

997
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,566
seemed preposterous.

998
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,359
(PIANO PLAYING)

999
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,494
RITA: How is everything?
I haven't seen you.

1000
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,830
Yeah, really good, you know.
Everything's just been fallin' into place.

1001
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,415
- Huh.
- You look great, as always.

1002
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:39,419
I may have some free time next week,
if you wanna, you know...

1003
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,670
Uh-huh.

1004
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,381
Or am I encroaching on your other love life?

1005
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,758
(CHUCKLING) Hey, give me a break.

1006
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,259
JILL: Abe!

1007
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,512
Hey, I tried to call you.

1008
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,349
Did you see what happened?
Did you see the papers?

1009
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,059
ABE: No, what?

1010
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,937
Hi. Judge Spangler was murdered.

1011
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,773
- What are you talking about?
- JILL: He was murdered.

1012
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:01,900
I don't understand.
Wasn't it a heart attack?

1013
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,403
Yeah, it was a heart attack,
but they did an autopsy,

1014
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,198
and it wasn't cardiac arrest, it was poison.

1015
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,616
- Poison?
- Yeah. It was poison.

1016
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,034
Somebody poisoned his juice.

1017
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,452
- You've got to be kidding.
- I know.

1018
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,746
Well, what made them do an autopsy?

1019
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:16,456
Well, don't they always do an autopsy?

1020
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,543
I think that they suspected that
it wasn't a heart attack right away,

1021
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,462
and they just thought it was poison
and so they did the autopsy.

1022
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,797
Who's Judge Spangler?

1023
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:24,965
- He's a judge...
- ABE: This judge.

1024
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,300
That we had overheard
someone talking about in a diner.

1025
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:28,802
- This crazy story that some...
- Oh, yeah?

1026
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,596
I don't have time for a crazy story
right now, but I will see you soon.

1027
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,932
- Okay.
- I mean, can you believe that?

1028
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,559
- No.
- Isn't it awful?

1029
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,311
You know, he must've had a lot of enemies.

1030
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,730
Well, God, I'm sure, but we were celebrating.

1031
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,984
I know, but you know,
I still can't say I'm sorry.

1032
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,611
Well, who do you think it was?
Do you think it was the woman?

1033
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:48,488
- I don't know...
- Or, one of her friends or something?

1034
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:49,990
Well, what, what did the police say?

1035
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,785
ABE: I'm Abe Lucas and I've murdered.

1036
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,914
I've had many experiences
and now a unique one.

1037
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,000
I've taken a human life.

1038
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,335
Not in battle or self-defense,

1039
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:06,131
but I made a choice I believed in
and I saw it through.

1040
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,134
I feel like an authentic human being.

1041
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,513
ABE: Today we're gonna discuss
existential choice.

1042
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,308
That life has the meaning
you choose to give it.

1043
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,352
And we'll examine
Jean-Paul Sartre's wonderful insight,

1044
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,813
"Hell is other people."

1045
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,357
(CELLO PLAYING)

1046
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,322
JILL: Abe seemed
to have had a breakthrough.

1047
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:35,535
It was as if whatever had been stifling
his deepest feelings became unblocked.

1048
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,216
FEMALE TV REPORTER:
Police still have no clues

1049
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:54,554
in the murder of Judge Thomas Spangler,
who was poisoned in Lippitt Park weeks ago.

1050
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,805
At a press conference,

1051
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,850
investigators told reporters
all leads have been followed up,

1052
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,561
but so far there are no persons of interest.

1053
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,147
They said that speculation
that the poison had been intended

1054
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,024
for someone other than Judge Spangler,

1055
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,735
was just speculation and unlikely.

1056
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,906
ABE: You're wearing a new perfume.

1057
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,575
I love that you notice those things.

1058
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:19,204
I've become very attuned
to the sensual joys of life.

1059
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,540
Sights and sounds,
the taste of food and wine.

1060
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,670
What?

1061
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:27,921
What are you thinking?

1062
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,091
Today for one very funny moment,

1063
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,511
I thought it would be ironic
if you had killed Judge Spangler.

1064
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,762
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1065
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,265
Uh-huh, and how did I
perform that little miracle?

1066
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,934
I don't know, I don't know.

1067
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,104
I mean, you couldn't and you wouldn't.

1068
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,357
- It's got to be hard to kill somebody.
- Mmm.

1069
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,609
Especially to poison a stranger.

1070
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:53,196
Yeah, I mean, if I had to
eliminate someone, I think I'd...

1071
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:56,616
I don't know, use a gun or run him over.

1072
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,536
I mean, cyanide's a whole other deal.

1073
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:03,206
Was it cyanide?
The papers didn't say that.

1074
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,292
I always assume anyone poisoned,
is poisoned by cyanide.

1075
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:09,295
Oh, that's funny.
I always assume arsenic for some reason.

1076
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,964
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1077
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:15,218
Old movies or something.
It had to be someone that knew him.

1078
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,263
I mean, someone would have to
be close enough to him

1079
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,765
to drop poison in his coffee.

1080
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:22,809
Or I guess it was juice, wasn't it?

1081
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,645
ABE: I enjoyed the whole conversation.

1082
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,939
It was like sitting at a tense poker table,

1083
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:30,442
holding a full house,
and chatting innocently...

1084
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,318
Confident I had the winning hand,

1085
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,989
but getting a thrill out of the chance
I could be beaten with a straight flush

1086
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:37,782
or four of a kind.

1087
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,993
I had a big argument with Roy today.

1088
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,788
I don't like to hear that.

1089
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,792
I told him that I wanted
to be honest with him.

1090
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:52,255
And, that I still had real feelings for him.

1091
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,175
But I also have feelings for you.

1092
00:59:55,843 --> 01:00:00,472
I must say, you were special
from that very first day.

1093
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,141
You are very lucky.

1094
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,518
- I am very lucky.
- (LAUGHING)

1095
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,021
JILL: Mmm.

1096
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,526
So, what do you wanna talk about?

1097
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,528
Um...

1098
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,824
Look, I'm not gonna see you anymore.

1099
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,035
I can't operate under these conditions.

1100
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:26,039
I'm not just gonna wait around while
you play out your affair with Abe Lucas.

1101
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,460
Yeah, I understand.
That's not fair to you.

1102
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,380
Yeah, I'm just gonna move on.
Whatever happens, happens.

1103
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,675
- Are you seeing somebody else?
- No.

1104
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:42,055
But, obviously, you are, so,
I'm not gonna hold on from trying.

1105
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,892
That wouldn't be fair.

1106
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,480
It's too bad.
We had a good thing goin'.

1107
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,026
Hey, it's my fault, Roy.

1108
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,073
I'm just really not ready
to commit to one person.

1109
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,491
Yeah.

1110
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,703
Dinner was delicious.

1111
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,413
- And this pie...
- (JILL'S MOM GIGGLING)

1112
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,916
- It's so nice of you to have me over.
- Well, we're happy to.

1113
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,919
Particularly since Jill
always speaks so highly of you.

1114
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:16,256
Have you two been following
the Judge Spangler murder?

1115
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:19,092
Have we? We have a special
attachment to Judge Spangler.

1116
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,386
'Cause we overheard
some people talking about him,

1117
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:22,887
and what a rotten judge he was,

1118
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,890
and we kind of rooted for him
to have a coronary or get run over.

1119
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,768
I've jogged in that park with Sally Kelly.

1120
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,688
You know, when I first heard about it,
I thought someone poisoned him

1121
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,566
at breakfast, and it kicked in
when he was in the park.

1122
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,442
But, you know, when I read
it was cyanide in his drink,

1123
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,278
my theory unraveled.

1124
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:42,365
You know, you were right, Abe.
It was cyanide.

1125
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,450
- Mmm-hmm.
- You said that very early on, didn't you?

1126
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,785
JILL'S DAD: That's what they said it was.

1127
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,912
Yeah, well, like I said, I always think cyanide.

1128
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,415
Cyanide's the clich
because it's so quick and fatal.

1129
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,459
Arsenic takes time and is very painful.

1130
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,962
None of the herbicides
are quick and dispositive.

1131
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,131
I don't know anything about poisons.

1132
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,133
I don't, either, just what I read.

1133
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,468
Who'd wanna kill a judge?

1134
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,929
Only everybody,
every person he ever ruled against.

1135
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,266
But I think they looked into
everybody that knew him.

1136
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:12,228
Including that woman that we heard,
and they were all ruled out.

1137
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,772
That's why they think
it might be a sick prank,

1138
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,816
or intended for someone else.

1139
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,818
But it was quick-acting poison,

1140
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,905
so they would have to drop it in the cup
right there in the park.

1141
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,073
- JILL'S DAD: Well, that makes sense.
- Mmm-hmm.

1142
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,658
But not an easy thing to do,

1143
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,828
with a total stranger,
in broad daylight, in a public place.

1144
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,831
Unless he was there with
someone he knew, and trusted.

1145
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,499
- A friend.
- A weekend. A weekend.

1146
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,002
A weekend early in the morning,
not a lot of people around.

1147
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,922
Had to be someone he knew.

1148
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,507
But I think they questioned
everyone that knew him.

1149
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,510
- They said it was a regular orange juice?
- Mmm-hmm.

1150
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,346
And he bought an orange juice
there every weekend

1151
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,182
and he'd read the paper after jogging.

1152
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,352
Well, then if it was routine,

1153
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,522
somebody could've come around
and just dropped the poison in his cup.

1154
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,150
- Someone...
- You know, he wouldn't be on a park bench

1155
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:01,110
reading the newspaper, unless he was alone.

1156
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,320
That rules out a friend.

1157
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,864
How do we know it was a man?
Maybe it was a woman.

1158
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,491
ABE: Oh, that's a good point.

1159
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,034
Maybe he turned his back.

1160
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:12,538
Someone appears out of the blue,
and drops something in his drink?

1161
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,043
Well, aren't those take-out juices
covered with a straw?

1162
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:22,298
Or someone could have gone to Pascal's
and gotten a juice,

1163
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,551
and put the poison in it
and switched it with the judge's.

1164
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:26,844
Hmm.

1165
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,888
I'm sure the police have
run through every theory.

1166
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:33,017
Okay, let's say the judge is
sitting in the park with his orange juice,

1167
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:39,649
and, and along comes someone with
an exact matching cup full of poison...

1168
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,402
- Who comes along?
- And...

1169
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,988
- Well...
- Someone who wants to kill the judge.

1170
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,197
Whoever it was,

1171
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,491
would have to get the judge
to look away long enough

1172
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,701
to make the switch.

1173
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,411
- I mean, they'd be taking a huge risk...
- But think...

1174
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,870
They would sit down next to the judge,

1175
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,331
and the guy doesn't even have to know him,
he just is sitting there,

1176
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,500
and the judge is drinking his juice,
you know,

1177
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:01,671
and he sets it down next to him,
and this person is just...

1178
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,092
The judge opens up his paper, and he turns
and he's covered up for just long enough.

1179
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,177
Well, if he didn't know the judge,

1180
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,263
why would he wanna go
to all that trouble to kill him?

1181
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:13,182
Yeah, he'd have to be familiar with
the judge's routine, the details.

1182
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,600
But that would be easy.

1183
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,853
You could just stalk the judge
for a week and you would...

1184
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,188
I mean, it sounds like
this was his Saturday morning ritual.

1185
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,440
I like it.

1186
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,942
What Jill says makes sense.
It's a well-thought out concept.

1187
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:27,113
The judge reads the paper,
blocks his eye line, a quick switch.

1188
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:29,073
You know, if someone
sits next to you on a bench,

1189
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,242
you often turn away.

1190
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,494
JILL'S DAD: I'm sure the police
are way ahead of us on all this.

1191
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,787
Mmm.

1192
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:47,216
JILL: The murder of Spangler
remained a hot tabloid issue.

1193
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,468
Abe often talked about it

1194
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,221
and what a blessing it was for that woman,
now that the judge was gone.

1195
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,766
I didn't give any special thought to it,
until one day,

1196
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,559
when I ran into Ellie Tanner, a friend,

1197
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,895
that I sometimes went horseback riding with.

1198
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,480
JILL: No, no, it's fine.

1199
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,482
- Okay.
- He just, um...

1200
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,275
- Basically, we had this long conversation.
- Right.

1201
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:08,071
And he said that he felt like
I wasn't being fair to him.

1202
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,824
And he was right. I wasn't.
But I didn't know what to do anymore.

1203
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,286
You would love Abe.
He is so interesting.

1204
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,163
You know Rita Richards?

1205
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:19,999
Oh, yes, are you gonna tell me
that she had an affair with him?

1206
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,627
Because who on the faculty
has not slept with Rita Richards?

1207
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,130
No, she has this hilarious theory
about Abe Lucas.

1208
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,840
Oh, God, here we go.

1209
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:31,135
She thinks he would be a good suspect
in that case of the murdered judge.

1210
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,512
You know, the guy who's all over the papers?

1211
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,430
(LAUGHING) Oh, please.

1212
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,517
- She's kidding.
- I mean, she's half-kidding.

1213
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,352
Oh, come on.

1214
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,354
How did she come to
that bizarre conclusion?

1215
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,523
I don't even remember.
We were at her husband's barbecue.

1216
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,690
And she starts yelling about

1217
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,193
how Abe had argued
that the judge deserved to die.

1218
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:48,611
And then something about...

1219
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,197
I don't know, the aesthetics
of committing a perfect crime.

1220
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,200
- Whatever, she's crazy.
- Oh, she's crazy!

1221
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,119
She's nuts.

1222
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,454
Hey, we should go
horseback riding again, soon.

1223
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,998
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That was fun.

1224
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,501
JILL: Naturally, I didn't believe
there was any substance

1225
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:08,548
to Rita Richards' so-called theory,
and yet, for some reason, it bothered me.

1226
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,176
ABE: Here, two poems I wrote for you.

1227
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,137
- You didn't.
- I did.

1228
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:16,514
- Oh, my God.
- No, don't read them now.

1229
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:17,807
- I'm too embarrassed.
- (SIGHING)

1230
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,894
If you hate them, throw 'em away.
If they move you, they're yours.

1231
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,732
That's very sweet.

1232
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,695
Hey, is something wrong?

1233
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,405
- No.
- No?

1234
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,907
You seem a tiny bit off.

1235
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,160
No, I'm just moved.

1236
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,536
Without even reading them,

1237
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,414
I'm just moved by the gesture
of you writing these.

1238
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,416
Aw, clever student.

1239
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,505
Are you sure you're okay?

1240
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,759
I'm just looking at you.

1241
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,763
JILL: It seemed absurd to me

1242
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,559
that I could entertain even
the slightest doubt about Abe.

1243
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:03,269
And then a week later,

1244
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:06,606
I got a chance to hear
Rita Richards' theory firsthand.

1245
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,107
I ran into her in a local bar

1246
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,109
where she had been
sitting alone and drinking,

1247
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,361
and was a little drunk and talkative.

1248
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,071
- JILL: Hi.
- How are you, Miss Pollard?

1249
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,115
- Great.
- Hi, Kim. How's it goin'?

1250
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,034
JILL: Uh, can I catch up to you?

1251
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,119
- Hello.
- I was just thinking about you.

1252
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,287
I was just thinking about you too, actually.

1253
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:22,705
- You were?
- Yes.

1254
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,207
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1255
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,459
I'm good.
I ran into Ellie Tanner actually.

1256
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,378
And she said that
you had a theory about Abe.

1257
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,257
Oh! Oh, yeah, well,
it's what's called a crackpot theory.

1258
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,469
But it's not totally off the wall.

1259
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,388
Well, I love a crackpot theory.

1260
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,807
- Yeah, you promise you won't tell?
- You have my word.

1261
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,143
You wanna hear it?
Sit down.

1262
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,147
You've been following that judge
who got poisoned in the papers?

1263
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,233
- Spangler? Judge Spangler.
- Spangler.

1264
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,651
- Spangler, right.
- Yes.

1265
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,278
Well, they don't know who did it.

1266
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:59,408
My theory is, uh...
Abe Lucas of our philosophy department.

1267
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,327
(GIGGLING) Our mutual crush.

1268
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:04,956
Well, you...
That's, that's very, very intriguing.

1269
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,667
Well, it's crazy, but it's not, you know?

1270
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,627
Well, why do you think Abe?

1271
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:12,672
- Well, once or twice, when I was alone...
- Could I have a white wine, please?

1272
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,759
Let's just say in, like, a moment
of post-passionate intimacy...

1273
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,261
- No, I understand...
- We'd talk, yeah.

1274
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,596
- You don't have to get too graphic...
- And we both said that

1275
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,432
we had experienced many things in life.

1276
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,310
But one thing that he had never experienced,

1277
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:30,648
but wondered was
what it would be like to actually kill.

1278
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,191
(LAUGHING)

1279
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:34,694
- To kill?
- Yes.

1280
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:38,030
Well, that sounds like random, silly, Abe talk.

1281
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,032
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's had a few.

1282
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,367
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
- He's dramatic.

1283
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,286
Oh, that's exactly
what I thought, too, you know?

1284
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,537
It's just Abe being Abe.

1285
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:47,456
But then my husband
saw him leaving the campus,

1286
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,709
very early the morning
that the judge was poisoned.

1287
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,711
Like very early, like 6:30.

1288
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,797
I mean, have you ever known Abe
to get up at 6:30?

1289
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,882
He barely makes it to class on time.

1290
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:01,721
Okay, then your theory is
that he gets up at 6:30,

1291
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,558
and he goes to Lippitt Park,
and he goes up to a total stranger,

1292
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,894
and he drops poison
in the juice of a total stranger.

1293
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,896
I mean, he didn't even know the judge.

1294
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,733
He couldn't get that close, and then,
if he knew the judge, he wouldn't...

1295
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,569
I mean, he just wouldn't do it.
He's radical, but he's not nuts.

1296
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,696
Let me give you the final tidbit.

1297
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,740
A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.

1298
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:24,243
Now I never lose anything,
but that key was missing from my bag,

1299
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:27,705
and it opens all the doors to all the lab rooms

1300
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,417
that have all those
dangerous chemicals and poisons.

1301
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,378
All right, well... (LAUGHING)

1302
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:38,257
You sure have really got
that theory down, don't you?

1303
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:40,426
- RITA: Like I said...
- I'll think about it.

1304
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,428
I'll weigh it out.

1305
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:49,518
JILL: There was no question
I was rattled by Rita's outrageous theory.

1306
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,563
I knew Abe had had a very angry reaction

1307
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,566
to the judge's unfair treatment
of that poor woman.

1308
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:59,403
And what was he doing out at 6:30
on a Saturday morning?

1309
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:03,240
My thoughts were very
mixed-up and troubled.

1310
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:06,702
And more devastating revelations
were to come.

1311
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:10,623
But for the moment,
I lapsed into complete denial,

1312
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,960
and told myself this was too absurd
to even contemplate.

1313
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:19,632
I must not get carried away
with my overactive imagination.

1314
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,385
And yet, a dark cloud had crossed the Moon.

1315
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:23,594
- Hey.
- Abe.

1316
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,429
What's on your mind?
What are you thinkin'?

1317
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,265
Nothing.

1318
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:31,977
I was actually, I was thinking
that I used to come here and jog.

1319
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,481
You know, I'll jog with you if you want.
I'd love to get back into shape.

1320
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:39,318
(CHUCKLING)
No, you'd have to get up very early.

1321
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,655
I run early and you're a night person.

1322
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,990
Yeah, well, that's why I quit last year.

1323
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,661
That and no will to extend my life, but now...

1324
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:57,169
Rita Richards' husband actually
told me that he saw you leaving the campus

1325
01:10:57,337 --> 01:11:00,506
really early, at like 6:30 or something,
on a Saturday morning.

1326
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,134
- 6:30?
- Yeah.

1327
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,927
Oh, yeah, that was the morning
Judge Spangler died.

1328
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,680
Yeah, I had to go to Providence for an MRI.

1329
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,348
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1330
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,851
- You didn't say anything.
- Well, I didn't want to alarm anyone.

1331
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,812
It was a little benign thing,
but the doctor wanted me to check it out.

1332
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,272
He didn't think it was anything horrible.

1333
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,940
- I'm glad it was nothing.
- Yeah.

1334
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,942
- Mmm.
- Don't worry.

1335
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,278
- I'm relieved.
- Mmm.

1336
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:27,032
JILL: It was hard for me
to keep my mind on school work.

1337
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,869
I had this growing sense of anxiety.

1338
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:34,206
And realizing I always had
a tendency to overdramatize,

1339
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,543
I tried to keep my fantasies in check.

1340
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:41,338
And still, walking home,
I passed Abe's house,

1341
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:44,383
and knowing he would be
busy teaching all afternoon,

1342
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,303
I couldn't resist doing a crazy thing.

1343
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,946
Once I was inside Abe's house,
I felt I was betraying him.

1344
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,406
And I felt guilty and stupid.

1345
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,868
I couldn't imagine what I expected to find.

1346
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:56,956
And yet on his desk
was a copy of Crime and Punishment,

1347
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,209
with margin notes
that had Judge Spangler's name

1348
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,962
and a quote of Hannah Arendt's.

1349
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:05,965
(BALL TAPPING)

1350
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,427
Oh, are you kidding?

1351
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,263
(CHUCKLING) Jill!

1352
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:14,807
- APRIL: Hey!
- Oh, hi.

1353
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:17,643
Oh, you look so pretty.
I love your hair today.

1354
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,645
- Oh, God, thank you.
- (LAUGHING)

1355
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,313
- It's a mess.
- Nuh-uh.

1356
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,232
Um, how's your paper coming?

1357
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,486
Good, actually, thanks to Abe Lucas.
I ran into him in the chem lab,

1358
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:29,738
and he gave me this
whole list of people to read

1359
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,908
to understand those confusing points
that I was talking about, so...

1360
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,493
- He was in the chem lab?
- Yeah.

1361
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,705
He was there after hours.
I really startled him. I felt so bad.

1362
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,000
- (LAUGHING)
- What was he doing in the lab after hours?

1363
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,419
I don't know.
I think he's researching on a book,

1364
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,087
or something that he's writing about,

1365
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:48,340
like, poison or chemistry,
or one of those things, so...

1366
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:54,263
But in the lab, all that poison
and toxic stuff is locked away.

1367
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,223
Yeah, but he had a key.

1368
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,813
Hey, why are you actin' so strangely? Huh?

1369
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,023
What's so important we gotta go over it...

1370
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,025
You killed Spangler.

1371
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,861
- What?
- Didn't you?

1372
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,070
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you?

1373
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,199
You got cyanide from the chem lab,
and you slipped it into his juice in the park.

1374
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,702
You went to Lippitt Park,
you didn't get an MRI.

1375
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,204
- Listen to yourself. Jill, it's me.
- Is that true?

1376
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,373
- Don't...
- Are you nuts?

1377
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,918
Don't tap dance with me, Abe!
I saw in your book.

1378
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,254
I saw that you wrote,
"Spangler, the banality of evil."

1379
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,256
You must've decided that he deserved to die.

1380
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:32,676
And so you stole Rita's keys,
and April saw you.

1381
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,386
- Hey, listen, come here.
- No.

1382
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,846
- Come here.
- (GRUNTING)

1383
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:38,140
I made the choice to help that woman.

1384
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:39,808
You had it right the other night.

1385
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,311
I always said you had a first-rate intelligence.

1386
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:45,147
In the park?
On the bench?

1387
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:49,485
The covering up, the...
Jesus, I felt that, Abe! I felt that!

1388
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,528
I always taught you to trust your instincts.

1389
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,238
Not everything can be
grasped by the intellect.

1390
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,824
If it feels right, it often is.

1391
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:58,786
This was the meaningful act
I was searching for.

1392
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,206
You can't just take it upon yourself
to take someone's life.

1393
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,625
Well, I thought it was a very
reasonable thing to do.

1394
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:06,293
She hoped he'd get cancer!

1395
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:08,420
But what the hell is hoping?
Hoping is bullshit.

1396
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,255
You see, you have to act.

1397
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,343
You can't believe it was moral, what you did.

1398
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,637
- You don't think that it was moral?
- Of course I do.

1399
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:19,098
I consider myself a moral man
who's lived a moral life,

1400
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:22,893
who came to the aid of a woman
suffering a great injustice.

1401
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,938
- So, what, are you gonna go to prison?
- No, the police are not thinking of me.

1402
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:28,482
You gonna go to prison
for the rest of your life?

1403
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:32,236
And they never will, because I'm a total
stranger to everybody, with no motive.

1404
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:35,781
This will be just another unsolved crime.

1405
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,158
Do you know that Rita Richards
has a theory that you did it?

1406
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:41,578
Yes, I know, she told me.
We had a big laugh over it.

1407
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,748
How could you do it, Abe?

1408
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,167
Is the world a better place
without this rotten judge?

1409
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,920
- Oh, my God, Jesus, Abe!
- No, I ask you.

1410
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,089
- Is the world a better place...
- No, this is...

1411
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,675
- Without Judge Spangler?
- I am so crushed, Abe!

1412
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,510
I'm completely lost.

1413
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:00,764
What do I do?

1414
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,767
What do you mean?
Meaning what?

1415
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:08,272
Meaning that I care about you
so much and I can't...

1416
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,524
I can't go on seeing you anymore.

1417
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,651
Oh...

1418
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,364
Are you thinking of turning me in?

1419
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,200
Yes, I'm thinking of turning you in.
Of course I am.

1420
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:22,077
- Jill...
- But I can't do that.

1421
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,328
I can't bring myself to do it.

1422
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,956
You, you... This is...

1423
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,833
This is crazy, Abe!

1424
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:30,836
I'm asking you to put
our everyday assumptions aside,

1425
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,547
and trust your experience of life.

1426
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:35,758
In order to really see the world,

1427
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,218
we must break with
our familiar acceptance of it.

1428
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:43,223
The second I decided to take this action,
my world changed.

1429
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,600
You saw it.

1430
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:47,853
I suddenly found a reason to live.

1431
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:51,690
I could make love,
I could experience feelings for you,

1432
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,068
because to do this deed for this woman
gave my life meaning.

1433
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,363
You have to leave, Abe.

1434
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,410
You gotta go.
I can't see you ever again.

1435
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:07,414
- I won't say anything.
- (SCOFFING)

1436
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:09,249
I won't say anything.

1437
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,459
But I...

1438
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,423
I believe that you think you did
something morally worthwhile.

1439
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,467
- I did!
- I do believe that. No, but I...

1440
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,761
- But you can't, you can't justify it!
- Shh!

1441
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,347
(WHISPERING) You can't justify it
with all this bullshit.

1442
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:27,476
With all this bullshit,
French postwar rationalizing.

1443
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,812
This doesn't...
This is murder.

1444
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,271
This is murder.

1445
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,649
It opens the door to more murder, Abe.

1446
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:35,400
ABE: (WHISPERING)
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

1447
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,237
I don't have the intellect
to refute these arguments.

1448
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,780
I can't argue with you.

1449
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:42,908
But you taught me to go with my instinct,

1450
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:47,037
and I don't have to think about this.
I feel that this is no good.

1451
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:49,081
This is murder.

1452
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,208
Good job today.

1453
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,253
JILL: The next few weeks
were the hardest of my life.

1454
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,296
I loved Abe and truly believed

1455
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,800
his misguided intention
was to do a heroic thing.

1456
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,387
I argued his position
in my head over and over.

1457
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:06,765
And at times I weakened
and felt he was an original thinker,

1458
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,976
who couldn't be judged
by middle-class rules.

1459
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:15,107
ELLIE: You seem so down lately.
Did something happen with Abe?

1460
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,317
JILL: He's leaving the school.

1461
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,152
I guess it's just as well.

1462
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,363
How are you taking it?

1463
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,700
Not great.

1464
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:30,372
I'm sure Roy will be thrilled to hear that.

1465
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,623
You know, it's so funny.

1466
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,835
I used to think of Roy as wonderful,

1467
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:38,922
but just very uninspired, compared to Abe.

1468
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,884
And now I'm starting to think that

1469
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,262
I've really been more suited for Roy all along.

1470
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,933
I guess I'm not as cutting edge
as I imagined myself.

1471
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,816
Is it true?

1472
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:00,402
I heard that Abe is moving on.

1473
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,195
JILL: Yes.

1474
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,324
- Yeah, that's true.
- I'm going to miss him.

1475
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:09,995
I guess he found Braylin a little tame
for his restless temperament.

1476
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:14,416
He's thinking of moving to Europe.

1477
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,668
Can I tell you something?

1478
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,378
Sure.

1479
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:21,632
I wish he'd go to Spain and take me with him.

1480
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,550
Hmm.

1481
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:28,305
You know, he said that
you two had a pretty big laugh

1482
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,641
over your theory that
he was the Lippitt Park killer.

1483
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,768
(CHUCKLING)
We did have a good laugh over it.

1484
01:19:33,478 --> 01:19:35,854
And yet, if it turned out to be that he did it,

1485
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:40,817
you know, I'd be surprised, but not stunned.

1486
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,111
Not flabbergasted.

1487
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:48,367
I'd still let him take me to Spain.

1488
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,204
ABE: I played out
my last few weeks at Braylin

1489
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,873
and made plans to go off to Europe to teach.

1490
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,793
I still felt justified in what I'd done.

1491
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,462
I felt that I'd experienced
something unique and deeper,

1492
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,382
from all my social protests or charity work.

1493
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,635
I'd helped a family and hurt no one,
but he who deserved it.

1494
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,262
A man who took advantage
of his power to hurt others.

1495
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:12,975
I knew Jill would never betray me.

1496
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,811
But then things took on a new twist.

1497
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,398
Well, there goes my theory.
I guess I'll never work for the FBI.

1498
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,358
What does it say?

1499
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,151
JILL'S DAD: "Police are certain
they have the person

1500
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,278
"who poisoned Judge Thomas Spangler,

1501
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:28,615
"the family court judge
who was murdered in Lippitt Park.

1502
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:31,660
"The alleged killer, Albert Podesta,
a medical laboratory worker,

1503
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,455
"had access to the same kind of cyanide
that was used in the murder.

1504
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:39,209
"Podesta, who denies
he had anything to do with it,

1505
01:20:39,377 --> 01:20:41,712
"had testified before Spangler two years ago,

1506
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:46,174
"and had been enraged with the judge for
his ruling in a case against his brother.

1507
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,594
"If convicted,
Podesta faces life imprisonment."

1508
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,599
JILL: What do you plan to do about this?

1509
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,768
(CLEARS THROAT)

1510
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,145
I don't know.

1511
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:00,272
You don't know?

1512
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:04,526
Oh, surely, you're not gonna let an
innocent man take the rap for you, Abe.

1513
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,487
I've been up and back over this
since I heard the news.

1514
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,781
"Up and back"?
What does that mean?

1515
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,868
It means that I tried to bring off
the perfect crime,

1516
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:14,619
and apparently, I succeeded all too well.

1517
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,622
Okay, well, what about all your talk
about moral high ground?

1518
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,875
Look, I need to think this out, all right?

1519
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,960
What is there to think about?

1520
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,421
An innocent man
is about to have his life ruined.

1521
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:26,882
Okay, I'll give myself up.

1522
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,467
Is that what you want?

1523
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,761
Isn't that what you want?

1524
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:36,141
I mean, all this talk, talk, talk,
about doing the right thing,

1525
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,101
and what's best, and...

1526
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,854
Okay, if they don't see
that they're making a mistake

1527
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,398
and let him go in a few days, then I'll just...

1528
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,442
I'll fuckin', I'll turn myself in!

1529
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:50,113
I haven't been able to live with myself as it is!

1530
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:51,448
And this is a...

1531
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,576
We're talking about an innocent man
that's gonna be prosecuted for this!

1532
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:58,580
I know, I agree! Let me just see
if my luck holds out,

1533
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:02,084
and they come to realize that
they made a mistake, you know?

1534
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:05,253
Because I mean... Look at me!

1535
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:09,132
- I'm not gonna fuckin' make it!
- I know, I understand. I get...

1536
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,052
You have to do it by Monday, though, Abe.

1537
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,679
You got to do it by Monday,
or else I'm gonna have to do it.

1538
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,014
- I'm gonna have to do it.
- You stop that.

1539
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:17,933
- You don't have to do anything, all right?
- Abe...

1540
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:19,726
Just give me till Monday, please?

1541
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:22,104
Look at me, please?
Just give me till Monday?

1542
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:24,022
Okay? I promise.

1543
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,817
- First thing in the morning on Monday.
- Okay, okay.

1544
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:29,319
You have to do it, Abe, or I will do it.
I will do it.

1545
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:32,405
You don't have to do anything, I promise.

1546
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,450
God damn it, Abe.

1547
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,334
ABE: But I had no intention
of giving myself up.

1548
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:47,003
A few months ago,
my life meant nothing to me.

1549
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,798
I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.

1550
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:53,051
I'd have been fine if that
little game of Russian Roulette ended it.

1551
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:56,763
But since I planned and executed
the elimination of Judge Spangler,

1552
01:22:56,931 --> 01:22:59,141
my life had taken a new turn.

1553
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,892
I understood why people loved life

1554
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,520
and saw it as something
joyous to experience.

1555
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,564
I did get pleasure out of living.

1556
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,025
I didn't want to commit suicide,
or spend my remaining days behind bars.

1557
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:13,530
I wanted to live, to teach, to write,
to travel, to make love.

1558
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:17,159
That night, I went to bed with Rita,

1559
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:21,454
and even entertained the thought
of takin' her with me to Europe.

1560
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,333
I would leave Paul in a minute.

1561
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,257
Are you serious?
About Europe, really?

1562
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:35,135
What if I was?

1563
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,058
I couldn't believe it.
That's, um...

1564
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,060
It would be a dream.

1565
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:47,814
And start over in Rome or Spain or...

1566
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:51,276
London?

1567
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,112
ABE: The police had their suspect.

1568
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,948
Rita Richards, who was never really
serious about suspecting me,

1569
01:23:57,116 --> 01:24:01,328
would see it was another man
and that her crackpot theory was crackpot.

1570
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:04,414
The morality of letting someone take
the rap troubled me greatly,

1571
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:08,251
but paled against the hardwiring
of my natural will to survive.

1572
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:12,631
Europe with Rita was beginning
to have an exciting ring to it.

1573
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,884
Her passion for love and lust
was contagious.

1574
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,970
Only one thing stood in the way.

1575
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:24,184
I had a few days before Jill would insist
I clear the wrongfully accused man.

1576
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:27,354
Was there a way to keep her from talking?

1577
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:32,400
I guess she was right when she said
that one murder opens the door to more.

1578
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:38,240
Jill, I never stopped caring about you.

1579
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,534
It was you who wasn't sure how you felt.

1580
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,828
I was so stupid, Roy.

1581
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,748
I was so stupid, I'm...

1582
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:50,585
If you say you never want to see me again,
I'll honestly say, I deserve it.

1583
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,129
But what happened
to make you change your mind?

1584
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,674
I don't want to talk about Abe.

1585
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,467
I'll never understand him.

1586
01:24:57,635 --> 01:25:01,429
That's fine. I never wanted to talk
about him the whole time, anyway.

1587
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:05,308
(WHISPERING)
God, you're too understanding.

1588
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:07,352
You should be angrier with me.

1589
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,855
Jill, I'm so in love with you, but I just...

1590
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,858
I just feel like there's something
that you're keeping from me.

1591
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,279
I'll tell you on Monday.

1592
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:18,989
Okay.

1593
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,949
- All right?
- Okay.

1594
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,535
On Monday, you'll know everything,
I promise.

1595
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:24,869
Okay.

1596
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,206
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1597
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,585
I never believed we'd actually break up.

1598
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:36,006
I'm sad to say, but the time has come.

1599
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:40,802
And we need to talk about arrangements.

1600
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:46,182
This is a big step for me.

1601
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,020
You've known all along
I've wanted to live abroad.

1602
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,855
Yes, yes, but...

1603
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:55,358
- I want you to reconsider.
- Please.

1604
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:56,985
- Please.
- No.

1605
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,864
Let's just talk about the details, okay?

1606
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,383
(ELEVATOR BELL RINGING)

1607
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:58,505
ABE: Her death would have
to look like an accident.

1608
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:01,758
And I ran through all the ones
she might have and it hit me.

1609
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:06,679
My brief time running an elevator during
my college days might now pay off.

1610
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,393
Funny how often your best ideas
come under pressure of a deadline.

1611
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:13,561
It was perfect.

1612
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,605
Saturday was her piano lesson.

1613
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:19,943
Most of the offices were closed.
There was very little action in the building.

1614
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:22,320
I couldn't make it look like
the elevator had been tampered with,

1615
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,572
but I knew enough
how to make it seem broken.

(THUDDING)

1617
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,212
Hi.

1618
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,884
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

1619
01:28:26,469 --> 01:28:28,011
- Hi.
- I just...

1620
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:31,139
I wanted to talk to you
before I go to the police.

1621
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,558
All right, if it's about anything other
than turning yourself in,

1622
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:35,727
- I don't want to talk about it, all right?
- No, no...

1623
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,896
I see no other way. I just...

1624
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,190
I want to apologize
for all the trouble I've caused.

1625
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,358
I mean, I just... I can't believe this.

Oh, God. Oh, Abe.

Oh, it's a nightmare, I know.

I don't see any other way
than just telling them the whole story.

What? That I murdered a judge?

- I will, as a friend.
- No, it won't matter, you know?

JILL: With the passage of time,

1649
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:20,623
the awful vividness
of what I had experienced,

1650
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:25,336
gradually, very gradually,
grew less and less traumatic.

1651
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:30,842
It helped having a boyfriend
who was so loving and supportive.

1652
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:35,179
Every now and then,
I reflected on the whole episode.

1653
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:39,892
And with hindsight, gained some
perspective about life and love,

1654
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,020
and who I was.

1655
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:46,482
I even experienced,
for one terrifying moment,

1656
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,818
the closeness of death.

1657
