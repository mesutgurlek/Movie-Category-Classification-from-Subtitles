I'm Cedric. Cedric, Cedric.

165
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah, I'm not married.

166
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,165
That's why I'm not wearing a ring.

167
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,624
I'm sorry,

168
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,876
but Jesus has my heart.

169
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,128
Yeah, no, no, no, I get that.

170
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,421
I love Jesus, too.

171
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,131
I talked to him today,

172
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,967
I was like, "Jesus," I
said, "I need a girl!"

173
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,344
And I get here and I see you,

174
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,678
so I was like, "Thank you."

175
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,638
You see Ced over there trying
to pull that PYT?

176
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,725
MICHAEL: Oh, she bad as hell.

177
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,809
See, thinking like that,

178
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,019
you lose the game before you even step in.

179
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,270
What are you talking about?

180
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,647
I'ma go on and leave.

181
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,232
Hey.

182
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,319
She's crazy. And I don't like her knees.

183
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,696
Excuse me, Miss, I noticed
that you were...

184
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,698
(GROANS) Honestly, I couldn't care less

185
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,241
about whatever it is you have to say.

186
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,368
And I can appreciate that.

187
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,994
I just know that I've seen you here before

188
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,371
and you're usually so stunning...

189
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,164
And you'll always have those memories.

190
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,833
In fact, why don't you walk
away and pretend this...

191
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,502
I don't know what I did to
make you so defensive.

192
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,337
All I'm saying is, whatever it is,

193
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,880
it's no reason to let yourself
go, that's it.

194
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,548
Let myself go?

195
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,758
I didn't mean any disrespect...

196
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,176
Let me tell your tired ass something.

197
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Something's changed.

198
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,762
Usually, there's an aura,

199
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,430
there's a glint about you
that I'm not seeing.

200
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,682
And I don't know if it's a relationship

201
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,519
or if it's job related, it's just...

202
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,812
Is that it?

203
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,398
It's work related?

204
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,485
Well, to be honest,

205
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,030
I was laid off from my job
about two months ago.

206
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,115
This damn economy.

207
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,908
How'd it go? CEDRIC: Not good, man.

208
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,119
Yo, I literally have nothing
to say anymore.

209
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,328
I don't know what's going on.

210
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,913
And my breath ain't right. (GROANS)

211
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,540
Drink a beer. You smell it?

212
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,999
You can't let that steal your smile,

213
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,376
'cause that smile that I'm talking about,

214
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,461
that's gonna get you that
next CEO gig, you get it?

215
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,712
See now? See? You're smiling.

216
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,589
Now I'm smiling.

217
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,757
I'ma walk away from here like a fairy now,

218
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,925
'cause I'm all happy.

219
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,802
A fairy? (LAUGHS) Yeah.

220
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,470
Have a good evening.

221
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,721
Thank you.

222
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,933
Got shot down.

223
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,017
(MOUTHING) Two, one...

224
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,102
Wait.

225
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,983
She calling him back for another
episode of crazy.

226
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,401
Here.

227
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,862
She probably shot him down. Twice.

228
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,655
Crazy, right? Man.

229
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,116
Talking about Jesus and she don't
speak English and stuff, right?

230
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,284
Luck of mine.

231
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,452
She actually gave me her damn number.

232
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,536
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

233
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,580
The Dark Knight strikes again.

234
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,831
How great is Kristen, man?

235
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,915
Nice.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,083
She's a phenomenal girl.

237
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,668
I just don't understand why
she's with this dude.

238
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,503
CEDRIC: Nobody does. How
good is your credit?

239
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,839
It's up. Low 400s, 430?

240
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,966
Goddamn! A 430?

241
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,010
You can't even get a Discover Card!

242
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,636
Don't white people start off
with a 500 credit score?

243
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,181
Five-fifty, 475 if you're a mulatto.

244
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,599
GAIL: Cedric!

245
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,933
Yes, Gail.

246
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,602
Gail, listen to what I'm trying to say!

247
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,769
Gail, I don't care!

248
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,480
I don't care what you take out the garage!

249
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,898
Gail, you can take the whole damn garage.

250
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,649
Let me tell you something.
Here's what I want,

251
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,151
and this is what's... (PHONE BEEPS) Hello?

252
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
Gail?

253
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,570
Y'all, I swear...

254
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,447
She didn't let me finish my sentence.
I don't like that.

255
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,657
Hey, Ced. When's the divorce
gonna be final?

256
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,242
Goodness, if I had to guess,

257
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,203
I'd say like four weeks, 367 hours,

258
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,787
22 minutes, 32 seconds.

259
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,914
That's just a guess.

260
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,624
Who's counting? ZEKE: But you
know what we should do?

261
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,876
We should take Cedric out for
celebration game night.

262
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,336
I can't do Sunday. This Sunday,

263
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,421
dinner with my ma. Little
casserole action...

264
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,547
JEREMY: That's every Sunday.

265
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,009
I can't do Sunday either. Jonah's
got a violin recital.

266
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,470
My God, dude, your kid has
way too many recitals.

267
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,056
Wait a minute, hold on, wait.
Your son play the violin?

268
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,933
And the cello. Yo, he's gay.

269
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,017
Playing the violin doesn't make him gay.

270
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,185
Yes, it does.

271
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,353
Name me one gay violinist.

272
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,479
Your son.

273
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,647
Listen to this.

274
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,024
Cedric is about to be released from
the shackles of Gail-Hell.

275
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,109
Forever. And we're about
to miss it for what?

276
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,486
Another Jonah recital.

277
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,613
By the way, he sucks. BENNETT: Really?

278
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,448
I'd expect that from them, not you.

279
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,741
What do you mean, "them"?

280
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,034
Like what, like black people or what?

281
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,369
Absolutely.

282
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,412
I don't get mad because he's
bold enough to say it.

283
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,331
Seriously, you have ears. Kid's tone-deaf.

284
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,875
This is his big solo. They're
playing the Gap Band.

285
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,335
You know, Dropped a Bomb on Me,

286
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,128
and he's got the last...
(MIMICS PLAYING) "Baby!"

287
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,839
Look, I got a great idea. I'll
have my mom cook for us.

288
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,758
She'll make some chocolate chip
cookies, a big casserole.

289
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,926
We'll do it the right way.

290
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,970
Mike, I almost punched you in
your damn face just now, man.

291
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,096
And I was gonna add a head butt.

292
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,597
I'm not going over your mom house

293
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,974
to celebrate my damn divorce party!

294
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,141
We gotta eat. We can start there...

295
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,393
I don't wanna eat with your mom!

296
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,769
I ain't going over his mom house.

297
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,563
Look, she just got the new Tyler Perry,

298
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,189
For Colored Girls on Blu-ray.

299
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,774
We'll just have a nice
little fellas night,

300
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,984
a chill-out night.

301
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,152
Let me tell you what happens, Janet
Jackson gets AIDS at the end

302
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,697
and some crazy guy throws his kids
out the window. You good?

303
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,448
Can we party now? Let's do it! I hate you.

304
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,576
All right, put 'em up! Yes, sir.

305
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,912
Fine, I'm in, man.

306
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,416
Life is great, fellas.
May it never change.

307
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,501
CEDRIC: None of us could have known

308
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,919
that the first bomb had been dropped.

309
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,421
The war had been declared.

310
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,047
And hard-worn secrets

311
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,966
had now fallen into the
hands of the enemy.

312
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,010
We had been betrayed by one of our own.

313
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,219
A man.

314
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,971
I'm talking about a man with a penis.

315
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,723
Someone who should know better.

316
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,642
And because of those actions,
a blitz was now on its way,

317
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,228
that would affect my entire
Band of Brothers.

318
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,522
VICKI: We have another question
in the audience, Steve.

319
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,815
Steve, I keep hooking up with guys

320
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,025
who don't want a relationship.

321
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,443
Why don't you stop hooking up?

322
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,652
Did you hear that?

323
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,406
Listen, men respect women
who have standards.

324
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,699
Just get some.

325
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,534
Exactly.

326
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,745
WOMAN 2: Steve, I'm a partner
in my law firm,

327
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,996
I own my own home,

328
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,040
but I've been single for three years.

329
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,834
Why can't I seem to find a man
to live up to my standards?

330
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,961
Maybe you need to adjust
them a little bit.

331
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,963
Bullshit. VICKI: Are you saying
that we should settle?

332
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,633
Look, you make six figures.
Does he have to?

333
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,717
Yes.

334
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,136
You own your own home. Does he have to?

335
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,304
Yes and yes.

336
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,014
VICKI: We have another question
here in the audience.

337
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,642
Hi, Steve. I'm currently dating

338
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,934
and I just wanna know

339
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,436
when is the right time for me

340
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,064
to introduce my man to my kid? Oh!

341
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,775
I know that single women
don't want to have

342
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,818
a parade of men coming through the house.

343
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,070
Exactly! I get that.

344
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,197
But if a guy is a serious contender...
What up, Momma?

345
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,531
Excuse you?

346
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,492
...bring him in as soon as
possible. Morning, Mom.

347
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,494
Because if you invest six months in a man

348
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,329
and then you introduce him to the kids

349
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,916
and he's not feeling the
kids, or vice versa,

350
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,710
then guess what? You just
wasted six months.

351
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,754
That's true. Did that.

352
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,306
Alex?

353
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,686
Alex!

354
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,145
Wake up!

355
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,318
Look, babe, I got us two
double-shot lattes.

356
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,612
Thanks, baby. Here.

357
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,615
Figured we needed some caffeine
after last night.

358
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,576
It was amazing. Mmm-hmm.

359
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,039
I'm gonna go and freshen up.

360
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,668
So, I'll be right back.

361
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,545
I'll be right here.

362
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,424
Don't move.

363
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,633
Don't worry, I won't.

364
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,345
So, babe, I was thinking

365
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,514
maybe we could go on our first real date.

366
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,391
We could go see a movie? Yeah, babe.

367
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,517
We should do that.

368
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,186
Things between us are gonna start
getting real serious, baby.

369
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,107
MYA: Okay, so I was thinking maybe we could
go see the new Tyler Perry movie.

370
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,275
You know, the one where the guy's,

371
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,484
like, mean to his girlfriend,

372
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,653
and a nice guy comes and rescues her

373
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,864
and at the end, they both find Jesus.

374
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,368
Alex? So, yes to the Tyler Perry movie?

375
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Alex!

376
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,498
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

377
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,627
"Michelle"?

378
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,048
It's Mya, asshole!

379
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,967
Mya.

380
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,219
(SIGHS)

381
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,972
Did this nigga take my coffee?

382
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,724
CEDRIC: It was like some long-hidden truth

383
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,058
had finally been released

384
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,269
in hardcover and paperback.

385
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,188
For my book club.

386
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,898
For me! For my mom!

387
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,650
For the first time in their
lives, women all over

388
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,612
stopped turning to other women
for relationship advice.

389
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,821
Really?

390
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,072
I got one too many.

391
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Thank you.

392
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,494
Instead, they went straight
to a man, Steve Harvey.

393
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,996
He had made his name as a comedian,

394
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,372
but this shit here? This wasn't funny.

395
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,124
And because of this,

396
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,667
things would never be the same.

397
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,691
Excuse me?

398
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,443
Yeah, hi.

399
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,320
Hey, did you by any chance
go to Fairfax High?

400
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,780
Yes.

401
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,406
I went there as well. Michael Hanover.

402
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,408
Candace Hall. Yeah, I remember.

403
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,035
I had classes with your sister Lisa.

404
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,412
CASHIER: Next in line. I'm sorry,
I don't recognize you.

405
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,957
Well, yeah, I was, like, five feet tall,

406
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,291
99 pounds when we graduated.

407
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,627
I had the glasses and the buck teeth.

408
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,671
Oh. (LAUGHS)

409
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,339
That look familiar, maybe down here?

410
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,841
Yeah, you do.

411
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,552
I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing.

412
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,886
You dissing me already?

413
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,055
Well, you've grown up. Quite nicely.

414
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,558
And you haven't changed a
bit. You look amazing.

415
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,395
Well, you need to put those
glasses back on, obviously.

416
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,856
No, actually, I'm nearsighted.

417
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,900
Besides, I mean, how could
I forget my teenage crush?

418
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,945
I used to look at you
walk down the hallway

419
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,823
and just fall into your smile.

420
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,827
I'm rambling, I do that when
I get nervous. Mmm.

422
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,206
Well, it was nice meeting,
I mean, seeing you.

423
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,334
It's nice finally being seen.

Next in line, please.

425
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,303
Candace?

426
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,347
Could we go grab a cup of
coffee or something?

427
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,099
We could maybe catch up on
old times we never had.

428
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,352
I can't, actually. I have to pick up my...

429
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,770
Husband? No...

430
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,689
You got a boyfriend? No, I have a son.

431
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,025
Oh...

432
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,364
Well, how about dinner?

433
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,329
Yeah.

434
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,584
KRISTEN: I finally get it. GINA: Get what?

435
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,503
Getting Jeremy to propose is like getting
Jeremy to paint the kitchen

436
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,963
or put the toilet seat down.

437
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,508
It's not gonna happen until
I require him to.

438
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,344
And I haven't required him
to do a damn thing.

439
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,428
Hmm.

440
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,472
You know we still go halfsies
on everything?

441
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,890
I thought that was your idea.

442
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,141
Yeah, in college.

443
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,310
He was work study and
I felt sorry for him.

444
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,562
And I am still paying for it, to this day.

445

NIJA: Thank you. Six months.

449
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,655
Yeah, and we can't wait.

See, that is a man with a plan.

00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,914
He knows what he wants,
he knows what he has.

455
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,167
I sell beautiful homes for a living

456
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,169
and we live in a frat house for the boys.

457
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,588
Last Valentine's Day, the boys were there.

458
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,881
So, you're saying, you're...

459
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,675
My God, I'm one of the boys,

460
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,760
except I have a vagina!

I swear to God, Frodo Baggins
had it easier.

I'm sorry, who?

463
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,015
Frodo, from The Hobbit.

464
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,433
I don't do hobbits.

465
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,602
Right, no, me neither. That's so lame.

466
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,187
Jeremy had a chess set.

467
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,522
It's totally stupid.

468
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,773
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

469
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,441
You're gonna trick him into
giving you a ring?

470
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,737
I'm not gonna trick him. I'm
going to require him.

471
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,531
It's been nine years. Uh-huh.

472
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,533
So, what makes you think
it's gonna change now?

473
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,034
I've got some new information.

474
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,369
Oh, you do?

475
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,914
Yeah, because Steve says "Don't
hate the Player..."

476
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,041
Change the game.

477
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,252
BENNETT: It's your shot. Wait!

478
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,420
You gotta raise your left leg.

480
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,428
H-O, you're a ho.

481
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,721
Really? I'm a ho?

482
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,389
I've been with the same
woman for nine years.

483
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,391
I'm the Stedman Graham of
relationships, all right?

Bro, I'm not saying ho like "whore."

485
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,477
I'm saying ho,

486
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,729
like punk bitch that's been henpecked,

487
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,272
so he ain't got no more nuts,

488
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,481
'cause his girl runs the house. Oh!

489
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,900
Speaking of which, how's Kristen?
She's incredible.

490
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,070
We were up till 2:00 a.m. playing Call
ofDuty last night. She loved it.

491
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,156
She does it... She does it for you.

492
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,532
I know my woman, okay?

493
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,492
Fantasy? Science fiction? Action figures?

494
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,119
All the stuff I love, she loves, too.

495
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,162
No, she does that shit

496
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,913
for you, trust me. Deep down
inside, she's thinking...

497
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,791
This is some silly-ass shit.

498
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,169
What the hell?

499
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,004
No wonder Jeremy hasn't proposed yet,

500
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,297
he hasn't gone through puberty.

501
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,175
It's time for a little spring cleaning.

502
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,179
You first.

503
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,181
No, no. That's your problem, Gail.

504
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,183
You don't never want to listen,
you just want to talk.

505
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,851
What'd I say? I said I'm
gonna be there tomorrow.

506
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,270
No, no, no. Listen, Gail...

507
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,772
I'm not gonna go back and
forth with you. Oh, man.

508
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,357
'Cause I'm trying to talk and you ain't
gonna let me say what I... Hello?

509
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,734
Gail?

510
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,986
Did it again. Hung up on me again.

511
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,988
What do you call the three
rings of marriage?

512
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,198
No clue.

513
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,992
The engagement ring, the wedding
ring, and the suffer-ring.

514
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,952
Oh, and, in your case, the beat-ing.

515
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
This is not the time.

516
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,830
You know, y'all underestimate
me because I'm short.

517
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,998
No, it's 'cause you a fool.

518
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,875
What up? What's happening, baby?

519
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,502
The hell's wrong with you?

520
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,253
You're stoned. Yeah, you're high!

521
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,379
(GRUNTS)

522
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,422
Either you're high,

523
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,382
or everything on my eHarmony
profile is true.

524
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,884
I'm high off life, gentlemen.

525
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,636
I met this girl.

526
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,889
No, matter of fact, she's not even a girl.

527
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,349
I met a woman.

528
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,017
But you are a woman.

529
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,482
Order up!

530
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,485
Hey, guess who's back. Table eight.

531
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,780
(EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH)

532
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,824
She is way out of your league, Dom.

533
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,826
Ain't no such thing, playboy.

534
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,036
All right, she probably spends
more here in one night

535
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,496
than you make in a month.

536
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,082
That's true, but, you know,

537
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,042
just think how much she'll
save if I cook for her.

538
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,335
Oh, you crazy.

539
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,087
Dominic. Scallions?

540
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,839
All right, Chef, coming up.

541
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,923
Well, you look cute. What's going on?

542
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,007
I do?

543
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,093
Yes. Thank you, that was nice of you.

544
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,845
Just, you know, Duke made Little League,

545
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,429
got a new laptop, met a guy.

546
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,723
I think I'm gonna try the white sea bass.

547
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Met a what?

548
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,726
A guy.

549
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,186
A real one? Not a blow-up doll?

550
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,730
Okay, don't look so surprised.
It's not that...

551
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,357
Honey, I'm just saying,

552
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,025
it's been two years since your divorce.

553
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,695
And three, maybe four, since you had sex.

554
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,446
I said I met a guy, Lauren,

555
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,031
I didn't say I was changing my last name.

556
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,199
Yet.

557
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,536
I need all the details,
honey. Now. Spill it.

558
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,955
Is she hot? Whoo! Pure fire.

559
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,123
Does she got real big titties?

560
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
Yeah, what's the rack like?
Tell us about the rack.

561
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,544
The rack. Definitely some white boy shit.

562
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,713
It is white boy shit. We love breasts.

563
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,715
You're not even white,
Bennett. You're clear.

564
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,134
He's got kind eyes. Soulful. Yes!

565
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,302
He's sensitive.

566
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,887
I know she got a fat ass.

567
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,556
She got that JLo, Serena Williams mash up.

568
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,350
Ass so big, I could hide underneath
it if it was raining.

569
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,060
That's way too much ass. No such thing.

570
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,770
Damn right, it ain't. The
bigger, the better.

571
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,232
But it wasn't just a physical attraction,

572
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,609
it was intellectual.

573
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,236
He loved The Immortal Life
of Henrietta Lacks.

574
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,072
He bought one for his mom's book
club. Isn't that sweet?

575
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,532
Yeah, and kind of gay.

576
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,617
He's a gentleman.

577
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,036
Yo, she a ho. I know she a
ho. Oh, definitely a ho.

578
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,871
Both of you, you both watch
your mouth, all right?

579
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,414
This one's not a ho.

580
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,624
She's a lady.

581
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,876
JEREMY: Whipped already. CEDRIC:
Enjoy it while it lasts, Mike.

582
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,920
Let me tell you something, it
ain't gonna last forever.

583
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,379
They all start out happy.

584
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,089
See, but here's when it gets real.

585
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,217
When you wake up in the morning,
and you go in the living room,

586
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,594
and you catch her pissing
inside of your Jordans.

587
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,054
And not the regular Jordans.

588
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,014
I'm talking about the ones with
the patent leather on the side,

589
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,224
where the pee don't come out.

590
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,434
Don't listen to them, Mike. Relationships
are beautiful.

591
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,602
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

592
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,354
Just saying. So, when are
you guys going out?

593
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,563
Saturday night.

594
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,565
She got to find a sitter,
first, and then...

595
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,775
What, like a dog sitter?

596
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,109
No, she has a son.

597
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,778
What? She has a child.

598
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,446
All right, well, be careful
dating a baby mama.

599
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,530
Why?

600
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,115
Because she's the baby mama.

601
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,450
Dude, she ain't looking
for a couple laughs

602
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,618
and some butt-naked sex.

603
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,453
She been a couple laughs
and some butt-naked sex.

604
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,996
Preach. She looking for a husband.

605
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,206
A father for her son.

606
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,499
Speaking of which, where's the baby daddy?

607
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,459
Oh, good question, Zeke. Thank you.

608
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,543
JEREMY: Could be a psycho.

609
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,629
Just got paroled for killing
her last boyfriend.

610
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,090
Or he could be one of those guys
that like to hide in a bush

611
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,258
waiting for a strange guy

612
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,509
to come to his baby mom's house.

613
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,970
And when he gets there,
he pops out the bushes

614
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,972
hits this guy on the back
of the head with a brick.

615
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,223
Without even realizing

616
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,308
that this guy's relationship with
his baby mom was platonic.

617
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,810
They ever catch that guy?

618
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,103
No, it's a cold case.

619
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,688
The cops won't even revisit the case.

620
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,022
They said they couldn't find the brick.

621
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,609
I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

622
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,112
None of that matters. ZEKE: Really?

623
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,531
'Cause you should see her smile.

624
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,284
Oh, shit. All right! Okay.
Good night, Mike.

625
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,535
CEDRIC: Talking to you about bricks!

626
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,828
You wanna go talk about a smile.

627
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,204
There is one thing, though.

628
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,622
I knew it, he was born a woman.

629
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,749
No. (GIGGLING)

630
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,710
He's, you know, he's... He's what?

631
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,961
A little younger.

632
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,671
You have kidnapped a cub, haven't you?

633
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,839
No, I'll have you know,

634
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,257
he seems very mature, actually.

635
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,425
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,010
Wait a minute, why am I
getting all worked up?

637
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,303
We haven't even had a date yet.

638
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,847
I still need to qualify if
he's even a contender.

639
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,265
Qualify?

640
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,766
You know, like... What are
his long-term goals?

641
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,685
What are his short-term
goals? Can he provide?

642
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,478
Don't hit him with all that at once.

643
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,690
I know, don't worry. I
intend to be stealth.

644
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,692
You? How?

645
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,405
By acting like a lady, but
thinking like a man.

646
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,699
Oh, you fell for that sexist crap?

647
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,035
He's actually giving insight
into a man's perspective.

648
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,162
Why should I have to lower my standards

649
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,580
to get a man? Who does that?

650
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,206
I'm sorry. Now, what man?

651
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,583
I just want my equal.

652
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,377
Okay? Or at least an attractive,
cultured man.

653
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,296
Who's over six feet tall,
makes six figures,

654
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,882
and isn't intimidated by my success.

655
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,301
Okay, girl. Quit chasing the ghost
of James Merrill's past.

656
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,386
He is married and long gone.

657
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,596
Mmm. That man was fine.

658
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,057
Here we go. Let's do a
little research, here.

659
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,184
Ah! This is you. Please, I don't...

660
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,728
"Strong, independent, and lonely women."

661
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,481
I don't need some bald-headed
man on a book

662
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,232
telling me I am strong and independent.

663
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Honey, that's a given.

664
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,610
But you forgot lonely.

665
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,070
You are a bitch.

666
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,404
You're too strong, Lauren.

667
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,656
There's no such thing as too strong.

668
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,866
And you know what?

669
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,659
If I were a man,

670
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,287
being the youngest COO of
a Fortune 500 company

671
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,789
would actually be a good thing.

672
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,123
Women would flock.

673
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,042
Yeah, but men flee when
you lead with that.

674
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,794
And it's not just your job, Lauren.

675
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,171
Remember what Marcel said
on your last date,

676
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,297
after you trumped his wine choice?

677
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,423
It was a better choice.

678
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,633
What were his words again?

679
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,928
"You don't need a man, Lauren,
you are a man."

680
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,889
Happy belated birthday. For you.

681
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,559
I'm just saying, all this
waiting for better?

682
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,769
It's making you bitter.

683
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,441
Hey, babe?

684
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,612
I stopped off for a beer, but
picked us up some dinner.

685
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,947
Oh!

686
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,031
Oh, my God.

687
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,952
Oh, my God! My anime posters!
We got robbed!

688
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,746
Kris! Are you home?

689
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,623
Yes. Where's the fire? What's going on?

690
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,291
Have you not noticed that
we've been robbed?

691
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,585
I just tidied up a little bit. Relax.

692
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,587
Tidied up? Yeah.

693
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,631
Justice League? Darth Vader? SpongeBob?

694
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,966
Where are they? Are they okay?

695
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,801
They are safe. They're fine.

696
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,885
(SIGHS)

697
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,847
I just thought we could
paint the living room.

698
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,390
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

699
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,516
Paint.

700
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,144
Okay. And redecorate.

701
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,605
Redecorate? Yeah.

702
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,982
I thought you loved that stuff.

703
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,400
Why would you want to do that?

704
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,527
Because it looks like we live
in a frat house, Jeremy.

705
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,612
Oh, stop it. We are adults,
for Christ's sakes.

706
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,864
We make a decent living.

707
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,158
I think it's time to invest
and make this a real home.

708
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,494
With matching dishes and glasses

709
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,290
and a new couch.

710
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,167
Well, what's wrong with my couch?

711
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,463
Baby, you pulled it out of a dumpster.

712
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,630
Yeah.

713
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,383
I'm pretty sure Annalisa was impregnated,
like, right there.

714
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,260
It's got cigarette burns, bong spills,

715
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,803
there was the scabies scare of '06.

716
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,346
You're being dramatic. No, I'm really not.

717
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,432
Your aunt who tinkles when she laughs?

718
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,476
She pissed all over the
couch last Christmas.

719
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,686
It's disgusting. We're like animals.

720
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,564
I cleaned up the bong spill
and the cigarette burns.

721
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,024
This couch has history.

722
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,193
And now it is history.

723
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,113
So, here are some new ideas.

724
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,741
I thought we could look it over.

725
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,451
Research some new styles.

726
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,203
Gotta zero in on a color palette.

727
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,331
I know you like mauve. You know?

728
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,708
There was that period you went through,

729
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,335
where you were partial to salmon.

730
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,129
Yeah, I'd rather watch Letters
to Juliet with you again.

731
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,757
I know you would. 'Cause you cried
at the end when they got reunited.

732
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,592
I wasn't crying, okay?

733
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,303
I was having an allergic reaction
to the perfume in the theater.

734
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,387
You bought the soundtrack.

735
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,473
It's a good soundtrack.

736
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,226
Look, I'm really bad at this. Okay?

737
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,685
Please, can you do this?

738
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,187
Without me? Really?

739
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,897
Really.

740
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,232
By myself?

741
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,192
Yeah.

742
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,445
I trust you. Awesome.

743
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,821
MYA: Okay, let me ask you a question.

744
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,908
Where is the last guy that you slept
with in less than 90 days?

745
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,076
You mean, John?

746
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,285
Hey! Baby!

747
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,620
'Sup, girl?

748
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,247
Hey, I had a great time the other night.

749
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,414
Oh, did you, Alex?

750
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,874
Yeah, Melanie. I was gonna call you...

751
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,418
Melanie? It's Mya, negro.

752
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,462
Yeah. I gotta go. So, I'll call you.

753
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,423
I know you did not just call her Melanie.

754
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,759
It's okay. I'm not even gonna
let him get to me.

755
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,095
(SIGHS) I am in a better place
and I am on another level.

756
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,182
I don't know, Sonia. I feel
like I have X-ray vision.

757
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,850
Like, Man Goggles.

758
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,686
You know, we spend all
this time complaining

759
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,479
about how guys don't want
to be in relationships,

760
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,814
they just want to hook up.

761
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,732
But really, all along,
we've had the power.

762
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,026
Right. We have?

763
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,904
Yes! We control the cookie.

764
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,781
She who controls the cookie
controls the game.

765
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,826
Oh, okay, I got it. What's the cookie?

766
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,787
It's a metaphor. For what?

767
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,372
For...

768
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,917
Oh. (GASPS) Oh!

769
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,128
Yes. The cookie! The cookie!

770
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,379
I got it. The cookie!

771
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,298
MYA: I'm telling you, the
power's in the cookie.

772
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,675
So, how do we control the cookie?

773
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,427
By putting it in the cookie jar,

774
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,971
clasping the lid on tight,
and leaving it in there.

775
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,139
Okay.

776
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,058
Until some little boy actually
grows up and earns it.

777
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,184
I get it.

778
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
It's kind of like when my cousin
had the five-date rule.

779
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,354
It was similar to that.

780
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,647
Oh, no. That's child's play.

781
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,733
I'm thinking something a
little bit more radical.

782
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,234
See, this is why you need to get the book,

783
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,861
because it has a whole chapter on it.

784
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,822
"Getting The Respect That You
Deserve: The 90-Day Rule."

785
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,948
Are you high?

786
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,950
No. Who is waiting 90 days?

787
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,411
If it's good enough for the
Fortune 500 company,

788
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,787
it's good enough for me.

789
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,581
See, when I worked at Ford Motor Company,

790
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,666
there was a 90-day probation rule.

791
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,835
I had to be on the job for 90 days

792
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,503
before they gave me a benefit package.

793
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,798
Ford figured this, "Let's
see how he performs.

794
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,926
"If he comes in on time,
if he proves himself,

795
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,845
"then we'll give him benefits."

796
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,640
So if Ford Motor Company waits 90 days

797
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,975
to pass out their benefit package,

798
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,685
why won't women wait?

799
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,895
You see, that's our problem.

800
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,647
It's that we keep giving it away

801
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,440
to some Axe body spray wearing man-ho

But it doesn't matter, because
a girl's got needs.

Listen to yourself.

Do you really think you
could wait 90 days?

806
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,659
Yes. I spent six months dreaming

807
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,702
about a guy that I met once
at a wedding weekend.

808

The one you had sex with at the beach?

Yes, who never called.

810
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, so, I definitely think
I could do 90 days.

811
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,211
Matter of fact, I could do
90 days before 90 days.

812
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,962
I am so sick and tired of men.

813
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,506
Maybe I should start dating women.

814
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,966
My God, I'll give you 50
bucks if you guys kiss.

I ask myself that same question every day.

820
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,604

Absolutely. And thank you for asking.

We would like... Why?

825
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,616
Is it that you crave scintillating
conversation?

826
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,159
Or that you want to discuss the politics

827
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,577
and nuances of the Chechnyan War?

828

You know, I don't really discuss
politics on the first encounter.

you wanted to get into my pants?

have to lie. You omit.

00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,124
you're not driving it 'cause
it's in the shop.

you tattoo your name in that ass,

then you tell her the truth.

Gail thought I was an account executive

945
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,301
and I met her in the mail room.

946

I had mail in my hand.

947
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,012
Yeah, but you became an account
exec right after that.

she didn't. Thomas did.

put up with anything.

953
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,023
Trust me.

954
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,359
Only if you're putting it on her right.

955
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,361
All right. That's...

956
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,654
Come on, man.

957
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,738
I'm gonna go clean the ball off.

958
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,823
MICHAEL: Bennett, just wipe it off.

00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,376
No, I mean, like your future, Jeremy.

1122
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,796
What are your long-term goals, Jeremy?

1123
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,009
Who are you, Oprah?

1124
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,096
You're funny. (LAUGHING)

1125
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,726
I just have this amazing idea
of a rocker, chic kinda look,

1126
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,395
so, it's really exciting.

1127
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,105
No, that is exciting. Yeah.

1128
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,314
Yeah.

1129
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,816
So, um,

1130
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,695
what are some of your long-term goals?

1131
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,823
Kind of a fly-by-the-seat- of-your-pants
kinda guy, you know?

1132
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,992
Oh, okay.

1133
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,911
That's cool.

1134

1135
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,334
Oh, turn that up. Turn
that up, turn that up.

1136
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,962
That is my... Yeah.

1137
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,755
You know these guys?

1138
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,340
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1139
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,343
(LAUGHS) My band opened for them once.

1140
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,429
You have a band?

1141
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,638
Had.

1142
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,891
Had a record deal for a second.

1143
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,143
Let me hear your CD. Come on!

1144
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,270
What makes you think that I have a CD?

1145
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,564
I don't know anybody who's
been in an R&B band

1146
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,857
who doesn't have their
own CD in their car.

1147
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,277
Wow, I feel so unique right
now, it's crazy.

1148
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,321
That's why you're reaching for it. Yeah.

1149
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,948
Let me see it.

1150
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,743
Wow!

1151
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,119
That is crazy.

1152

I want you to meet my mother.

I'd like you to meet my son.

1197
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,831
I would love that.

1198

00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,894
Good night. Thank you.

00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,264

but with a twist,

1241
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,695
because I used the ingredients
from your Thai takeouts.

1242
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,988

1247
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,375

You let yourself in again, huh?

1260
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,460
I didn't expect you to be here.

1261
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,086
I figured you'd be tiptoeing
around her place.

1262
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,547
Well, first of all, I live here, not you,

1263
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,925
and second, she has this five-date rule

1264
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,176

1265

Five dates?

1268
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,432
What, is she some type of Farrakhan
Muslim or something?

1269
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,600
She's a diva.

1270
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,851
She literally refuses to
walk through a door

1271
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,977
unless I open it for her.

1272
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,354
Gail used to do that.

1273
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,855
Gail used to get on my nerves with that.

1274
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,858
"Get the door for me. How am I walk
in and you ain't open the door?"

1275
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,778
"My hands hurt. You better
open that goddamn door!"

1276
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,029
That's why I'm gonna end it right now.

1277
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,155
Yeah, you need to.

1278
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,281
'Cause you don't need her.

1279
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,741
You got me, and what we got is special.

1280
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,660
Open her door. (SCOFFS)

1281
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,538
It's 2012. Come around and open my door.

1282
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,373
I don't know, Sonia, I just felt
like a different woman.

1283
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,417
I felt so in control and strong, and...

1284
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,794
What about him?

1285
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,920
Well, I think...

1286
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,129
Oh.

1287
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,633
It's him.

1288
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,970
"Are you available for dinner
tomorrow night?"

1289
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,096
Well, are you?

1290
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,848
Well, I do believe that I am.

1291
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,476
But I do not go out with guys
who ask me via text.

1292
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,729
She trippin'.

1293
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,815
You know, Gail always suggested
them egg whites,

1294
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,275
she said they was better for you.

1295
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,819
Hey, can you put a shirt on
while you cooking, man?

1296
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,487
(WHOOPS)

1297
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,738
Look at these hours.

1298
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,866
What you come in here glowing
for like you're pregnant?

1299
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,242
My boys.

1300
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,871
Hey, you got some. Oh! On the first date?

1301
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,997
Homie scored.

1302
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,707
DOMINIC: Yeah, I did.

1303
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,084
And I'm totally screwed.

1304
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,627
We never once talked about my job.

1305
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,338
You really like him. I really do.

1306
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,883
I don't even know how much he makes.

1307
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,051
Whoa! And you know what? I don't care!

1308
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,720
I believe in his dreams.

1309
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,847
She thinks I'm a chef on the rise.

1310
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,056
With a cold-ass Benz.

1311
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,850
And a sexy limo driver. I
looked good last night,

1312
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,184
I had the hat cocked to the side.

1313
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,104
Guys, she's going to run when
I tell her the truth.

1314
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,106
Whatever you do, you don't
tell her the truth.

1315
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,232
Thank you. You delay.

1316
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,192
Hell, I wouldn't tell her until
she was in her third trimester.

1317
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,986
Yeah, I can't do that. ZEKE:
Dom, I know you, okay?

1318
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,529
And you're trying to grow
a conscience here.

1319
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,864
Trust me on this one.

1320
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,365
Honesty is overrated, man.

1321
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,409
Hey, that's in the Bible. Old Testament.

1322
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,787
I just don't want a relationship
based on lies.

1323
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,122
That's called marriage.

1324
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,832
Dom, you don't fool me.

1325
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,459
I know what this is about.
This is about sex.

1326
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,210
You didn't do what you were supposed
to do in the bedroom.

1327
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,378
That's why you walk through here

1328
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,713
with your shoulders all slouched

1329
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,381
and your self-esteem all low.

1330
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,133
It's true. When you don't smash right,

1331
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,509
the insecurities come out on you.

1332
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,386
You know what he did? He gave it a LD.

1333
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,888
Lazy Doodle. That's exactly what he did.

1334
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,307
Right. You gotta put it down
like the right enforcement.

1335
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,185
I can't do this no more. I'm
done. I'm done with this.

1336
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,354
Like, dude, put a shirt on. It's us!

1337
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,439
There's no one else here, just us!

1338
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,233
So, you're telling me she's got a son?

1339
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,277
Yeah! Duke. He's six years old.

1340
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,737
An amazing kid, full of energy.

1341
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,948
That's an awful lot of
responsibility, baby.

1342
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,116
Well, she's a really responsible
woman, Ma.

1343
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,285
I'm not talking about her,
I'm talking about you.

1344
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,580
You really think you got what it takes

1345
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,123
to date a single mother?

1346
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,417
Well, I was raised by a single
mother, wasn't I?

1347
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,502
(CHUCKLES)

1348
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,796
Oh, but I'm one of a kind, baby.

1349
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,549
Trust me, Ma. You are going to love her.

1350
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,802
(MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1351
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,345
Thank God!

1352
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,931
Somewhere familiar.

1353
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,265
Some place that hasn't changed,

1354
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,433
that still looks the same.

1355
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,310
Yo, J, what's wrong with you?

1356
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,437
My Fortress of Solitude has morphed

1357
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,064
into a damn Bed, Bath and Beyond.

1358
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,232
What does that mean?

1359
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,441
I'm telling you, he talks in code.

1360
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,402
Listen, Kristen, she redecorated.

1361
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,362
CEDRIC: Redecorated? Why
didn't you say that?

1362
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,072
No, no, no, she didn't redecorate.

1363
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,407
She obliterated.

1364
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,368
Every trace of my identity,
gone! My anime posters,

1365
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,412
Battlestar Galactica shot glasses
that you used to like,

1366
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,705
it's all gone.

1367
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,914
May I?

1368
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,165
Wait a minute. She ain't even ask you?

1369
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,458
She just threw your stuff out?

1370
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,711
That's some takeover shit right
there. That's crazy.

1371
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,046
I was starting to feel like someone else.

1372
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,550
Someone warm and modern with
a smattering of vintage.

1373
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,969
That's probably your lips
tingling. It's a STD.

1374
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,762
You just put your mouth on Zeke's drink.

1375
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,723
Oh! And she threw away
my couch! Thank God!

1376
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,391
(ALL CHEER)

1377
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,976
Hail Kristen!

1378
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,310
That couch has a lot of memories, guys.

1379
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,395
CEDRIC: Is that what that smell was?

1380
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,980
Yeah, all of us got laid on that couch.

1381
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,106
Twice.

1382
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,691
You've had that couch since
college, right? Yes!

1383
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,900
That's some white boy shit.

1384
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,277
No, that's some Jeremy shit.

1385
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,403
ZEKE: No, that's some white boy shit.

1386
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,613
I graduated college, I
got rid of my couch.

1387
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,948
What college did you go to?

1388
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,784
DeVry, Class of February. Valedictorian.

1389
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,994
Whose side are you on?

1390
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,163
Ain't no brother on the planet
gonna let no fine-ass sista

1391
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,914
sit on no stinky-ass couch from college.

1392
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,958
Preach, boy! It don't matter what happen,

1393
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,376
you go and you find a way
to get that furniture,

1394
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,627
figure how to pay for it later.

1395
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,422
Yeah, don't do that, though. That's called
negro shit. Don't ever do that.

1396
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,673
BENNETT: That is negro shit!

1397
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,799
You guys do that a lot.

1398
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,967
You pay for something you can't afford.

1399
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,470
Ced, you couldn't even
afford your wedding!

1400
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,180
I'm making my payments.

1401
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,431
Listen, Kristen is a great girl.

1402
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,100
Don't mess up something good over
a damn couch, all right?

1403
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,685
Something's up.

1404
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,771
CEDRIC: The game was on,

1405
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,397
but not the one we were watching.

1406
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,399
While we were sitting there on our asses

1407
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,609
watching the game,

1408
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,235
our team was getting destroyed.

1409
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,571
The other team was drawing up plays,

1410
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,031
planning their strategies,

1411
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,325
and plotting their next moves.

1412
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,786
Hey, you.

1413
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,329
JEREMY: You still up?

1414
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,872
I thought you were sleeping.

1415
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,084
I couldn't put this down.

1416
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,293
Mmm. Yeah.

1417
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,879
CEDRIC: Jeremy didn't even
know he was under attack.

1418
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,715
Hey, uh... God, it was such a trip.

1419
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,259
I ran into Sarah's little brother. Oh.

1420
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,845
And he told me he got a job at Neversoft.

1421
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,306
Cool.

1422
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,474
Yeah.

1423
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,602
Weren't you offered an
internship there once?

1424
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,480
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Turned it
down for a real job.

1425
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,983
Right, yeah, that junior level
one that you're still in.

1426
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,485
What?

1427
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
(SIGHS)

1428
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,867
CEDRIC: My brothers didn't even
know they were at war.

1429
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,954
They were lost in the honeymoon phase.

1430
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,705
They were too busy enjoying the ride.

1431
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,958
All right, who's hungry?

1432
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,293
I'm hungry, but, babe, babe!

1433
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,920
Damn! Look at that ass!

ZEKE: That's nice. She's hot.

1435
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,589
Guys, come on, that's somebody's daughter.

1436
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,091
Wait, that's the baby mama?

1437
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,425
Mmm-hmm. That's Candace?

1438
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,718
That is Candace.

1439
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,220
I know the baby mama.

three times a week at the Y,

1442

most successful guy he knows.

Really? (LAUGHS) You scored!

I did well? You know what,

a really amazing chef.

CEDRIC: For Zeke, the cookie
crumbled on Thursday.

1598
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:04,062
So, the night is young.
What do you wanna do?

1599
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,358
Well, it is our fifth date, right?

1600
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,571
It is? I don't know, I lost count.

1601
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,740
Did you really?

1602
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,908
(CHUCKLES)

1603
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,245
So, nightcap?

1604
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,081
Okay.

1605
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,043
Yeah.

1606
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,337
So it's kind of small,

1607
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,173
but I really got it for the French windows

1608
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,551
and 'cause it's close to work.

1609
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,386
So...

1610
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,804
Stunning.

1611
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,015
Um...

1612
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,102
Yeah, maybe we should
get more comfortable.

1613
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,479
Yeah.

1614
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,813
Yeah. Yeah.

1615
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:47,898
Um...

1616
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,776
I'm gonna put on some music.

1617
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,861
Or you know what?

1618
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,948
Better yet, maybe you should
go ahead and choose.

1619
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,574
Cool.

1620
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,118
That vinyl?

1621
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,788
Yeah, I'm a bit of a purist.

1622
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,958
I'll be right back. Okay.

1623
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,626
Don't leave. I mean...

1624
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,462
Don't leave.

1625
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,673
I won't leave. Okay. All right.

1626
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,138
Wow. You really are a purist.

1627
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,517
How the hell did you get this on vinyl?

1628
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,893
No.

CEDRIC: See, Zeke found out the hard way

1637
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,966
that sometimes, a nightcap
means just that,

1638
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,217
a nightcap.

1639
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,635
Three shots of Jack.

Oh, Ced, what you run outta this time?

1644
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,691
I ain't had no milk.

1645
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,444
Hey, let me ask you a serious question.

1646
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,112
You think I look like Idris Elba?

1647
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,906
'Cause the stripper down at the new club
Sweaty Crack told me that last night,

1648
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,325
but I had a lot of ones in my hand,

1649
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,743
so I don't know if she was
trying to play me or not.

1650
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,411
Don't even answer. Don't worry about it.

1651
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,204
'Cause it made me feel
good when she said it.

1652
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,123
All right, looks like somebody
got invited in.

1653
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,374
How'd it go?

1654
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,500
We had coffee.

1655
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,544
And? Mint Milano Cookies.

1656
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,795
And?

1657
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,631
And we talked and we talked

1658
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,008
about our childhoods and art and music,

1659
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,926
and Plato's Allegory of the Cave.

1660
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,386
What is Plato's Allegory of the Cave?

1661
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,721
It's actually very profound.

1662
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,765
On par with Bishop Don Magic Juan book

1663
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,183
of pimp knowledge and street wisdom,

1664
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,517
which is a very good read.

1665
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,144
Five dates and all I get
is a cup of coffee.

1666
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,354
What is wrong with her?

1667
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,064
Ain't nothing wrong with her.
What's wrong with you?

1668
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,192
Looks like the old Negro Gigolo
is losing his flow.

1669
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,194
I'm in a relationship without sex,

1670
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,696
when all I'm really trying to get
is sex without a relationship.

1671
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,031
So, when you gonna see her again?

1672
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,908
Saturday night, nigga. Mind your business.

1673
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,243
Nice job.

1674
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,621
Hey, Zeke, when you go upstairs,

1675
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,789
you gonna look in the toilet,

1676
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,415
it's gonna appear to be stopped up,

1677
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,541
I don't know for sure.

1678
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,126
I just didn't know where the plunger was,

1679
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,170
so don't be caught off
guard when you see it.

1680
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,296
There's a lot.

1681
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,590
So we stayed up all night... SONIA: Okay.

1682
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,717
...and we talked about everything.

1683
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,177
Did you keep the cookie in the cookie jar?

1684
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,553
(CHUCKLES)

1685
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,472
But of course. Nice.

1686
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,265
I'm not gonna lie, though,
and say that it was easy.

1687
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,267
I don't know, when he kissed me,

1688
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,435
it was like sex.

1689
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,189
So, yeah, thank you for your
advice on the undies.

1690
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,357
Which ones did you wear?

1691
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,943
The granny ones. The grandma drawers?

1692
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,986
I told you the ugly panty
trick would work.

1693
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,738
You wasn't trying to listen
now. And it worked.

1694
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,824
Now that it's not just a theory,

1695
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,243
do you really think you can last 90 days?

1696
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,619
Monique!

1697
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,037
It's Mya!

1698
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,288
Call me!

1699
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,958
It's Mya, asshole!

1700
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,170
Yeah.

1701
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,674
Yeah, I think I can definitely
do 74 more days.

1702
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,342
Okay, Monique.

1703
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,512
LAUREN: I'm canceling the date. Why?

1704
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,472
He's a part-time waiter.

1705
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,349
May I remind you, Miss Thing,

1706
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,184
that we were both waitresses

1707
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,687
for two years at Olive Garden?

1708
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,647
Candace, we were in college.

1709
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,941
I'm talking about a grown-ass man,

1710
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,695
who admitted that he was valet-parking
the Benz he chased me down in.

1711
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,280
It's kind of romantic.

1712
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,031
It's kind of pathetic.

1713
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,616
I thought you didn't care
about how much he made.

1714
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,201
I thought you believed in his dreams.

1715
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,578
But not his pipe dreams. Come on!

1716
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,829
Okay, fine.

1717
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,415
Dump the first guy who puts
you before anything else

1718
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,624
because he doesn't make six figures.

1719
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,294
Please, he doesn't even make four.

1720
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,546
And I can't invest that kind
of time in something

1721
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,840
that I know won't yield
tangible dividends.

1722
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,216
Would you listen to yourself?

1723
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,553
Dominic is a person, Lauren,
not a stock portfolio.

1724
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,305
Like Steve Harvey says,

1725
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,348
there's no such thing as the perfect man.

1726
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,058
You have to compromise on something.

1727
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,351
What do you have to lose?

1728
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,187
My youth.

1729
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,646
So, wait. She just canceled on you?

1730
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,982
She was about to. Then she got
interrupted by her boss.

1731
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,984
It's messed up. You know what?

1732
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,737
Who needs her whole fancy presentation

1733
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,322
and her board of directors?

1734
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,699
I make an honest living
and I pay my taxes.

1735
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,909
Most of the time.

1736
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,535
Let me tell you something,
Dom. I agree with you.

1737
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,704
I'm an American, too and I agree
with your plight, brother.

1738
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:13,830
ZEKE: I second that.

1739
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,248
JEREMY: Yeah, we got your back.

1740
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,042
ZEKE: What's good with you, Mike? What up?

1741
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,877
So, how did it go between
Candace and your mom?

1742
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,170
It was...

1743
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,546
CANDACE: I'm slowing things
down with Michael.

1744
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,589
LAUREN: Why?

1745
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,508
He already has a woman in his life.

1746
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,426
Oh, that son of a bitch. Who is it?

1747
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,677
His mama.

1748
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,887
What? Ew.

1749
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,180
Ew.

1750
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,892
My mom thinks she's nice.

1751
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,143
Yeah, right.

1752
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,354
No woman has ever been good
enough for your mom.

1753
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,398
You think the first one she gonna
root for is the baby mama?

1754
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,359
Good luck with that. CANDACE:
Listen to this.

Let me get some chicken. Let me
get some chicken! (LAUGHING)

1910
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,575
Stop. And the onions,

1911
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,536
you know I love the sautéed
onions, and the cornbread.

1912
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,037
I know. I'm gonna get you a plate,

1913
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,497
but clear all this off, first.

1914
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,706
All right, all right.

1915
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,834
And make sure that sweet potato pie...

1916
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,878
LORETTA: I will, little boy,
you just clear the counter.

1917
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,672
Mom, what is this?

1918
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,133
That's that book by that big-head boy

1919
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,176
that's on that Family Feud thing.

1920
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,011
Act Like something, Think
Like something else.

1921
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,221
It's the new read for my book club.

1922
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,056
CEDRIC: Every war has its turning point.

1923
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,560
In the Civil War, it was the
Battle of Gettysburg.

1924
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,271
World War Il,

1925
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,022
it was the Invasion of Normandy.

1926
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,401
The definitive turning point in this war

1927
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,735
was that night at Loretta's house.

1928
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,112
It was like finding the Holy Grail.

1929
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,115
Jeremy. Tell them to turn the bus around.

1930
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,992
CEDRIC: The power had just
shifted in our favor.

1931
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,285
But we didn't know that yet.

1932
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,203
"Why Men Do What They Do."
Look at this, guys.

1933
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,872
Steve Harvey is a traitor.

1934
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,624
Hey, look, "Mama's Boys."
Chapter 7. That's you.

1935
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:32,876
I'm not a Mama's Boy.

1936
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,210
Jer, you don't think I'm
a Mama's Boy, do you?

1937
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,712
Nah. ZEKE: Listen to this.

1938
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,297
"Men respect standards, get some."

1939
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,882
I prefer my women not to have standards.

1940
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,133
In fact, if I've got to choose,

1941
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,843
I'm gonna choose the woman
who has no standards.

1942
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,596
Hold up. "Until a man achieves his
goals, or is on the road to,

1943
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,806
"you will never be number
one in his life."

1944
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,308
See, that's not even true.

1945
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,059
I've achieved absolutely nothing

1946
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,477
and I still put my women first.

1947
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,396
This is sick. It's brainwashing,
I'm telling you.

1948
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,523
She's trying to push me towards my dreams

1949
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,192
and help me accomplish my goals.

1950
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,526
Why would she do this?

1951
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,944
Shit, at least you're getting some.

1952
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,821
Ninety days, that's not a probation,

1953
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,072
that's a death sentence.

1954
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,449
CEDRIC: Hell, yeah, I want
to taste your yams.

1955
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,826
Hey, Mike, how old is your mom?

1956
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,952
What?

1957
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:09,412
No, not like that.

1958
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,623
No, it is. It is like
that. How old is she?

1959
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,083
I come in the house, she's like, "You
want to eat?" I said, "Eat what?"

1960
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,585
Yo, first of all, put my plate down

1961
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:16,794
and stop hitting on my mom, man.

1962
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,463
Don't get mad at me! I don't
even wanna be here.

1963
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,590
Y'all the ones that wanna be here,
I want to go to the strip club!

1964
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:21,925
Man, wrap this up.

1965
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,177
I got a bunch of ones, and
somebody gonna get them.

1966
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,931
Ms. Loretta! I'm ready for
the rest of the tour.

1967
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,227
You guys are so screwed.

1968
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,270
And honestly, there's nothing
you can do about it.

1969
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,480
Maybe we can.

1970
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,148
They got our playbook, man.

1971
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,691
They know all of our maneuvers.

1972
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,818
Yeah, but they don't know

1973
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,779
that we know that they know our maneuvers.

1974
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,530
You see why I don't hang out
with Jeremy by himself?

1975
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,949
I don't ever know what he's talking about.

1976
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,825
Guys! It's like the Patriots,

1977
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,203
when Bill Belichick stole the Jets' plays.

1978
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,372
Right, and they got busted. Yeah,
but they won the game.

1979
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,375
And where'd they end up? The Super Bowl.

1980
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,960
I wish I knew what you was talking about.

1981
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,128
We use Steve Harvey's words against them.

1982
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,755
We pretend to give them what they want

1983
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,173
so we get what we want.

1984
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,549
We lie to them.

1985
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,343
Exactly.

1986
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,137
This is war, gentlemen.
There are no rules.

1987
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,974
CEDRIC: Like the great Khan
once said, not Genghis,

1988
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:13,309
I'm talking about the Latin
guy from Star Trek Il.

1989
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,812
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."

1990
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,481
CANDACE: Michael, I need to
get something off my chest.

1991
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,817
You know what? Before you get
something off your chest,

1992
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,652
I gotta get something off my chest.

1993
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,737
You know I can be a bit of a Mama's Boy?

1994
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,824
I think it really all started
when my dad died.

1995
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,536
It was a rough time for us, you know?

1996
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,248
And my mom just started relying
on me for so many things.

1997
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,666
Too many things.

1998
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,419
You know, I had to be the man of the house

1999
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,045
at a really young age

2000
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,714
and I guess maybe that's
why we're so close.

2001
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Michael.

2002
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,217
And I guess, I guess what I'm
trying to say is this.

2003
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,680
I want you to be the number
one woman in my life.

2004
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,931
CEDRIC: It was like taking a test

2005
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,308
you already had the answers to.

2006
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,686
You're my priority, Candace. All right?

2007
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,021
Yeah.

2008
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,898
All right. Now, you said you wanted
to talk about something.

2009
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:03,735
Did I?

2010
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,862
CEDRIC: The women had no chance.

2011
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:08,114
They were like putty in our hands.

2012
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:12,910
So, I just updated my résumé,
and sent it off to Neversoft.

2013
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,912
Really? Mmm-hmm.

2014
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,122
You're serious?

2015
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,874
I was intrigued by a job posting

2016
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,542
I saw in Adweek and I thought,

2017
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,918
"Why not go for it, Jeremy?

2018
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,378
"You have nothing else to lose."

2019
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,213
Baby, that's awesome, that's wonderful.

2020
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,882
I'm so proud of you.

2021
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,717
Oh, my God. Don't get too excited, okay?

2022
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,093
It's just a feeler.

2023
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,720
Probably won't even call me in.

2024
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,263
No, you're selling yourself short.

2025
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,307
Jeremy, you were the best
in your class at Parsons,

2026
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,892
you're a brilliant designer.

2027
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,895
No. You're a brilliant artist.
They'd be lucky to have you.

2028
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,772
I'm lucky to have you.

2029
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,649
You are? Mmm-hmm.

2030
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,652
You know what I was just thinking?

2031
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:47,779
What?

2032
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,572
Nobody's had sex on this couch yet.

2033
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:50,990
What?

2034
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,909
No, it's a virgin couch. Really?

2035
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:53,993
Mmm-hmm.

2036
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,328
What do you think we should do about that?

2037
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,121
There's about 10 things I think
we can do about that.

2038
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,247
Only 10?

2039
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,583
You'll be crying out like
a bitch after three.

2040
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,085
Now I'm scared.

2041
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,461
I love this couch.

2042
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,921
CEDRIC: After careful study,

2043
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,839
Dominic realized there was only one man

2044
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,257
who could impress the Alpha Female.

2045
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,134
"The Guy With Potential." Zeke.

2046
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,345
What? I have to show her
I'm a man with a plan.

2047
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,180
Well, just make some shit up, dude. No.

2048
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,807
Remember that restaurant idea I had? Yeah.

2049
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,767
I need you to help me
with a business plan.

2050
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,602
Cook for her. Dummy.

2051
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,938
I already did. Breakfast.

2052
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,981
I ain't talking about no breakfast, boy!

2053
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,525
Something fancy, Dom.

2054
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,362
Like, like one of them dishes
with an apostrophe in it.

2055
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,613
Is that your robe?

2056
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,490
ZEKE: Yeah.

2057
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,616
Man, you here again?

2058
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,453
Yes! Ass Factory don't open up 'til
10:00, so I got time to waste.

2059
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,580
Bitch, move in already. What'd you say?

2060
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,706
Huh?

2061
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,958
I'm sorry if I want to
be around my friends

2062
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,459
when I'm going through a divorce.

2063
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,710
What was I thinking?

2064
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,170
You're something else, boy.

2065
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:49,257
Look, Gail used to love it when I would
cook for her. It turned her on.

2066
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,092
You can do all types of
things in the kitchen.

2067
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,802
We had a little food thing
that we would do.

2068
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,221
I would go and get some chocolate-covered
strawberries, right?

2069
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,433
Then I would come downstairs,
I have a G-string on.

2070
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,935
You know what I'm talking about.
She used to love it.

2071
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,147
So, the game was "Balance the Berry."

2072
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,691
I would put it on the...

2073
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:08,734
But the way it's...

2074
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,571
The berry ain't gonna stay there for long.

2075
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,322
The berry wouldn't stay on, so...

2076
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,161
The point that I'm making is this, Dom.

2077
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,997
Food is your art. Stick
with what you know.

2078
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:22,999
Mmm.

2079
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,459
It's good milk, Zeke.

2080
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,587
He's right.

2081
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:30,840
It's on.

2082
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,341
LAUREN: It's over. CANDACE:
Wait, what happened?

2083
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,552
Dominic's car broke down.

2084
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,262
I have to go pick him up?

2085
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,430
So? Calm down.

2086
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,932
Do you know how many times I had to pick
you up when your Jag broke down?

2087
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,100
Oh, save it, Candace.

2088
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,602
The man is a loser.

2089
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,270
And I'm the fool who slept with him.

2090
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:45,521
On the first night.

2091
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:46,939
Which is a memory

2092
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,400
he will have to cherish for
the rest of his life

2093
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:53,404
because it is never happening
again. Never.

2094
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:58,451
Hey, beautiful.

2095
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,204

2098
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,002
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

2099
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:11,255
Would you like a glass of wine?

2100
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,548
Actually, I came over here...

2101
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:14,967
It's a Chateau Montelena, 2006.

2102
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:22,475
That won first place in the Judgment
of Paris back in '76.

2103
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,394
Actually, it was a '73
Chardonnay that won,

2104
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:27,855
but I've heard this one is better.

2105
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,565
It was a gift.

2106
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:33,528
But I wanted to save it
for a special occasion.

both of them were relatives.

future, then he's gonna profess it.

He's gonna attach a title to it.

lady, his fiancée, or...

01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,314
Congratulations!

2378
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:02,276
Oh, my God. You did this for me?

2379
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:06,530
No, you did it. You left
it all on the track.

2380
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,615
I love you, girl.

2381

CEDRIC: Without even meaning to,

2382
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:18,542
Zeke done messed around and uttered
the three magic words

2383
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,585
that finally opened the cookie jar.

2384
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,654
But Zeke's victory was short-lived.

2385
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:17,851
(CHUCKLES)

2386
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,815
Uh-oh. This cannot be good.

2387
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:27,319
No, no, no.

2388
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:39,748
(DOOR OPENING)

2389
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,418
(MUFFLED SPEECH)

2390
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,548
Am I tripping, or was last night
the best night of my life?

2391
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:49,883
You got the cookie.

2392
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,885
The cookie? I'm the cookie monster.

2393
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:54,388
You know what I got us?
I got some latte...

2394
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,560
Mya, I can explain that.

2395
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,230
You lying-ass sack of shit!

2396
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,983
I was just using this to defend myself.

2397
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,735
Defending yourself against what?

2398
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,861
Against your 90-Day Rule.

2399
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,823
That was created for women to protect
themselves from sorry-asses like you.

2400
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,699
Oh, so I'm the villain, and you
didn't even have the guts

2401
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,785
to tell me that I was on
a 90-day probation.

2402
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:18,078
I was gonna tell you. Oh,
were you gonna tell me?

2403
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:22,332
Yes, I was gonna tell you. But then,
I thought I might amend it.

2404
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,379
'Cause I thought you might
actually be the one.

2405
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:29,339
So, was any of it real?

2406
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:34,094
Any of it? The wining, the dining?
Calling me your girlfriend?

2407
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,138
Or was that all just to get the cookie?

2408
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:39,474
Wow.

2409
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,352
You win, congratulations.

2410
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,355
You got it, right? You won.

2411
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,315
Mya, wait a minute. Mya, it was true.

2412
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,109
Zeke, don't touch me!

2413
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:51,653
God, you're so good.

2414
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:53,905
You're so good.

2415
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,825
Because even when I know
that you're lying,

2416
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:00,036
I still almost believe you.

2417
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:05,208
CEDRIC: In The Art of War, Sun Tzu wrote,
"All warfare is based on deception."

2418
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:08,295
He left out, "Only dumbasses get caught."

2419
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:09,796
(RINGING)

2420
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,256
CANDACE: Baby, your phone!

2421
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:14,968
CEDRIC: Meanwhile, Candace didn't even need
to find the book to get the message.

2422
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,219
Michael Atwater's phone?

2423
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,096
Tandace?

2424
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:19,181
Loretta?

2425
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:24,227
Listen, I'm calling to tell Michael that
I don't need him to take me to church.

2426
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,481
Deacon Johnson will be
driving me to church.

2427
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,733
Let me talk to him. Is he free?

2428
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,401
He will be.

2429
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,737
MICHAEL: Here we go! Oh, slam dunk!

2430
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,238
Michael.

2431
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:37,741
Can I talk to you for a minute?

2432
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:38,992
Uh-oh.

2433
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,368
Uh-oh. What?

2434
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:41,536
Ha! You'll see.

2435
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:42,787
Duke, get in the house.

2436
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,915
Baby, did you see that boy's skills?

2437
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:46,208
If I keep on...

2438
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,542
What's wrong, baby? What's up?

2439
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,295
Your, uh, work just called.

2440
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,215
And I thought it might be an
emergency, so I picked up.

2441
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:54,925
But it was just your mom.

2442
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,303
Really? You know, the T-Mobile
Top Five be acting up...

2443
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,804
Don't bullshit me, Michael.

2444
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,932
Baby, listen, I know how that looks,
but trust me, this isn't...

2445
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,142
Trust? I believed you.

2446
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,230
I can't compete with your
mother. And I won't.

2447
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:09,564
You don't have to...

2448
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:11,691
Then why did you look me
in my face and lie?

2449
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,530
You need to go.

2450
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:18,532
Baby, listen I...

2451
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,200
Get out of my face, Michael.

2452
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,961
CEDRIC: And Candace wasn't the only
one who was all business that day.

2453
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,337
Hey, beautiful.

2454
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,965
Hi. How are you?

2455
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,175
Um, I have a 2 o'clock, so...

2456
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:38,593
You look stunning.

2457
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,095
Thank you.

2458
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,764
So, you said you had some news?

2459
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,976
Yeah. My investor friend that
I told you about? Mmm-hmm.

2460
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,813
Read your prospectus, loves it, and
wants you to give him a call.

2461
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,523
You serious?

2462
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,400
I told you it was brilliant.

2463
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2464
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,739
Okay, we gotta go celebrate.
Let's go out tonight.

2465
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,658
I'm not free tonight.

2466
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,494
Okay, well, what about
tomorrow night, then?

2467
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,455
Dominic, I'm gonna hit you
with the headline, okay?

2468
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:10,709
I recently reconnected with an ex-boyfriend
of mine from college.

2469
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,043
Anyway, he just got a divorce

2470
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,587
and is moving back to LA and I...

2471
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:14,671
Whoa, whoa.

2472
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,590
You breaking up with me?

2473
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,968
No! No, I'm not breaking
up, just taking a break.

2474
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,511
I need some space. Space.

2475
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,179
Yeah, because we were moving too fast...

2476
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,015
Yeah, you sound like a guy.

2477
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,224
What did you say?

2478
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,018
I said you sound like a guy.

2479
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:32,147
Is that why you invited me to this
place? For a business lunch?

2480
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:33,565
So you can have an out-time?

2481
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,150
Dominic, look, I really like you.

2482
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:39,654
Okay? I didn't want to string you
along. Let's just be friends.

2483
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,115
Yeah, I don't really need
any more friends, Lauren.

2484
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:46,661
You know, and I really don't need
your friends to let me down easy.

2485
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:48,580
Okay, don't be stupid, Dominic.

2486
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:49,956
That's business, not personal.

2487
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,627
Do you even know the difference?

2488
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:55,003
You know, Lauren, I...

2489
01:33:56,088 --> 01:34:00,967
I never even had a prospectus, you
know? I did it all to impress you.

2490
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:06,431
You inspired me, you motivated me to do
something for myself for the first time.

2491
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,310
And all this time, I thought
you were too good for me.

2492
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:13,855

What I don't get is just like the book,
I was the guy with potential.

2497
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:09,035
I told her the truth, I put myself out
there, and it still wasn't enough.

2498
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,329
At least you didn't get caught
in a flat-out lie.

2499
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,790
Y'all should see how bad things
are with Candace right now.

2500
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,210
Kristen wouldn't even look at me
when I showed up at Gina's.

2501
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:18,837
She'll change her mind.

2502
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:22,298
Nah. You did not see the way
she looked at me. Such...

2503
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:23,717
Hate? Hurt.

2504
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,636
It's hate. Women will hate you fast.

2505

Either way, fellas. I think we
brought this upon ourselves.

It was self-defense. They attacked
first! We had to strike back.

01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,678
Not my type.

2534
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:55,266
That's how we do it, Zeke. I line
them up, you mow them down.

2535
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:57,477
Can I have my tab?

2536
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,455
CEDRIC: You can only get it once a year.

2537
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,581
What kind of meat is in the McRib?

2538
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,958
Fellas. Let me guess,

2539
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:21,334
school pictures?

2540
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,752
(LAUGHS) You look like
a substitute teacher.

(ALL LAUGHING)

2542
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:28,591
I finally sent my résumé over to Neversoft.
I had my meeting today.

2543
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:31,761
And they just called. I got the job.

2544
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,137
Is that right?

2545
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,222
Congratulations, man!

2546
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:37,475
I'm a senior designer at Neversoft.
With full benefits.

2547
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,893
Damn right, and the next step
is the expense card.

2548
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,061
I gotta call Kris.

2549
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,148
She not talking to you, huh?

2550
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,025
No. Well, you should call her anyway.

2551
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:48,444
She's the reason it happened, right?

2552
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,572
Yeah.

2553
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:51,656
That's good advice, right there.

2554
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,782
How's that project going along?

2555
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,409
It's going great. In fact,

2556
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:57,328
I'm gonna have to get out of here
soon and go get some work done.

2557
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,747
You know what we should do?
We should celebrate, right?

2558
01:37:59,915 --> 01:38:02,208
DOMINIC: Nice. Yes. New job,
first round's on Michael.

2559
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:03,376
Yes. I like that.

2560
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,752
No, no. I just had the last round...

2561
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,962
This is nice, just the fellas.

2562
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,630
Just like old times.

2563
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:10,550
No, it's not like old times because
I don't have a curfew this time.

2564
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,887
Speaking of curfew, I gotta
go. My night to cook.

2565
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:15,305
CEDRIC: Bennett, you sound like a bitch.

2566
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,891
We just got finished hearing good news,
we with the fellas, we drinking.

2567
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,852
He running home all henpecked.
Come on, man!

2568
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,395
I'm not cooking 'cause I have to,

2569
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:23,855
I'm cooking 'cause I want
to, that's my wife.

2570
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,148
Come on, now, Bennett.

2571
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,275
I'm not saying it like that, I'm
saying just, right now...

2572
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:28,776
Don't be mad at me 'cause I
got a wife at the house.

2573
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,362
That means sometimes I can't hang
out all night with you guys,

2574
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,698
I gotta go home early then
that's what I gotta do.

2575
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:35,617
I'm just saying.

2576
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,410
I got this round.

2577
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:39,329
I'm happy for you, congratulations.

2578
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:40,455
Thank you.

2579
01:38:40,539 --> 01:38:41,873
I'll see you guys. ZEKE: Big B!

2580
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,666
You're $20 short, Bennett.

2581
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:47,921
Yeah, no, I used to cook for Gail
on Thursdays. That was my day.

2582
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,006
I'm happy we're free. I really am.

2583
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,050
I'm telling you right now, we're
better off without them.

2584
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:53,635
Yeah, I mean, who needs to
put up with their shit?

2585
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,511
And their demands, the nagging...

2586
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,641
The expectations. Expectation is
the catalyst for all of that.

2587
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:00,850
Here we go. CEDRIC: You know what's funny?

2588
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:04,771
Gail used to love it when I cooked
Bolognese sauce from scratch.

2589
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,105
Like, that was her favorite, so...

2590
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,359
All right, boys, we are free
to do whatever we want,

2591
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:13,321
with whoever we want, whenever we
want, all right? To freedom!

01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,416
Right, I'm sorry. No, no, no.

That's my house, too, Gail!

I pay the bills in that house!

my back. Put me in my onesie.

I done told you I'd bring that coffee
upstairs, you old, nasty fool.

2689
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:21,861
Hey.

2690
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:24,030
Look who I found.

2691
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,991
Wow. Okay, third time I hope is a charm.

2692
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,201
Actually, I think it is.

2693
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:30,077
Go ahead, tell them. We
want to make an offer.

2694
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:32,663
I told you this was gonna happen.

2695
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:33,789
No, you didn't, actually.

2696
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,752
This is great news. We sort of had
an instinct about you guys.

2697
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:39,170
Kris?

2698
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:40,546
Jeremy, what are you doing here?

2699
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:41,797
I need to talk to you.

2700
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,925
Yeah, I can't. I'm in the
middle of something.

2701
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,551
This is important.

2702
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,137
Not a problem. Take your time.

2703
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:50,389
I'm gonna get the paperwork,
and we can get started.

2704
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:51,474
I'm really sorry.

2705
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,102
Did someone die?

2706
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,229
What? No.

2707
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,105
Well, you have a suit on, so I...

2708
01:43:58,273 --> 01:43:59,690
I got the job at Neversoft, Kris.

2709
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:00,775
Really?

2710
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:02,068
Yeah.

2711
01:44:02,277 --> 01:44:05,029
I mean, that's cool. I hope you
didn't do it for my benefit.

2712
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:08,324
I did. At first.

2713
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:12,453
But somehow, through all the pretending,

2714
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:15,456
I figured out I wanted it for me.

2715
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:19,293
And now that I have it, I want it for us.

2716
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,213
You were the first person I wanted
to call when I got the news,

2717
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:25,633
and the fact that I couldn't
drove me crazy.

2718
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:29,470
You're the last person I think about
before I go to sleep at night, Kris.

2719
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,680
Look, I, um,

2720
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:32,765
I miss you.

2721
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:34,308
Oh, honey.

2722
01:44:34,476 --> 01:44:37,311
I miss you and I want you back.

2723
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,146
So sweet.

2724
01:44:39,481 --> 01:44:40,815
I want to buy you a house.

2725
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,316
That's my man, step up there.

2726
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:43,859
I want to buy you this house.

2727
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:46,153
Back up, bitch. You ain't buying my house.

2728
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:47,321
Oh, it's fine.

2729
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:48,864
How the hell he talking
about buying my house?

2730

Breathe.

I'm breathing, I'm breathing.
I got it, I got it.

01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:55,871
Okay.

2733

I want to be your wife. And I
want you to be my husband...

I want to be your husband.

And I want you to be my wife

so bad.

2737
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,817
So, um...

2738
01:45:35,912 --> 01:45:37,163
Will you marry me?

2739
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:42,251
It's a yes.

2740
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:44,295
Oh, she did it.

Go ahead, my man.

2742
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:47,798
She did it 'cause she changed
the game. She did what?

01:45:47,966 --> 01:45:49,091
Oh, don't worry about it.

...but it was inspired by a

Of course I want the sex.
