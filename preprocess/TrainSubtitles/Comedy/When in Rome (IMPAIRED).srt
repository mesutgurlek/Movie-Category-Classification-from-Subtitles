so that you have my number,

from my phone.

I can't give it to you, because
Umberto made me turn it off.

get hit in football?

But... I could not paint your feet.
[Speaks Italian]

You came from Italy to paint my feet?

No, also to earn your love.

I think you have me confused
with someone else.

You can get your work done,

I think that's a real dog.

And here's the crown jewel.
I am the Gasee guy. So...

- Wow.
- I'm Gale.

Like a gale-force wind.

527
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,264
I took on that name because

in the natural world.

You can feel it.

00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,009
Actually, I think that's water,
eroding the earth.

532
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,740
Don't think it's water.
I think it's wind.

I don't hear any complaints
from the peanut gallery, so...

- Put your shirt back on, creep.
- [Man] Here you go.

I know this looks nuts, all right?

542
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,402
And maybe I am a little nuts
because I've never

543
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,605
tried to share my beauty
with anyone before.

544

And I think it's because
I'm in love with you. Big time.

Great first date, Beth!

[Man] Come on, man, put your shirt on.

548
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,581
Honestly though,
is there a doctor here,

549
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,617
because there's some kind
of weird swelling in this...

Oh, you're a street magician.

00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,565
I really appreciate it,
but I don't have the time right now.

You have all the time in the world.

now it's getting kind of creepy

touched me, and I didn't feel anything.

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,330
It's front-page news over here, sis.
What were you thinking?

590
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,997
<i>[Beth] I don't know.</i>
<i>Little bit ofjet lag,</i>

or a lot of champagne.

592
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,139
And the next thing I'm sitting
in the fountain picking up coins.

593
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,305
She took coins from the <i>fontana?</i>
That's not so good.

- Why not so good?
- <i>[Umberto] There is a legend,</i>

- Oh! Except that is ridiculous.
- OK. Then we hang up!

598

<i>[Stacy] I totally believe</i>
<i>in magic coins.</i>

599
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,356
- Were you on that call?
- Love is finally at your doorstep.

600
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,130
So have any men come on to you
since the wedding?

601
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,297
- Well...
- Oh, my God. They have been.

602
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,068
Yeah, a couple of weirdos
approached me this morning...

603
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,372
There are some magical forces
at work here.

604
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,935
I don't believe in magic.
Know what I do believe in?

605
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,879
Art. Where's my Slater Bradley?

606
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,382
Told you I was on top of it.

607
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,884
The insurance company
totally wanted to jack up the rate,

608
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,788
so in an effort to be more assertive,
I told them to shove it.

609
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,257
You told Hillman and Craft to shove it?

610
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,851
- Yeah.
- That piece was coming

611
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,259
from a collector in Australia.

612
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,593
Even if we got it on a jet today,

613
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,723
it would never clear customs
in time for the gala.

614
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,291
That means I have no centerpiece
for the Circle of Gold.

615
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,200
I'll get Hillman and Craft on the phone.

616
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,570
- I don't think I burned that bridge.
- No, no. It's too late now.

617
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,538

00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,183
- Little busy now. What do you want?
- Same thing I wanted last night.

621
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,622
What is it going to take for me
to convince you

622
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,626
- <i>that I'm not interested in you?</i>
- What is it going to take?

623
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,288
It's going to take you looking me
in the eye to tell me that.

624
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,389
That'd require seeing you,
and I don't have the time...

625
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,391
- Hi.
- Oh, so you're stalking me now?

626
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,564
No, I'm just running into you
in a premeditated manner.

627
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,733
I have a big problem
on my hands right now.

628
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,639
I just lost the centerpiece to my show.

629
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,076
- Beth?
- Celeste.

630
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,706
This is Mr. Al Russo, our newest patron.

631
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,579
He asked specifically to see you.

632
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:36,553
Of course. Um, hi. Um...

633
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,023
- I'm sorry. Have we met before?
- In my dreams.

634
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,489
[Snorts]

635
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,993
[Chuckles]

636
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:48,158
Beth has secured a rare Slater Bradley
as the centerpiece for our pain exhibit.

637
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,723
Actually, Celeste...

638
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,168
- Nick Beamon? Are you Nick Beamon?
- Yeah.

639
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:57,641
Nick the Hit! You want to talk
about pain, this guy...

640
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,907
- A million volts in the neck.
- That's fascinating.

641
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,815
Beth, you do have
the Slater Bradley, yes?

642
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,376
- Celeste, it's...
- My fault,

643
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,546
and I was meaning to tell you...

644
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,818
Actually, she has access
to something better.

645
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,917
- This is really not the time.
- An original Petrocelli.

646
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,655
The title of the photograph is <i>Anguish.</i>

647
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,322
It too has never been viewed in public.

648
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,025
A Petrocelli that's never been viewed?

649
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,126
That's right. Damian Petrocelli
agreed to give me the print

650
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,399
- and burn the negative.
- Why would he do that?

651
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,339
Because I happen to be
the subject of the photo.

652
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,834
And I'm willing to relive
that humiliation in public

653
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,869
because I know that
as long as Beth is involved,

654
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,710
it will be in good hands.

655
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,184
How about that private tour
we're gonna have?

656
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,883
Follow me.

657
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,085
...including Cézanne, Degas,

658
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,493
Manet, Picasso and Van Gogh...

659
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,021
They're just really nicely spaced.

660
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,864
You did such a great job.

661
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,394
Let me... I have something for you.
This is a gift for you.

662
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,300
Oh, my.

663
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,105
It's not from Tiffany.

664
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:15,318
- Sausage. That's your face.
- Yeah, that's it.

665
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,345
This may sound a little odd to you,

666
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,415
but encased meat is my life's work.

667
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:25,691
I am like a curator, just like you.
A curator of sausage.

668
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,325
- Well, passion is passion.
- That's exactly what I say.

669
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,530
There is not an emotion on Earth

670
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,062
that can't be expressed
through sausage.

671
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,838
And that bratwurst is saying,

672
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:44,075
"Hello, and thank you
for showing me the museum."

673
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,913
[Chuckles] Who knew bratwurst
could even say all that?

674
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,277
- Beth.
- Please tell me you're here

675
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,687
because you have
a deep appreciation for modern art.

676
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,250
I have a deep appreciation,
but for you, Beth.

677
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,988
[Laughs] That's it. Tour's over.

678
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,293
I know it seems crazy.
It's crazy to me too.

679
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,856
[Yelps]

680
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,925
Want to play cat and mouse?
I can play cat and mouse.

681
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,061
[Growls]

682
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,799
[Mumbling]

683
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,603
You forgot your sausages!

684
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,642
Oh, no. Oh, no.

685
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,906
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it hurts.

686
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,675
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
that was you. I didn't...

687
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,909
I'm really sorry.

688
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,850
It hurts so bad, but tastes so good.

689
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,012
- What is that, mint?
- It's breath spray.

690
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,921
You startled me, I didn't have
anything else. I am so sorry.

691
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,652
Can I see it? Take your hands away.

692
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,683
- You're gonna make it worse.
- I'm not gonna make it worse.

693
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,491
Don't be such a baby.
I really feel awful.

694
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,691
I did not know
that it would hurt that bad.

695
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:14,168
It doesn't hurt that bad.
I was just playing.

696
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,129
You think you're real charming,
don't you?

697
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,110
- Little bit.
- Yeah. Well, you are. OK?

698
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,476
- What?
- OK.

699
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,878
[Nick] Where are you going?

700
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,848
[Beth] I know your type of guy, Nick.

701
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,680
And what type is that?

702
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,085
Come on. The girl in the red dress
kissing you at the fountain?

703
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,287
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

704
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,849
That's why you've been cold
the last couple of days.

705
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,292
Is that so hard to believe?

706
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,421
That was Umberto's crazy cousin, OK?

707
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,488
You know the blood runs hot
in that family.

708
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,397
Yeah, you seemed so sick about it.

709
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,198
I was a little sick about it.
Especially after I met you.

710
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,566
[Man shouting in Italian] Wait!

711
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,907
Oh, no. Let's go this way.

712
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:58,108
- Hey, Beth! It's me, Al Russo!
- Oh, let's cross.

713
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,979
- [Honking]
- Whoa! Wait one second.

714
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,646
[Man shouting in Italian]

715
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,314
- [Nick] One second!
- I'm sorry, Nick! I gotta go!

716
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,551
- Just...
- [Beth] I'm sorry. I gotta go.

717
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,389
Hold on! Beth! Beth, wait.

718
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,131
Ah!

719
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,337
- [Screams]
- [Crashing]

720
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,034
[Nick] Ah, I did not
see that one coming!

721
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,001
OK, Lance, you can do this.
Just have to believe.

722
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:33,039
I will do the Great Mummy Escape,
and Beth will love me.

723
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,551
This worked for Houdini,
it should work for me.

724
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,111
OK, here she comes.

725
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:43,388
Well, I don't know, Joan. OK?
I don't know what I believe anymore.

726
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:47,261
All I know is that this is crazy,
and I need it to stop.

727
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,993
We told you this would happen.

728
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:53,527
OK, then what is it gonna take
for me to end this little nightmare?

729
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,267
You have to return the coins
to the Fontana d'Amore.

730
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,298
Wait, that's it?

731
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,367
And spell broken,
and these guys leave me alone?

732
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,379
I'm overnighting you
the coins right now.

733
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,314
That's no good. She needs
to return the coins herself.

734
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,752
I cannot just fly back to Italy to put
some magic coins into a fountain.

735
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,119
<i>There's got to be another way</i>
<i>we can handle this.</i>

736
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,386
- Try and enjoy the attention?
- Joan...

737
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,915
[screams]

738
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,418
Beth! It's me, Lance.

739
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,829
I'm setting a record for you.

740
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,457
I know this looks scary and dangerous,

741
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,968
but if I can do this,
get out of the straitjacket...

742
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,766
Stop! Stop!

743
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,774
What are you doing in my apartment?

744
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,407
Blowing your mind!

745
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,976
No one's ever done the Mummy Escape
in under three minutes.

746
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,183
- Juan, what's my time?
- Three minutes and 53 seconds.

747
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,986
I don't know. That felt pretty tight.

748
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,754
Are you sure you timed that right?

749
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:54,821
You know, you want to find the rabbit,
you got to work the hat.

750
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,662
You're just not putting in
the hours, bro.

751
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,134
- Not in front of my girlfriend.
- Who the hell is that?

752
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,602
That's Juan, my assistant.

753
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,698
He's just been video chronicling
all my illusions. Anyway...

754
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,766
Both of you, out of my apartment, now.

755
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,538
No, wait. Now listen up.

756
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,671
Oh, my goodness.
Your perfume is intoxicating,

757
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,477
and your hair smells like cinnamon!

758
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,882
[Gasping]

759
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,646
Get out!

760
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,552
Hey, Nick... Douche. [laughs]

761
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,153
[Nick fakes laughter]

762
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,096
You get those old Giant photos
I asked you for?

763
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,157
I am a professional photographer.

764
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,929
I'm not your girl Friday, OK?

765
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,665
I would appreciate some respect,
but yes, here.

766
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:39,165
Or, in lieu of respect, I'd appreciate
you and me chatting up two ladies

767
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,339
and leaving the one that knows more
about Wookiees alone with this.

768
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,041
I'm not gonna be able
to make that party.

769
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,915
What? No, Saturday night
is the ESPN party.

770
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:52,684
That's a work and play event, dude.
Oh, my God. It's the girl.

771
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,658
- The museum girl, isn't it? I knew it.

Your dentist. Dr. Moscowitz.

Oh.

Oh, God, yeah.

- Oh, good.

- I don't want to talk about it.
- Your dentist? Are you OK?

I just want to get out of here.

Where would you feel safe?

960
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,032
I used to come here with my parents
when I was a little girl.

961
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,867
I thought this place was magic.

962
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,410
And my father told me
that the roof was made of glass

963
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,009
so that God could see the paintings
from up in heaven.

964
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:55,953
Wow.

965
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,421
I know.

966
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,566
Her name was Marie-Therese Walter.

967
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,331
She was 17 when Picasso
fell in love with her.

968
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,830
Picasso was already married,
and 30 years her senior,

969
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,275
so they kept their affair a secret.

970
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,802
But he documented his passion

971
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,610
by hiding her initials
in some of his paintings.

972
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:24,985
Of course, Picasso wasn't
completely ready to settle down,

973
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,684
and he left Marie-Therese for Dora Maar

974
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,922
just like he left his wife Olga
for Marie-Therese.

975
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,033
But Marie-Therese
never stopped loving Picasso.

976
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,130
And she hung herself after his death.

977
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,168

00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,050
You OK?

979
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,882
She just loved him so much,

980
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,412
and in the end,
he didn't really love her back.

981
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,058
It's just sad.

982

You know, it doesn't always
have to be that way.

Every time.

985

It's like I meet a guy,
and I think it's great.

986
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,107
And anyone else

how much greater it's going to get.

988
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,009
And I'm constantly waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

You know, lightning does strike
once in a while, Beth.

Trust me. I know.

I wish I could believe that.

You can. No other shoes
are going to drop, Beth.

I hate you. You're ruining my life.

- Oh, it's so beautiful.

- Yeah, it's OK.

...everything football
meant to me and my family
