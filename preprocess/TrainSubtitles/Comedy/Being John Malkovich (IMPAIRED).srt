this is a very odd thing.

It's supernatural,
for lack of a better word.

403

I mean, it raises
all sorts of philosophical-type
questions, you know...

about the nature of self,

How could that be?

Good. [ Chuckles ]

I wasn't sure
I was going to come...

What was he doing?

He wasn't doing anything really.

He was just hanging
around his apartment.

uh, lonely guy.

we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night...

some tension between us at work--

Now, when you say that I can be
somebody else, what do you mean exactly?

Well, we mean exactly that.

his new wife and manager, Maxine Lund.

1244

Malkovich had found his mentor...

absolutely sensational...

1250

for giving us this opportunity...

1251
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:48,380
to share our creative vision.

1252
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,900
[Narrator]Nothing was impossible
for John and Maxine in the early days.

1253
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,420
Their union was a joyous one,
and together they worked tirelessly...

1254
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,860
to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.

1255

John Malkovich, the artist...

1256
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:02,500
and Maxine, the entrepreneur--

1257
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,580

1258
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,060
this protean figure
that we cal John Malkovich.

has changed since becoming pregnant...

1261

and, rumor has it,
from her husband's affections.

1262

[ Whispering ]
I'm so sorry.

1263
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,780
[Bing]Malkovich shows us...

1264
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:39,420
a reflection of ourselves,
our frailties...

1265
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:44,740
and our, you know,
desperate humanity.

1266
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:49,380
That's what makes him one of
the most relevant artists of our time.

1267
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:53,020
[Narrator]And what does the future
hold for John Horatio Malkovich?

1268
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,500
Well, to quote the Bard,
"He's got the world on a string. "

1269
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:02,380
As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice
need not merely be the record of man.

1270
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,860
It can be one of the pillars,
the props...

1271
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:08,260
to help him endure and prevail,"
and I believe that.
