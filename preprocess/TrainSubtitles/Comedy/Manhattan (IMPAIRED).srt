(♫ Gershwin ”Rhapsody In Blue")

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,131
"Chapter one."

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,474
"He adored New York City.
He idolized it all out of proportion."

4
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,358
Uh, no. Make that "He romanticized it
all out of proportion."

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,939
"To him,
no matter what the season was..."

6
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,322
...this was still a town
that existed in black and white...

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,734
"...and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin."

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,403
Uh... no. Let me start this over.

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,664
"Chapter one."

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,702
"He was too romantic about Manhattan,
as he was about everything else."

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,462
"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic."

12
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,840
"To him, New York
meant beautiful women...

13
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,799
...and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles."

14
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,215
Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste.

15
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,679
Let me... try and make it more profound.

16
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,597
"Chapter one. He adored New York City."

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,063
"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,355
"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out...

19
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,365
...was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."

20
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,825
No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean,
face ft, I wanna self some books here.

21
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,786
"Chapter one. He adored New York City...

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,328
...although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

23
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:04,842
"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitized by drugs, loud music...

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,799
...television, crime, garbage..."

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,134
Too angry. I don't wanna be angry.

26
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,595
"Chapter one."

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,762
"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved."

28
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,227
"Behind his black-rimmed glasses
was the coiled sexual power

29
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,641
of a jungle cat."

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,354
I love this.

31
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,942
"New York was his town
and it always would be."

(♫ "Rhapsody In Blue")

33
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,176
(♫ jazz music)

34
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:27,106
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation...

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,771
...so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

36
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,238
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
They've had this argument
for 20 years.

38
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,663
Listen to this example.

39
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,748
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning...

40
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,912
...would we have the nerve...

41
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,878
Would one of us have the nerve to dive
into the icy water and save them?

42
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,839
It's a key question.

43
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,845
I, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

44
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,765
Oh... God.

45
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,476
Which of us? (chuckles)

46
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,222
- You want a little more?
- No.

47
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,188
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

48
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,149
You don't smoke.

49
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,908
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but...

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,447
...I look so incredibly handsome with
a cigarette that I can't not hold one.

51
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,033
- You like the way I look?
- Mm-hm.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,577
Provocative.

53
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,714
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

54
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,218
- Jesus, she's gorgeous.
- Mm.

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,180
But she's 17.

56
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,599
I'm 42 and she's 17.

57
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,725
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

58
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,225
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

59
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,361
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

60
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,740
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

61
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,448
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

62
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,365
- Who, Tina?
- Mm-mm. My second ex-wife...

63
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,247
...is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

64
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,630
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

65
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,385
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies...

66
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,012
...and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

67
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,016
Mm, mm, not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

68
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,680
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret. (sighs)

69
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,725
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

70
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,361
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

71
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,738
You should never let yourself drink.

72
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,525
We oughta go
'cause I've got an exam tomorrow.

73
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,194
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

74
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,370
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

75
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,877
What is it? What's the matter with you?

76
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:55,007
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

77
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,167
I have something I wanna say.

78
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,213
I, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

79
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,472
Um, I, uh...

80
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,678
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party...

81
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,938
...and I met a woman there.

82
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,937
And...

83
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,444
And I've got
kind of involved with her.

84
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,695
You're kidding?

85
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,529
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

86
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,193
And now it's, you know,

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,113
it's getting out of hand
and I don't know what to do about it.

88
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,373
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

89
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,535
Well, who is she? What are the details?

90
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,874
- Well, she's a journalist.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,630
She's very...

92
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,212
- ls she married, too?
- No, no.

93
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,628
- She's very beautiful.
- Mm-mm.

94
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,765
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

95
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,346
Great. It sounds wonderful.

96
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,855
Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.

97
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,108
What are you telling me?
That your marriage is...

98
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,896
I mean, how serious is it?

99
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,531
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

100
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,533
But you haven't
said anything to Emily?

101
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,239
No! God, no.

102
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,872
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know...

103
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,126
...I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

104
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,628
We do! I mean, I love her.

105
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,165
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,084
But in all the years
that we've been married...

107
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,472
...I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

108
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,804
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea.

109
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,561
I hate myself
when I'm doing this sort of thing.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,769
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

111
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,356
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,524
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

113
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,287
Well, I don't think 17 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

114
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,790
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

115
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,168
He could do a lot worse.
He has done a lot worse.

116
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,545
I just think he's wasting his life.

117
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,833
He writes that crap for television.

118
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,845
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

119
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,807
Oh, my God. Kids.

120
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,845
Listen, I've gotta get this book
finished. it's never gonna get done.

121
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,311
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

122
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,066
Kids...

123
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,854
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

124
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,443
- (Sighs) Connecticut.
- Yeah.

125
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,826
I can't go to Connecticut.
It's not practical.

126
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,986
All my stuffs here. (laughs)

127
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,622
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

128
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,251
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

129
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,414
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

130
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,674
Very Freudian.

131
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,173
(Yale) Mm-mm...

132
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,519
Are you writing a book
on our marriage?

133
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,777
Leave me alone.

134
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,033
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

135
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,035
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

136
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,448
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

137
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,289
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

138
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,828
Do you spy on me?

139
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,624
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter...

140
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,511
...of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

141
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,549
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

142
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,217
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

143
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,730
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

144
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,890
He doesn't wear dresses.

145
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,731
You'll find out the details
when it's your turn to see him.

146
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,521
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

147
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,986
It's an honest account of our break-up.

148
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,323
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

149
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,704
Look at you. You're so threatened.

150
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:59,835
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

151
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,371
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

152
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,832
(♫ "Our Love Is Here To Stay")

153
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:13,136
Are you telling me that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

154
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,768
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

155
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,022
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

156
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,311
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

157
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,478
No? What does that mean?

158
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,740
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

159
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,152
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

160
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,822
This is... This is a terrific thing -
move over - you know.

161
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,583
And we're having a great time,
but you're a kid

162
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,870
and I never want you to forget that.

163
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,710
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life...

164
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,000
...and, you know,
I want you to enjoy me.

165
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,216
My wry sense of humor (chuckles)
and astonishing sexual technique...

166
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,383
...but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,722
Don't you have any feelings for me?

168
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,435
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you...

169
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,227
...but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

170
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,566
It's... charming, you know.

171
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,653
(Clears throat) Erotic.
No question about that.

172
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,909
As long as the cops don't burst in,

173
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,287
I think we're gonna break
a couple of records.

174
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,790
But you can't, uh, you can't...
it's not a good thing.

175
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,250
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

176
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,041
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

177
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,426
I don't want you to get in the habit...

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,178
...because first you stay one night,
then two nights,

179
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,590
and then you're living here.

180
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,430
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

181
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,096
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

182
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:48,110
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,898
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

184
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,943
No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?

185
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,864
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

186
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,830
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

187
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,632
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

188
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,420
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

189
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,215
I was taking pictures in our drama
class. It's fun, really neat.

190
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,180
You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry.

191
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,719
Are you kidding me?

192
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,435
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- Sh! You sound like the mouse.

193
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,395
Well, thanks.

194
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,732
- I know, I'm a whiner.
- (giggles)

195
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,024
- What are you doing here?
- (Yale) Hi.

196
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,114
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

197
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,703
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

198
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,085
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

199
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,167
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

200
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,332
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

201
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,048
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

202
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,258
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

203
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,673
You, too.

204
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,432
- Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,595
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

206
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,355
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

207
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,935
Really?

208
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,692
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

209
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,695
Great. Absolutely great. Did you?

210
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,982
No, I really felt
it was very derivative.

211
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,526
To me it looked like it was
straight out of Diane Arbus,

212
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,660
but it had none of the wit.

213
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,494
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

214
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,408
You liked the Plexiglas?

215
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,953
You didn't like the Plexiglas either?

216
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,669
Ah, that's interesting.
Nah, no... uh-uh.

217
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,335
It was a lot better than that...
that steel cube. Did you see it?

218
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,552
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

219
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,716
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

220
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,932
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

221
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,723
It was perfectly integrated
and it had a...

222
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,812
a marvelous kind of negative capability.

223
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,068
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

224
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,950
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

225
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,486
You wanna see that?

226
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,156
He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights.

227
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,246
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

228
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,505
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

229
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,007
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

230
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,171
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

231
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,676
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

232
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,139
Right!

233
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,522
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as...

234
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,810
...Gustav Mahler...
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

235
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,446
- ...Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

236
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,359
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

237
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,246
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich Boll.

238
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,032
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

239
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,623
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

240
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,585
- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch?
- She said "Van Goch"?!

241
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,000
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

242
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,296
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,260
He's a big Bergman fan.

244
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,222
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

245
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,183
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

246
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,349
It's bleak, my god.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

247
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,521
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

248
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,691
OK, OK, OK. I mean,
I loved it when I was at Radcliffe,

249
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,985
but, all right, you outgrow it.

250
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,496
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

251
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,123
No. Don't you guys see?

252
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,912
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups...

253
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,752
...by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,916
Here we are.

255
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,301
Uh, listen,
it was very nice meeting you.

256
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,304
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation...

257
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,387
...but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

258
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,553
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

259
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,145
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in god so, uh... OK?

260
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,901
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

261
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,107
Well, that...

262
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,317
"I'm from Philadelphia.
I believe in god."

263
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,404
- (nervous laugh)
- Does this make any sense to you?

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,823
What a creep. Could you believe her?

265
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,330
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

266
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,036
Nervous? She was overbearing.

267
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,419
She was, you know, terrible!
She was all cerebral.

268
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,625
Where the hell
does a little Radcliffe tootsie

269
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,836
come off rating Scott
Fitzgerald...

270
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,343
...Gustav Mahler and Heinrich Böll?
- Why are you getting so mad?

271
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,097
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

272
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,056
"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch. Like an Arab she spoke.

273
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:37,019
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

274
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,186
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

275
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:46,358
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife and
he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

276
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,198
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

277
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,911
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

278
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,327
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese...

279
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,918
...and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism“.

280
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,708
I get the feeling
that Yale really likes her.

281
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,844
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

282
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:11,053
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

283
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:16,062
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

284
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,475
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

285
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,566
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

286
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,279
You're 17. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

287
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,990
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

288
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,827
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

289
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,414
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

290
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,624
Get the groceries, will you?

291
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,462
Good morning
and welcome to Human Beings Wow!

292
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,505
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith...

293
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,672
...close friends of the Caner family.

294
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,934
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt. (laughs)

295
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,811
Except that Mrs. Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

296
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,520
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

297
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,146
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

298
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,314
I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...

299
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,156
No, wrong.
That's very chancy material.

300
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,697
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

301
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,084
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

302
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,960
You don't find this insightful?

303
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,338
Worse than not insightful.
It's not funny.

304
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,250
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

305
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,795
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

306
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,963
This is an audience raised on TV.

307
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,304
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

308
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:41,143
They watch their sets and the gamma rays
eat the white cells of their brains out.

309
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,151
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a Lude.

310
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,190
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

311
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,281
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

312
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,198
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

313
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,162
Ike, you're being silly.

314
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,701
(laughter)

315
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,370
We've talked to them about that.

316
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,960
- Don't break her neck.
- I won't. That's fine.

317
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,251
What did I do?
I made a terrible mistake.

318
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,419
It's the first smart thing you've done.

319
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,713
I've screwed myself up completely.

320
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,635
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

321
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,020
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

322
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,681
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

323
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,727
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

324
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,817
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

325
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,075
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

326
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,739
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

327
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,454
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

328
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:47,543
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and child
support. You know, I gotta cut down.

329
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,707
I'll have to give up my apartment.

330
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,253
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner...

331
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,421
...or take the Southampton house.

332
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,965
(sighs)

333
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,180
Oh! Plus I'll probably have
to give my parents less money.

334
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,219
It'll kill my father.

335
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,515
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

336
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,605
He'll be in the back,
away from god, far from the action.

337
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,770
Have you said anything to Tracy?

338
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,860
I gotta get out of that situation.

339
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,027
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

340
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,072
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

341
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,450
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

342
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,247
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

343
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,462
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

344
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,882
Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.

345
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,467
(woman) This is a wonderful turnout.

346
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,307
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

347
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,895
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment...

348
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,402
...is that so many of you
who would never do it before

349
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,278
put on black tie tonight.

350
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,439
(laughter)

351
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,699
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

352
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,990
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

353
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,664
Hi. What are you doing here?

354
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,549
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

355
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,960
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

356
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,595
Listen, I'd like you
to meet Isaac Davis.

357
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,722
Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

358
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,226
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

359
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,387
Well, of course I'm here.

360
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:31,355
What a funny coincidence. Uh,
excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

361
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,441
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

362
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,064
I heard you, uh, quit your job.

363
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:41,327
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

364
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,490
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

365
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,079
We should go there,
get some guys together.

366
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,416
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

367
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,334
There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times.

368
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,843
Well, a satirical piece
in the Times is one thing,

369
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,676
but bricks get right to the point.

370
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,762
Aw, but biting satire
is better that physical force.

371
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,643
No, physical force is better with Nazis.

372
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,351
It's hard to satirize
a guy with shiny boots.

373
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,017
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

374
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,027
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

375
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,611
I'm from Philadelphia. We never
talk about such things in public.

376
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,902
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

377
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,413
I'm just about to direct a film...
uh, of my own script.

378
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,451
The premise is this guy
screws so great...

379
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,836
- Screws so great?
- Screws so great...

380
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,292
...that when he brings
a woman to orgasm, she's

381
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,378
so fulfilled that she dies.

382
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,635
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

383
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,218
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

384
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,510
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

385
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,431
It's, uh, Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

386
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,108
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

387
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,612
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

388
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,152
My worst one was right on the money.

389
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,543
(Ike) Good night.
It was nice to meet you.

390
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,702
(Dennis) Same here.

391
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,621
(Mary) Bye-bye.

392
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,291
Oh, gee!

393
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,632
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

394
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,550
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

395
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,513
- She's a brilliant woman.
- Mm-hm.

396
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:32,601
She's a genius. I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

397
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,607
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

398
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,189
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

399
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,026
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

400
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,190
You don't have
to tell me if you don't...

401
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,110
Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

402
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:50,281
I was tired of submerging my identity
to a brilliant, dominating man.

403
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,539
He's a genius.

404
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,623
He was a genius,
Helen's a genius, Dennis is a genius.

405
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,833
You know a lot of geniuses.

406
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,045
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

407
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,209
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

408
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:07,098
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

409
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,849
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

410
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,477
God, that must have been demoralizing.

411
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,683
I took it well under the circumstances.

412
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,893
Phew-wee.

413
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,183
I tried to run 'em both over
with a car.

414
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,192
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

415
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,026
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

416
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,489
Hey, the little girl is tine. Jesus,
she's... What's with the little girl?

417
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,827
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
16 years old, no possible threat at all.

418
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,711
She's 17. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

419
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,170
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

420
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,006
I like the way you express yourself,
too. Pithy, yet degenerate.

421
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,514
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

422
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,766
I never thought I was very pretty.

423
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:55,896
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

424
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,730
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

425
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,897
When you climb into the sack, if you're
a bit giving, they're so grateful.

426
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,861
Yeah, I know I am.

427
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,025
- D'you have kids?
- Me, yeah.

428
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,320
He's being raised by two women.

429
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,238
I think it works.

430
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,248
They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

431
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,830
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

432
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,668
Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.

433
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,085
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in a rush?

434
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,629
Oh, no, sure.
What kind of dog you got?

435
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,389
(laughs) The worst.

436
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,892
It's a dachshund. You know,
it's a penis substitute for me.

437
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,681
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

438
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,144
(♫ "Someone To Watch Over Me")

439
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,792
- (Mary laughing)
- So, you serious with Yale or what?

440
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,919
- Serious?
- Mm-hm.

441
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,172
Well, he's married.

442
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,464
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

443
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,799
Donny my analyst always tells me...

444
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,592
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

445
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:18,354
I call mine Dr. Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

446
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,056
Donny...'? That's first name.

447
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,069
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate...

448
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,322
...especially with
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

449
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,278
I was his student and, um...

450
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,660
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

451
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,321
That's very, uh...

452
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,364
He failed me
and I fell in love with him.

453
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,999
Oh, that's perfect.

454
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,911
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

455
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,875
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

456
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,132
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

457
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,293
You got a good sense of humor.

458
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,134
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

459
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,641
I've been making good money
off it for years,

460
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,597
till I quit my job to write this book.

461
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,184
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

462
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,186
D'you wanna...?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

463
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,523
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

464
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,905
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

465
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,067
If I don't get at least 16 hours,
I'm a basket case.

466
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,954
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

467
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,705
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

468
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,118
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

469
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,037
See, years ago I wrote
a short story about my mother

470
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,252
called The Castrating Zionist...

471
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:31,715
...and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

472
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,506
(♫ "Someone To Watch Over Me")

473
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,309
(Mary sighs) isn't it beautiful out?

474
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,150
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

475
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,406
Mm, I know. I love it.

476
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:58,075
(Ike) Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

477
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,740
It's really a knockout, you know.

478
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,576
(Mary sighs)

479
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,996
I think I better head back.

480
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,086
I've got an appointment
with Yale for lunch later on.

481
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,637
(Ike groans)

482
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,906
Mm, hi. (coughs)

483
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,159
No, no. No, I'm awake.

484
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,618
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7:15.

485
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,458
Oh, yeah.

486
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,120
Really?

487
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,839
You did? At the museum?

488
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,673
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

489
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,593
Uh, so you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

490
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,928
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

491
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,018
Yeah, I don't think
you'll have any trouble.

492
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,650
(softly) I knew you'd...
see she's a terrific woman,

493
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,527
if you spent some time with her.

494
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,316
You still feel the same way about her?

495
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,404
'Cause you hadn't
mentioned it in a while.

496
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,036
So you... Yeah. Mm-hm.

497
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,993
Yeah, mm-hm, right. I know.

498
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,457
She's great, I know. Great.

499
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,872
So, uh... No, I gotta go
apartment hunting today.

500
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,882
I have to get something cheaper.

501
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,840
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

502
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,764
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Mm, yeah.

503
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,928
Said he had a great time with you.

504
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,895
Really? That's good 'cause I always
think he's uncomfortable around me.

505
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,060
Oh, come on.

506
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,694
I missed you so much.

507
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,153
Yale, this is ridiculous.
You're married.

508
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,569
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

509
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,737
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

510
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:09,582
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

511
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,371
Besides, I'm not looking
for any big involvement here.

512
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,289
It's just... I don't...

513
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,427
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about
you when you're not around.

514
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,844
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

515
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,681
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

516
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,845
You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.

517
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,434
Oh, Yale, please stop it.

518
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,646
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

519
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,688
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

520
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:41,905
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

521
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:46,698
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

522
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,959
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

523
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:55,043
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

524
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,798
And I don't wanna go to your house

525
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,257
'cause I can't stand the dog
and the phone ringing.

526
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,640
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

527
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,554
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

528
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,813
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

529
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,859
Oh, hi, Isaac.

530
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,987
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

531
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,148
(ex-wife) He'll be right down.

532
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,158
- How you been, Ike?
- Good. How you been?

533
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,319
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

534
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,286
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

535
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,374
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

536
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,211
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

537
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,547
Where does he get that?
'Cause you don't draw and I don't draw.

538
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,087
I draw.

539
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,678
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

540
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,469
I'm hoping you'll take Willie
on the 16th

541
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,683
'cause Connie and I
want to go to Barbados.

542
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,770
Are you still gonna
write that stupid book?

543
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,775
I mean, are you serious about that?

544
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,982
I'm very serious about it.
It's an honest book.

545
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,193
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

546
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,199
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

547
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,658
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

548
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,790
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

549
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,746
- You can't understand?
- No.

550
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,707
You knew my history!

551
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:20,340
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

552
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,922
D'you think we can be
ever just friends?

553
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,757
You're putting in all the details?

554
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,719
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

555
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,304
Wha... I tried
to run her over with a car?

556
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,971
What are you talking about? It was late.
You know I don't drive well.

557
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,139
It was raining. It was dark.

558
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,479
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

559
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,065
I was spying on you guys
'cause I knew what was happening.

560
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,151
You were falling in love.

561
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,907
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

562
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,696
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

563
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,865
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

564
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,707
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

565
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,630
(♫ "Love ls Sweeping The Country")

566
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,954
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

567
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,371
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

568
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,756
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

569
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,760
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

570
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,173
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

571
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,344
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

572
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,016
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

573
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,728
We could do well.

574
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,020
I think we could have picked up
these two, if you were quicker.

575
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm serious.

576
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,279
I think the brunette liked you.

577
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,112
(barking)

578
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,532
(mutters) I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

579
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,880
Mm...

580
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,924
Hello, Yale? Um, I'm sorry for calling.

581
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,556
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

582
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,887
Well, I just thought
that it's Sunday out...

583
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:43,310
...and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or... Mm.

584
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,523
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

585
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,312
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.

586
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,074
Well, OK, it was just a shot.
Yeah. Yeah.

587
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,577
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

588
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,082
(phone rings)

589
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,327
Hello?

590
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,671
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

591
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,293
No, not at all.
I was just sitting around

592
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,303
looking through the magazine section.

593
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:18,097
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

594
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,728
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

595
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,891
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

596
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,151
You wanna go for a walk?

597
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,695
I don't know, I've gotta get out.

598
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,323
I'm going stir-crazy
and Yale's with Emily's parents.

599
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,826
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

600
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,827
(clap of thunder)

601
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:40,240
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

602
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,035
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

603
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,420
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

604
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,458
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favorite sound either.

605
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,797
D'you know every year
one or two people get killed

606
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,304
during a storm in Central Park?

607
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,090
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

608
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,408
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

609
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,661
You look ridiculous! You know that?

610
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,414
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

611
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,203
I've never seen anybody react
so strongly to a little bit of water.

612
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,996
It wasn't the water.
It was the electricity.

613
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,588
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

614
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,879
What do you think? You think
I look terrible? How do I look?

615
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,674
- I can't see.
- (laughs) You should see your face!

616
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,390
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

617
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,098
- (Mary) I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

618
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,143
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

619
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,277
And I had tickets
to this Vivaldi concert.

620
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,438
He had to cancel on me, of course.

621
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,576
- (Ike) That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

622
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,034
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

623
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,996
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

624
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,877
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

625
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,257
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

626
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,591
That I was bad in bed, not bright
enough, or physically unattractive.

627
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:20,633
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

628
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,928
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

629
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,017
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

630
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,274
Women found him devastating.

631
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,485
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

632
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,113
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

633
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,320
How many of the satellites
of Saturn can you name?

634
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:43,455
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course. Uh...

635
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,743
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

636
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,537
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

637
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,425
They mean nothing 'cause nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

638
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,803
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening...

639
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,511
...if you'll forgive
the disgusting imagery.

640
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,177
I don't agree at all. Where would
we be without rational thought?

641
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,597
You... you...
you rely too much on your brain.

642
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,562
The brain is the most overrated organ.

643
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,319
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

644
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,732
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

645
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,903
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

646
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,071
You're tine. Are you kidding?

647
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:29,163
You do have a tendency to get a little
hostile, but I find that attractive.

648
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,829
(Ike whispers) Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm glad you do.

649
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,500
(Mary) So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

650
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:41,342
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

651
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,596
(Mary sighs)

652
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,884
I think you're...
I think you're terrific.

653
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:51,022
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

654
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,899
I think you're wonderful, really.

655
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,363
(Mary sighs) What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

656
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,400
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

657
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,870
(mumbles) I gotta
see somebody this evening.

658
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,656
I don't know if it's a great idea.

659
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,371
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

660
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,878
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

661
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,131
Uh... (sighs)

662
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,252
I'm not gonna have any free time

663
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,262
'cause... I don't think
it's such a great idea.

664
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:29,053
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

665
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,186
OK. OK.

666
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,607
(Yale) Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time. (laughs)

667
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,194
- (Emily) Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

668
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,235
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

669
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,324
Written another one,
if you can believe it.

670
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,161
- (Emily) Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

671
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:55,045
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

672
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,833
- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.

673
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:03,424
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

674
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,680
Oh, come on.

675
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:12,395
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

676
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,351
Yeah.

677
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,103
It's not too crowded.

678
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,815
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

679
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,026
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight

680
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,408
'cause...
I really did wanna see you a lot.

681
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,161
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

682
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,414
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

683
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,668
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

684
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,829
So I have a chance to go to London...

685
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,715
...study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

686
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,671
Really? When did this happen?

687
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,303
The other day.
Got a letter in the mail.

688
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,681
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

689
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,684
But I don't wanna go without you.

690
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,096
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

691
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,937
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

692
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:02,070
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

693
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,821
You'll have a great time.

694
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,529
It's a great town
and you're a wonderful actress

695
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,319
and it's a terrific place to study.

696
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,080
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

697
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,960
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

698
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,088
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

699
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,044
I'm kidding.

700
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,380
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

701
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,422
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17.

702
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,764
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

703
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,553
You're 17 now.
When you're 36, I'll be...

704
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,307
- Um...
- 63.

705
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,693
63, right. Thank you.

706
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,776
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

707
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,191
Of course, I will too probably, but...

708
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,451
...you know, I'm a late starter.

709
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,612
- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.

710
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,749
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

711
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,626
- Mm-hm.
- Forgot the coconut.

712
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,912
So what do you wanna do tonight?

713
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,084
We'll go to the movies,
I'll take you dancing...

714
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,547
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

715
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,712
OK, I know what we can do.

716
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,722
Well, get the filthy look
off your face.

717
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,225
Shut up. It's not filthy.

718
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,220
(♫ "He Loves And She Loves")

719
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,480
(hooves clattering)

720
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:34,366
(Ike) This is so corny. I can't believe
this. Is this what you wanted to do?

721
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,123
(Tracy) I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

722
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,955
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

723
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,917
Well, I've never done it.
I think it's great.

724
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,380
(Ike) On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

725
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,638
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

726
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,154
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

727
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,817
I am. You're...
You're God's answer to Job.

728
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,703
You would have ended
all argument between them.

729
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,035
He'd have said
"I do a lot of terrible things

730
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,076
but I can also make one of these."

731
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,961
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

732
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,677
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do
this any more. It's really bullshit!

733
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,188
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend...

734
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,441
...and I sit around like
I've nothing to do, so I called Isaac.

735
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,817
We went for a walk.

736
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,355
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

737
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,526
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

738
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,821
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

739
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,284
I know.

740
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,541
- What if I took some action?
- No!

741
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,543
- (phone rings)
- Oh. I'm not a home wrecker.

742
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,127
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

743
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,291
It happens. Hello?

744
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,302
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

745
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,463
- Uh, what?
- (dog whining)

746
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,852
Well, um, why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

747
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,312
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Right, I'll talk
to you later. OK, bye-bye.

748
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,728
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

749
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:34,400
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going no place. Excuse me.

750
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,488
Look, I know it's terrible.

751
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,450
I'm at Sneedon's Landing
with Emily and her parents...

752
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,162
...and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

753
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,999
- (phone rings)
- Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

754
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,335
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

755
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,799
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

756
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,464
Oh, Donny. Hi! (whispers)
it's my analyst.

757
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,724
Hello. Uh...

758
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,767
Um, no, uh... Well, I think
that'd be impossible. Uh...

759
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:09,605
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

760
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,395
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

761
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,064
- (Waffles barks)
- Oh, man. Waffles!

762
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:20,078
Please, just don't. This is really a bad
time... Waffles! ...A bad time for me.

763
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,448
I gotta think things through here.

764
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,916
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

765
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,455
(Waffles barks)

766
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,374
(♫ "Sweet And Low Down")

767
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,118
- (strange whining)
- Listen to that! How am I gonna...?

768
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:04,031
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

769
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,496
It's like somebody's
playing the trumpet.

770
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:12,539
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

771
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,878
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

772
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,918
It'll take your mind off it.

773
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,714
How many times a night...? How often
can you make love in an evening?

774
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,759
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

775
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,019
Well, a lot is my favorite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

776
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,352
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do...

777
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,516
...but nobody would do with you.

778
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,187
I'm shocked. What kind of talk
is that from a kid your age?

779
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,403
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

780
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,535
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

781
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,161
- (rumbling)
- Listen to this.

782
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,163
Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

783
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,744
It's a rumbling.

784
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,535
Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

785
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:56,083
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

786
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,876
Let's... Let's...
Can we check into a hotel?

787
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,796
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

788
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,260
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

789
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,347
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

790
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,888
No, and I don't want you living here.

791
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:14,150
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment...

792
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,029
...so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

793
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,191
(runs tap) Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

794
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,577
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

795
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,205
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

796
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:32,085
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

797
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,245
And I got brown water here.

798
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,416
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

799
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,085
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

800
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,927
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

801
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,969
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

802
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,479
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

803
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,891
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

804
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,563
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

805
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,778
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

806
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,615
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

807
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,200
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

808
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,084
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

809
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:17,748
Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.

810
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,757
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

811
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,419
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

812
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:27,136
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

813
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,472
I'm not angry.
It's just I knew it was gonna end,

814
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,012
but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

815
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,682
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

816
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,691
And I don't wanna break up my marriage

817
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,273
and then find out
we're no good together.

818
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,734
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

819
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,025
OK, you made your point very clear.

820
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,035
I'm just glad one of us
had the nerve to end it.

821
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,531
- Will you be all right?
- (crying) Yeah...

822
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,076
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

823
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,667
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

824
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,548
I got everything going for me.
The point...

825
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:06,759
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

826
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,552
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

827
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,688
I could go to bed with the entire
faculty of MIT, if I wanted to.

828
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,063
It's just...

829
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,443
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

830
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:26,024
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

831
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,534
I got these tickets
to see Rampal tonight.

832
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,865
Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

833
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,622
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

834
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,786
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

835
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,046
Fuck off, Yale!

836
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,505
Um, I know you're gonna think
the water's a little brown,

837
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,340
but you can drink it.

838
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,504
Don't get thrown by this.

839
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,641
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

840
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:52,891
It's just...

841
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,021
- God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it.

842
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,977
I didn't know who to call.

843
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,018
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

844
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,734
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

845
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,898
When did they find that out?

846
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:12,070
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

847
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,580
Well, I guess
I deserve everything I get.

848
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,785
Come on.

849
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,669
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

850
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,829
Yeah, you pick a married guy...

851
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,626
...and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

852
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,793
What worst feelings?

853
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,966
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

854
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,682
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyze me.
I pay a doctor for that.

855
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:41,099
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

856
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:46,897
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

857
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,906
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

858
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,738
He's done a great job on you.

859
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,369
Your self-esteem is like
a notch below Kafka's.

860
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,576
- (rumbling)
- What is that noise?

861
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,662
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it?

862
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,202
There's a guy upstairs.
I don't know what the hell it is.

863
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,373
It's like he's up there strangling a
parrot or something. I can't stand it.

864
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,541
How can you stand it? It's terrible.

865
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,710
I know.
I used to have a great apartment.

866
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:14,257
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

867
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,517
- No, come on.
- (sniffles)

868
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,939
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticize him?

869
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,021
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

870
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,404
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

871
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,736
Yale has his problems as we all do.

872
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,243
I'm starting to sound
like Rabbi Blitzstein.

873
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,497
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

874
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,956
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

875
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,540
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

876
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,296
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:50,881
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

878
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,137
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

879
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,559
(TV) But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money...

880
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:03,518
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

881
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:08,653
That is hilarious. Mm, there's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

882
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,315
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

883
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,861
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

884
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,624
But look at his wife. Looks like her
face has been lifted about 8,000 times.

885
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,877
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

886
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,458
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

887
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,467
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

888
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,253
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

889
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,639
Yeah. They're great.

890
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,720
Mm... Mm...

891
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:44,230
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

892
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,767
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

893
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,106
Mm.

894
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,363
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

895
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,991
(Yale) om on, God.

896
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,038
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

897
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,573
Yeah?

898
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,539
You know, I just had
to cut this thing off finally.

899
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,829
I'm not the type for affairs.

900
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,089
D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?

901
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,750
No. We cut it off.
It's easier that way.

902
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,591
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

903
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,802
Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.

904
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,592
Right up your alley.
You oughta call her.

905
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,137
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

906
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,806
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

907
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,974
She told me she did.

908
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,611
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she Ends you attractive.

909
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,649
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

910
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,193
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

911
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,987
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

912
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,078
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

913
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,619
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

914
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,915
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

915
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,052
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

916
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,213
I think you guys
would be good together.

917
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,347
I could be a good influence on her.

918
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,601
I think that under
my personal vibrations,

919
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,808
I could put her life
in a kind of good order.

920
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,227
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

921
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,566
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

922
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,450
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

923
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,283
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

924
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,994
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

925
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,659
- ...Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

927
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,059
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

928
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,818
Or Grand Illusion. That's...

929
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,151
I see that every time it's on
television, if I'm aware of it.

930
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,407
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

931
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,783
Oh, Jesus, what is this?

932
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,617
You got a corned beef sandwich here
from 1951, I think.

933
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,623
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

934
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,252
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

935
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,505
Ugh, it's really terrible.

936
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,040
- Hey.
- What?

937
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,879
Come here.

938
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,804
What're you doing?

939
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:29,937
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

940
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,190
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

941
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,350
it's something I wanted
to do for ages.

942
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,689
Yeah, I know.

943
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:41,107
Do you? I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

944
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,867
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

945
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,028
- I did.
- I thought so.

946
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,117
But you were going out with Yale then

947
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,659
and I would never
in a million years interfere...

948
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,827
Did you want me to kiss you?

949
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:58,044
Mm, I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

950
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:01,460
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain...

951
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,427
...and I had a mad impulse to throw you
down on the lunar surface...

952
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,638
...and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

953
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,599
I can't go from relationship
to relationship. It's senseless.

954
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,560
I can't do it.

955
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,022
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Ls that the problem?

956
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,186
I've got too many problems.

957
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,983
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

958
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:27,619
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- (giggles) What are you saying?

959
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,281
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

960
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,541
I'm... I'm kidding.

963
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,961
Shh.

964
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,297
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

965
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,883
What about your relationships
with women?

966
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,095
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

967
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,511
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

968
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:56,182
She got into drugs
and she, uh, moved to San Francisco.

969
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,350
Went into est, became a Moonie.

970
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,861
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

D'you like that?

972
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,617

wonderful otherness to it, you know.

00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,574
- A marvelous negative capability.
- OK.

974
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,660
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

975
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,383
(Mary) I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

976
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,546

all flushed and hot.

Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

Why not?

I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,590
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

...believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

Well, don't you love me?

1011

The truth is that I love somebody else.

Hey, come on... We... we...

1014

This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

1015
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,597
You met someone?

1016
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,308
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

1017
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,397
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

1018
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,561
Have you been seeing someone?

1019
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,197
No. Yes. Someone older.

1020
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,528
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

1021
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,571
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,332
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

1023
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,586
It's not right.
You shouldn't get hung...

1024
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,918
I mean, you should open up your life.

1025
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,082
You know, you've got to.

1026
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,627

then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

But Viking will shell out the money.

01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,494
Maybe it'll inspire Yale
to finish his book.

(laughing) "Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female..."

1175
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,041
...made me realize
what an empty experience...

1176
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,507
"...what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1177
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,639
Please. That is so nauseating. I... Oh!

1178
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,846
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1179
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,011
- She put that in?
- (Yale laughs)

1180
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,602
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1181
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,438
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1182
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,571
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1183
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,073
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1184
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,701
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1185
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,956
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1186
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,458
Everybody... All my friends and...

1187
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:36,838
(Emily) Listen. "He was given to fits
of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia..."

1188
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,840
...male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy...

1189
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,172
"...and nihilistic moods of despair."

1190
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,384
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1191
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:49,176
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1192
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:52,562
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death...

1193
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:57,396
...which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1194
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:01,153
- I came here to strangle you.
- (Jill) Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1195
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,531
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1196
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,487
It's an honest account.

1197
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,244
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1198
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:12,407
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1199
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,371
Like what? What?

1200
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,627
You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind.

1201
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,710
- (Connie laughs)
- What are you laughing about?

1202
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,593
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1203
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:26,550
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1204
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,966
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1205
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,306
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1206
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,723
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1207
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,392
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1208
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,311
Don't forget
that Willie's at ballet class.

1209
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,526
Look, I better warn you.

1210
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,239
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1211
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,539
- Anybody home?
- (Mary) Uh-huh.

1212
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:58,625
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story to
tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1213
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,379
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1214
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,042
Just let me get one glass of brown water
'cause I'm dying of thirst.

1215
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:08,384
- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today...

1216
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:12,551
...because I'm real annoyed over that
junk she printed in the book. And...

1217
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:16,597
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1218
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,982
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1219
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,899
Wh... What's the matter?

1220
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:29,567
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1221
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,492
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1222
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,050
What?

1223
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,466
You... Are you kidd...?

1224
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:54,183
- You are?
- Yes.

1225
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,978
Well, when did this happen? What...

1226
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,349
Well, you are or you think you are?

1227
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,984
I started seeing him again.

1228
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,237
When? Since when?

1229
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:11,989
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1230
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,656
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1231
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,419
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1232
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,877
I think I've always
been in love with him.

1233
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,133
How does he feel about this?

1234
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,168
Well...

1235
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:33,764
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1236
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,518
I'm stunned.
I mean, I'm in a state of, uh...

1237
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,896
Somebody should throw a blanket
over me. You know, I'm...

1238
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:44,935
Well, you see, he called me several
times in a very depressed state...

1239
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,320
...and he still loves me.

1240
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:52,075
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1241
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,656
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1242
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,821
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1243
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,284
Well, then I wish you would.

1244
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,451
I wish you'd get angry
so that we could have it out.

1245
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,040
I don't get angry.
I tend to internalize.

1246
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:08,549
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumor instead.

1247
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,961
Well, I told you that
I was trouble from the beginning,

1248
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,721
from when we started dating.

1249
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,132
So what does your analyst say?

1250
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,518
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1251
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:23,181
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1252
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,645
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

1253
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:26,934
Why?

1254
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:30,105
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1255
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:33,650
I know that sounds egotistical,
but, uh, you know...

1256
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:37,411
This guy's been married 12 years.
What do you think will happen?

1257
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,494
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1258
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:44,627
And if he does commit to you, when you
start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1259
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,629
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1260
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,416
I can't plan that far in advance.

1261
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,803
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1262
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,555
What kind of foresight is that?

1263
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,719
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1264
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,013
You always think
that you're gonna be the one

1265
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,898
that makes 'em act different, but...

1266
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,650
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1267
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,028
Mm-mm. Oh, well, I'm...

1268
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,906
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1269
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,158
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1270
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,156
What are you doing here?

1271
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,534
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1272
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,036
I was, but...
I'm trying to teach a class.

1273
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,947
So where can we go and talk?

1274
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,992
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1275
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,332
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily...

1276
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:12,169
...and run away with
the... the winner of the...

1277
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,959
...Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1278
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,923
Look, I love her.

1279
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:21,011
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1280
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,017
- Why? What was the point?
- 'Cause I thought you liked her!

1281
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,851
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1282
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:33,019
“I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1283
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,486
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1284
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,867
So you liked her?
Now you don't like her?

1285
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,450
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1286
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,456
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1287
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,459
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1288
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:53,213
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1289
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:57,377
You could've said, but you... All you
had to do was call me and talk to me.

1290
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,218
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1291
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,975
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1292
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,353
We had a few innocent meetings.

1293
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:12,438
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1294
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,693
We met twice for coffee.

1295
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,854
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1296
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,398
Did you meet for Sanka?

1297
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,283
That's not too romantic.
A little on the geriatric side.

1298
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,035
I'm not a saint, OK?

1299
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,821
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1300
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:30,494
You're... You rationalize everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1301
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,753
You talk about you wanna write a book,

1302
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,130
but in the end
you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1303
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:39,635
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1304
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:44,094
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1305
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,054
You are so self-righteous.

1306
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:50,346
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1307
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,686
I gotta model myself after someone.

1308
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,149
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1309
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:00,736
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1310
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,526
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1311
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:08,289
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1312
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,916
And now look.
This is what happens to us.

1313
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:14,750
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1314
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,381
I'll be hanging
in a classroom one day...

1315
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:22,295
...and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1316
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,838
Ike!

1317
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,177
Isaac, where are you going?

1318
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,320
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1319
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,324
But then, nothing's perfect.

1320
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:30,204
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1321
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,411
It's funny 'cause I'm just
a non-compromiser.

1322
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,418
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1323
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:40,081
I think it's always
a mistake to look the other way

1324
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,249
'cause you pay for it in the end.

1325
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,590
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1326
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,754
I'm living in the past.

1327
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,015
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1328
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:54,975
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1329
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:58,186
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1330
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,396
I think, and I know this sounds strange,

1331
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,062
but I think
I really missed a good bet...

1332
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,230
...when I let Tracy go.

1333
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,616
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1334
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,744
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week...

1335
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,624
...and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years...

1336
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,660
...when I actually
am honest with myself,

1337
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,749
I think I had the most relaxed times...

1338
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,415
...and, you know,
the nicest times with her.

1339
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,879
She was a terrific kid,
but young, right?

1340
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,044
So that's that.

1341
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,213
Why don't you call her?

1342
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,258
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1343
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,803
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1344
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:39,849
And (sighs) she was so sweet, you know.

1345
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,940
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago...

1346
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,696
...that I should
watch Grand Illusion on television

1347
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,950
and I never returned her call.

1348
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,157
'Cause I, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1349
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,618
She really cared about me and I...

1350
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,202
You know I was
a little pissed off at you.

1351
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,745
Me?

1352
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:05,758
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

(Ike) An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan...

1354
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,927
...who are constantly creating...

1355
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,600
...these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves...

1356
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,767
...'cause it keeps them from dealing

1357
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,939
with more unsolvable,
terrifying problems...

1358
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,233

Well, all right, why is life worth
living? That's a very good question.

01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,076
Um...

1362
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:46,082
Well, there are certain things,
I guess, that make it worthwhile.

1363
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,046
Uh, like what?

OK, um, for me, uh...

Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,

Um, and Willie Mays.

you made such a convincing case.
