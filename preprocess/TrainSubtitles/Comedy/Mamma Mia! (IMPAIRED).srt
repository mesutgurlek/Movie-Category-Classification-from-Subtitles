Harry! It is you!

I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

I'm writing a travel piece.

(STAMMERING) Okay. What is this?

520

It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

525
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,515
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

526
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,079
- BILL: Didrt catch the name.
- Greek lady.

527
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,832
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,990
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

529
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,991
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

530
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,548
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

531
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,473
I'm closed and I'm full.

Bill here is used to roughing it.

536
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,994
- And Harry here...
- I'm spontaneous.

537
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,399
- Spontaneous.
- DONNA: Ah.

538
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,158
What about you?

539
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,356
Just wanted to see the island.

You know what it meant to me.

541
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,112
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

542

to take you all back to the mainland.

- You have a boat?

Good, get on it,

But how are they here now?

1250
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,353
I invited them.

1251
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,031
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1252
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,712
but I didn't. I just...

1253
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,268
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1254
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,590
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.

1255
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,716
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

1256
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,394
No, I thought you would try to stop me.

1257
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,796
- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?

1258
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,635
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1259
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,393
- You finding your dad?
- No. No!

1260
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,835
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1261
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,673
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1262
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,957
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1263
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,793
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1264
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,469
that comes from finding yourself.

1265
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,797
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

1266
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,475
I put everything on hold for you.

1267
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,109
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1268
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,553
Now, I don't know.

1269
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,394
You don't know if you love me?

1270
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,438
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1271
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,792
Is everything okay?

1272
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,636
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1273
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,233
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1274
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,311
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1275
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,391
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1276
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,517
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1277
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,319
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1278
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,949
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1279
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,713
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1282
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,515
No.

1283
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,677
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1284
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,752
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1285
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,398
Will you help me?

1286
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,509
