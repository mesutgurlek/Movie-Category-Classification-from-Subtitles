ASTRONAUT: Mission Control, come
in. Mission Control, do you read?

00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,530
Mayday. Mayday.

3
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,575
On reentry into Earth's orbit,
I seem to have fallen into,

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,246
I don't know, some kind
of tear in time and space.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,125
My coordinates are unknown.
Is this even Earth?

6
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:47,505
Ship's instruments indicate
should be White Sands, New Mexico.

7
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,300

receiving this? Come back.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

10

Recovery team! Recovery
team, fix coordinates now!

11
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,773
Where the hell am I?
Somebody respond!

12
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,567
Recovery team,
come back, God damn it!

13

Oh, God. Oh, God!

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,240
Does anyone read...

17
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,748
No!

MALE ANNOUNCER: This is
Today, with Matt Lauer.

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,801
We're back now with
Dr. Rick Marshall,

20
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,387
whose new book arrives
in stores tomorrow.

21
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:42,268
It was back in Oslo, Doctor, last month,
that you just startled your colleagues

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,897
with this theory of yours that takes
science in a completely new direction.

23
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,023
- Quantum...
- Quantum Paleontology.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,274
Quantum Paleontology,
that's correct.

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,942
What exactly is that?

26
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,280
Well, it's... Not to say modestly,
it's our very future, Matt.

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
It's the only
real solution

28
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,951
to solving this fossil fuel
crisis we're experiencing.

29
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,579
And it boils down
to two simple words.

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,080
Renewable biofuels.

31
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,208
Close. Time warps.

32
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,627
- Time warps?
- Time warps.

33
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,669
You're serious about this.

34
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,630
I'm deadly serious.

35
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,091
Five years, over $50
million on my research.

36
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,637
You've spent $50 million of your
own money studying time warps?

37
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,307
No, that's adorable. No, taxpayers'
money. I don't have $50 million.

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,725
And now you're
asking for more.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,268
It's all explained
in my book.

40
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,478
I know. We've plugged the book.

41
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,854

42
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:27,939
Yeah.

Bantam Books. Amazon.

44
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,819
We are living in a time
right now with huge cuts in...

45
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,945
I saw.

46
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,404
- Huge cuts in spending.
- Right.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,989
We're in dire economic straits,

48
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,952
and you're spending $50
million on studying time warps.

49
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,995
How do you not think
that's irresponsible?

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,163
- Well, I...
- Are you smoking?

51
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,998
No, I'm making a balloon
animal here, earthling.

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,291
But you can't smoke in the studio.

53
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,543
Okay, no one told me that.

54
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,169
Just, you can't.

55
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,587
Look, look... Fine.

56
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:56,342
There are huge, huge amounts of
trans-dimensional energy out there

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,177
just waiting for us to throw the switch.

58
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,512
Energy crisis averted.

59
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,141
You are asking people to stake the entire
future of industrialized civilization

60
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,853
on what you call
"parallel dimensions. "

61
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,856
What about the critics who
have a fair question, Doctor?

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,235
They say this theory of yours is
not science. It is non-science.

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,904
And some are even more blunt,
and they say it's nonsense.

65
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,114
How do you
respond to that?

66
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,407
- My critics?
- Your critics.

67
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,200
- And there are a lot of them.
- Can you be more specific?

68
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,785
Stephen Hawking.

69
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,831
Stephen Hawking says this
is nonsense. That's his word.

70
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,416
Okay, you know what?
This interview's over.

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
Why?

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,295
Because, like, your producers said
you wouldn't bring that up, all right?

73
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,379
It's a fair question.

74
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,131
No, it's not! It's a hatchet job!

75
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,383
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall,

76
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,426
whose book arrives in stores tomorrow.

77
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,677
RICK: Goddamn right it was!

78
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,761
You might want to look for it

79
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,265
in the "I'm out of my
freaking mind" department.

80
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,142
When we come back, trampolines.

81
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,435
Summer fun or silent killer?

82

MAN: Wait, wait! He's
making a run for the stage!

83
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,229
Are you out of your mind?

84
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,231
MAN: - Hey, he's so strong!
- What are you, crazy?

85
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,984
(RICK SCREAMING)

86
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,159
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed
colleagues, I'll conclude with this.

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,621
Our very future depends on one thing.

88
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,039
(RICK READING)

89
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,083
Subatomic particles that
move so incredibly fast,

90
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,419
they actually travel backwards in time.

91
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:18,299
Ask yourself, what if there was a
device that could harness these tachyons?

92
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,678
We could open and travel
through warps in time and space.

93
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,932
What's that?
Not in our lifetime?

94
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,977
My friends, I've designed such a device.

95
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,688
I give to you
the tachyon amplifier.

Genius in a box.

97
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,570
Only with this device, you don't
travel forwards or backwards.

98
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,822
You travel sideways in time

99
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,452
to another dimension where past,
present and future all meet.

100
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,871
And lights!

101
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,541
All right, any questions?

00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,795
Oh! Great. Yes.
You, right there, young man.

103
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,798
Yeah. If you shot a
ton of pot at the sun,

104
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,967
would it burn up
and get everybody high?

105
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,593
No. No, no.

106
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,513

that pertain to science?

you're about to cry now?

00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,241
Did you ever try to make
the tachyon amplifier?

Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm Holly Cantrell.

I studied all your
work at Cambridge.

120
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,082
I think you're brilliant.

121
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,211
Well, Holly from Cambridge
who thinks I'm brilliant,

122
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,380
I started, but I didn't finish. So, no.

123
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,924
No, but you have to build it. I
mean, it's the most incredible...

124
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,301
What are you eating?

125
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,971
It's a donut
stuffed with M&M's.

126
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,599
That way when you finish the donut,
you don't have to eat any M&M's.

127
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,436
But don't you see?
You were absolutely right.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,562
- Everything...
- Stop!

129
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,817
Chasing that theory got me laughed out
of mainstream science and landed me here.

130
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,319
And you know what? I don't
have anyone to blame but myself.

131
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:08,492
'Cause, as they say, if you don't
make it, it's your own damn "vault. "

132
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,828
That's a bitch-slap
of truth right there.

rubbish, then explain this.

00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,221
I found it out in the desert
along with crystals like this

that radiate pure
tachyon energy.

Go on.

No. No. I mean, yes.

163
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,788
I don't know. I finished
building it, yes,

164
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:21,333
but I didn't have the
nerve to test it out.

165
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:27,006
So I thought a trip to Arby's might
give me some courage, but no dice.

166
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,466
Then I had Popeye's, Del Taco.

babbling to a cutout of Jared.

171
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,396
It still didn't give me the
strength to turn that thing on.

You are not a coward.
You're a visionary.

parts since the Pilgrim times.

00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,930
A beacon.

635
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,558
A transmitter, tapping directly
into my prefrontal lobe.

636
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,939
- What the hell?
- Stop it!

637
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,524
Well, I'll be.

638
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,317
I guess you weren't crazy.

639
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,320
Okay. I'm man enough
to say that's my bad.

HOLLY: Wow. That's
incredible. The architecture.

641
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,535
It's almost like the Olmec
culture of Mesoamerica.

642
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,829
Reminds me of the Prudential building.

That ambient energy?

647
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,891
Just like at Devil's Canyon.

648

HOLLY: Yep.

649
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,728
Tachyon radiation.

Finally, something cool, huh?
What, no reaction?

654
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,453
You guys have seen that
before, too, I take it, huh?

655
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,996
In your lab.

656

660
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,467

661
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,343
I wouldn't touch that, all right?

Only you can help me escape.

727
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,702
The fate of the universe depends on you.

728
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,831
Well. That's very flattering, Enik,

729
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,793
but I think you've
found the wrong guy. I...

730
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,961
No, Rick Marshall.

731
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,923
I have summoned you here specifically
to help me stop an evil madman

732
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:26,220
who has already conquered my world
and now plans to conquer yours.

733
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,265
His name is the Zarn.

734
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,228
I am the Zarn! Heed my
warning or be destroyed!

735
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,773
The Zarn became obsessed with
using the power of these crystals

736
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,733
to conquer the universe.

737
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,029
If he is not stopped, he will
open a doorway to your world

738
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:49,159
and lead his army of Sleestak on
a rampage across time and space.

739
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,912
He must be stopped.

740
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,498
Enik, buddy.

741
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,002
I'm a scientist.
You're a scientist.

742
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,171
I think together you and I
can figure this out. Now...

743
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,090
You mustn't touch the crystals!

744
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,174
Okay!

745
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,968
The wrong manipulation of the crystals

746
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,179
could turn time and space inside out.

747
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,015
What do you need from us?

748
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,102
The Zarn lacks only one thing
to enact his evil plan.

749
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,107
A device to amplify tachyons and
unleash the full power of the crystals.

750
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,569
Well, Marshall's created a device
that isolates tachyon interference.

751
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,903
Yeah, I did that.

752
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,238
Of course.

753
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,826
With tachyon particles focused
along the proper temporal vector

754
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,661
a stable passageway
can be opened... Opened

instantly you could help me.

761
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,884
You are a truly
advanced intellect.

762
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,720
I don't know how you
manage amongst these others.

763
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,139
I don't know how I do,
either. I really don't!

764
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,348
Excuse me!

765
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,642
You have this tachyon amplifier?

766
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,687
I lost it on the way,
and I don't know where.

767
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,064
It could be lost in time.
On the contrary.

768
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,399
I detect it nearby. It...

769
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:06,236
Strange. I cannot precisely
pinpoint its location.

770
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,405
It moves.

771
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,365
Leave it to us.

772
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,076
If it's out there, we'll find it.

773
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,119
(WHISPERING)
Not so fast, amigo.

774

trust a dude in a tunic. "

775
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,583

You live by that rule?

776
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,293
Yes. It's never led me astray.

777
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,796
All right, come on. Enik,
are you well enough to travel?

778
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,592
No. My place is here in the
pylon. I must protect the crystals.

779
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,762
If you wish to return home,
these crystals are the doorway.

780
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:36,183
Your device is the key.
Find it before the Zarn does.

781
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,814
Bring it to me and rescue
us all. Rescue the universe!

782
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,778
All right, everyone, gather around!

783
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,446
Let's go! Chop-chop!

784
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,739
Hustle up.

785
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,324
Marshall, did you just make that?

786
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,078
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a bit
of a miniatures enthusiast.

787
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,080
It's very impressive.

788
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,164
Thank you.

789
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,042
Yeah, well, I see some
obvious scaling issues, but...

790
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,710
I think
it's pretty damn good.

791
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,047

of my professional career,

I've done extensive research with
reptiles and various birds of prey,

809

strictly for genetic research
to be used upon our return,

815
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,104
I think it would prove wise to
use this now. Hadrosaur urine.

822
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,868
This was to be used
for genetic engineering,

823
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,038
and I was going to write a
report on kidney function,

but now it'll just be camouflage.
We'll all blend in. Okay?

00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,043
So we will cover ourselves...

Yes. What's the problem?

That means that you stood
under a dino dong with a bucket.

Yeah.

about the size of your brain,

What, did he puke you
out or something? Well...

believe, Will chose to stay.

1582
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,153
All right. Cool.

WILL: Yeah, did you see those
Sleestaks kick the crap out of Enik?

1584
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:17,078
I've never seen
them move so fast.

more, little buddy. Tunic.

Hop up.
I got you, come on.

with Matt Lauer.

01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,882
It's been some time since
my final guest was here,

1612
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:57,678
but after the remarkable
events of the past year,

1613
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,305
he needs no introduction.

1614
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:02,892
He's back with a new book
and more startling evidence

of, you guessed it,

The pipe's allowed.
I asked.

1617
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,856
That's great news.

1618
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,192
You've had quite a year.

1619
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,360
Actually, a stellar year, Matt.

1620
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,529
In fact, I brought
you back a dinosaur egg,

1621
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,532
which my beautiful
partner and lover,

1622
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:21,452
Holly Cantrell, was
gracious enough to transport.

1623
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,703
And I'm obviously very excited

1624
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,705
about my new tome.
- It's a book.

1625
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,874
Sixteen weeks on the New
York Times bestseller list.

1626

Let me get to your
discovery, Doctor, because...

1627

This is for you.
I signed it.

1629

You're supposed to say the
title and the publisher.

1630
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,718
That's not gonna happen.

1631
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,011
- Just say it.
- No.

1632
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,471
Just say the damn title.

1633
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,555
Fine.

1634

Matt Lauer Can Suck It,
by Dr. Rick Marshall.

1635
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,520
I was so surprised that your
attorney signed off on that.

1636
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,397
I was like, "Are you sure?
Is this gonna be okay?"

1637
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:51,857
He said, "Yeah, go for it. "

1638
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:53,359
Son of a bitch. You...

1639

tell him he forgot his egg?
