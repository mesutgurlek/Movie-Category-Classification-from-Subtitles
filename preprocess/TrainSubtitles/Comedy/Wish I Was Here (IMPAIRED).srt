Well, Rabbi,
as I'm sure you know,

my father has been paying
our tuition here at Hillel.

he's taken ill

to cover us anymore.

Oh, yes, I've been
counseling your father.

326
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,491
I am deeply sorry
about his illness.

Thank you.

I hope you're not withdrawing
the children from this school.

Mr. Bloom, if you want
to buy a gallon of milk

342
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,481
when you only have enough
money for a glass of milk,

343
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,327
you must first take that
money from somewhere else.

344
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,930
So, maybe you
decided that

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,243
this week you
will give up honey.

I'm not a honey guy,
but go on.

347
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,043
If I give you charity,

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,569
I must take away funds from
one of the several families

provide assistance.

Families who actually
need the assistance.

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,807
Not just someone who's made
a choice to be an actor

352
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,566
and thusly cannot
provide for his family.

353
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,244
But what about my dream?

354
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,926
I mean, doesn't God believe
in my pursuit of happiness?

No! That's the Declaration

God wants you to provide for
your family, Mr. Bloom.

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,324
I get, like,
these little half-boners.

475
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,044

I figured that out, Jerry.

Can you please
stop talking?

481
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,644
'Cause I have
a shit-ton of work to do.

No, we're Jewish.

Jews ran Hollywood.

502
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,164
I thought so, too.

503
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,960
Maybe we're in the wrong
tribe or something.

504

you're doing in school.

working on in school?

Yay, recess!

539
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,123
No, no, no, no recess. Back, back,
back, no recess. Thank you.

540
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,646
And can you please sit on
your ass and not your head?

541
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,370
An ass is a donkey.

542
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,169
That's correct.

AIDAN: Yes.

I'm in honors math.

545
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,209
We're learning things like supplementary
and complimentary angles,

546
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,320
determining the area of a
three-dimensional shape, circumferences.

547
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,801
I know all that, Grace.
We're starting with...

548
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,644
We're starting with
some of the basic stuff,

549
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,802
and then going to
the good stuff, you know?

550
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,763
You go see Sting

hear a couple hours of

with the dizzery-do.

554
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,405
Dad, I have to
take a choom.

555
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,481
What's a choom?

556
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,130
It's how we say
"shit" in school.

557
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,202
Swear jar!
I don't have any money.

558
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,203
See, that's where the whole swear
jar thing falls apart for me.

559
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,850
I'm the only one
putting money into it.

560
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,570
It's Hebrew for "brown."

561
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,721
Oh.

562
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,927
Got it!

563
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,841
You are free to leave the
classroom for your brown. Enjoy.

564
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,881
Grace, is this
triangle complimentary?

565
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,645
Or is it one of
those supplementary guys?

566
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,803
A triangle can't be
complimentary or supplementary.

567
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,690
Only the angles that comprise
it can be judged that way.

568
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,762
Right. Good.
Good, exactly.

569
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,922
The triangle that you drew,
albeit poorly, is isosceles,

570
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,686
meaning that at least two of
its sides are equal in length.

571
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Right.

572
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,041
So, for example,

573
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,809
what angle is complimentary
to a 45-degree angle?

574
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,562
Well, if they're
gonna add up to 90,

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,971
it would be
a 45-degree angle.

576
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,367
Correct.
Yes!

577
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,363
Good. Now for
a supplementary angle...

578
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,482
Hey! Hey!

579

What are you doing, man? We're
in the middle of a lesson.

580
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,810
I lied about
having to <i>choom,</i> Dad.

581
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,405
I just wanted to
kill the triangle.

582
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,960
No! Well, turn it off. We are
in the middle of school.

583
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,121
This isn't fun time.

584
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,448
I was pretending
the triangle was Arab.

Not all Arabs are bad.

Arabs want to kill Jews.

589
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,731
Well, Levi Goldfarb is wrong.
That's not true at all.

590
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,245

No, that's Al Roker.

596
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,408
Al Roker wants
to kill Jews?

No, buddy, he's very good
friends with Matt Lauer.

Yes, Grace is the

do you want to teach us?

I know it looks weird,
but they're having a lesson.

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,085
Aidan, why are the children
duct-taped to chairs?

627
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,801
They wouldn't listen to me.

628
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,291
I couldn't get
control of them, Sarah.

629
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,443
They asked about al-Qaeda. I have to
work on this audition for tomorrow,

630
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,808

You can't just
show the kids videos,

634
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,921

force them into learning.

635

Well, then what's
your idea?

636
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,282
Because they're fighting
every single thing I try.

637
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,727
We need to regroup.

638

Why don't we go to dinner?

three hours of babysitting,

641
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,205

and said box is in mint condition.

642
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,044
It is. It's brand-new.

643
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,920
Can I keep them
taped up like that?

644
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,364
No. No.

the beach reading a book,

651
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,249
and you were
taking those lessons.

652

And I was watching you

653

and you kept
trying to get up,

654
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,846
trying to get up, and
then you finally got up.

655

And I couldn't see your face
'cause you were kinda far out.

It wasn't even
a real show.

You were just, like, in the

I was terrified that
I'd never ever find

682

that kind of passion
in my life.

I haven't.

But did Dr. Becker give
you any new information?

788
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,250
Did he say
anything about...

789
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,045
A few months.
Maybe a year.

790
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,644
Or as long as it takes
them to finish the 405.

I just always imagined

I'd have a better handle on what I
believed by the time we had kids.

This is the spot where
I had one of the deepest,

most sincere, spiritual
moments of my life.

What's an "aniffany"?

An epiphany is when
you realize something

needed to realize.

one of the reasons.

Okay, but he didn't do (QUIETLY) a
black guy voice or anything, did he?

938
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,526
He didn't do
anything racial?

939
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,725
No, it was high-pitched.

945

I know we don't
always run things

946
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,520
according to the book
around here,

947
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,444
but I think you need to
lighten up a little bit.

948

Nobody's trying
to touch you.

949

penis talk like a rapper.

967

AIDAN: Aren't you a little
old for playing dress-up?

968
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,690
It's hardly playing
dress-up, Aidan.

969
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,762
It's for Comic-Con.
The top prize is $1,000.

some congratulatory poontang

One day.

and then we'll
go see Dad, okay?

979
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,124
Oh, yeah, right. I've been meaning
to talk to you about that, Aidan.

980

here and plus, I'm not going.

982
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,250
Dude, what's the point? I haven't
seen him for, like, a year.

983
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,810
I guess my tolerance
for being called

984
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,291
a disappointment has
an expiration date.

985
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,562
You haven't spoken
to Dad in a year?

986
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,081
No. The last time he called
me was on my birthday.

987
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,448
I think my present was a
20-minute thesis on why I suck.

988
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,609
So you're just
gonna cut him off.

989
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,807
Dude, you gotta see this
from my perspective, okay?

990
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,089
You at least have
a wife and a family.

991

all he sees is failure.

Well, what about Grandma?

993
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,163
No. My mom believed in me.

994
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,765
With her,
things were different.

995
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,729
She at least made him
a tad bit nicer.

996
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,802
But with my dad...

997
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,326
Nope, never gave him any
reason to be proud of me.

998

We both spent our entire lives
wishing we could be something great.

1003
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,522
And now we're finally
called upon to do something

1004
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,729
that requires some actual
bravery and you run and hide.

officially a man at my Bar Mitzvah.

1089
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,361
So I told him that,
as a man,

1090
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,761
I wanted to have a bacon
double cheeseburger.

1091
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,081
(LAUGHING)

1092
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,128
I think I saw
his head explode.

1093
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,087
But to his credit,
he let me eat

1094
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,811
whatever I wanted
outside the house.

1095
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,491
I think I impressed
him with my logic.

1096
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,802
What brings you
to temple, Aidan?

1097
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,890
When we were kids,
my brother and I

1098
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,530
used to pretend
we were these

1099
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,120
superhero space-men.

1100
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,962
We'd go out to
the woods behind our house

1101
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,203
and pretend it was
this mystical planet

1102
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,090
and we were the only ones
who could save everybody.

1103
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,206
But I've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

1104
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,768
Remembering those fantasies
for the first time in, like,

1105
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,205
14 years.

1106
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,686
What do you
think it means?

1107
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,410
I don't know. And I'm even
embarrassed to say this out loud,

1108
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,006
but if I can't say it to you,
I can't say it to anybody.

1109
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,410
Do you think

1110
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,565
God is trying to
tell me something?

1111
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,601
Trying to guide me
in some way?

1112
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,685
And if you say He works in mysterious
ways, I will run out that door.

1113
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,369
Do you feel any spiritual
connection at all to anything?

1114
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,365
Infinity.

1115
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,207
Looking up at
the sky with my kids

1116
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,409
and trying to explain to them
that it goes on forever.

1117
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,009
I do feel
a spirituality in that.

1118
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,565
Could that be God?

1119
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,361
God can be whatever
you want him to be.

1120
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,966
You're getting
tangled in semantics.

1121
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,850
Try not to get caught up in the
God who wants you to be kosher,

1122
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,241
and the God who wants
you to study the Torah.

1123
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,648
Start with God as
the infinite universe,

1124
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,210
and imagine that
that force may be

1125
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,282
trying desperately
to guide you

1126
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,405
through the most challenging
part of your life.

1127
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,250
Even if it has to appear to you
in the form of a space-man

1128
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,130
to get you to listen.

1129
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,446
Why does Grandpa
have baby jellyfish?

1130
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,249
Those aren't
jellyfish, buddy.

1131
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,802
Believe it or not,
those are contact lenses.

1132
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,805
Your grandpa saved all the
contact lenses he ever wore.

1133
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,001
Why?

1134
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,248
AIDAN: He said he just couldn't
bear to throw them out

1135
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,442
'cause it's
everything he ever saw.

1136
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,810
It's weird, right?

1137
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,480
I know, but it's kinda
good-weird. I like it.

1138
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,608
Well, he must have
seen a lot of stuff.

1139
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,728
He did. If you think about
it, all those years,

1140
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,724
all the things that he saw with
his eyes through those lenses.

1141
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,368
Also, before he retired, he
was a microbiology professor.

1142
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,680
TUCKER: What's that?

1143
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,125
AIDAN: That's someone
who studies things

1144
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,282
you can only see
with a microscope.

1145
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,603
So, really, really,
really tiny things. Hey!

1146
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,804
I know the albums
are fascinating,

1147
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,281
but I could use a little help
getting this place set up

1148
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,840
so it's nice and cozy for
when Grandpa comes home.

1149
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,880
So, if Grandpa's dying,
then why is he coming home?

1150
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,843
Because we don't want Grandpa to
be alone in a scary hospital.

1151
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,844
We want him to come home and be
with his family, be with us.

1152
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,601
So we're making him all cozy so
he's happy when he meets God?

1153
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,481
Yeah.

1154
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,167
Whoa! When did Grandpa
have this cool car?

1155
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,800
(LAUGHING)
Look at that thing.

1156
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,169
That, my friends, is a '62 Cadillac.
Look at those fins.

1157
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,968
Look how happy
he was, huh?

1158
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,170
Why, this was
taken at a dealership.

1159
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,651
He could never
afford that car.

1160
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,521
That sucks.

1161
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,726
It does suck.

1162
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,011
It's cool.

1163
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,604
Hello.
Welcome to Aston Martin.

1164
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,605
Hello. Um,
my name is Marco

1165
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,810
and I work for Sean "Puff
Daddy" "Dirty Money" Combs.

1166
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,523
Um, these are
Puffy's children,

1167
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,126
and he's asked me to
come in and test drive

1168
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,090
the new Aston Martin
DB9 Volante.

1169
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,761
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1170
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,046
Of course.

1171
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,246
Please, come right here.

1172
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,401
Be good, children.

1173
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,761
I know what
you're thinking.

1174
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,928
"Why are Puffy's
kids white?"

1175
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,125
Valid question.

1176
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,444
Well, so many celebrities were
going and adopting black children.

1177
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,851
You know what he went and did?
Mmm-mmm.

1178
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,049
He went to Switzerland and adopted
these two skim-milk popsicles.

1179
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,287
Tucker! Do not.
Tucker, it's not funny.

1180
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,725
I know what
you're trying to do.

1181
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,801
You do?

1182
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,440
Do you know how many
people walk in here

1183
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,642
and try to sweet-talk
their way into

1184
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,484
test-driving one
of these bad boys?

1185
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,404
So annoying.
Hey! I never fall for it.

1186
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,969
But I can see
your daughter's sick.

1187
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,642
So, you know what?
I'm gonna make an exception.

1188
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,131
And you don't even
look good in the wig.

1189
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,486
So take it off,
like, seriously.

1190
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,925
TUCKER: No way.
GRACE: It's my wig.

1191
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,610
She is sick, isn't she?

1192
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,764
Have some respect.

1193
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,531
So sick.
Mmm...

1194
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,846
(ENGINE REVS)
Okay, attendance.

1195
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,160
Grace.
Here!

1196
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,004
Tucker.
Here.

1197
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,682
What's your name?
Anthony.

1198
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,046
Anthony's here, too, Dad.

1199
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,248
AIDAN: All right, Anthony.
Welcome to our classroom.

1200
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,442
Now, kids, unless
you're on the Autobahn,

1201
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,807
you're never gonna get a
car like this up to speed.

1202
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,809
So in a city like LA,

1203
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,484
it's really about
what it sounds like

1204
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,164
when you floor it
from a full stop.

1205
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,481
Yes, but, kids, we're
on Robertson Boulevard.

1206
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,130
So there will
be no flooring it

1207
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,725
from a full stop,
will there be?

1208
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,088
No, sir.
Thank you.

1209
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,764
(GRACE SCREAMING)
(TUCKER CHEERING)

1210
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,971
Did I scare you?

1211
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,649
I thought if I ever
saw you here alone,

1212
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,683
you'd be putting
a pillow over my face.

1213
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,924
I looked.

1214
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,764
You're lying on
the only two in the room.

1215
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,921
(CHUCKLES)

1216
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,685
I've been watching
the paramedics

1217
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,171
come and go for
the last half-hour.

1218
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,561
And every few minutes
they race in at full speed

1219
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,520
doing everything they can
to save someone's life

1220
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,291
and then a few
minutes later,

1221
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,011
they all walk outside
and smoke cigarettes.

1222
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,728
You never really think about
death until you're here.

1223
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,801
(SIGHS)

1224
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,771
Chemicals pumping into your veins
while you watch Maury Povich.

1225
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,441
I'm unclear which one
is killing me faster.

1226
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,087
(LAUGHING)

1227
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,525
Can I offer you
some saline?

1228
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,365
I'm glad to see you're
keeping your sense of humor.

1229
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,044
What else am I
supposed to do?

1230
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,651
Eventually things
get tragic enough

1231
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,404
and they circle
back to comedy.

1232
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,203
(SIGHS) Yeah.

1233
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,885
You know, I don't think
I ever told you this,

1234
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,530
but when I lost my sister, you were
the most helpful person to me.

1235
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,644
Really?
Yeah.

1236
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,683
I mean, I'm glad if I was, but I
don't even remember what I said.

1237
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,891
You said,

1238
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,329
"Nothing in life will call
upon us to be more courageous

1239
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,926
"than facing
the fact that it ends.

1240
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,489
"But on the other side of
heartbreak is wisdom."

1241
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,361
I said that?

1242
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,601
Yeah.

1243
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,251
That was good advice.

1244
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,761
(LAUGHING)

1245
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,846
And now here I am, a <i>shiva
</i> waiting to happen. (SIGHS)

1246
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,604
Well, the wisdom
that came out for me

1247
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,921
was that the things left
unsaid stay with us forever.

1248
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,211
I wish nothing more

1249
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,886
than if I could tell my
sister how much I loved her

1250
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,007
and that I
always idolized her.

1251
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,285
But we never said
those things.

1252
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,567
We just weren't
like that.

1253
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,089
And suddenly one day
she's gone.

1254
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,446
And I have all
these things to say,

1255
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,806
but no one to say them to.

1256
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,081
(SIGHS)

1257
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,847
Both my boys
know how I feel.

1258
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,004
Are you sure, Gabe?

1259
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,645
I told them
I wanted to retire.

1260
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,651
I lied.

1261
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,124
They pushed me out.

1262
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,084
'Cause I wasn't keeping
up with technology.

1263
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,921
Don't let anyone
push them out.

1264
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,888
Have you told them this?

1265
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,525
What is this?

1266
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,362
Is this an intervention?

1267
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,406
Did you come here to tell
me howl failed as a father?

1268
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,641
No!

1269
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,201
(SIGHS)

1270
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,127
Not at all. You've raised
two incredible boys, Gabe.

1271
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,004
They may not
have quick answers

1272
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,447
or awards
on their mantles.

1273
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,884
In fact, neither one
of them has a mantle.

1274
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,764
But they're incredible,

1275
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,966
with big, sensitive hearts.

1276
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,370
And right now
they need to know

1277
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,363
how much their
father loves them.

1278
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,247
Barbara used to help you with the
hard part of parenting, right?

1279
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,208
She made everyone
around her happy.

1280
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,482
She just brought out
the best in me.

1281
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,647
I think if she were here right
now she'd tell you that

1282
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,048
your boys will remember this time
for the rest of their lives.

1283
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,520
It will shape who
they are as men.

1284
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,651
You're gonna make a great
matriarch one day.

1285
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,445
I already am
a great matriarch, Gabe.

1286
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,968
At least
I'm working on it.

1287
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,640
Today, we are going to Mr. Miyagi
the shit out of this fence.

1288
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,086
Who's Mr. Miyagi?

1289
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,561
Mr. Miyagi is
an older Asian man

1290
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,324
that taught me
many life lessons.

1291
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,765
The point is I'm sick of
looking at this fence.

1292
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,320
Today we're gonna fix it.

1293
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,886
Tucker, where's
your drill?

1294
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,803
It's under my pillow.
Please go get it.

1295
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,801
<i>Whoa-hem Okay,
Grace, some up here.</i>

1296
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,966
Hop on the diving board.

1297
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,166
Okay-

1298
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,129
You are going to
recite this poem

1299
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,884
while Tucker and I
work on the fence.

1300
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,011
Then we'll switch.

1301
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,561
This is weird.

1302
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,686
Think of it as a prayer you're
not expecting anyone to answer.

1303
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,809
All right, Tuck, good. Come over here.
Put the drill down.

1304
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,928
We're gonna use it later
when we put 'em back up.

1305
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,446
Come over here
with this crowbar.

1306
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,047
And the point is to jam it in
here and then use your leverage.

1307
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,645
Slide your arms down.
Yeah!

1308
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,404
Oh! You're
a natural at this.

1309
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,729
Next up, we're gonna
re-plaster that pool.

back there?

I'm comforting you.

1325

You've been going
through a lot lately.

1326

Thank you, baby.

They don't deserve a break.

They need to work harder.

1338

This is the little hand that took
so long to plaster anything.

No, no, no,
nothing like that.

1365

Yeah.

1390

You and Noah would hear
the music and light up.

01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,361
to figure out how to
handle this situation.

1548
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,010
Situation?

1549
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,566
If you ever so much as
exhale near my wife again,

1550
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,802
I promise to sue you
for sexual harassment.

1551
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:35,608
Stay away from my wife,
you wretched piece of shit.

1552

1555
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,161
(GROANS)

1556
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,324
That did not
go as planned.

1557
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,526
Are you okay?

1558
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,045
I think you
lost, Dad.

1559
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,770
Here, put this
on your eye.

1560
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,281
(PANTING)

1561
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,689
We gotta go. Come on.

1562
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,840
Hey-

1563
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,400
Honey, oh, my God!
What happened to your eye?

1564
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,801
I ran into Jerry
at the supermarket.

1565
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,849
Oh, my God.

1566
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,246
Hey, Dad, I'm here.

1567
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,089
Look, I'm here.
Toasted almond.

1568
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,330
What happened
to your eye?

1569
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,966
Oh. Don't worry
about it, Dad.

1570
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,560
Don't worry about
that at all.

1571
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,483
The point is
I'm here, okay?

1572
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,684
I'm here and Sarah's here
and the kids are here.

1573
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,089
And the rabbis are here
and we all love you.

1574
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,211
I'm sorry, I don't think
Noah's gonna make it, Dad.

1575
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,850
I did everything I could.

1576
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,801
Hmm.

1577
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,244
Thank you, Aidan.

1578
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,844
For what, Dad?

1579
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:09,604
For doing your best to hold this
family together when I couldn't.

1580
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,928
How did you
get that shiner?

1581
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,370
I ran into someone who's been
harassing Sarah at work.

1582
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,691
So, yes.

1583
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,009
You went after him, huh?

1584
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,245
(LAUGHS)

1585
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,330
I tried.

1586
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,204
That takes guts.

1587
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,325
Good for you.

1588
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,609
You showed up.

1589
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,045
How are you feeling?

1590
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,569
I'm not afraid.

1591
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,369
Isn't that funny?

1592
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,042
I thought
I'd be afraid.

1593
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,443
I think that's the bravest
thing I've ever heard.

1594
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,723
GABE: Really?
AIDAN: Yeah, I really do.

1595
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,966
You promise?

1596
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,166
I promise you.

1597
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,450
Do you see that

1598
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,285
or is God very different
than I imagined?

1599
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,528
Noah! That's Noah,
Dad. You made it?

1600
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,046
Dad, it's Noah.
He made it.

1601
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,243
Noah, you're a warrior.

1602
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,128
No, I just won a contest.

1603
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,644
But you won.

1604
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,045
Yeah.

1605
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,764
Yeah, Dad, I won.

1606
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,568
GABE: I'm so proud of you.

1607
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,482
I'm so tired.

1608
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,684
Hold my hands.

1609
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,045
AIDAN: Right here.
Right here, Dad.

1610
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,245
We love you.

1611
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:47,804
If there's a next time,
I'll do better.

1612
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,610
So fast.

1613
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,404
Try to remember
how fast it goes.

1614
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,410
When we were kids, Noah and I used
to pretend that we were heroes

1615
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,248
with swords, the only ones
who could save the day.

1616
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,004
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

1617
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,366
Maybe we're just
the regular people.

1618
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,362
The ones who get saved.

1619
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,531
(BELL RINGING)

1620
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,006
Hey!

1621
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,241
Oh, my God!

1622
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,285
Dude! This is because
of you. I got that part.

1623
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,010
Oh, my God!
Yeah.

1624
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,650
They fucked you up.

1625
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,051
Yeah, no,
you were totally right.

1626
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,441
Soon as I get off the ship, there's
fucking Ractonians everywhere.

1627
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,601

what's your name?

Hey, I'm Paul.

1631
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,641
Nice to meet you. No, thank
you again for that note.

1632
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,440
I was just talking about you in a meeting.
I didn't have your number.

1633
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,009
I work with this little
theater company in Topanga.

1634
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,088
Have you ever given
any thought to teaching?

1635
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,206
Not... No, no.

1636
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,204
Well, look, we have these
classes for college kids

1637
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,486
and we're looking
for somebody new.

1638
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,769
The pay is just okay, but
the people are amazing.

1639
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,084
You should come by
and give it a look.

1640
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,401
Really?
Yeah.

1641
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,403
They'd love you.
Would you come by?

1642
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,806
That'd be really cool.
I'd be honored.

1643
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,530
Really? You'll come?
Yeah.

1644
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,960
I'd give you my number,
but I doubt

1645
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,240
you have a phone in
your little onesie.

1646
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,721
Yeah, no, I don't, but I've
got places I can put things.

1647

(LAUGHING) All right, let's do it.
My trailer's right here.

1648
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,531
Will you come with me just two seconds?
Of course.

1649
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,640
Yeah, thank you.
Wonderful.

that you take it seven times.

Are the Gilberts home?

Nobody home.

Oh, it's okay. I'm a
friend of the Gilberts

the drain at the bottom of their pool.

so embarrassing.

Don't worry. The Gilberts are in St.
Tropez all spring.

01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,767
It's their own
