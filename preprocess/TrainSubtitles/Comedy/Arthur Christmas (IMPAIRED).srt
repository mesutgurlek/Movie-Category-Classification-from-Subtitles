<i>Dear Santa,
Are you real?</i>

2
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,696
<i>If you live at the North Pole,</i>

3
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:32,339
<i>how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?</i>

4
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,590
<i>Are you Saint Nicholas?</i>

5
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,142
<i>'Cause you'd be
incredibly old.</i>

6
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:39,983
<i>How do you have time
to read all the letters</i>

7
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,125
<i>from all the children in the world?</i>

8
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,666
<i>And how many cookies and
mince pies have you eaten</i>

9
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,667
<i>in all of history?</i>

10
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,979
<i>How do you get
all of the presents in the sack?</i>

11
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,750
<i>Does your sack have to get bigger</i>

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,532
<i>every year, 'cause of
exponential population growth?</i>

13
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,834
<i>And how do you
get down the chimneys?</i>

14
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,666
<i>I put my head in ours,
and it's really small,</i>

15
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,207
<i>even if you could
squeeze down in 1 minute.</i>

16
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,469
<i>And there's 9 houses in my village,
so that's nearly 10 minutes,</i>

17
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,181
<i>and there are
millions of loads in the world.</i>

18
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:13,203
<i>It must be so hard
being Santa these days.</i>

19
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,414
<i>I mean, what if,
after all of that,</i>

20
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:17,415
<i>I'm staying at Grandma's?</i>

21
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:20,277
<i>Santa, how can you get
'round the whole world</i>

<i>in just one night?</i>

23
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>My friend said, that
you'd have to go so fast,</i>

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,832
<i>it would make you,

25
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:30,493
<i>and the reindeer,
all burn up!</i>

26
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,624
<i>I think you are real,</i>

27
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,626
<i>but how do you do it?</i>

28
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:35,816
<i>For Christmas,</i>

29
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:39,809
<i>I would love a pink
twinkle-bike with stabilizers.</i>

30
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,229
<i>But, please, don't
bring it</i>

31
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,931
<i>if it makes you
and the reindeer burn.</i>

00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:54,323
my father told me,

321
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:56,325
[snoring]

322
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:57,925
that being Santa

323
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,557
is the best job in the world.

324
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,558
He was right.

325
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,759
I loved it.

326
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,353
I can't wait for year seventy one!

327
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:18,438
Merry Christmas everyone!

328
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,418
What do you get
if you eat

329
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,789
Christmas decorations?

330
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,090
Tinsel-itis!

331
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,044
Isn't this the best
bit of Christmas?

332
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,477
It certainly is, Arthur.

333
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,478
The whole family together.

334
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:13,010
- How about a toast, Malcolm?
- Oh!

335
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,641
Uh, well ... here's to me ...

336
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,642
doing an even better job next year!

337
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,994
I mean, you're
already perfect, Dad.

338
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,735
Ha! That turkey did more than him.

339
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,206
Ha! Ha! H--

340
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,208
You wouldn't understand, Father.

341
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,759
I'd rather move
things on since your day.

342
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,910
Eh, Steve?

343
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,301
Forget Techno Tommy.

344
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:34,713
He's texting on his
calculator after another job.

345
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:38,125
It's a <u>H</u>and-held <u>O</u>perational & <u>H</u>oming <u>O</u>rganizer:

346
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,006
the HOHO 3000.

347
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,477
- I'm enacting mission closure.
- Ooo. Whoopie doo.

348
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,578
Aren't you the Fancy Nancy?

349
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,159
Don't matter what
you come up with, son.

350
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,440
You may be the next in line,

351
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,883
but you'll never get to be
Santa unless you knock him off.

352
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:53,714
Um...

353
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,425
I've got you all a present.

354
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,736
After all the hard work,

355
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,807
I wanted everyone
to have some Christmas fun.

356
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:02,329
Ta-da!

357
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,696
What is that?

358
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,200
(Gasps)

359
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,062
- I'm Santa!
- No. I'm Santa.

360
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:26,083
This is ridiculous. You just took
the piece out of my hand!

361
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,744
Well, I am actually Santa,

362
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,705
so I rather think I should have it.

363
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,186
Well, yes. You're the
non-executive figurehead.

364
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,607
Exactly. The figurehead.

365
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:36,919
It means a fatty with a
beard and fits the suit.

366
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,620
The other pieces are good, too.

367
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,222
Or, I can make
extra Santa's for everyone.

368
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:43,933
Why don't you
be the candle, Steve?

369
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,885
All those bright ideas, eh?

370
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:48,356
Fine.  I'm the candle.

371
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:52,008
Arthur's the turkey.  And you,
Father, are, of course,

372
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:53,159
Santa.

373
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,780
Grand-Santa, you can be
this charming relic.

374
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,511
Relic? Relic?

375
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:00,163
I did the whole of
Christmas in one of these, Arthur!

376
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,804
Oh, yes. I didn't need a

377
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,175
trillion elves in blinking hats.

378
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:08,208
We don't just fly about throwing
lead-painted toys down chimneys any more.

379
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,559
- That space sends you back to Lapland.
- Why?

380
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,640
Malcolm, where did you get those?

381
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,321
Just moving things along.

382
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,933
- Do I win?
- Cheats! The pair of you!

383
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,164
- Mum, are you okay?
- Polar bear, dear.

384
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:20,755
Attacked me on the ice.

385
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,586
Good job I did
that online survival course,

386
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,437
or it would be
one less for turkey next year.

387
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:26,799
Christmas has gone
right down the Rodney hole.

388
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,920
You're a postman with a spaceship!

389
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,021
My S-1 festivized the world

390
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:34,363
at 1,860 times the speed of sound!

391
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,364
Christmas, 1941.

392
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,205
World War II.

393
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:40,217
I did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!

394
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,878
I was shot at, Arthur.
Took twelve direct hits.

395
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:45,370
- Lost three reindeer.
- What happened to the elf?

396
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,261
Fell out of the sleigh over
Lake Geneva.  Never saw him again.

397
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,782
Goodness.  Now,

398
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,513
Christmas crackers.

399
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,815
Sing "Silent Night" backwards.

400
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,015
Who would know that?
[DING]

401
00:22:55,015 --> 00:23:00,959
♪ tneliS thgin! yloH thgin!
llA si mlac, lla si thgirb. ♪♪

402
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,610
I went on alone.

403
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,371
I could still do it now, Arthur.

404
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:07,042
- Just gimme a go!
- In a heap of sticks.

405
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,454
Heap of--
I'll show you,

406
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,125
Rumpy the robot!

407
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:14,947
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my. That won't make--

408
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,948
- I would've won, anyway.
- What?

409
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:21,081
Oh, yeah! Run away,
now that you're losing!

410
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,014
Steve!

411
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:29,195
Steve! Don't be upset.

412
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:32,167
Look:  You keep this.

413
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:35,309
Then you can be Santa next time.

414
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,621
That'll be you there, Steve.

415
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,932
Next year, I bet.

416
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,194
You'll be great.

417
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,185
How many times, Arthur?

418
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,187
It's the North Pole.

419
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,578
Shut the doors!

420
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,201
I secured the gift, sir.
Gift secured.

421
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,782
It just can't be.
The system is foolproof.

422
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:59,884
- It has to be an error, sir.
- Error!?

423
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:03,366
I spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows, sir.

424
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:05,507
I am actually trained in wrapping.

425
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,138
But I say to myself, "Bryony,"

426
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,889
the wrapping looks okay.
Thank goodness!

427
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:13,882
- But that present should not be lying in the--
- Yes. Yes. Thank you, soldier.

428
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:16,623
Someone got the wrong present?
That's awful!

429
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,455
- Whose is it?
- No one gets the wrong present.

430
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:22,457
47785BXK...

431
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:23,868
Gift undelivered?!

432
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,869
They got ... nothing.

433
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,930
- (shrugs)
- A child's been missed.

434
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,151
Not necessarily.

435
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,154
A child's been missed!

436
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:36,035
Do you want to wake up
the whole North Pole?

437
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,626
Good idea.
A CHILD'S BEEN MISSED!!!!

438
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:40,127
Arthur!

439
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,458
Everything all right?

440
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,169
There's been ...
a glitch.

441
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,831
- We've missed a child!
- Really?

442
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,932
Dear, oh dear.
That's awful.

443
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:50,734
How did you let it happen, Steven?

444
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:51,544
How did I--

445
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:53,425
- I thought it was your mission.
- Oh, no, no.

446
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,346
- This is your department.
- What are we going to do?

447
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:58,758
We must...um...
We must...

448
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:00,019
What must we do, Steven?

449
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,680
There's...nothing to do.

450
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,971
The mission was a success.

451
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,442
We can't leave
a child out of Christmas.

452
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:08,484
Sunrise at destination is 7:39 A.M.

453
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:10,355
- There's no way to get there in time.
- No way.

454
00:25:10,355 --> 00:25:12,356
- Except, of course, the S-1.
- The S-1.

455
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:13,607
- Righto.
- No!

456
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:16,549
The S-1 has just traveled
7 million miles.

457
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,550
- We could damage it!
- Oh, dear.

458
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,212
- And, risk the lives of the elves.
- Oh, dear.

459
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,553
I'll go, sir.

460
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:26,905
Bryony Shelfley, Wrapping
Division. Grade Three, sir!

461
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:30,247
- Who asked you?
- I wasn't called up for field duty this year,

462
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,458
Served up my mission
in gift-wrap support.

463
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,230
I wrapped
264,000 presents in 3 days, sir.

464
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,063
If you want that bike delivered
in a perfect state of enwrapment,

465
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:42,954
- then I'm your elf.
- No one is going!

466
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:44,625
- It's impossible!
- But, this child!

467
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:51,910
It's a margin of error of
0.00000001514834%, sir.

468
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,060
Wow.

469
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,682
I mean, "Hello??"
Where's the champagne?

470
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,203
My department has
delivered the most

471
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,445
outstanding Christmas ever.

472
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:02,446
Oh.  Uh...

473
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,757
Well done, us.

474
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,808
But, there's a child
without a present.

475
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:09,200
Arthur, Christmas is not
a time for emotion.

476
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,622
We will get 47785BXK a present

477
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:15,333
within...the window of Christmas.

478
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,545
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in 5 days.

479
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,706
But, that'll ruin the magic.

480
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:25,770
If there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight;

481
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,000
it can't be done.

482
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,803
Your brother knows
about these things.

483
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:33,654
I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur.

484
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:37,517
But there it is.
It can't be done.

485
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:40,909
Merry Christmas.

486
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:47,943
Arthur,

487
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,944
you're compromising
the wrapping!

488
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:51,765
That is not a toy!

489
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:55,917
Well, it is, but that's not the--
ARTHUR!

490
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:58,469
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon.

491
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:01,631
Child 47785BXK...

492
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:03,242
Where are you?

493
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,773
Ah!

494
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,464
Dear Santa,
and my friend doesn't believe in you.

495
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:10,716
For Christmas, I'd like
a pink twinkle-bike.

496
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,867
Gwen Hines.

497
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,869
23 Mimosa Avenue

498
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:18,711
Trelew, Cornwall, England.

499
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:44,216
<i>Lights out.</i>

500
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,658
This figurehead thing.

501
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:50,680
I'm not just a
fatty with a suit, am I?

502
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,161
Of course not, dear.

503
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,943
No.  I'm Santa.

504
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,064
Children...

505
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,315
rely on me.

506
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,928
- Here.
- Thank you.

507
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:07,780
It's just cheques for the boys
and cash for Father.

508
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,361
Oh, Malcolm.

509
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,802
The 2 billion other gifts, dear.

510
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,204
Christmas has become
such a mad rush!

511
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:17,195
Until you...retire....

512
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,297
Retire?

513
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,348
Sit next to Father,
watching Steve on TV.

514
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:26,161
<i>You are sent a level 1 access HOHO.
Please state your identity.</i>

515
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,172
<i>State your identity.</i>

516
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:30,923
Who would I be?

517
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:34,425
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.

518
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:36,877
And there's...Arthur.

519
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:38,658
Dear Arthur.

520
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:40,529
What a puzzle.

521
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,471
- This one's from me, dear.
- Oh.

522
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,562
Happy Christmas, Margaret.

523
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:46,823
Oh, thank you.

524
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:49,384
I'm still very much
after the two of you, now.

525
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:51,836
Ho-ho--

526
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,647
Night, dear.

527
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:57,599
Good night,
Malcolm.

528
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,992
It just can't be.
It can't.

529
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:06,374
It just can't be. It can't.
It just CAN'T--

530
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,556
What's all this
caboodle, young man?

531
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,407
Grand-Santa!
It's this little girl.

532
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:11,938
- She's been missed.
- Ha!

533
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:14,749
So much for your brother's
fancy-pants technology.

534
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:16,450
No! Steve and Dad
wracked their brains,

535
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,162
- but they said it's impossible.
- Is it, now?

536
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:21,373
Missed a child.
Dear, oh, dear.

537
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,794
Sends shivers down me shins.

538
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,516
In 2 hours,
she's gonna wake up,

539
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:29,078
head downstairs,
search under the tree, and

540
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:33,660
the look on her face...

541
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,952
when there's nothing there.

542
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:38,683
She won't understand.

543
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:41,015
She'll think she's the
one kid in the whole world

544
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:43,556
that Santa doesn't care about.

545
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,108
She'll feel so...

546
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,789
left out.

547
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,323
On Christmas night,
he comes.

548
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:56,874
Gwen can't not have
a present from Santa.

549
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:58,565
Do you know, Arthur,

550
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,306
there is a way.

551
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:01,507
It's impossible.

552
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:03,088
They used to say
it was impossible

553
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:05,509
to teach women to read.

554
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,771
Follow me.

555
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,330
It's--

556
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,512
It's the actual sleigh!

557
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:45,233
Hello, Evie.

558
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:47,494
I though it was
scrapped years ago.

559
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,175
So did everyone else.

560
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:50,356
I know.

561
00:30:51,446 --> 00:30:53,197
Icelandic birch.

562
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:54,848
Arctic balsa.

563
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,789
Built in 1845.

564
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,921
Able to reach
50,000 miles per hour

565
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:01,162
at a height of 40,000 feet!

566
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,673
- With a--
- Over here, you sprig of tinsel!

567
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:10,307
Potash of Carboniloroxy Amilocitrate...

568
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:11,778
Magic dust!

569
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:15,180
Mined from the aurora borealis.

570
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,542
She doesn't still...

571
00:31:18,932 --> 00:31:20,654
go?

572
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:26,417
Not just a hobby, Arthur.

573
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:30,169
Great-great grandchildren
of the original 8.

574
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,555
Dasher!

575
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:42,676
Wow!

576
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:45,928
Dancer!
Prancer!

577
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:49,000
Uh, what are the others called?
I could never ruddy remember.

578
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,402
B-Bambi?
-John!

579
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,193
You there,
with the white ear.

580
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:56,004
And you.
Not you, you bag of fleas.

581
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,786
Uh...
Ah!

582
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,287
- I'm not really good with big animals!
- Piffle!

583
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,209
Don't get bit-mind.
They can smell fear.

584
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,940
Let's hitch 'em up!

585
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,741
Grand-Santa!

586
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:09,332
Ah, excuse me.

587
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:13,164
You can go to Gwen,

588
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,166
on the old sleigh,
with the reindeer,

589
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,167
and the magic dust,
and everything!

590
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,988
It's a miracle!

591
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,419
You're coming too, lad.

592
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,372
Me? On that?
Up there?

593
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:27,373
Pulled by them?
Ah!

594
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:29,154
N-no way.

595
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:33,456
I'm 136. I can't do it
on me own. I need an elf.

596
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:35,458
I can't fly a sleigh!

597
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,089
I can't even ride
a bike without stabilizers.

598
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,290
I know! Let's
wake Steve. He'll--

599
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,391
No!

600
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,392
He's a worrier, Arthur.

601
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:44,633
What if he stops us?

602
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,634
Gwen's forgotten.

603
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,115
You really care.

604
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:50,506
Well, of course I do!

605
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:53,198
I was Santa, too.

606
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,640
Think of your dad.

607
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,491
Lying awake,
chewing his

608
00:32:57,491 --> 00:33:00,312
beard off with
worry over this girl.

609
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,844
Don't you want
to help, for once?

610
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:05,325
Make him proud?

611
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,216
I can't.

612
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,967
I just...
I...

613
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:12,740
No! I can't.

614
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,740
Ready?

615
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,031
No!

616
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,102
Ha Ha!

617
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,223
You promised not to go too fast!

618
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,926
I get travel sick,

619
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:41,797
and I'm allergic to snow!

620
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:44,758
Ho ho!
So you're a son of Santa?

621
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:50,212
Wait! My slippers!

622
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:52,753
They're not **!

623
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:56,856
Dash! Dash!

624
00:33:56,856 --> 00:34:00,118
DAAAASSSHHH!!!

625
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,340
Ha! Ha! Ha!

626
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,972
See? Who's Santa now?

627
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:09,023
Ho-ho-ho!

628
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:12,015
Whoooo!

629
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,937
Aah! Put me down!

630
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:20,510
- What's the matter, boy?
- I'm having a heart attack!

631
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,821
- Ha! Ha!Ha!
- Ga...

632
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:27,043
They've never flown before.
Just gotta break them in.

633
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:31,096
Now: (whistles)

634
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,628
Come away!

635
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:38,360
Dash away!

636
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:51,868
Look, Arthur:

637
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:54,169
All those stars!

638
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:55,780
We're one of them, now.

639
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,592
A shooting star!

640
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:03,095
Stuck that there for
your dad when he was a boy.

641
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:05,366
Dad? He sat here?

642
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:06,607
So did I.

643
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:10,449
Every young heir to the Pole
gets took out by his father.

644
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:14,902
Right back to Saint Nick.

645
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:17,823
We Clauses used to be
the only men in the world

646
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:21,415
who could fly, Arthur.
See all this?

647
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:22,836
It was a gift.

648
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:27,199
Great big ball wrapped in
oceans and mountains.

649
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:31,041
I remember the look on your
father's face when he saw it.

650
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:10,024
Fish!

651
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:13,516
- With horns!
- Ha, ha!

652
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:16,068
Want to help me
make a snowman?

653
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,831
Ah! Where's the seatbelt?

654
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,816
Whoa!

655
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:32,127
Woo hoo!

656
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:34,529
Can Dad do that?

657
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:36,850
Did he make
a snowman for Steve?

658
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,992
Robot Roy? Ha!
Ice and cocoa.

659
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,773
Next Santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.

660
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:48,817
- Is that...?
- The map of the Clauses.

661
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:51,679
Used every
Christmas night in history.

662
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,400
Whatever your brother says, Arthur,

663
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,652
it's the same old world.

664
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:01,995
(Both)
Whaaaaaaaa!

665
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:05,967
- What is it?
- No idea! I've never seen it before!

666
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,559
- It's a city!
- New one erected.

667
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:11,080
They're always putting these things up.

668
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,042
I remember the first time
I ran into Chicago.

669
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:16,173
Chicago wasn't on the map?

670
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,655
Now then,
where are we?

671
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,786
Aha! Here we are. See?

672
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:23,918
Oho! No, that's Peking.

673
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:26,229
- Um...Ahead, there's a--
- Whoa!

674
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,301
They can see us!

675
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:31,332
Well, pull the camouflage lever!

676
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:36,585
Now, then. We'd better draw in
a few of these sky-scratchers. Just...

677
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:40,377
Well, that's a steam train, you ninny!

678
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,540
So, what do they call this place?

679
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,842
To-ron-to.

680
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:52,765
- Toronto's in Canada!
- The Santa's always come through Canada.

681
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:54,766
Nobody lives here.

682
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,887
It's nice and quiet.

683
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,789
'Til your brother came
along, with all his,

684
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,270
"You can't cut through
Saigon. There's a war." rubbish.

685
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:05,222
I don't need him to tell me
what's ahead. I've got eyes.

686
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:07,714
Grand-Santa!!

687
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,317
Ah! It's an elf!

688
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:14,688
Bryony Shelfley. Ow!

689
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:17,029
This is more stronger
than your gift wrap, sir,

690
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,200
- but I can fix it.
- A stowaway.

691
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,691
I can wrap anything, sir,

692
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:22,923
with three bits
of sticky tape. Three.

693
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,164
Good.
Wrap yourself a parachute.

694
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,215
Grand-Santa!

695
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:30,747
Ah!

696
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:40,583
Toronto.

697
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,184
- Present and correct.
- Not quite, sir.

698
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:46,186
You've lost one of the reindeer!

699
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:57,463
Quantitative easing...
What the...? Hello?

700
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:59,774
- What elf?
<i>- Bryony Shelfley, sir.</i>

701
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,635
<i>The crazy wrapping elf,
you know?</i>

702
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,707
<i>Security tracked her
to sector 9-G, and...</i>

703
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:06,748
<i>- ...we think Arthur was here.</i>
- Arthur?

704
00:39:06,748 --> 00:39:09,000
<i>Who else leaves
the door open, huh, sir?</i>

705
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,281
The old sleigh barn?

706
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,522
That was sealed up decades ago!

707
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:15,043
After that terrible night,

708
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,315
Grand-Santa sneaked out and...

709
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:19,886
Thank goodness he's
too old these days

710
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:21,977
to get into trouble.

711
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,930
Bash it with a brick, Arthur!

712
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,111
Go on!

713
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:31,383
Grab its antlers and tug.

714
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:33,924
I may just be
a wrapping operative, sir,

715
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,175
but this contravenes...

716
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:35,986
<i>seventeen</i>

717
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,467
specific mission regulations!

718
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,979
I'm in charge here,
not Billy the bureaucrat.

719
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,330
Tug!

720
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:47,883
<i>Eighteen.</i>

721
00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:49,554
Wrap your head.

722
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,574
Come on, lad!

723
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:52,966
You're as much use
as a cheese chopstick!

724
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:55,117
Got it!

725
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:57,118
Oh.

726
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,950
Oh, my big Aunt Betty...

727
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,252
It'll have to do.
Pass it down!

728
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:04,773
What?

729
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,294
Permission to breathe, sir.

730
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:09,245
I have about 9 seconds
left before I black out.

731
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:11,687
One breath.

732
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,348
- Sir?
- I said, "One."

733
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:15,709
Hurry up, Arthur.

734
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,781
Don't we need a whole one?

735
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:21,492
You know, to balance the sleigh?

736
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:24,024
Oh, it won't balance
the sleigh. No. No.

737
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,435
If anything,
it'll slow us down.

738
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,807
So, why are we taking it?

739
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,528
It's for Gwen.

740
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,349
Eight beautiful reindeer.

741
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,640
That's what she's dreaming of.

742
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,992
The jingly bells,
the sleigh on the roof.

743
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,163
- Yeah, but...
- That's what the kids want,

744
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,304
not some spaceship!

745
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:43,726
We're giving her the star treatment.

746
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,357
What now?

747
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:47,358
We have a waker, sir.

748
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,358
With a gun!

749
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,141
That's it, lad.
You distract it!

750
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,372
- Grand-Santa!
- Who's there?

751
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:56,683
Uh--

752
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:58,985
We come in peace.

753
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:02,507
Our craft has to travel
around the world

754
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,508
in less than an hour!

755
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,611
We need the sign
for our slei--

756
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,103
craft.

757
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,554
Sorry I can't pay you.

758
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:17,105
Where I come from,
we don't have moneyyyy--

759
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,804
Christmas, 1923:

760
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:33,555
Had a heart attack at the reins.

761
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:35,766
Left ventricle
popped out me mouth.

762
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,767
Pushed it back down
and carried on.

763
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,589
Ha, ha.

764
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:42,090
Big, isn't it?
The Atlantic.

765
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,001
You think we should
stop and ask someone?

766
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,593
Pishy whipper!
We're nearly there!

767
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:48,974
See? I take the
North Star there

768
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:50,345
as a fixed point,

769
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,466
then I plot my bearings from--

770
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,127
That's a plane, sir.

771
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:56,829
Insubordination!
I'll have you harpooned, elf.

772
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,050
I thought it would be
chillier near England.

773
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,981
Uh...globular warming.

774
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:02,872
Ha! Land ahoy!

775
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:05,164
There it is!
Told you.

776
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:13,989
Now, now.
There you go.

777
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,672
Wow!

778
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:21,133
England.

779
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,825
Maybe we've come
to the right a bit.

780
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:25,706
We're a reindeer short.

781
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:27,927
France.
<i>Bonjour.</i>

782
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:30,829
<i>Ou est le boulangerie?</i>
(Where is the bakery?)

783
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,540
They have elephants in France?

784
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,782
The odd stray.
They breed in the drains.

785
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,163
This way.

786
00:42:38,283 --> 00:42:41,655
<i>Buenos Días. Hola.</i>
(Good day. Hello.)

787
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,098
Paris zoo.

788
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,711
Then this is where
they keep the lions!

789
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:56,034
They won't eat me.
I'm Santa!

790
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:58,075
Lie down!
Right.

791
00:42:58,115 --> 00:43:00,256
- Call the keeper!
- How old is this?

792
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:02,788
Atlantis?
Here be cannibals?

793
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,789
You gotta watch out for cannibals.

794
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,811
This isn't France, is it?

795
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:10,202
Technically, it's North Africa.
Ah!

796
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:12,223
Serengeti National Park,
Tanzania.

797
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,844
Rubbish. How can
you possibly be sure?

798
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:16,105
The GPS in the HOHO, sir.

799
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,806
Take her!
Take the elf!

800
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,247
GPS?
Why didn't you say?

801
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:21,138
I'm a wrapping elf.
I don't navigate.

802
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,840
I wrap! I use it
to draw pictures of bows.

803
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,002
She's right. You've
brought us to Africa!

804
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:29,814
I've seen it on a stamp.

805
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:32,465
I'm too young
to die, Arthur!

806
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:37,138
Do something!
Arthur!!!!!!

807
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,292
The old sleigh?
What is happening here?

808
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,784
It was supposed to be chopped
up for firewood decades ago!

809
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,295
- Who on Earth would be that devious?
- Old people, sir.

810
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:51,877
Shall I get you
your stress ball?

811
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,688
We have a finer
comms array than the Pentagon,

812
00:43:54,688 --> 00:43:56,239
and you say we
can't contact him

813
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,400
except by some crazy, ancient--

817
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:14,500
Me and your granddad
saw some time.

818
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,992
- I remember, once--
- Wow. Must catch up soon. Now...

819
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:22,855
Ooh, you're in a hurry.
I can tell.

820
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:29,749
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Can't we hurry this?

821
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:33,811
Ooh, you can't rush
the Stigdamater.

822
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,812
Got to play her gentle.

823
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,665
So, what do you
wish to say?

824
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:40,855
I wouldn't worry.

825
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:44,057
It's not like they're

There's always time for a bow!

850
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:26,738
Not that knob!

851
00:46:26,738 --> 00:46:29,149
- Oh! Good night!
- Oh, no!

852
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,691
- Uhhh...
- Something else!

853
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:33,342
No! Leave it alone!

854
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:37,274
My camera!

855
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,763
Wait!
Look!

856
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:19,239
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Wow!

857
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,142
(All laughing)

858
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:30,686
- Whoa!
- What's so funny?

859
00:47:30,686 --> 00:47:33,257
Look what
they've done to my Evie!

860
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:34,408
And the map!

861
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:36,889
But, it's okay!
We've got this! Look:

862
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,701
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

<i>Proceed to the

864
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:43,763
What's the point?
Look at us.

865
00:47:43,763 --> 00:47:45,815
And my camera totally bad-jacked.

866
00:47:45,815 --> 00:47:48,806
- How do I get my picture now?
- What picture?

867
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:49,947
The sleigh on the roof,

868
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:53,359
the eight beautiful reindeer,
and Santa--me--

869
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,710
going down the chimney!

870
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,712
That's what I
wanted them to see.

871
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,153
They missed the kid,
but I got there.

872
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,344
My way.

873
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:05,206
That's why you came.

874
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,437
Not for Gwen.

875
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:12,500

878
00:48:20,395 --> 00:48:22,356
Try them again.
Keep trying!

879
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:25,008
All this about 1 child...
in 600 million!

880
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:27,069
We can turn their **.

881
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,700
Don't worry, sir.
Children are stupid.

882
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,421
Either he won't know
he got missed,

883
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:33,132
or he'll think he's been bad!

884
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:34,303
It's a win-win!

885
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,075
You missed one?
A nipper?

886
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:41,107
What's all this here for,
if you've missed one?

887
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:43,599
Would you please
type faster?

888

891
00:48:59,758 --> 00:49:01,469
Let go of my hand, please.

892
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:04,061
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

893
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,442

00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,771
Woopty-doo.

898
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,323
<i>In 100 yards,

899
00:49:24,323 --> 00:49:26,624
<i>Straight ahead.

900
00:49:26,624 --> 00:49:28,195
<i>You are at your client's dwelling.</i>

901

Steady!

902
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:36,880
We made it.
I survived!

903
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:41,543
I'll walk home,
I'll get a boat,

904
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:46,406
but I am never getting back
in that crazy flying death-trap ever again!

905
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,377
Go on.

906
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,958
Get it over.

907
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,160
I want my bed.

908
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,471
You're not coming?

909
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,224
You have to deliver the present!

910
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:02,395
You put your
special coat on.

911
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:04,116
You're our Santa!

912
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:07,238
I said, me and Evie
could get here and we did.

913
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,819
The rest is just elf work.

914
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:13,682
Go on , Festive Freddy,
sling your hook.

915
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:19,645
It doesn't matter
how we got here.

916
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:20,756
The sleigh on the roof,

917
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:24,198
the jingle bells;
the eight reindeer.

918
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:27,490
Gwen would never
have seen that.

919
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,382
I wish Dad could see this.

920
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,774
It would take
such a load off his mind.

921
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:51,994
So,

922
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:54,776
what are your orders?

923
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:56,167
You're a Claus.

924
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,888
You give the orders.

925
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,499
Yeah! Oh, um...

926
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:02,230
I'm just happy being an elf, really.

927
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,252
You know,
just part of it all.

928
00:51:05,722 --> 00:51:08,034
You want the orderly
to go through the cat flap?

929
00:51:08,034 --> 00:51:10,395
Oh, yes.
That's a grand idea.

930
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:14,478
Do you want
the girl to let you in?

931
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:16,249
Brilliant!
Thank you, Bryony.

932
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,111
And do you want...
Wait!

933
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,682
Uh, the alarm?
Yes! Definitely!

934
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:57,823
Is this your first time?

935
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,781
Bryony?

936
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:38,377
He loves these slippers
even more than you do!

937
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:47,693
Merry Christmas.

938
00:52:48,753 --> 00:52:51,155
When you put
the address into the HOHO,

939
00:52:51,155 --> 00:52:53,306
- what did you see?
- A list of Trelews.

940
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,047
I just clicked on the first one.

941
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,638
Which was not Trelew, England!

942
00:52:57,638 --> 00:53:00,540
We're in the wrong Trelew!

943
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:09,515
They've been watching us.

944
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,497
They've seen Evie!

945
00:53:11,497 --> 00:53:13,738

but as it's the old sleigh,

1278
01:11:10,853 --> 01:11:14,685
we should allow a drift margin
of 1,000 miles outside the Greenwich meridian.

1279
01:11:14,685 --> 01:11:17,407
I put a sweater for Arthur,
your father's pills,

1280
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:20,049
and some nice, sweet tea.

<i>Espresso machine broken.</i>

01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:42,162
Idiot Arthur!

1288
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,023
Send everyone crazy!

1289
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:45,594
He'll destroy Christmas!

get to be Santa!

- Trelew.
- Oof!

1295
01:11:57,391 --> 01:12:00,983
Really, Malcolm, there's
no harm in using a manual. Men...

1296
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:04,945
Margaret, I order you to disembark.
It's not safe.

1297
01:12:04,965 --> 01:12:08,177
Piffle. I did a bite of
light-flying course on the Internet.

1298
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:10,899
It can't be that different.

Malcolm! You
told me he knew!

1303
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:20,814
You know how Steve
feels about his S-1.

1304
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:22,335

1306
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:25,477
I'm flying to this child!

1307
01:12:26,368 --> 01:12:29,399
She's all that matters!
Not me, your son!

1308
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:33,552
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight! No.

1309
01:12:34,192 --> 01:12:36,494
This is about that
pool table, isn't it?

1310
01:12:36,494 --> 01:12:39,305
I told you,
you should have written to me.

1311
01:12:39,305 --> 01:12:40,606
I was eight!

1312
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,008
- You're my dad!
- For goodness' sake!

1313
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:45,139
Arthur and Grand-Santa
are out there

1314
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:47,390
probably not wearing
nearly enough layers,

1315
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:50,112
and you two are
bickering over a big, red toy!

1316
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:51,493
I... I'm not bickering.

1317
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:53,924
If Steven could
just stand back-- OOF!

Thank you.

1321
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:12,095
So, since gift delivery to
child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter,

1322
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:13,586
I'll do it myself.

1323
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:15,367
Then we'll pick up
Arthur and Grand-Santa

1324
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:17,508
from whatever ditch
they've ended up in.

1327
01:13:28,815 --> 01:13:30,816
He's not coming back!

1328
01:13:30,816 --> 01:13:32,337
The Santas are leaving!

1329
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:33,727
The children don't matter?

1330
01:13:33,727 --> 01:13:36,179
- Christmas doesn't matter!
- Nothing, man!

1331

It's like 1816!

I know where
we can find a map, lad.

1336
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,092
It's a bit risky, this.

What talk about?
Maybe the aliens come in peace?

1346
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:52,654
They burst an inflatable Santa Claus
in Toronto, on Christmas night!

1347
01:14:53,685 --> 01:14:55,596
Let us attempt contact,

01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:58,437
but be ready
to save our planet!
