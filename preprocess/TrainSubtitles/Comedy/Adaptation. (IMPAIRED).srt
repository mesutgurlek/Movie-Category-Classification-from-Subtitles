Charles Darwin?
Evolution guy? Hello?

You see that nectary down there?

384
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,737
Darwin hypothesized a moth

385
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,449
with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

386
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,785
Everyone thought he was a loon.

387
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,162
Then, sure enough,
they found this moth

388
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,372
with a 12-inch proboscis.

389
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,584
"Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
I know what it means.

390
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:43,838
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

391
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,591
The point is,
what's so wonderful

392
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,803
is that all these flowers
have a specific relationship

393
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,805
with the insect
that pollinates it.

394
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,849
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

395
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,602
So the insect is drawn
to this flower,

396
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,939
its double, its soul mate,

397
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,567
and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

398
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,278
After the insect flies off,

399
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:12,117
it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, pollinating it.

400
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,745
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand

401
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,873
the significance
of their lovemaking.

402
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,752
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

403
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,754
But it does.

461
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,704
Collected the shit out of them.

462
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,916
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

463
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,879
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

464
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,006

had the largest collection

465

on the planet.

so much of your soul in.

miss turtles?

profoundly in love with tropical fish.

in my house.

478

Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

479
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,937
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

480

That's how much "fuck fish."

481

That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.
Cool.

504
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,559
Okay, there's this
serial killer, right?

505
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,437
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

506
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:00,608
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

507
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,319
He's already holding her
hostage in his basement.

508
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,197
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity

509
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,616
and in the process
falls in love with her.

It's a little obvious,
don't you think?

513
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,876
Okay, but here's the twist.

514
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,295
We find out that the killer

515
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,423
really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

516
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,177
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

517
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,556
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

518
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:37,728
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

519

On top of that,
you explore the notion

520
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,526
that cop and criminal are
two aspects of the same person.

to have this modus operandi.

01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:30,254
Any idiot can write narration to
explain the thoughts of the character.

1070
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,214
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

1071
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:39,263
McKEE:
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

1072
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:43,142
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

1073
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,812
You follow? Good.

1074
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,439
Anyone else?

1075
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,652
Yes?

1076
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,532
What if a writer is attempting
to create a story where nothing
much happens?

1077
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:02,035
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

1078
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:05,956
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

1079
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,333
More a reflection
of the real world.

1080
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,669
The real world?

1081
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:12,379
Yes, sir.

1082
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,673
The real fucking world.

1083
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:18,510
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis,

1084
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,888
you'll bore your audience to tears.

1085
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,808
Secondly, nothing happens
in the world?

1086
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,604
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1087
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,690
People are murdered every day.

1088
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,985
There's genocide, war, corruption.

1089
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,780
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world,

1090
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,324
somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody.

1091
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,911
Every day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision

1092
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,538
to destroy someone else.

1093
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,999
People find love.
People lose it.

1094
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:53,754
A child watches a mother beaten
to death on the steps of a church.

1095
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,380
Someone goes hungry.

1096
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,884
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

1097
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,845
If you can't find that stuff in life,

1098
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,224
then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

1099
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:11,104
And why the fuck are you wasting my
two precious hours with your movie?

1100
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,024
I don't have any use for it!

1101
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:17,903
I don't have any
bloody use for it!

1102
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,073
Okay, thanks.

1103
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,161
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1104
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,704
No. Thank you.

1105
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,915
WOMAN 1:
Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.

1106
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,087
WOMAN 2:
This course makes you look at
writing in a whole different way.

1107
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,507
Mr. McKee.
Yes?

1108
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,010
I'm the guy you yelled at
this morning.

1109
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,930
I need more.

1110
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,600
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

1111
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,395
Ah. Right. Okay.

1112
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,772
Nice to see you.
I need to talk.

1113
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,068
Mr. McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

1114
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,570
I don't meet people well.

1115
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,322
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

1116
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,741
It was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

1117
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:08,245
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

1118
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,791
Yeah.

1119
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,254
Well, you know, I could
sure use a drink, my friend.

1120
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,094
"...but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

1121
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,221
Then what happens?

1122
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,975
Well, that's the end
of the book.

1123
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,768
I wanted to present it simply

1124
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,897
without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

1125
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,149
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

1126
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:41,278
I wanted to show
that Orlean never saw
the blooming ghost orchid.

1127
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,155
It was about disappointment.

1128
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:46,700
I see.

1129
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,828
That's not a movie.

1130
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:53,457
You gotta go back,
put in the drama.

1131
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:59,796
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

1132
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:03,175
I'm way past my deadline.
I'll tell you a secret.

1133
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,721
A last act makes a film.

1134
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,725
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

1135
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:15,604
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end

1136
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,106
and you've got a hit.

1137
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,569
Find an ending. But don't cheat.

1138
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,156
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

1139
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,953
Your characters must change

1140
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,873
and the change
must come from them.

1141
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:40,337
Do that and you'll be fine.

1142
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,882
You promise?

1143
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,637
Mr. McKee.

1144
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,305
[McKEE CHUCKLES]

1145
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,434
Have you taken my course before?
My brother did.

1146
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,980
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

1147
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,399
Twin screenwriters?
Yeah.

1148
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:04,528
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein,

1149
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,489
who wrote Casablanca,

1150
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,617
they were twins
You mentioned that in class.

1151
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,537
Finest screenplay ever written.

1152
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,706
DONALD:
Great writers' residence.

1153
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:18,375
Donald.
Hey, how's your trip going?

1154
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:21,211
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog, you?

1155
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:22,587
Yeah.

1156
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:26,049
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

1157
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:31,096
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

1158
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,725
That's great, Donald.

1159
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,394
I want to thank you
for all your help.

1160
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,187
I wasn't any help.

1161
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,565
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

1162
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,860
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

1163
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,738
It's been a wild ride.

1164
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,906
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

1165
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,451
Oh, please!
Ha, ha, ha.

1166
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,119
Please, Donald?

1167
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,787
Catherine Keener?

1168
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,750
Catherine Keener's in my house?
Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

1169
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:02,753
She's great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

1170
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,464
Yeah. Um, look...

1171
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,467
I've been thinking.

1172
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:15,766
Maybe you'd be interested
in hanging out for a few days
in New York.

1173
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,018
Oh, my God, yes.

1174
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,352
Yeah?

1175
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,772
I was gonna show my script
to some people,

1176
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:25,776
and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

1177
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,487
Of course. I'd be flattered.

1178
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,740
Okay.

1179
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,742
Thanks, Charles.

1180
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,243
Okay, bye.

1181
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,051
So, like, what would you do?

1182
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,428
The script kind of
makes fun of me, huh?

1183
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,932
I'm sorry. I was trying something...
Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

1184
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,308
Good. Okay.

1185
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,019
So, what would you do?

1186
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,982
You and me are so different,
Charles. We're different talents.

1187
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,651
I know. Just for fun...

1188
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,028
how would the great Donald
end this script?

1189
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:13,156
Heh, heh. Shut up.
"The great Donald."

1190
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,160
I feel like you're missing something.

1191
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,872
All right. Like what?
Look.

1192
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,837
I did a little research
on the airplane.

1193
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:32,175
"Sometimes this kind of story
turns out to be something more,

1194
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,678
some glimpse of life
that expands

1195
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,681
like those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water

1196
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,476
and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous

1197
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,688
you can't believe there was
a time all you saw

1198
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,815
was a paper ball
and a glass of water."

1199
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,694
First of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care
about flowers.

1200
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,197
For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
Well, but for what?

1201
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,741
What turned that paper ball
into a flower?

1202
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,368
It's not in the book, Charles.

1203
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,954
I don't know. You're reaching.
Maybe.

1204
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:05,417
But I think you actually need
to speak to this woman.
To know her.

1205
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,628
I can't.

1206
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,257
Really.
I'll go.

1207

I'll pretend I'm you.

1208
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,136
I want to do it, Charles.

1209

I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people
