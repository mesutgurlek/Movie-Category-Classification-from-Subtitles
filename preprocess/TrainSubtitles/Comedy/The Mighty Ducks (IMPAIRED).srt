1
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,613
[Announcer] ...The Minnesota Pee Wee
Championship is up for grabs.

2
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,242
Both teams playing like there's
no tomorrow. Duluth, in the Hawks' zone,

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,786
looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.

4
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,664
There's a pass out to the blue line.
lntercepted by Gordon Bombay!

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,000
Bombay! He's got a breakaway.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,711
Across the blue line all alone
for a chance to win the game!

7
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,589
He's pulled down from behind
by Fox of Duluth.

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,842
Fox definitely pulled him down
from behind and this could be --

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,762
Yes, the referee calls
for a penalty shot.

10
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:10,028
Gordon, it's up to you. l don't wanna
see any goats around after the game.

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,365
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot...

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,910
you're not just lettin' me down,
you're lettin' your team down.

13
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,642
[Announcer]
A pressure situation he's in now.

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,396
The 1973 Pee Wee State
Championship now rests...

15
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:49,401
on the little shoulders
of number 9, Gordon Bombay.

16
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,112
[Cheering]

17
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,412
[Crowd chanting]
Gordon! Gordon!

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,166
[Chanting]
Gordon! Gordon!

19
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,909
Let's go, son!
All right!

20
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,287
[Crowd cheering]

21
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,415
[Whistle blowing]

22
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,809
[Announcer] He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!

23
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,937
Little Gordon Bombay
had the chance --

24
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:49,145
All my client did was attempt
to give you what you wanted!

25
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,189
lsn't that right?

26
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,192
This man put his neck
on the line for your greed.

27
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,361
Objection. Your Honour?

28
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,655
Will both counsellors
approach the bench?

29
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,328
[Man]
What's he doing?

30
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,997
l don't have anything to tell you.
l just wanna make a point.

31
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,500
So nod like l'm saying
something important.

32
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,712
- Mr Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?

33
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,589
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.

34
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,050
This drives him nuts
and l love it.

35
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,596
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?

36
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh, Mr Bombay,
l'm so glad you could make it.

37
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,353
Please restrict yourself
to a relevant cross-examination!

38
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,773
Your Honour, the applicability
of societal intent...

39
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,234
vis-a-vis individual action
is well established.

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,195
l'm citing
Minneapolis V. Higgins.

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,367
The appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony.

42
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,580
Now, if l'm not mistaken,
that was... you.

43
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,582
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?

44
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,045
l stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.

45
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,923
[Frank] Oh, you really stooped
to an all-time low on this, Bombay.

46
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,677
l'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low l can stoop.

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
l don't mind losing.
l would just like to lose fair.

48
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,350
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.

49
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,102
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.

50
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,189
lt was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!

51
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,942
Next time do your job,
Frankie boy.

52
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,403
- 30 and 0! l remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?

53
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,531
We don't count that one because
l scored with the court reporter.

54
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,284
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.

55
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,286
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.

56
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,622
What's he waiting for?
l saw him in the back of the courtroom.

57
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,916
How about some kudos here, huh?

58
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,919
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside
seats for tonight's North Stars game.

59
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,338
Hockey? [Raspberry]
Forget it!

60
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,465
Gordon, here's the research
for the Pearlstein Project.

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,676
- Can you get started?
- Jane!

62
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,679
Can't you see l'm reveling here?
Today l'm 30 and 0!

63
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,016
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,061
- [Ringing]
- Mr Bombay's office.

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,606
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right. He wants to see you.

66
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,276
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!

67
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,823
lt was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.

68
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,659
[Door closing]

69
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,286
Gordon, another fine job today.

70
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,123
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.

71
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,710
Score. Don't spike.

72
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,462
l'm not sure l understand
what you mean, sir.

73
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,049
This is a business.
lt isn't a game.

74
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,635
Next time a little
restraint might be in order.

75
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,599
[Tyres squealing]

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,567
* Hey, man, get off my back
l'm doin' the best l can, yeah *

77
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,196
* You bust my neck
Cut no slack *

78
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:51,202
- * Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh *
- [Siren]

79
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,373
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,546
** [Muffled rock]

81
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,217
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.

82
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,930
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.

83
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,058
l guess it was a "widdle" noisy.

84
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,226
A "widdle"?

85
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,188
Okay, l'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?

86
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,899
No, thanks, l'm full.
[Laughs]

87
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,277
Okay, out of the car. Now.

88
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,490
The charges against Mr Bombay
are driving under the influence,

89
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,410
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment.

90
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,081
And to think l almost
stayed home this morning.

91
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,541
l assume you're
representing yourself?

92
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:43,046
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?

93
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,715
Okay, let's talk business.
What am l facing?

94
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,885
Suspension of licence?
Fines? What?

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,263
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges.

96
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,684
But that's solely
up to the prosecutor.

97
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,853
The city of Minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case.

98
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,857
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,736
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

100
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,743
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,621
l own the place.
How about you?

102
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,457
Just goin' over a few cases.
RlCOH Statute stuff.

103
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,836
Oh, l thought you might be
researching your defence...

104
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,048
against D.U.l.
and reckless endangerment.

105
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,218
Did you think l wouldn't
find out, Gordon?

106
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,470
There was no reason to concern you
with it, sir. They have no case.

107
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,141
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
l found a loophole. l'm gonna plead not guilty --

108
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,352
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.

109
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,230
There's not going to be a trial.
l am not going to have you drag...

110
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,399
this firm's good name
through the mud.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,070
l've talked to Judge Weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case.

112
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,949
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence...

113
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,618
and 500 hours
of community service.

114
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,620
And a leave of absence
from the firm.

115
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,999
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.

116
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,419
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. l am.

117
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,006
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.

118
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,093
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.

119
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,723
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.

120
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,810
lt'll teach you compassion,
a sense of fair play, how to fit in.

121
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,856
- Community service? This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.

122
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,109
And hopefully you'll come back
a better person and a better attorney,

123
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,364
which is why l'm keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you.

124
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:37,702
You know, in the early '70s l drove the
tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.

125
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,039
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties,

126
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,208
amps cranked up to about
eight jillion decibels.

127
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,003
All that loud music damaged my hearing,
but l got no regrets...

128
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,548
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?

129
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,260
Community service...
coaching hockey!

130
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,557
l found one!
l'm comin' out!

131
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,893
[Boy] Karp, you finally found
something for once in your life.

132
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,729
Dumpster Dave comes through!

133
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,025
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,654
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.

135
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,407
- Thanks, Peter. Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?

136
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,911
- Yeah! Right there!
- Yeah!

137
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,622
Here, Petie. Here, boy.

138
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,125
A little chili
to keep you warm, buddy.

139
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,630
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!

140
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,258
[Peter]
l can't believe he ate the can too.

141
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,760
[Averman]
He sniffs.

142
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,681
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.

143
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,225
[Averman]
He sniffs some more. He stops.

144
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,228
l think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.

145
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,774
- He squats! He scores!
- Yes! We did it!

146
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,695
[Groaning]
Full load.

147
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,948
Stinks!

148
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,367
[Averman]
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!

149
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,453
- [Peter] Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurryin', okay?

150
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,122
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah! All right! Let's do it!

151
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,339
Oh, come on. Stop!

152
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,092
- Yes!
- Okay! Here we go.

153
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,641
Yeah. There's more inside.

154
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,810
[Karp]
He's takin' off with it.

155
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,772
This guy deserves what he gets.

156
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,656
- [Tyres squealing]
- [Screaming]

157
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,327
[Laughing]

158
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,205
Oh, guys, he saw us.

159
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,148
Oh, my!
[Groaning]

160
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,531
[Cheering]

161
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,366
Rink's gotta be
around here someplace.

162
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,202
Just look for a sign
that says "Personal Hell."

163
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,998
How could he do this to me?
l hate kids. They're barely human.

164
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,459
[lndistinct chatter]

165
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,837
Come on! Over here!

166
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,588
Keep it down, please!

167
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,508
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.

168
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,677
Let's talk, come on.
l'm your friend, aren't l?

169
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,973
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to
stop it. l'm tired of chasin' the puck.

170
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,018
Be careful, man.
lt almost hit me that time.

171
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,895
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
lt's supposed to hit you.

172
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,023
Does that sound stupid
to anyone else?

173
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,948
Good God.
That's the hockey team.

174
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:07,078
Drive out on the ice.
lt'll be all right.

175
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,916
[lndistinct chatter]

176
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,005
l ain't scared.

177
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,592
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.

178
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,136
[Peter]
We're gonna get in big trouble.

179
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,097
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, l just know it.

180
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,528
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.

181
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,657
This is my dominion. This is
a drug-free zone, you understand?

182
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,495
We ain't buyin' nothin'.
l'm feelin' generous today.

183
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,414
So l'm gonna let you get your
sorry vanilla bootie outta here...

184
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,502
before we be usin'
your eyeballs as hockey pucks.

185
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,882
Thanks, bro, but l'm not goin' home
'til l take care of business.

186
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,260
He's got a gun.
Stand back.

187
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,598
Whew!

188
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,184
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.

189
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,687
l'm Gordon Bombay.
l'm the new coach.

190
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,856
[Laughing]
What a joke!

191
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,693
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.

192
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,322
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.

193
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,742
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.

194
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,997
Here's the long and the short of it.
l hate hockey and l don't like kids.

195
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,374
What's this supposed to be,
a pep talk?

196
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,669
l'm sure this'll be
a real bonding experience.

197
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,672
Maybe one day one of you
will even write a book about it in jail.

198
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,133
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie?

199
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,260
Only for a little while.
l'm movin' back to Philly.

200
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,470
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.

201
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,974
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.

202
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,477
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.

203
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,063
l'll decide
who sucks around here.

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,612
- Get off me.
- They really suck.

205
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,035
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.

206
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,204
Passing the puck
over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.

207
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,582
- [Grunt]
- Ouch!

208
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,584
That hurt!

209
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,339
Oh, it's the Connie-meister,
the velvet hammer.

210
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,341
Hi, coach. l'm Connie.

211
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,927
- Do you play?
- No. So what's our record anyway?

212
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,097
0 and 9. One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.

213
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,975
We almost scored a goal too.

214
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,728
So what do we do now... coach?

215
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,689
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.

216
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,692
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?

217
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,321
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us,
"Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?

218
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,034
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast--" [Gasping]

219
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,578
Heart attack. Great.

220
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,206
All right, look.
l gotta make a phone call.

221
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,292
Keep scrimmaging. You, you, you,
you and you against you four.

222
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,629
- We got names, you know?
- l'm sure you do.

223
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,256
And l'll bet they're very nice names.
l might even learn 'em.

224
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,175
For now, l'll be in my office.

225
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,595
Oh, and if you
need anything, fax me.

226
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,806
Geez, what a jerk.

227
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,642
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?

228
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,894
Shouldn't we check
his qualifications or somethin'?

229
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,023
Jeannie, who told you
not to give me my messages?

230
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,277
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?

231
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,363
- On three!
- Jane!

232
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,407
- One, two, three! Charge!
- Are you kidding me?

233
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,243
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --

234
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,286
Hold on a second!

235
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:40,291
- [Kids shouting]
- Hey! Get your mouth off the windows!

236
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,839
- Hey!
- Get off there!

237
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,175
- [Shouting]
- Get off the car!

238
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,888
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!

239
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,100
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!

240
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,477
- ls that a real phone?
- Yes, and l'm really on it.

241
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,521
- Not any more.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,108
- Let's see, who should l --
- Watch the upholstery.

243
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,403
[lndistinct chatter]

244
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,407
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!

245
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,118
[Chanting]
We wanna ride! We wanna ride!

246
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:19,039
- We wanna ride!
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.

247
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,001
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!

248
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,046
[Cheering]

249
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,511
This looks good.
l'm gonna eat it.

250
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,638
- Wow, l feel like Madonna.
- You wish!

251
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,515
Seats ten comfortably.

252
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,978
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- [Growling]

253
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,231
- Yeah, l see your point.
- [Sniffing]

254
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,275
Oh.

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,404
- [Sniffing]
- [Together] Goldberg!

256
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,574
- lt wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?

257
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,410
- Nothing! lt wasn't me!
- Open a window!

258
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh, man! lt's my mom!

259
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,124
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.

260
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,171
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.

261
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,467
Goldberg, why'd you
have to ruin the fun?

262
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,762
Are you out of your mind? What were you
thinking putting that car on the ice?

263
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,056
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.

264
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,101
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take. One crack!

265
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,936
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?

266
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,356
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?

267
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,067
They send you over here to coach
the team and you endanger their lives.

268
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,195
What danger? l grew up on the ice;
l know when it's safe to drive on.

269
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,948
- How do you know?
- l just know! All right?

270
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,994
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be
in tune with the ice universe,

271
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,455
but when it comes to my kid,
"l just know" doesn't cut it.

272
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,542
Charlie, let's go.

273
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,963
- Mom?
- Give me my candy! All of it!

274
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,675
Well, l guess practise is over.

275
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,512
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.

276
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,640
Coach, gonna be
at the game tomorrow?

277
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,269
By order of the state
of Minnesota, yeah.

278
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,024
[Chanting]
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

279
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,027
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

280
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,779
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

281
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,075
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!

282
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,495
- One, two, three, four, five!
- [Whistle blowing]

283
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,922
- Hi, girls.
- Karp! No!

284
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,092
Goodbye.

285
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,162
The hawks. My first game
and it had to be the Hawks.

286
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,333
Gordon? Gordon Bombay.

287
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,336
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.

288
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,421
Why don't you
just call me Jack?

289
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,758
Hey, come back
to see your old coach, huh?

290
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:21,346
Well, actually l'm, uh,
coaching... Pee Wee.

291
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:26,976
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'. You got a kid on the team or something?

292
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:31,189
No, l'm here because l need
to be of service to the community.

293
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,943
How about this, huh? Whoever thought
we'd be coachin' against each other?

294
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,612
Yeah, who'd have thought?

295
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,448
So, who's your hotshot
player this year?

296
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,909
- Anyone good?

Well, not at first,

We're the ones out there

Yeah, it's not like you coach us
or anything. At least we try.

You didn't listen
to a word l said.

00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,544
We can't even win when we cheat.

450
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,964
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- [Connie] That was embarrassing.

451
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,302
Charlie! What the hell
is the matter with you?

452
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,805
When l tell you to do something,
you do it! You got it?

453
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,309
Look at me.

454
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,480
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.

455
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:03,321
Jesse, Terry, let's go.

456
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,824
This is what l gave up
my overtime pay for?

457
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,868
To see my kids takin' falls?

458
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,415
Gordon.

459
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,877
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.

460
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,297
Just like you used to.

461
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,966
You'd spend hours
watching me do this.

462
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,260
What do you think?

463
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,262
ls this sharp enough? Ow!

464
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:12,974
- Did you cut yourself?
- No. [Chuckling]

465
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,393
You always fell for that.

466
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,938
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, l'm Scandinavian.

467
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:22,609
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.

468
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,695
You probably thought
l was dead.

469
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,907
l saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?

470
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,452
You were so busy
screaming at the kids.

471
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,954
l didn't want
to spoil the moment.

472
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:50,261
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.

473
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,098
Why should my store?

474
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,433
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.

475
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,436
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?

476
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,189
Well, l hardly
ever lose a case.

477
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,651
That is not what l asked.

478
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,654
Hmm! l see you still have this up.

479
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,491
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.

480
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:14,160
l'd just as soon forget it.

481
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:19,040
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.

482
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:23,420
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.

483
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:27,340
l found this not long ago.

484
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,594
He was proud of you.

485
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,930
l miss him.

486
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,356
You scored 198 goals
in that season, Gordon.

487
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,817
lt's a shame you quit. You --

488
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,612
- Could have gone all the way. Yeah.
- No!

489
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,782
You really loved to play.

490
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:57,287
You remember? You remember...

491
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,956
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark,

492
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,917
until your father
called you back.

493
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,462
You really flew
on that ice, Gordon.

494
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,131
That's all l ever wanted to do.

495
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,761
Then why did you stop? Reilly?

496
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,890
l saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.

497
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:21,019
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.

498
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:26,524
Just show they how to play. Show them
how to have fun. Teach them to fly.

499
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:31,529
That is what they'll remember long after
you've gone back to being a doctor.

500
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,990
Lawyer.

501
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,535
And long after they've stopped
buying skates from me.

502
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:41,039
Here... there you are.

503
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,416
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.

504
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,336
- What's this?
- Your new skates.

505
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,422
That is why you came here
tonight, isn't it?

506
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:54,803
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, l'm a nine.

507
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:59,683
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.

508
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,954
Here comes Bombay
on an end-to-end rush.

509
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,541
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!

510
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,918
He fakes once,
he fakes twice.

511
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,464
Fakes three times!
Shoots! Scores! Yes!

512
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,842
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What a play!

513
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,386
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!

514
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:23,224
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.

515
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,769
Come here, son.

516
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,065
You look great out there. Come on,
let's go inside, get something to eat.

517
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,443
A few more minutes?

518
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,279
Please?

519
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,615
- Go on. Get outta here.
- Thanks.

520
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,682
[Sighing]

521
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,106
[Knocking]

522
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,904
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away. Charlie doesn't want...

523
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,949
to be on the team any more, and neither
he nor l have anything to say to you.

524
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,660
- Well, l have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?

525
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,870
Door-to-door mistreatment now.

526
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,498
Now the team can feel miserable
between games too, huh?

527
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:33,753
l came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.

528
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:37,757
- What?
- Apologize.

529
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,803
Well... you should.

530
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,517
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.

531
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,896
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?

532
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,736
l was just, uh, walkin'
around thinkin' and, uh --

533
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,742
Wanna give us a minute?

534
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,579
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:17,213
Listen, it was
very wrong of me...

536
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,507
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat.

537
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,345
l never should have said to you what l said to you.
l was angry. l was frustrated.

538
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,891
lt took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right. l admire that.

539
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:32,896
And, uh, l just wanted
to tell you that, uh,

540
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,774
that l'm --

541
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,443
Oh, boy, this is difficult.

542
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:40,779
- l'm --
- You're sorry.

543
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:44,824
l'm sorry. [Louder]
l'm sorry. All right?

544
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:50,038
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be
a lot more fun this time around.

545
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,415
What do you say?

546
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,502
Do you want to stay for dinner?

547
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,380
- What?
- Charlie!

548
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,425
Uh, no, l --
l can't. Uh --

549
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:08,264
Well, what are you havin'?

550
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,229
Mr Ducksworth,
there are two reasons l came by.

551
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,898
First off, l want to let
you know things are going well.

552
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:20,026
l'm learning a lot about teamwork,
fair play and all that junk.

553
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,321
Good, good.
And the second thing?

554
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,199
Well, sir,
fair play doesn't come cheap.

555
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:28,868
These kids, my team,
have no money.

556
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,330
They can't afford rink time,
safe equipment, proper uniforms,

557
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,541
which makes it difficult
for them to compete.

558
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:39,087
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice...

559
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:43,133
with old copies of the "Enquirer"
taped to your shins instead of pads.

560
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,135
The point l'm trying to make, sir,

561
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,971
is that you wouldn't be taken seriously
and neither are these kids.

562
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,891
So l thought maybe
the firm could help 'em out.

563
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,685
How much are we talking about?

564
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,063
- $15,000.
- No way.

565
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:01,526
Wait a minute. Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.

566
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:06,031
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross,

567
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:10,327
the firm that gives back
to the community.

568
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,746
Come on.
l'll get you your own jersey.

569
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,460
* Ooo, yeah *

570
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,880
* Can you feel it baby
Ooo *

571
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,759
* l can too, Ooo *

572
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,347
* Ooo *

573
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,101
* Ooo, come on swing *

574
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,145
* Come on swing *

575
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,272
* Come on swing *

576
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,483
* C-Come on swing
Ooo *

577
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,570
* Ooo *

578
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,076
* lt's such a good vibration *

579
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,664
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

580
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,542
* lt's such a good vibration *

581
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,629
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

582
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,964
Who is that kid?

583
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,966
Thanks, Fulton.

584
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,511
- Fulton Reed. He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?

585
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,389
He only plays football. Some preppie
school gave him a scholarship...

586
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,432
as long as he doesn't play hockey.

587
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,434
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.

588
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,603
He's been accepted to four of 'em.

589
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,440
- Yeah, but l heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.

590
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:26,236
Gordon Bombay?

591
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,738
Bombay was a Hawk.

592
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,157
* ...Good vibration *

593
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,661
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

594
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,748
* Feel the vibration
lt's such a good vibration **

595
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,460
Dude, check 'em out, man.

596
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,462
Holy cow.

597
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:47,924
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?

598
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:52,429
That's Tommy Duncan. He's in my science
class. That's his sister, Tammy.

599
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,473
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- [Together] Yeah!

600
00:41:55,598 --> 00:42:00,020
Go get dressed.
l'll do the negotiating.

601
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,191
Just think of it
as figure skating... with a stick.

602
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,653
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!

603
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:12,407
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!

604
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,826
Mom isn't gonna
like this at all.

605
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,954
So what? You want me to figure skate,
then you gotta play hockey.

606
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,041
What do l know about hockey?

607
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,626
More than you think.

608
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:27,672
Back to basics! Skating!

609
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:32,427
Go! Go! Side to side.
Shift your weight.

610
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:36,556
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.

611
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,184
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.

612
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,228
That's okay, Charlie.

613
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,651
Soft hands.

614
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:52,530
You don't shoot the puck
to your teammate. You sail it to him.

615
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,241
Karp, on your feet.

616
00:42:55,367 --> 00:43:00,538
- You send it.
- Oh! Gross!

617
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:04,626
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it. Cradle it.

618
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,796
- Oh!
- Again!

619
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,090
Concentration, not strength.

620
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:13,677
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on! Wax off!"

621
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,513
Just shut up and try it, Averman!

622
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,224
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.

623
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,685
Good, Averman. Charlie.

624
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,022
That's good. Good.
Now sail it back.

625
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:30,443
Oh! Way to go!

626
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:34,072
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.

627
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:36,491
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.

628
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,868
- [Splattering]
- Oh!

629
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,204
Here it comes.
Nice and easy. Good.

630
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:46,167
- l did it! l did it!
- All right.

631
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,837
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.

632
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:53,133
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?

633
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:57,262
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.

634
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:01,099
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.

635
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:04,436
Coach, l think you got the ceremonies
mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.

636
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,564
Coach! Will you come back here?
What'd l ever do to you, man?

637
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:11,234
District Five! Ready!

638
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,945
Oh, man, l'm gonna die.
l'm gonna die.

639
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,614
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.

640
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,825
- Oh, please! No!
- Fire!

641
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,413
[Screaming]

642
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,583

[Laughing]

645
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,632
This doesn't hurt!

646
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,093
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!

647
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:39,679
Oh! Come on!
That's good!

648
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:43,391
Hex goal! Goalie boot save!
Whoa! Nice shot, man!

649
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:46,353
l'm a dog! l'm a crazed dog!
Come on!

650

[Chanting]
Goldberg! Goldberg!

651
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,861
l am Goldberg!
The goalie! [Growling]

652
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,241
Good! Good!
All right, Charlie!

653
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,244
Good hustle! Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!

654
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,455
- You guys hungry? Tired?
- [Together] Yeah!

655
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,334
- Do you ache? Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!

656
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:13,672
Good! That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.

[lndistinct chatter]

658
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,845
Hey, guys! Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!

659
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,683
Ha-ha! Good joke.
Very funny. l like it.

660
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:27,769
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!

661
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,355
Coach, come on, don't leave me
hangin' like this!

662
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,691
Coach, don't make me
come after you, coach.

663
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:50,375
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks for the ride.

664
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,503
You did real well in
practise today, Charlie.

665
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:56,715
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?

666
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:04,347
Mom and l left him. l don't really
remember, but that's what she says.

667
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:08,268
You know, when l was a boy,
l had to take care of my mother too.

668
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:10,603
Really?
What happened to your dad?

669
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:14,107
He passed away.

670
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:19,529
You do a good job
takin' care of your mom.

671
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,698
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?

672
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,410
- Okay. We'll see ya.
- Okay. Hey, coach.

673
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,704
- What's that?
- Huh?

674
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,873
- Oh!
- Victory! [Laughing]

675
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:33,960
[Bombay laughing]
You've just entered the tickling zone!

676
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:36,046
[Laughing]

677
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,261
So l'm right in the middle of my
cross-examination and l say to the guy,

678
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:47,098
l usually defend heels like you,
you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.

679
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:49,434
[Chuckling]
That's a good one, sir.

680
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,436
Whoa!

681
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:57,067
[Screeching]

00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:03,406
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

683
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:08,745
Hold it!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

685
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,792
Look, it was an accident,
all right?

686
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,461
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

687
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,630
l didn't learn.
l just do it.

688
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,965
Do it again.

689
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,770
Yargh!

690
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:40,151
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?

691
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:43,530
Yeah. Well, one out of five.

692
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:46,908
Fulton, is it true what they say?

693
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:49,160
About the scholarships and how
they won't let you play hockey?

694
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,329
People talk.
lt don't mean nothin'.

695
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:54,040
- Why don't you play for us?
- l can't.

696
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:56,543
- What do you mean?
- l mean, l can't.

697
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:00,964
- You afraid? - No, l mean l can't,
you moron. l don't know how to skate.

Keep your knees bent.

The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?

716
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,616
Man, what brain-dead jerk
came up with that name?

717
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:14,788
As a matter of fact, l did. But l didn't
have a choice. We're being sponsored.

718
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:18,375
By who? Donald and Daisy?

719
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,170
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five? Some stupid number?

720
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:25,423
Better than some stupid animal.

721
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:29,761
l'll have you know, Peter,
that the Duck is one of the most noble,

722
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:32,472
agile and intelligent creatures
of the animal kingdom.

723
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,141
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.

724
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,186
Neither do hockey players.

725
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,481
Have you guys ever seen a flock
of ducks flying in perfect formation?

726
00:49:41,606 --> 00:49:45,902
lt's beautiful. Pretty awesome
the way they all stick together.

727
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:49,239
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?

728
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:53,952
No way. Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.

729
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,080
They know that
if they mess with one duck,

730
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:00,625
they gotta deal
with the whole flock.

731
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,879
Oh, man!

732
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,007
l'm proud to be a duck.

733
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:10,468
And l'd be proud to fly
with any one of you.

734
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:13,096
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?

735
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:23,148
l'll be a Duck.

736
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:27,527
Yeah. Me too.

What the hell are they doing?

Every time you get the puck,
you're the quarterback.

744
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:05,440
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.

745
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,235
Come on, guys. This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.

746
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,571
What a weird-ass team.

747
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:13,823
How you doin'?

748

- You ready?
- l think so.

Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.

Wow!

- [Crowd gasping]
- One out of five.

All right,
Let's forget the past.

754
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:05,333
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.

755
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,961
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.

756
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:12,382
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right! Yeah!

757
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:14,801
Quack, quack.

758
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,929
- Quack. Quack.
- [Together] Quack! Quack!

759
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:21,433
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack!

760
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:25,228
[Chanting]
Quack! Quack!

761
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:28,356
Go... Ducks!

762
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,942
- [Cheering]
- What the hell was that?

763
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:37,782
[Bombay]
Let's go, Ducks! Defence! Defence!

764
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:45,165
Dig it outta there!

765
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,627
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah!

766
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:53,423
Let's go, Ducks!

767
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:56,301
Throw it! Throw it!
To the crease!

768
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:00,722
[Cheering]

769
00:53:07,562 --> 00:53:10,982
Yes! The Oreo line!

770
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:13,902
That's my boy!
[Laughing]

771
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,995
Defence, Karp!
Defence! Come on.

772
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:30,168
[Crowd gasping]

773
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,845
l don't wanna go
to school today, Mom.

774
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,098
- How many fingers am l holdin' up?
- He wouldn't know.

775
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,725
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?

776
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:50,397
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.

777
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:54,317
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.

778
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,783
Get him on the bench, Charlie.

779
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:06,329
Okay, Ducks,
we still got a chance here.

780
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:09,332
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy,
time for the secret weapon.

781
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:13,211
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.

782
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,506
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.

783
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:21,469
[Cheering]

784
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:26,224
Oh, no.

785
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:29,769
- Go! Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.

786
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,319
That's it.

787
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,321
Aaah!

788
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,990
Whoa!

789
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:50,081
[Cheering]

790
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,339
Whoo! Yeah!

791
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:11,227
That tie of yours might be what you need
to make the play-offs.

792
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,396
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.

793
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:16,858
Everyone but the last two teams
are in, remember?

794
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,903
Panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season.

795
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:23,531
So, you beat the Huskies
and you'll make the play-offs.

796
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:27,077
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?

797
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,205
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since l played.

798
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,290
Actually, one little thing
has changed.

799
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,251
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.

800
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:39,881
They redrew the district
lines last year.

801
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:42,300
The lake is not
the boundary any more.

802
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:45,387
You see? You'd be a Duck.

803
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:49,432
l'd be a Duck.

804
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,937
Excuse me. Coach Reilly?

805
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,939
- Yeah?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.

806
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:59,150
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.

807
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:02,862
Banks! Over here!

808
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,948
- This is a joke, right?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.

809
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,076
- Problem?
- No, just a mistake.

810
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:12,831
Are you this boy's father? 450 North
Hennipen, is that your address?

811
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,958
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.

812
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,294
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?

813
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,131
According to league rules, Adam Banks
should be playing for District Five.

814
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:26,636
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon?

815
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,097
l'll expect to see him
at our next game.

816
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,975
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.

817
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,562
My son would rather not play
than play for your team.

818
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,814
Fine, if that's the way
you want it. But remember,

819
00:56:37,939 --> 00:56:41,860
if Adam plays for the Hawks,
you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.

820
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,113
Boy, l'd hate to see that.

821
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:49,117
Look, l'm sorry this had to happen,
but you can see on the map.

822
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:54,080
Gordon? Hey, Bombay!

823
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:57,417
You stop when
l'm talking to you, son!

824
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:00,003
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?

825
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:03,089
The law's a bitch when it
works against you, isn't it, Jack?

826
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:05,633
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.

827
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:09,804
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove,
you and that bunch of losers?

828
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,182
That's right, coach.
They are losers.

829
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:16,019
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.

830
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:21,566
Maybe Banks won't make a difference,
but at least we're playing by the rules.

831
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:26,321
Why'd you turn against me,
Gordon? For six years...

832
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:29,199
l taught ya how to skate,
l taught ya how to score.

833
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,534
l taught ya how
to go for the "W."

834
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,245
You could have been
one of the greats.

835
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:37,207
And now look at yourself.

836
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:41,127
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.

837
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:53,515
Going to the play-offs! Whoo!

838
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,977
One win!

839
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:00,855
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.

840
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:05,443
All right, everyone, listen up.
l got some good news.

841
00:58:05,568 --> 00:58:07,988
We're getting a new player,
Adam Banks.

842
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,657
- What?
- [lndistinct chatter]

843
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,701
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.

844
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,578
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.

845
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,915
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. l say we do need him.

846
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,501
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- [Karp] lf?

847
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,712
All of a sudden you don't
think we're good enough.

848
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,756
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.

849
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:30,677
- What?
- We heard what you said.

850
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:33,888
You said we were losers,
we didn't deserve to live.

851
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:38,768
- That's not what l meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.

852
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:43,064
You were a Hawk, weren't you? Guess
you guys stick together to the end.

853
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:46,943
You know what?
l don't need your stinkin' equipment.

854
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:51,281
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.

855
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,576
- l'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.

856
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:59,164
lf you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.

857
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,461
Where do you guys
think you're goin'?

858
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:11,760
l don't believe this.
[Sighing]

859
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:16,097
All right, l'm goin' up to the bench
because that's where l'm supposed to be.

860
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:20,018
Anyone who wants to join me
can join me. Anyone who doesn't --

861
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,813
Well --

862
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,954
Ten minutes to game time, coach.

863
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,956
Yeah, yeah, they'll
be out in a minute.

864
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:45,085
They're, you know, working
themselves into a frenzy.

865
00:59:57,305 --> 00:59:59,683
Not much of a frenzy.

866
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:05,397
We forfeit.

867
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:07,899
Ducks forfeit. Flames, you win.

868
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,408
Hey. Can l sit?

869
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,410
Sure.

870
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,580
You talk to the guys?

871
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:26,084
l tried. They think l'm a traitor
for even showing up.

872
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:28,837
l guess they
really hate me, huh?

873
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,965
ls it true you were
really a Hawk?

874
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:35,218
Yeah.

875
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:39,431
Peter said you blew
a really big game once.

876
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,433
Yeah, well, Peter's right.

877
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:43,727
lt was the last game
of the state finals.

878
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,396
We were tied 2-2
in the end of the third period.

879
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,398
l get a penalty shot.

880
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:52,402
l go in, l triple deke.
l fake the goalie right out of his pads.

881
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:54,404
The puck's headed in,
and then...

882
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,240
- Clang! Hits the post.
- [Groans]

883
01:00:57,365 --> 01:00:59,743
We lost in overtime.

884
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,912
A quarter of an inch this way
and it would have gone in.

885
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,956
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.

886
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:09,419
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way
and you'd have missed completely.

887
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,421
l never thought of it that way.

888
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:13,965
At least you got to play
in a championship game.

889
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,219
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey. Can l get you a cup of coffee?

890
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:20,597
l'd love one.

891
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:26,436
You know, she has many fine qualities
that men find attractive.

892
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,356
l know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.

893
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,067
So, what kind of guys
does she usually date?

894
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,569
Jerks. l mean,
most of them like her,

895
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:36,696
but as soon as they
catch a glimpse of me --

896
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:39,991
Pow! Warp speed!
They are gone!

897
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:42,285
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, l wouldn't even care...

898
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,329
except it's not fair to my mom.

899
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:47,082
She deserves somebody nice.

900
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:50,168
Are you gonna come over
for dinner again?

901
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:52,170
l don't know, Charlie.

902
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:55,173
l'm not sure
it's such a good idea.

903
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:57,884
See, that's what l wanted
to talk to you about.

904
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:02,389
l, um, talked
to Jesse and Terry's dad,

905
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,517
and he's gonna take over
coaching for the rest of the year.

906
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:08,687
- You're quitting?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.

907
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,689
The guys can't play for
somebody they don't trust.

908
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,857
l trust you.
The other guys do too.

909
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:15,026
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.

910
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:18,113
- l've done all l can.
- No, you haven't.

911
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:21,366
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.

912
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:23,535
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.

913
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,538
We are too! We weren't even
the Ducks until you came along.

914
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:29,708
You made us and now
you're stuck with us.

915
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,710
Charlie.

916
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:38,383
That's right.
The red is oxygen.

917
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:41,219
Now what are the blue balls?

918
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,179
[Students giggling]

919
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:45,432
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?

920
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,726
ls correct.
Now put them together...

921
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:51,938
and you have a molecule
that makes up 96 %%% of your body.

922
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,232
- What is it?
- Pizza?

923
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:56,359
[Students giggling]

924
01:02:56,484 --> 01:03:00,363
- [Knocking]
- lt's the principal. l'll be right back.

925
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:05,285
Work on H2 C03.
lt's a goody.

926
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:11,082
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?

927
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,460
Leave me alone, guys.
l don't want to talk about the team.

928
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,420
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.

929
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:17,756
Everybody knows
he likes you best.

930
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,592
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!

931
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,594
Take it back now!

932
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,554
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.

933
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,765
- [Connie] Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!

934
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,933
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.

935
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,935
[All arguing]

936
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:33,438
Atoms away!

937
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,739
My atoms!

938
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:44,866
You! Sit!

939
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:49,329
Sit now!

940
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,165
ln your seats now!

941
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,466
l have never in my life --

942
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:04,803
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

943
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,805
Quack.

944
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:11,309
[Chanting]
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

945
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:14,104
Thanks for coming by
on such short notice, Gordon.

946
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:16,106
By the way, your court
release came through.

947
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,109
- Congratulations. Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.

948
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,611
So you wanted to talk
about my coming back to work then?

949
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:23,780
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey. Great!

950
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:27,867
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.

951
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:32,205
Gordon, you know
Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.

952
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,207
[Mumbling]
Sir, they're the bad guys.

953
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:37,043
No, actually, Phil is
one of my oldest friends.

954
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:41,381
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together
here to try to work out this little problem.

955
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,217
You see, my son Adam
wants to play for the Hawks.

956
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,511
His older brother was a Hawk.

957
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:49,973
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.

958
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:53,893
lt's a tradition. You understand that,
Gordon. You played.

959
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,563
But the league's
already ruled on it.

960
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,649
We've talked to the league,
and we worked out a little deal.

961
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:02,861
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.

962
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:07,073
The long and short of it is that Adam stays
on the Hawks for the rest of the season.

963
01:05:07,198 --> 01:05:09,909
And then next year,
they redraft the lines.

964
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,746
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.

965
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,748
What's that?

966
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:17,751
That you withdraw your protest.

967
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,756
- That's great.
- Good, good.

968
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,758
Well, that's settled then.

969
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,260
No, sir, you don't understand.

970
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:29,554
l can't withdraw my protest.

971
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,223
- What?
- Mr Ducksworth,

972
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,726
you wanted me to learn
about fair play...

973
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:37,729
and how to be part
of a team...

974
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:40,732
and l may not have
learned everything yet,

975
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:43,735
but l remember something
my father said to me.

976
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,738
A team isn't a bunch
of kids out to win.

977
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:50,075
A team is something
you belong to,

978
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,078
something you feel,

979
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:56,081
something you have to earn.

980
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:59,250
And l'm not gonna
let those kids down.

981
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,264
Gordon, l'm going
to make this simple.

982
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:19,104
Are you prepared to lose your job
over some kids? Some game?

983
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:22,440
Let me ask you, sir.

984
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:26,945
Are you prepared to fire me
over some kids? Some game?

985
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:31,741
Collect your personal
belongings, Gordon.

986
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:37,372
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth!

987
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,374
Thank you very much,
Mr Ducksworth!

988
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,419
Quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, Mr Ducksworth!

989
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:46,297
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.

990
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,051
[Quacking]

991
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:54,806
You may have paid for this jersey, sir,
but you didn't earn it.

992
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:58,351
l'll see you in the play-offs.

993
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,854
[Bell rings]

994
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,944
- Excuse me. There are some students
here that l'd like to see. - Who are you?

995
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,946
l'm their hockey coach.

996
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:14,409
lf you could tell me where
l can find each of them, please.

997
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:16,953
They're in room 223.

998
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:20,999
- All of them?
- All of them.

999
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:26,338
"l will not quack
at the principal."

1000
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:31,176
"l will not quack
at the principal."

1001
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,678
- What do you want?
- l want to talk to you guys.

1002
01:07:33,803 --> 01:07:36,681
- People.
- People, right.

1003
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:38,683
Sit down, please.
All of you.

1004
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:43,313
Okay, don't sit down.

1005
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,690
Look, what's done is done.

1006
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,360
l want to be your coach again.

1007
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:50,904
You're gonna coach
a bunch of losers?

1008
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,740
- No, l want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?

1009
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:56,076
You said we didn't
deserve to live.

1010
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,871
Karp, l was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?

1011
01:07:59,996 --> 01:08:03,041
- No.
- Okay, then you do.

1012
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,710
l didn't mean those things
the way they sounded.

1013
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,588
You guys know what it's like
to be misunderstood, right?

1014
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:11,424
- Yeah, of course. We're kids.
- So...

1015
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,928
Can you forgive me?
Can l be your coach again?

1016
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,556
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.

1017
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,433
He should have been
with us all year.

1018
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:24,729
lt's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!

1019
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:28,608
- We're a team, right?
- [Ducks] Yeah.

1020
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:33,113
l made you guys,
and l'm sticking with you.

1021
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:37,367
So, what's it gonna be?

1022
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,704
We can play tomorrow night and still
have a shot at the play-offs...

1023
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:45,917
or we can forfeit again
and the season's over.

1024
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:48,128
Peter, what do you say?

1025
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:51,131
Well...

1026
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,968
l guess it would help
if we practised first.

1027
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:57,971
All right. Let me see if l can
get you out of detention.

1028
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,265
- Yes.
- Take that.

1029
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,434
You really quacked
at the principal?

1030
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,728
Yeah.

1031
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:07,439
Are we Ducks, or what?

1032
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,274
Yeah!

1033
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,403
Look at your mother.

1034
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:16,406
Let's see how it is
in ten minutes.

1035
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,408
l'm gonna kill you!

1036
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,757
Hey. Wasn't sure
if you'd show up.

1037
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,759
Yeah, whatever.

1038
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:38,261
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.

1039
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,431
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.

1040
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,767
On behalf of the Ducks,
l'd like to say welcome.

1041
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,686
Cake-eater.

1042
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:50,148
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!

1043
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,442
Shut up, Averman!

1044
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,278
[Averman]
lt's just a joke.

1045
01:09:55,403 --> 01:10:00,950
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey
doesn't mean you're a real Duck.

1046
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:30,021
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.

1047
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:33,692
Well, suit up.
l'll see you on the ice.

1048
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:49,416
On your left!

1049
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,211
Over here!

1050
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,547
l'm open!

1051
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:59,092
Come on, right here!
Up front!

1052
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:03,138
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!

1053
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,725
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!

1054
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,438
Yeah! All right!

1055
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:16,109
Way to go, Banks!

1056
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,236
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!

[Ducks talking excitedly]

1058
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:25,618
Goldberg, you're gonna
sit this one out.

1059
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,747
What? You're pulling
the goalie when we're tied?

1060
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:30,749
Listen, listen, listen!

1061
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:33,752
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.

1062
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,713
Okay, Fulton,
you're our extra man.

1063
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:39,883
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.

1064
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:42,761
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?

1065
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,972
No, take your shot. You may only
get one, so it's gotta be good.

1066
01:11:46,097 --> 01:11:49,100
- But, coach, one outta one?
- [Germaine] Soft hands, Fulton.

1067
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:52,270
- Concentration, not strength.
- [Bombay] That's right!

1068
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,648
Okay? Let's get the Huskies!

1069
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,775
Let's go! Come on!

1070
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,495
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one. Let's go!

1071
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:16,753

Shoot, Fulton, shoot!

1074
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:39,985
We won!

1075
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,658
We made the play-offs!

1076

[Charlie]
Boy, this is great.

1077

[Connie]
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.

1078
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:07,846
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano!

1079
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:12,851
- ...Believe this?
- Cool!

1080
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,853
This is too cool.

l can't believe this.

1082

[Connie]
This place is humongous.

1083
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,944
What are we doing here?

1084
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:25,071
lt's a little play-offs present.

1085
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,997
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?

1086
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:36,499
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.

1087
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:40,211
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.

1088
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,213
Actually, l became a lawyer.

1089
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,549
But l'm coaching Pee Wee now
and this is my team, the Ducks.

1090
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:48,720
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- [Ducks] We can see that.

1091
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:50,722
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!

1092
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,766
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.

1093
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,102
lf you ever want a shot, l'll get you
a tryout in the minor league clubs.

- Thanks.
- No problem. Hey, nice seein' ya.

1095

Take it easy.

* Have faith or pandemonium *

1104

to walk upon the sea *

1105

You know, l heard the North Stars
wore the same underwear...

1121
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:59,726
all through the play-offs
last year for luck.

1122
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:01,728
So l'm doin' the same thing.

1123

Hmm. Maybe l should've cooked.

1124
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:08,777
You know, l'm thinkin' maybe we can all
go down to the winter festival tonight.

1125
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,779
- All three of us?
- Sure.

1126

l don't think l should,
'cause l got a lot of homework.

l don't know how they sculpt these.

1134

Hmm, l wonder.

1135
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,767
l used to sculpt,
but now l do mostly paintings.

1136
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:44,062
How do you think
they do the details?

1137
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:48,400
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.

1138

Oh.

You probably think l'm weird.

No, l think you're great.

1143
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:17,262
When l was a little girl, l used
to pretend that that was an ice castle.

1144
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:20,432
And that was my room,
that window right up there.

1145
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,600
And last winter
l gave Charlie that one.

1146
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:25,770
What about me?
Which window's mine?

1147
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:29,274
l want to live there too.

1148
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:37,324
What? What did l say?

1149
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:41,369
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?

1150
01:17:41,494 --> 01:17:43,705
Casey, l was just
playin' around.

1151
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,708
Look, l don't know
how you feel about me.

1152
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,002
l don't even know
how l feel about you.

1153
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:52,505
But l do know there's
a little kid back home...

1154
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:56,092
who's absolutely falling
in love with his coach...

1155
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:58,428
and if you
can't deal with that,

1156
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:00,805
if you're just playing around,
then you better let me know.

1157
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,807
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?

1158
01:18:02,932 --> 01:18:05,727
- l have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.

1159
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:08,730
Charlie's gonna be there
when we get back.

1160
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:11,983
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.

1161
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:14,486
Look, l can take it.

1162
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:19,741
But if Charlie
gets too attached --

1163
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:23,578
Every time this happens,
it gets...

1164
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:26,164
a little rougher on him.

1165
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,919
Just on him?

1166
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:55,151
l'm glad to be here with you.

1167
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,530
Me too.

[Announcer] The surprising Ducks
are still in this game...

Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!

lt's getting rough out there
between the Ducks and the Hornets.

Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots. He scores!

1173

Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots! Score!

will face the Cardinals.

1177
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:51,791
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!

1178
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:54,252
Cardinals with it in their own zone,
tryin' to clear it out.

1179
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:56,379
Pass to the blue line,
intercepted by the Ducks.

1180
01:19:56,504 --> 01:20:00,759
Here's their star, Adam Banks. Banks
has great speed. Right down the middle!

1181
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:04,429
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!

1182
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,431
He scores!

1183

Here's Averman,
now getting it over to Banks.

1186
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,748
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!

1187
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,792
He shoots, he scores!

1188
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,628
Germaine put it off
the goaltender's glove into the net!

1189
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:39,964
And that does it! The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?

1190
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:45,762
4-2, and the Ducks now get set
to face the Hawks in the state finals.

All right, it's up to you, Gordon.

1192
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:13,456
Now, you miss this shot,
you're not just letting your team down,

1193
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:16,126
you're letting me down too.

1194
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,962
Remember, it's not worth playing --

- lf you can't win.

[Booing]

01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:57,829
Hey, Banks.

1225
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:00,832
Don't forget what side you're on.

1226
01:24:00,957 --> 01:24:04,627
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.

[Announcer]
And the game is underway,

1228
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:27,984
and right off Larson and McGill
with a heavy hit.

1229
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:32,697
That gives you an indication
of what you're going to see tonight.

1230
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:35,700
[Reilly] Good hit! That's the way
l want you guys to play it!

1231
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:45,585
The Ducks in green
chasing it down against --

1232
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,421
A hard hit out at centre ice!

1233
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,674
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!

1234
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:53,051
Heavy hitting continues
in this championship game.

1235
01:24:53,176 --> 01:24:56,054
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks' zone.

1236
01:24:56,179 --> 01:24:59,391
Back in again to Larson,
the man behind the net.

1237
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:17,409
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!

1238
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,870
Banks, two comin' hard!

1239
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,581
Banks still looking
for an opening, moves it up --

1240
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:28,378
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.

1241
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:32,340
Here's Larson, over to Brown. Brown,
in front, goes backhand. He scores!

1242
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,992
Come on! Hustle!

1243
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,252
Come on, you guys!

1244
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,758
Hawks with a 1-0 lead,
come back to centre ice.

1245
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,760
Larson gives it up to McGill.

1246
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:19,262
Here's McGill, inside,
the lead at centre ice.

1247
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:22,182
He's up on the blue line
and around the net.

1248
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,184
And he scores!

1249
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:30,899
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.

1250
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:40,617
Good save, Goldberg!

1251
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,299
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey...

1252
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,301
l want to see
played all day, boys.

1253
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:03,723
Larson stopped at the blue line,

1254
01:27:03,848 --> 01:27:06,184
but the Ducks can't clear it out.

1255
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:08,561
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots! He scores!

1256
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:18,321
The Hawks lead late
in the first period, 3-0.

1257
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:21,574
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.

1258
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,744
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.

1259

l want you to drop Banks like a bad
habit. l want him outta the game.

1263

- Finish him off. You got it?
- Yeah.

1264
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:40,385
Okay, boys, let's go.

1265

All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

1266
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:45,557
Face-off for the second period,
and the Hawks win the draw.

1267
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:48,393
They get it back to Stickler.
3-0, Hawks lead.

1268
01:27:48,518 --> 01:27:51,730
Stickler to the blue line of the Ducks.
His pass taken away by Conway.

1269

[Bombay]
Go after him!

1270
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:55,942

Adam Banks with a great goal
for the Ducks!

1274
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:07,746
McGill knocked him down
from behind, but Banks scored.

1275

to say to me, Bombay?

To think l wasted all those years
worrying about what you thought.

You're goin' down, Reilly.

1295

- Let me go after 'em, coach. Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.

to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.

- Coach, they'll be rushin' him.
- Right.

Fulton plenty of time.

back to Fulton Reed.

Here's Reed winding.

He scores!

Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!

01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:34,411
The puck comes around,
now to Blake on the right side.

1326
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:37,414
Blake through the slot
with a backhand. Scores!

1327

Blake with a backhanded goal,

1328
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:44,129
and the Hawks regain
the two goal lead at 4-2.

1329
01:31:44,254 --> 01:31:46,256
Guys, guys, guys,
listen up, listen.

fired up and focused, all right?

Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks
something really different. Come here.

Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2,
trying desperately to get back in the game.

1335

The Ducks with Tammy
and Tommy Duncan on the ice.

1336
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,654
Tammy Duncan goes in front
of the net, Tommy with the puck.

1337
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:12,991
Tammy's spinning,
and the Hawks are just looking at her.

1338
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:14,826
- Come on.
- Come on!

1339
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:17,495
Now!

1340
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,873
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!

1341

Yes! Yes!
We're still alive!

Yes, we're still in there!

1345
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:40,727
He Grabs McGill from behind...

1346
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:43,355
and throws him over the boards
into the bench.

1347
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,066
Now he wants to pick a fight
with the entire Hawks team.

1348
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:48,735
Fulton Reed has to be restrained
by the referee.

1349
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,071
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.

1350
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:53,073
l'm off, coach.

1351
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:55,325
He barely touched him.

1352
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,921
Oreo line!

what we learned.

Let's get a line change!
Let's go!

1358
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:22,894
[Jesse] Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!

Come on! Come on!

Flying "V"!

1361
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:41,037
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net,
joined by the rest of his team.

1362
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:45,875
Here they come from behind the net!
lt's the flying "V"!

1363
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:50,422
Come on! Come on!

1364
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:54,426
Terry Hall, with the puck,
moves the puck ahead to brother Jesse.

1365
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:58,471
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.

1366
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:02,267
Moves down the right side,
now in front of the net. Jesse scores!

1367
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:18,283
[Crowd quacking]

1368
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:28,418
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal
will decide the championship.

1369
01:34:28,543 --> 01:34:31,421
Tremendous pressure. Neither team
can afford any mistakes now.

1370
01:34:31,546 --> 01:34:34,132
23 seconds left to go in regulation.

1371
01:34:40,513 --> 01:34:42,891
Looking for
the game-winning goal,

1372
01:34:43,016 --> 01:34:45,602
here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.

1373
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:49,648
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!

1374
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:53,818
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.

1375
01:34:53,943 --> 01:34:56,112
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!

1376
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:59,824
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line,
down the middle! He could win the game!

1377
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:07,499
Hey! Where's the call?

1378
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:12,003
No time left on the clock, but
the referee is calling a penalty shot!

1379
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:15,090
[Reilly]
What kind of call is that?

1380
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,759
Okay, we've got a penalty shot
for the Ducks.

1381
01:35:17,884 --> 01:35:21,096
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.

1382
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:25,767
All right, Ducks,
who's gonna take it?

1383
01:35:25,892 --> 01:35:27,769
- l think he should take it.
- Me?

1384
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:29,771
What about Charlie?

1385
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:32,023
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.

1386
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:34,025
Let's let him finish
what he started.

1387
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:37,028
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.

Come here. You been practising
that triple deke?

- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.

You may make it, you may not.

What matters is that we're here.

we'd make it this far?

One, two, three.
Triple deke.

1395
