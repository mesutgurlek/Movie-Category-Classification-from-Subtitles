1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:06,763
Hey, folks. Don't you weep, don't you bawl.
Today we're working drywall.

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,733
Right, all?

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:17,343
You have to forgive Tim.
His sense of humor's a little off the drywall.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,113
We're gonna show you
how to tape your wallboard joints.

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,089
That's right.
Taping technique is critical.

6
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:29,720
An inferior job can result in
unsightly lumps and bulges.

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,796
Kind of makes you wonder
who taped up Al.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,939
There are many mechanical tools
used in drywalling.

9
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,001
l like to use
the Binford 61 00 wet-tape banjo.

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,947
With the wet-tape banjo, you can apply
your tape and mixture in one swipe,

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,848
and do a rendition of ''Oh, Susanna.''

12
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>- # Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me
- (drumming)</i>

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,781
As you can see...

14
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,326
<i># For l came from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee</i>

15
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,420
l've loaded my banjo with
quality premix compound,

16
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,022
available at any hardware store.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,500
<i>(energetic drumming continues)</i>

18
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,266
<i>(drumming stops)</i>

19
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,780
You don't have to buy it premixed.
You can mix it yourself if you want.

20
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,045
lt's three parts calcium carbonate,
two parts mica,

21
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,576
a little Galliano, a little vodka,
you got a Harvey Dry Wallbanger.

22
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,489
As l'm sure Tim realizes, if you are
going to mix your own compound,

23
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,858
you have to be exactly sure
of its consistency.

24
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,330
l'll put my banjo up against anybody's.

25
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,563
Would that be a challenge, Tim?

26
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,538
Get ready to duel, fool.

27
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,846
Klaus!

28
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,114
<i>(guitar plays ri from ''Dueling Banjos'"))</i>

29
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,159
<i>(banjo plays same ri</i>

30
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,561
<i>(guitar plays next ri

31
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,774

32
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,383
<i>(guitar and banjo play ''Dueling Banjos'"))</i>

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,046
Dad, the hot rod looks really great.

34
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,525
Yeah, thanks.
Except for one thing.

35
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,823
l was staring it a little while yesterday.

36
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,330
A little while?

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,424
Eight hours. All right.

38
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,164
What it needs is an original
'33 hood ornament. l'm waiting for...

39
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,763
<i>(phone rings)</i>

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,967
Yo! Could be it! Keep waxing.

41
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,645
Deke!

42
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,078
Oh, hi, Ashley.

43
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,583
No. Brad's not here.
He's out buying you a big gift.

44
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,141
Why'd you tell her that?

45
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,555
l'm waiting for an emergency call for
a hood ornament. l want the lines clear.

46
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,219
So now l have to buy Ashley a present.

47
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,560
No. Now you have to buy Ashley
a big present.

48
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,830
<i>- (Tim) Hi, hon.
- (Jill mumbles)</i>

49
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,563
...beyond belief!

50
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,970
Well, hi! Good day at work?

51
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,936
Tim. l feel like l'm about to explode.

52
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,209
Don't do it in here.
We just waxed.

53
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,517
Remember l told you about that
big meeting l had with my boss today?

54
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,918
l was expecting a raise and a promotion?

55
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,013
She laid me off!

56
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,990
- What?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,028
l got two weeks' severance pay
and a farewell cake.

58
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,495
Like a cake is gonna make me feel better.

59
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,260
Well, did you bring the cake home?

60
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,993
Did it have nuts on it?

61
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,131
For your information,
it was a triple chocolate fudge.

62
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,509
l was so depressed that l polished
the rest of it off in the car on the way home.

63
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,071
Now, l need a little sensitivity and a...

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,448
ThighMaster.

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,847
Well, you came to
the house of sensitivity. Right, guys?

66
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,087
ls this gonna affect my allowance?

67
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,322
lt will now.

68
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,690
Stay off the phone.

69
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,065
What happened? Business bad there?
Did they lay everybody off?

70
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,697
Oh, no, no. Just me.
They didn't lay off Becky.

71
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,469
- The pretty one?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,306
Yeah, the pretty one.

73
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,247
The one with the Harvard degree
and the pair of Ph. double Ds.

74
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,482
Yeah, bright girl. Yeah.

75
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,818
Thanks.

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,983
Jill, come on. Come on, come on.

77
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:04,052
l'm sorry about your job.
l know what it meant to you. l really do.

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,725
Hey, you want a shoulder to cry on?
Pick one.

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,763
l gave them two years of my life.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,001
<i>(phone rings)</i>

81
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,544
- Two years of total dedication.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,612
The writers, the editors,
they all said that they liked me the best.

83
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,817
- Yeah.
- l had such a nice desk.

84
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,053
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tim, l was talking to you.

85
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,825
Hold on a second.
Maybe one of the kids got in an accident.

86
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,128
- l thought that they were all home.
- Hold on.

87
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,658
Most of the accidents
take place in the home.

88
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,901
Hey. Hey, Deke? What are you doing?
Ah. Hold on a second.

89
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,103
Thank God the kids are OK.

90
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,169
Yes!

91
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,876
Well, all right. OK.
Call me any time, day or night, l'm here.

92
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,418
Thank you, buddy.
Thanks. Bye.

93
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,452
Great news.

94
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,959
Deke thinks he knows a guy that knows
a guy that could get my hood ornament.

95
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,221
Yay, Deke.

96
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,525
Come on! Deke's a great guy.

97
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,327
He's got connections everywhere.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,961
Maybe he knows a guy who knows a guy
who could find me a job.

99
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:24,100
We shouldn't bother him because now
he's looking for a hood ornament for me.

100
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,614
- So, how you holding up?
- l'm OK, l guess. l don't know.

101
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,087
Ever wake up in the morning
and feel like you just don't have a clue?

102
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,421
Every day.
Wait. That's not normal?

103
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,792
- Want some orange juice?
- Yeah, l'd love some.

104
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,567
l stayed up half the night trying to figure
out what l should do. What should l do?

105
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,969
The magazine business is so tough and
l don't know if l want to do that anymore,

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,531
so you know what l've been thinking?

107
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,737
lt's really a stupid idea.
Well, it may not be that stupid.

108
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,545
l mean, people my age have done it, not
that much, but it's not that it's impossible.

109
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,451
There's a lot to be said for it and a lot
to be said against it. What do you think?

110
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,457
Well, l'm 50-50 on it myself.

111
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,023
- What are you talking about?
- Oh...

112
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:21,032
When l was in school,
l really liked psychology.

113
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,263
l thought that
l might make a good therapist.

114
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,497
Hm.

115
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,507
As someone who's been in therapy forever,
l think you'd be great.

116
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,373
And l blame my mother.

117
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,745
l'm thinking about getting my master's,
then l could be a family counselor.

118
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,148
You would be a natural
working with families.

119
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:43,416
Well, after surviving this one,
l should get a Purple Heart.

120
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,763
- Hi, Brad.
- Hey, Mom.

121
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,595
What's this?

122
00:08:54,667 --> 00:09:00,003
Oh. That's a college catalogue
with watermelon seeds all over it.

123
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,974
- l'm checking out colleges.
- Well, aren't l a little young?

124
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,038
lt's for me.

125
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,411
Well, then, aren't you way old?

126
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,219
l'm never gonna
get my allowance back, am l?

127
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,187
lt's not looking good.

128
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,621
<i>- Hey, Brad. Hi, hon.
- (both) Hi.</i>

129
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,216
l'm glad you're home.

130
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:26,288
- You sound like you're in a better mood.
- Oh, yeah, l had a great day.

131
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
What'd you do? Sit in bed all day,
stuff your face,

132
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,600
talk to your girlfriends on the phone?

133
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,876
ls that what you think
my idea of a great day is?

134
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,743
Sorry.
That's my idea of a great day.

135
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,545
Wait till you hear
what l'm thinking about doing.

136
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,020
l want to go back to college.

137
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,024
Are you gonna stay here or at the dorm?

138
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,322
l'm thinking about getting
my master's in psychology.

139
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,422
l'd have to take some undergrad courses,
but what do you think?

140
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,333
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, l'm serious.

141
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,803
Jill, a master's degree will take forever.

142
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,703
lt's OK. l like school.

143
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,503
Do you remember school?

144
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,648
Homework, detention, being suspended,
sitting in the corner.

145
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,208
- Tim, they don't do that in college.
- Oh, yeah?

146
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,281
How much is this gonna cost?

147
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,553
How much did the hot rod cost?

148
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,154
How mu...
Cost is not the issue here.

149
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,566
This is something that l want to do.

150
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,933
l thought you liked journalism.
Don't you like being a researcher?

151
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,529
l did. But now
l want to move in a new direction.

152
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,699
l'm going through a major life change.

153
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,800
The facial hair thing?

154
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,212
<i>- No, Tim.
- (gruly) Thank goodness for that.</i>

155
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,512
<i>Do you remember when you quit
being a salesman to do Tool Time?</i>

156
00:10:55,588 --> 00:11:01,049
lt was important to you and l was
very supportive. Do you remember that?

157
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,823
l'd support you if you did something
that made sense.

158
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,729
- Why don't you go to a trade school?
- Trade school?

159
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,791
Six months,
you can be a turret lathe operator.

160
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:15,000
l don't want to be a turret lathe operator.
l don't even know what that is.

161
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,668
That's why you go to the school.

162
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,071
- How about a certified arc welder?
- Are you insane?

163
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,582
Diesel bus repair.

164
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,450
l was excited about this idea.
l'm trying to have a serious conversation,

165
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,115
and all you can do
is throw out idiotic suggestions.

166
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,658
Why don't you just tell me
to go to clown college?

167
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,887
They'd never take you.

168
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,730
You're not funny enough
and your feet are too small.

169
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,838
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- (audience) Tool Time!</i>

170
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,776
That's right. Binford Tools is proud to
present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor. Whoo!

171
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,836
<i>(applause)</i>

172
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,875
Thank you, Heidi.

173
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,218
<i>Thank you, everybody. Welcome to
drywall week here on Tool Time</i>

174
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,887
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor, and you
all know my assistant, Plump Al Stiltskin.

175
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,123
<i>(audience cheering)</i>

176
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,493
Thank you. Thank you.

177
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,563
l'm wearing these stilts to show you a
handy way to put up drywall ceiling panels.

178
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,041
After that, Al's gonna juggle
and bounce a big rubber ball on his nose.

179
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,272
<i>(hums circus music)</i>

180
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,314
We'll be working with a ten-foot ceiling
today so l have my stilts set to 36 inches.

181
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,786
They're adjustable all the way to 48 inches.

182
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,017
The stilts or your belt?

183
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:49,358
The advantage of stilts when drywalling is
they do give you height, plus mobility.

184
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,905
Each of these panels weighs 60lbs, so it's
always a good idea to have a good helper.

185
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,574
Or, if you're in a bind... Tim.

186
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,850
Now, if you don't happen to have
a drywall lift, like this here,

187
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,756
you can hold up your panels with T-braces,
called ''deadmen.''

188
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,091
Tim, show them
what a dead man looks like.

189
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,927
This is all well and good
if you have a traditional ten-foot ceiling,

190
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,168
but let's say l want to do
a remodel on the Sistine Chapel.

191
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:34,271
Well, l don't think you'd be
their first choice as contractor.

192
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,242
Stick with me here, OK?

193
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,186
Guys, raise this up
to the Sistine Chapel level.

194
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,490
Let's say you want to smooth out those
chubby cherubs with some wallboard

195
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,553
but the stilts only go up to 48 inches.

196
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,292
That's why l use these. Heidi?

197
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,530
My pneumatic drywall stilts.

198
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,203
- Pneumatic drywall stilts?
- ls there an echo in the building?

199
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,079
- How high can they go?
- The sky's the limit.

200
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,277
Want to go up, press this lever up.

201
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,514
Third floor, lingerie.
Ding ding ding.

202
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,657
- l'm very impressed, Tim.
- Watch this. l want to reverse the process,

203
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,225
and go down to the bargain basement
where you picked up that shirt, press here.

204
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,775
- Hey, Randy.
- Hey, Dad.

205
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,248
<i>- Great day today.
- Good Tool Time?</i>

206
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,512
Through the roof.

207
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,452
Uh...

208
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,425
- How's Mom?
- Not too bad. She finally stopped saying,

209
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,624
''Boys, whatever you do,
don't turn out to be like your father.''

210
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,158
OK. Well, this'll put her
right over the top.

211
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,101
- Do flowers always work?
- Yep.

212
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,004
Every time l get in trouble,
l just call Lou the florist.

213
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:14,671
She gets mad at you so often, you must be
on some kind of ''frequent flower'' program.

214
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,049
l'm not only a member,
l'm the club president.

215
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,580
Bet you can't guess what l've got.

216
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,824
Seven roses, 1 6 daisies, two tulips
and a couple of sprigs of baby's-breath.

217
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,729
- Right on the money.
- That's amazing!

218
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,292
lt's not that unusual.

219
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,807
This is the 29th time l've gotten
that exact same bouquet of flowers.

220
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:49,538
Lou the florist calls it
his ''Tim Taylor Foot-in-the-Mouth'' special.

221
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,845
Don't knock it.
Because of this bouquet,

222
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,081
Lou has been able to send his son
to a fabulous trade school.

223
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,318
He's a turret lathe operator now.

224
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:05,694
Well, at least you get flowers. Joe gives me
a string of sausage and a side of bacon.

225
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,096
See how lucky you are?

226
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,635
Joe screws up, a pig dies.

227
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,806
Good luck, Tim. You'll need it.
Thanks for the basil.

228
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,742
Tim,

229
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,409
why did you give me these flowers? Was it
so that l wouldn't be mad at you anymore?

230
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,111
Yes.

231
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,387
lf you'd just given me the flowers

232
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,324
to show me that you supported
my idea of going back to school,

233
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,486
l would have been so happy about that.

234
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,293
lsn't that amazing?
That's exactly why l bought them.

235
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,563
l love our relationship.
We know what each other's thinking.

236
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,796
Then you know what
l'm thinking right now?

237
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,205
l think you're thinking
that l wasted... $ 2 7.95.

238
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,310
Hey, Wilson.
Want some flowers?

239
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,945
Why, Tim, what a neighborly gesture.

240
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,182
lt'll cost you 35 bucks.

241
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:11,688
lf l'm not mistaken, that is the $ 2 7.95
''Tim Taylor Foot-in-Your-Mouth'' special.

242
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,896
Yeah.

243
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,527
l tried to use them to say l'm sorry to Jill.
She didn't want them.

244
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,434
She wants to go back to school
and was mad

245
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,303
'cause she doesn't think
l'm being very supportive.

246
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,138
Well, do you feel that you are?

247
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,805
l guess that depends
on your definition of ''supportive.''

248
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:35,719
l told her it was a stupid idea and she
probably couldn't get into clown college.

249
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,855
l don't think that's
anyone's definition of supportive.

250
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:44,055
Going back to school,
it's really a big deal to her.

251
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,757
l couldn't wait to get out of college.

252
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,269
And to be honest, the college
couldn't wait to get me out of there.

253
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,703
- Wasn't it college where you met Jill?
- Yeah. lt wasn't easy.

254
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,209
l was a motorhead and she hung out
with all the intellectuals.

255
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,644
You know the type. Spend their days
thinking about the meaning of life

256
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:06,946
when they could be figuring out how
to drink a keg of beer with no hands.

257
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,650
l'm not looking forward to her
getting back in a group of eggheads -

258
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:15,887
people who are always trying to prove how
smart they are by talking over your head.

259
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,863
So, Tim, you're worried about Jill returning
to the world of academia.

260
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,163
lt was a lot of work to get her
interested in me in college.

261
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,365
Maybe she goes back and hangs out
with all those intellectual types,

262
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,033
maybe she won't find me
that interesting again.

263
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,545
Just because Jill grows doesn't mean
that she'll grow apart from you.

264
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,206
No, no, no.

265
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,942
Heck.

266
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,745
What am l talking about?

267
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,049
Why would she trade me in
for a new model

268
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,353
when she got a V8 like me
sitting in the garage at home?

269
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,484
<i>(Wilson chuckles)</i>

270
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,427
<i>- You are a classic.
- (grunts) Yeah.</i>

271
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,058
Jill. Don't expect me to help you
with your homework.

272
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,764
What?

273
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,537
When you go back to study psychology.

274
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,804
Wait. You're OK with that?

275
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:12,147
lf your dream is to work with nuts, you
should go back to the world of macadamia.

276
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,683
You wanna go back and get your master's,
l totally support it.

277
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,318
- You really mean that?
- Absolutely.

278
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,589
Oh, thank you, honey.

279
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,159
l'll take these now.

280
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,365
You realize, with me studying
and being in school,

281
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,804
that things are gonna change
a little bit around here.

282
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:41,278
Hm. lf there's adjustments to be made
on the house, l'll make 'em.

283
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,113
No. Forget about the adjustments.
Just be supportive.

284
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,549
l'm so excited about going back to school!

285
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,751
l get to buy a new three-ring binder
and knee-socks.

286
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,792
l never told you this, but at school, l always
thought you were out of my league.

287
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,424
l was.

288
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:09,435
And l guess l was worried that you'd find a
new group of... brainiacs to hang out with.

289
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,502
Well, maybe you'll come home to me,
l'll be kinda boring.

290
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,515
<i>(laughs)</i>

291
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:22,316
One thing about coming home to you, Tim,
it's never boring.

292
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,879
Let me ask you a question.

293
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:29,291
Have you ever wished that
you'd married somebody as smart as you?

294
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,228
- You think l'm smarter than you?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,534
Well, that just shows how smart you are.

296
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,939
You didn't answer the question.

297
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,535
Do l ever wish
that l married somebody else?

298
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,072
Why would l wanna marry anybody else?

299
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,984
You're funny,
you're sexy,

300
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,488
creative, you take chances,

301
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,220
and you're definitely not afraid to be wrong.

302
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,897
l'm perfectly happy being married
to a man who thinks that

303
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,563
PBS is something that
women get once a month.

304
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,912
<i>What l said was,
''Once a month is enough for PBS.</i>

305
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,418
''And way too much for the other thing.''

306
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,827
- You'll never guess what l got in the box.
- Oh, the hood ornament.

307
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,264
No. l had to miss the call.
Deke put me at the bottom of the list.

308
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,428
Glad you weren't waiting for a liver.

309
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,697
This is stuff for your first day at school.

310
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,836
A three-ring binder
with your college sweetheart on it.

311
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,347
Stop laughing,

312
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,411
otherwise l won't give you a Tim Taylor
''More Power'' pencil sharpener.

313
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,888
- Try it out.
- Let me see this.

314
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,653
<i>(motor starts)</i>

315
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,399
And my best piece...
your remote-control lunchbox.

316
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,566
Press this.

317
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:40,452
...to the bargain basement where you
bought that shirt, press this button here.

318
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:50,228
l'm wearing these stilts to show viewers
a handy way to install ceiling panels.

319
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,738
After that, just for the kids,
Al's gonna juggle a ball on his nose

320
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,137
and sing ''Kumbaya.''
