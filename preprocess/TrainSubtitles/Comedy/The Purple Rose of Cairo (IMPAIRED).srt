Heaven, I'm in heaven

And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak

3

And I seem to find the happiness I seek

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:43,125
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

And the cares that hung
around me through the week

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,602
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

When we're out together

Oh, I love to climb a mountain

10
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,366
And to reach the highest peak

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,079
But it doesn't thrill me half as much

12

I love Jane Froman,
and James Melton plays...

First he's a hotel
porter and then he becomes a radio singer

37
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,647
and then he becomes an opera singer.

Yes, he's married to Ginger Rogers.

45

on a boat off the island of Catalina.

They live in Beverly Hills
and sometimes holiday in Spain.

313
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,402
and we're meeting
the Countess and Larry Wilde.

314
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,197
Well, I am impressed! I really am.

315
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,700
You have yourself quite a place here.

316
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,661
You know, I still can't get over the fact
that 24 hours ago,

317
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,246
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

318
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,874
I didn't know any of you wonderful people,
and here I am now.

319
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,503
I'm on the verge of a
madcap Manhattan weekend.

320
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,589
I hope you like your martinis very dry.

321
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,924
Oh, no, no, thanks.

322
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,552
I think I'll wait for
that glass of champagne at the Copacabana.

323
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,854
Miss Rita, something on your mind?

324
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,232
'Cause you ain't been yourself since you
come back from them pyramids.

325
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,110
No, it's nothing. I'll be okay.

326
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,865
I don't suspect it has anything to do
with that explorer fella, Mr. Tom Baxter.

327
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,783
Now, why would you say that?

328
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,871
The way he speaks, all romantic-like.

329
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,499
Yeah. Come on, Delilah, draw my bath.

330
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,293
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,797
Now, will you be wanting the big bubbles,
or the asses' milk?

332
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,098
Boy, I can't wait to get out of these clothes

333
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,975
and hit some of the night spots.

334
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,935
Well, children, let's not waste any time.

335
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,646
The floor show
at the Copacabana starts in 10 minutes,

336
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,982
and we're meeting
the Countess and Larry Wilde.

337
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,943
Well, I am very impressed. I really am.

338
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,654
You have yourself quite a place here.

339
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,991
You know, I still can't get over the fact
that 24 hours ago,

340
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,451
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

341
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,369
I didn't know any of you wonderful people,

342
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:07,168
and here I am now. I'm on the verge
of a madcap Manhattan weekend.

343
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,005
My God, you must really love this picture.

344
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,674
- Me?
- You've been here all day,

345
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,218
and I've seen you here twice before.

346
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,387
- You mean me?
- Yes, you, you. You've...

347
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,015
This is the fifth time you're seeing this.

348
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,601
(WHISPERING) Henry, come here, quickly.

349
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,770
- I gotta speak to you.
- (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)

350
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,106
(SCREAMS)

351
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,066
HENRY: Listen, old sport,
you're on the wrong side.

352
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,234
Tom, get back here,

353
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,693
- we're in the middle of a story!
- Leave me alone.

354
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,654
I want to have a look around.
You go on without me.

355
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,405
- HENRY: We can't continue with the story!
- Who are you?

356
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,532
(STAMMERING) Cecilia.

357
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,117
I'll go get the manager!

358
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,160
Let's get out of here
and go somewhere where we can talk.

359
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,829
But you're in the movie!

360
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,789
Wrong, Cecilia, I'm free!

361
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,668
After 2,000 performances
of the same monotonous routine, I'm free!

362
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,837
- HENRY: Call Father Donnelly.
- Tom!

363
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,382
I don't understand. What's going on?

364
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,758
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

365
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,553
You've seen the movie five times.
I'm Tom Baxter.

366
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,222
Poet, adventurer, explorer,
of the Chicago Baxters.

367
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,390
Well, yes, I know you're Tom Baxter.

368
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,350
You wind up with Kitty Haynes,
the nightclub singer,

369
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,893
- but still, I don't...
- Not anymore, I don't have to.

370
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,896
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm out before the wedding. I'm free.

371
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,189
Don't you have to marry her?

372
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,941
Not while I'm here and she's up there.

373
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,693
Don't you want to? She's so beautiful.

374
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,486
She's not for me. She's too bony.

375
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,655
Kitty Haynes, the nightclub singer, is bony?

376
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,323
I need a place to hide!

377
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,076
Look, I'm never going back,
now that I've met you.

378
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,121
A place to hide? A place to hide?

379
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,582
What's happening? What's going on?

380
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,834
Tom's left. He just walked right out.

381
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,794
I don't know how he did it. I can't get out.

382
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,920
This is just disgusting.

383
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,423
I am an heiress
and I don't have to put up with this!

384
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,883
He left the picture?

385
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,010
Oh, my gosh. Well, don't panic.

386
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,179
Just stay up there and keep calm.

387
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,305
Keep calm?

388
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,431
Are you crazy?
What do you mean, "keep calm"?

389
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,141
- Somebody call for a priest?
- Thank God you're here.

390
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,226
- Wait a minute, this is the second reel.
- That's the point.

391
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,145
- I'm not on till later.
- Tom's gone.

392
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,688
Can't you go on? There's an audience.

393
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,065
RITA: How?
Tom was the linchpin of the story.

394
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,567
That's right! Whoever you are, you see, sir,

395
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,651
although this is basically my story,

396
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,653
- Tom moves the exposition along.
- What do you mean, your story?

397
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,738
It's not your story,

398
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,698
it's the story
of a man's quest for self-fulfillment.

399
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,742
- It's the story of a complex, tortured soul.
- Oh, stop that...

400
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,327
It's story of the effect of money
on true romance...

401
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,453
I don't think money comes into it.

402
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,663
...my upbringing, my wealth,
my private schools.

403
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,874
I'm the one who marries royalty.

404
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,250
- I'm the one...
- Nobody cares...

405
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,793
A humble kid...
What do you mean, they don't care?

406
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,171
They wouldn't
sell a ticket if it were your story.

407
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,173
(ALL ARGUING)

408
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,800
- Stop arguing.
- RITA: And do what?

409
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,719
Maybe you should just
turn the projector off.

410
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,763
No! No! Don't turn the projector off!

411
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,681
No! No, it gets black and we disappear.

412
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,642
- Calm down...
- Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

413
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,310
Easy, my son. We're all in this together.

414
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,897
Yes, but you don't
understand what it's like to disappear

415
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,815
and to be nothing, to be annihilated.

416
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,859
So don't turn the projector off.

417
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,694
Miss Rita, your bath is ready.

418
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,655
- Not now, dear.
- Well, what's going on?

419
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,031
- Come in and sit down, Delilah.
- Be quiet, Delilah.

420
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,157
Well, what's he doing here?

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,576
- Have a martini.
- He's not supposed to be here till reel six.

422
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,662
- We know that, Delilah.
- What the hell is going on?

423
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,871
Is somebody trying to hustle me?

424
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,081
They're not trying to hustle you.

425
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,044
TOM: Hey, I know what this is,
it's an amusement park!

426
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,922
CECILIA: Yeah, it's usually pretty dead
around here until summer.

427
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,424
I know exactly what an amusement park is,

428
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,718
- and what goes on. I do!
- Well, good.

429
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,137
It's written into my character.

430
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,764
Remember, I invite Kitty to Luna Park,

431
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,391
but she prefers just to stay home and talk?

432
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,018
- Oh, yes.
- So, it's in me!

433
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,521
Oh, too bad nothing's open. I'm starved!

434
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,939
- Oh, you are?
- Well, yeah,

435
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,358
I, uh, left the movie
before the Copacabana scene.

436
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,110
- So that's when I usually eat.
- Oh, wait a minute,

437
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,570
what am I thinking?
Look, here, I've got a whole bag of popcorn.

438
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,489
- You can have that.
- Oh, wow.

439
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,491
Also, I have a Milky Way bar you might...

440
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,160
- No, that's, popcorn is...
- You might want it later.

441
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,579
Boy!

442
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,707
So that's what popcorn tastes like.

443
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,377
I've been watching
people eat it for all those performances.

444
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,671
When they rattle
those bags, though, that's, uh...

445
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,964
- That's not...
...kind of annoying.

446
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,300
I still don't understand what's going on.

447
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,884
I wanted to meet you.

448
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,511
Don't tell me you
didn't see me looking at you

449
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,179
just out of the corner of my eye.

450
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,973
When Kitty Haynes
was doing her nightclub number?

451
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,976
Oh, wait a minute,
I did, I remember seeing you kind of...

452
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,936
You were looking
off to the side, somehow, but...

453
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,272
- Sure.
- I never thought it was to me.

454
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,899
Yeah, when we
take the drive to that little country inn?

455
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,901
When I propose to Kitty?
I was looking at you.

456
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,279
Oh, no, Kitty
looked so beautiful in that black dress.

457
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,573
Oh, no, she's nothing compared to you.

458
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,326
What are you talking about? I'm nothing.

459
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,369
Like hell you are. You are fetching.

460
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,455
- Fetching?
- Fetching.

461
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,041
Dad liked to use that word
about Mom back in Chicago.

462
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,418
"Man!" he'd say, "You're rather fetching."

463

(GIGGLES)

464
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,755
Dad was a card.

465
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,090
I never met him.
He died before the movie begins.

466
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,635
I have to confess.
My eye did always go to you

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,930
- up on the screen. Really.
- Really?

468
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,517
Even when I'm around Detective Sims
and Henry Adams, the playboy.

469
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,103
Yes, even though
you're not the main character,

470
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,646
you're the one you look at.

471
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,982
You don't think I'm the main character.

472
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,943
Oh, I didn't mean it that way. No!

473
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,780
I think you were positively essential.

474
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,282
In fact, every time
I saw the movie I kept thinking,

475
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,284
"Tom Baxter's so handsome."

476
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,369
(CHUCKLING)

477
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,125
Shouldn't you be getting back?

478
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,128
I want to live.
I want to be free to make my own choices.

479
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,798
Right now,
the country's not in such great shape.

480
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,385
- What do you mean?
- Well, we're in the middle of a depression.

481
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,136
Everybody's very poor...

482
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,473
I got plenty, look at this!

483
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,353
But, they need you.
The story doesn't work without you.

484
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,855
Cecilia, I'm in love with you.

485
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,233
I'm married...

486
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,151
Happily?

487
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,738
I really should get back home.
I have to cook dinner.

488
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,490
Just slip away from your husband tonight.

489
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,158
Meet me here. I'll wait for you.

490
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,786
I want to learn
about the real world with you.

491
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,246
I can't.

492
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,622
Well, look at it this way.

493
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,166
How many times
is a man so taken with a woman

494
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,210
that he walks off the screen to get her?

495
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,091
Okay, okay, let's not panic. We're all adults.

496
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,843
Bored of sitting around.
I'm a dramatic character.

497
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,010
I need forward motion.

498
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,470
Here comes the Countess and Larry.

499
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,763
Where is everybody?

500
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,473
Weren't we meeting at the Copacabana?

501
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,016
- HENRY: Tom's gone.
- What?

502
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,685
- He left the film.
- What?

503
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,270
The bum walked out on us.

504
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,772
(STAMMERING) But the Copa
is where the two of us meet.

505
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,232
I'm trying to get him to marry me.

506
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,901
Forget it. I'm tired
of marrying you every night anyway.

507
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,236
We never even get to the bedroom.

508
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,864
- Where did Tom go?
- Into the real world.

509
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,032
That two-bit minor character
leaves and we're stuck.

510
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,784
I wonder what it's like out there.

511
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,203
They don't look like
they're having too much fun to me.

512
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,497
Hey, what the hell kind of movie is this?

513
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,208
WOMAN: The paper said it was a romance,
set all over the world!

514
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,211
Look, don't tell us your sad stories.
You think we like this?

515
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,007
Look at this.
They sit around and talk, and no action?

516
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,050
- Nothing happens?
- I want my money back.

517
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,052
- This is outrageous!
- Shh. Why don't you stop yapping?

518
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,387
We've got problems of our own.

519
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,722
You can't talk to my wife like that.

520
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,931
Who do you think you are?

521
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,184
I'm a genuine Countess with a lot of dough,

522
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,311
and if that's your wife, she's a tub of guts.

Hey, what are you so nervous about?

00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,031
Oh, I'm not.

527
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,241
There's too much pepper in the sauce.

528
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,660
I told you to go easy on the pepper.

Hey, Monk?

Are you, uh...

531
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,792
I guess you and the guys
are probably going out again tonight, huh?

532
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,879
No, I'm not. My back is acting up again.

533
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,298
You gotta give me one
of your special rubdowns. I bought liniment.

00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,217
- Oh, no.
- What?

Well, I can't.

What do you mean, you can't?

537

I'm sorry, I didn't mean I can't, I mean,

538
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,601
(STAMMERING) I made some plans, I...

539
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,311
You made plans?

540
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,189
Well, I did. I said I'd...

541
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,608
I'd baby-sit tonight.

542
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,195

into Mrs. Lorenzo and, in the...

I'm saying in the restaurant,
in the street today...

544
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,991
And she has some, you know, I don't know,

545
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,453
I think it was social club meeting or
something she wanted to go to...

546
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,789
Yeah, it won't be too long.

547
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,458
- Yeah, well, I think it's a great idea.
- Yeah?

- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah, because we can use every penny.

All right, so what am I going to do
about my back?

Oh well, don't worry.
You know, I can do some now,

and I'll do some when I come in...

552

You shouldn't move around too much,
just kind of take it easy.

Well, if you're
gonna go baby-sitting, get paid in cash.

- I will. Okay.

and staring back at us,
making nasty remarks.

Is that what they're doing now?

561

Well, the last time I looked,
the priest had a deck of cards,

562
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,450
and the men were playing pinochle.

How did this first happen?

Well, it's probably all the electrical
storms we had this evening.

I've got no substitute picture to put in here.

There's no story. Mrs. Lupus likes a story.

570
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,635
I still think you should
turn the projector off and shut down.

571
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,345
This could be the work of Reds,
or anarchists.

572
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,306
You can't do that.
If he turns off the projector,

in the movie last week to happen this week,

Oh, yeah? Well, we're not human.

I won't speak? The kid is quiet.

He never makes conversation.

- I don't like to draw people out.

00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,033
That's what I said.
He has trouble with live humans.

and there's a crisis with his film.

Yes, this is Mr. Hirsch. What's the problem?

00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,433
What?

609
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,894
They're all just
sitting around up there on the screen.

Larry Wilde, the playboy.

Come on, take a walk, will you?

614
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,949
Look, he just walked out!

Baxter! The Communist is screaming.

616
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,912
The priest in reel five is in reel two!

617
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,248
How can he come off the screen?
It's impossible.

618
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,708
It's never happened before in history.

619

Just because a thing never happened before

620
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,794
doesn't mean it can't happen for a first time.

Hundreds?

624
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,552
As your lawyer,
I advise you to get control of it fast.

A character from one of your productions
on the loose?

Who knows what he's capable of?

627
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,016
Robbery, murder. I see lawsuits.

628
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,103
I'd charter a plane right away,

Oh, no, you're a feather in my arms.

Not even if I begged him.

Really? So, it's been bad for you.

Oh, it's been hard for everyone.

No, I'm sorry. I missed it.

singled out by all the East Coast critics?

Mmm-hmm.
The New York Times said that I was...

655
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:12,267
I had almost too smoldering a quality
to just play comedy.

Would you play Lindbergh
the way you played Tom Baxter?

00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,980
Would I play... No, of course not.

Tom was kind of a change of pace for me.

He was from my earlier roles.

I played Tom Baxter with a kind of a
poetic, idealistic quality that, uh...

661
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:31,245
Just... Lindbergh was a loner.
He was just self-reliant.

I'd have to work
it out with my dialogue coach.

No, make that 30%.

707
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,967
Yes, quite amusing.

708
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,012
- What is?
- The fake money.

709
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,348
Fake money?

710
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,059
Is it, uh, play money, sir, or stage money?

711
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,022
Keep 30% for yourself,
and stop looking so serious.

I'll get the Maitre D'.

Tom, that's not real money.

Oh, my God.

Uh, do you have any money?

No. What are we going to do?

718
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,624
We're going to have to make a run for it.

00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,877
No, I can't run.
My ankles are bad from waitressing.

720
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,046
Just get up. Follow me.

721
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,104
TOM: Quick, get in the car.

722
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,858
Tom, this is not our car!

723
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,527
We don't have a car. We came by foot.

724

CECILIA: Oh, that's okay.

736
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,137
It's not going to be so easy
to get along without it in this world.

737

But that's not going to be so easy, either.

Right now, the whole country's out of work.

740
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,936
Well, then we'll live on love.

741
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,105
We'll have to make some concessions,
but so what?

742
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,649
- We'll have each other.
- That's movie talk.

743
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,235
You look so beautiful in this light.

00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,807
I'm a little tipsy. I... From the...

752
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,652
- Where's the fade out?
- What?

753
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,323
Always when the kissing gets hot and
heavy, just before the love-making,

754
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,866
there's a fade out.

755
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,868
Oh, then what?

756
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,538
Then, then we're making love
in some private, perfect place.

757
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,334
Oh, that's not how it happens here.

758
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,337
- What, there's no fade out?
- No...

759
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,424
But when you kissed me,
I felt like my heart faded out,

760
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,262
and I closed my eyes
and I was in some, some private place.

761
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,807
How fascinating.

- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
- Yes.

764
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,855
Well, I can't wait to see this.

765
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,651
Listen, I can't...

766
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,861
I'm not that kind of girl.

767
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,613
I'm married.

768
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,367
Cecilia,

769
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,411
it's clear how miserable
you are with your husband,

770
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,708
and if he hits you again, you tell me.

771
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,211
I'd be forced to knock his teeth out.

772
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,338
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

773
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,798
He's big.

774
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,842
Well, I'm sorry.
It's written into my character to do it,

775
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,051
so I do it.

776
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,514
Listen, I think I better go home now.

777
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,057
- It's late.
- Okay.

778
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,517
It's been a whirlwind of a day.

779
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,726
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

780
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,228
What are you gonna do?

781
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,273
Um, I'll just... I'll sleep here at the carousel.

782
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,568
And walk around, drink in the night air.

783
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,113
Enjoy my freedom, and dream of you.

784
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,499
You got in late last night.

785
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,710
Oh, yeah, you were out like a light.

786
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,753
I took a hot bath to relax me.

787
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,589
You want to get me a cup of coffee?

788
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,257
Oh, yeah, sure.

789
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,093
There was some big
deal going on over at the movie house.

790
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,928
A big crowd when I went to buy cigarettes.

791
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,097
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I couldn't get the story straight.

792
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,933
There's some guy
who ran out the side exit with a customer.

793
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,811
- Who?
- Oh, a woman, a guy, uh, an actor.

794
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,563
I don't know what
the hell the cop was talking about.

795
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,606
He didn't know.

796
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,400
Well, they don't know who the woman was?

797
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,903
Some woman dragged out in the dark.

798
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,030
They got those real geronimos
at the movie houses.

799
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,282
See, that's why
I don't like you staying out so late at night.

800
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,909
(STAMMERING) I know. I couldn't help it.

801
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,161
The Lorenzos didn't get back till late.

802
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,287
I couldn't leave.

803
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,623
- Well, I hope you got paid overtime.
- Oh, sure.

804
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,958
Oh, good, good. Let's have it.

805
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,628
(STUTTERING) They, uh...
They didn't have any cash.

806
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,796
I'll have to come back for it later today.

807
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,257
Cecilia, I told you
to get paid, uh, in cash, didn't I?

808
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,636
Well, I know, but all they had was big bills,

809
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,137
and, um, you know, I was getting late,

810
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,222
- so I thought I better leave.
- Yeah, well,

811
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,057
- they're going to fork it over today, right?
- Oh, they will.

812
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,141
Yeah, yeah, sure.

813
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:12,270
Leave something to you,
you can bet you're going to get fouled up.

814
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,986
You have no idea where he went?

815
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,489
Mr. Hirsch, this is awful for us.

816
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,907
- Really difficult.
- Think of me,

817
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,742
my reputation, my career!

818
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,786
First thing we've gotta do,
is we gotta keep it contained.

819
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,995
- Yeah.
- The word's out already.

820
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,163
We gotta keep the crisis local.

821
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,624
I know the two reporters in town.
They're old friends.

822
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,667
- Maybe I could talk to them.
- Fine,

823
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,002
a couple of bucks
spread around town will buy us some time.

824
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,212
Don't worry about a thing...

825
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,464
I mean, we're all so lost.

826
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,548
HIRSCH: I know it's rough.

827
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,384
I just want the whole cast to know

828
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,262
how much I appreciate
your staying up there on the screen.

829
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,014
I hope you're not
going to hold this against me, R.H.

830
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,475
You created the part of Tom Baxter, Gil.

831
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,768
The facts are undeniable.

832
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,437
I want to go too.
I want to be free! I want out!

833
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,648
I'm warning you, that's Communist talk!

834
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,316
We're gonna
have to pull the film out of the theater

835
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,277
and you're going
to have to make good my receipts.

836
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,028
You mean, you're thinking of pulling the film

837
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,446
because a minor character is missing?

838
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,448
A minor character? Would you listen to her?

839
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,826
You know, he may not have the most lines,

840
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,411
but the plot turns on Baxter.

841
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,289
I deliberately played him
with a cheerful bravado.

842
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,832
Who cares how you played him?

843
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,916
- He's minor.
- That's right.

844
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,376
I would just like to get my hands on him.

845
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,044
Right when my career was taking off.

846
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,046
He could be raping
that woman he abducted.

847
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,966
And he's got my fingerprints,
my exact prints!

848
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,719
You know what
they get for rape in a small town,

849
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,846
especially by a man in a pith helmet?

850
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,682
If this is the start of a new trend,
our industry's as good as dead.

851
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,728
The real ones want their lives fiction,
and the fictional ones want their lives real.

852
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,396
Does anybody know who that woman was?

853
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,565
No. It was all so crazy, nobody noticed.

854
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,110
Just two doughnuts
and a container of coffee to go, please.

855
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,237
GIL: Right now, it's chaos.

856
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,532
Well, how can rumors
be circulating at the Brown Derby?

857
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,035
It just happened! Well, squash it, Herbie,

858
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,786
I got a career on the line.

859
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,540
Look, I'll call you the minute I hear.

860
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,044
Oh, excuse me.

861
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,420
(GASPING) What are you doing here?

862
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,006
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't have a pencil,
or I'd give you an autograph.

863
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,091
Where did you get those clothes?

864
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,844
- Pardon me?
- Your clothes, where did you get them?

865
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,263
Uh, a little store on Sunset and Vine.

866
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,890
What are you talking about?

867
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,683
What are you talking about?

868
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,934
Excuse me.

869
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,937
I just bought you these. Two doughnuts.

870
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,774
- For me? Well, thank you very much.
- Yeah. A container of coffee.

871
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,941
I hope you enjoy my next movie.

872
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,070
But, do you, I thought
you were going to stay hidden at the park.

873
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,446
What park?

874
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,864
Tom, what's the matter with you?

875
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,117
- You're acting so peculiar.
- Tom? No, no. I'm...

876
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,995
Wait a minute! Come here.

877
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,414
What's come over you?

878
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,291
I'm not Tom. I'm Gil Shepherd.

879
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,001
- I play Tom.
- What?

880
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,920
- How do you know Tom?
- You're Gil...

881
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,255
- Oh, my God. I don't believe it.
- Yeah.

882
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,966
You're Gil... I've seen you in lots of movies.

883
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,136
- Look, where's Tom?
- Oh! Broadway Bachelors, right? Right?

884
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,722
- Yeah, yeah, well, you know...
- Honeymoon in Haiti?

885
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,516
- Done about six.
- You were a scream.

886
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,267
- Well, thank you.
- (EXCLAIMING)

887
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,894
Thank you very much. That's...

888
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,146
I try to do one a year,
you know, just to keep...

889
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,649
Where's Tom?

890
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,942
Why?

891
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,194
Well, he's my character. I created him.

892
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,405
Well, didn't the man
who wrote the movie do that?

893
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,657
Yes, technically.

894
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,784
But I made him live. I fleshed him out.

895
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,579
But you did...
You did a wonderful job. He's adorable.

896
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,790
(CHUCKLING) Thank you very much.

897
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,167
(SIGHING) What's your name?

898
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,710
Cecilia.

899
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,087
Cecilia.

900
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,338
(GASPING)

901
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,673
Where is he?

902
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,592
- Why?
- Has he done anything wrong?

903
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,760
Wrong, like what?

904
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,972
Has he stolen anything
or attacked any females? You?

905
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,517
No, gosh, no, no, he's as sweet as can be.

906
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,811
Well, I played him sweet.
I was well reviewed.

907
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,354
Well, it comes across.

908
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,940
Good. Look, I gotta speak to him.

909
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,650
You're not upset with him?

910
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,152
Well, a little, yes,

911
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,612
but I know if I spoke to him,
we could straighten everything out.

912
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,322
Oh, I don't know.

913
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,366
Please, I have a right.

914
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,743
Well, it has to be secret.

915
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,204
He doesn't want to have
to go back into the movie.

916
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,082
- He doesn't?
- No, he loves being free.

917
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,918
- He's having the time of his life.
- Oh, my God.

918
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,880
Would you take me to him? Trust me.

919
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,174
Please.

920
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,136
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

921
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:25,023
Monk, somebody saw your wife last night
at the Dine and Dance Joint.

922
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,150
Oh, sure, she's there every night
with the Rockefellers.

923
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,319
Uh, she was with this crazy-looking guy

924
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,905
- wearing an explorer's hat and britches.
- Come on.

925
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,364
Britches?

926
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,242
You know, you're nuts.
She was baby-sitting.

927
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,078
Right. I guess you know it all.

928
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,251
All right, who's next?

929
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,138
(SOFTLY) Tom? Tom?

930
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,936
- Cecilia, I dreamed of us in Cairo.
- Tom. Tom...

931
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,897
- I brought Gil Shepherd.
- Gil... Gil Shepherd.

932
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,107
- I play you in the movie.
- You do?

933
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,235
How dare you run away!

934
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,736
This is disconcerting.

935
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,614
Oh, I'll show you
the meaning of disconcerting.

936
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,949
I'm trying to build a career!

937
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,992
Yeah, well,
I don't want to be in the film anymore.

938
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,327
I'm in love with Cecilia.

939
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,496
Mr. Shepherd, you said you weren't angry.

940
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,373
You can't do this to me. It's my best role.

941
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,083
I've been critically acclaimed for this.
It's my very...

942
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,709
I'd say it's because of the way I do it.

943
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,754
No, no, no, because of the way I do it.
I'm doing it, not you.

944
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,465
It's me, not him. I mean, isn't that obvious?

945
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,300
Well, then, how do you
explain that here I am?

946
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,010
Well, because
I took you from the printed page,

947
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,887
and I made you live.
I fleshed you out, just like...

948
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,890
- So, I'm living.
- Yes, but for the screen only, please.

949
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,642
- And as soon...
- I want my freedom.

950
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,644
I don't want another one of me
running around the world.

951
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,312
I mean, I can
just imagine what he's been up...

952
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,106
Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

953
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,482
Yes. Frankly, I am afraid...

954
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,692
But, you created me.

955
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,610
All right, look, be reasonable here.

956
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,737
I'm starting to build a career.

957
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,614
Is life up on the screen so terrible that you...

958
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,617
I want to be with Cecilia.
I'm in love with her.

959
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,953
Will you tell him to go back?

960
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,746
Tell him that you don't love him.

961
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,914
Tell him you can't love him.

962
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,082
He's fictional!

963
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,334
You want to waste your time
with a fictional character?

964
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,670
I mean, you're a sweet girl.
You deserve an actual human.

965
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,422
But Tom's perfect.

966
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,798
Yeah, but he's not real.

967
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,718
What good is perfect if the man's not real?

968
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,428
I can learn to be real.

969
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,305
It's easy. You know, there's nothing to it.

970
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,098
Being real comes very naturally to me.

971
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,434
Can't learn to be real.
It's like learning to be a midget.

972
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,852
It's not a thing you can learn.

973
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,937
Some of us are real, some are not.

974
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,315
I say I can do it.

975
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,941
I'm not going to stay here
and argue with you.

976
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,192
I'm gonna go back to town.

977
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,362
I'm going to call my attorney,
the Actors' Union.

978
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,615
I won't take this lying down.

979
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,577
Nor will Raoul Hirsch, nor the police,

980
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,662
nor the FBI.

981
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,166
Yes, yes, we found him.

982
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,209
Gil Shepherd found him,

983
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,587
but he refuses to get back on the screen.

984
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,672
R.H. is very upset.

985
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,176
No, no, we can't force him. It's not a crime.

986
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,053
We need a plan.

987
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,888
Yeah, the press is on our side.

988
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,599
It took a few bucks,
but they're going to keep it quiet for now.

989
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,352
Uh, what? Really?

990
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,773
The Tom Baxter character
in a movie house in Chicago

991
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,900
has been forgetting his lines.

992
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,361
I just got a call from the manager.

993
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,946
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the bathroom.

994
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,907
On the floor, weeping.

995
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,663
I mean, you do...
Aren't you at all even worried?

996
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,248
Well, what about
Raoul Hirsch and what, the FBI?

997
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,417
No, Cecilia,
if I can be with you, I'm never going back.

998
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,002
- But I, you know...
- No more buts.

999
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,213
I said I was going
to learn about the real world with you.

1000
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,506
Show me.

1001
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,887
(INAUDIBLE)

1002
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,720
TOM: It's beautiful.
But I'm not sure exactly what it is.

1003
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,099
Oh, this is a church.
You do believe in God, don't you?

1004
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,976
Meaning?

1005
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,732
Mmm, the reason for everything,
the, the world, the universe...

1006
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,816
Oh, I think I know what you mean.

1007
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,152
The two men who wrote, uh,
The Purple Rose of Cairo.

1008
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,155
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine,
the writers who collaborate on films.

1009
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,491
No, no, I'm talking
about something much bigger than that.

1010
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,203
No, think for a minute.
A reason for everything.

1011
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,498
Otherwise, it'd be
like a movie with no point,

1012
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,833
and no happy ending.

1013
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,501
So there you are!

1014
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,628
I'm looking for you.

1015
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,714
Monk, I, um...

1016
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,761
This is my husband. This is Tom Baxter.

1017
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,972
Adventurer, explorer, the Chicago Baxters.
I'm charmed to meet you.

1018
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,141
So you wear the britches.

1019
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,768
CECILIA: What did you want
to talk to me about?

1020
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,604
I heard you were out on the town last night.

1021
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,024
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I admit I didn't tell the truth about that,

1022
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,027
but things have
been so strange the last 24 hours...

1023
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,403
You know what I told you I'd do to you

1024
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,780
- if you ever lied to me?
- Monk, don't hit me.

1025
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,948
Obviously, your marriage
has come to an impasse, sir.

1026
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,533
And you keep out of this.

1027
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,827
- Monk, let's just talk.
- No, you're coming home with me!

1028
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,412
- Can't we talk?
- Perhaps you don't understand, sir,

1029
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,538
but I'm in love with your wife.

1030
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,123
Close your yap, jackass.

1031
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,208
Now let's go. You're in for a lesson...

1032
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,210
You're failing to understand, sir.

1033
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,377
She's not coming with you.

1034
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,630
- Oh, she's not, huh?
- No, you take your hands off.

1035
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,715
No man will hit the woman I love,
nor any woman.

1036
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,219
- Beat it! Beat it. I'm gonna take you apart!
- Stop it!

1037
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,012
- He's got a terrible temper.
- And you, go home.

1038
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,307
Sorry, it's written into my character.
Courage.

1039
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,600
Stop it!

1040
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,194
- Come on.
- Stop it! What are you doing?

1041
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,415
Time for the old one-two.

1042
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,000
(GRUNTING)

1043
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,587
Hope he's had enough.

1044
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,298
Sorry, pal. Sorry about the rough stuff.

1045
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,508
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1046
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,926
Let me give you a hand. There's a...

1047
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,429
(GRUNTING) God, it's not fair. Oh!

1048
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,853
Tom! What are you doing?

1049
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,564
- You're coming home with me now.
- No, I'm not!

1050
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,606
What'd you say?

1051
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,650
No, I'm going to stay
and see that Tom's okay.

1052
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,943
- I...
- You're a bully, Monk.

1053
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,986
I gave you an order.

1054
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,863
I don't care. I'm tired of taking your orders.

1055
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,072
You could've killed him.

1056
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,658
All right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1057
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,742
- I hit hard.
- You can't just...

1058
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,995
You can't just
go through life beating people up.

1059
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,080
Look, I'm telling you one more time.
Are you coming with me?

1060
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,540
No, I'm not.

1061
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,376
I'm telling you one more time. You coming?

1062
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,795
- No! No, I'm not!
- Come on!

1063
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,633
The hell with it. I need a beer anyway.

1064
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,468
I'll see you later.

1065
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,056
Oh, are you okay?

1066
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,475
Oh, oh, yeah. I'm fine.

1067
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,727
You're not even marked.

1068
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,645
Your hair is in place.

1069
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,480
No, no. I don't get hurt or bleed.

1070
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,607
Hair doesn't muss.

1071
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,817
It's one of the advantages
of being imaginary.

1072
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,569
- (CHUCKLES)
- You were very brave.

1073
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,406
Yeah, well, I had him, too,
till he started fighting dirty.

1074
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,534
That's why you'll never
survive off the screen.

1075
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,996
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood right up to him.

1076
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,664
You inspired me.

00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,015
CECILIA: Mr. Shepherd.

1079
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,185
Oh, Cecilia, look, I got to speak to you.

1080
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,979
Oh, listen, I've had a crazy morning.

1081
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,273
- I'm still shaking.
- Look, I don't know what to do, all right?

1082
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,775
I've struggled my whole life.

1083
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,069
And now I'm
finally beginning to break through

1084
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,946
and my whole career's
going right down the drain.

1085
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,490
You don't have to worry about that.

1086
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,368
You'll always be a great movie star.

1087
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:20,122
Oh, well, that's very nice of you to say,
but technically, I'm not really a star yet.

1088
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,251
(CHUCKLING) Cecilia, you know, I mean,
I try to carry myself like one.

1089
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,338
You know, I do the best I can
as far as that, but star?

1090
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,091
Phew! That's a big word, isn't it? Star?

1091
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,969
Yeah, uh, no, no.

1092
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,428
No, star, no, no.

1093
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:39,100
And you're not just a pretty face,
you're also a peach of an actor.

1094
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,686
Really, I've seen you. I've seen you a lot.

1095
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,562
You've got something.

1096
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,564
- Is that your opinion?
- Sure.

1097
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,400
And I see all the movies.

1098
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:51,153
You've got, oh, how can I describe it?

1099
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,241
You've got a magical glow.

1100
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,743
(CHUCKLING) Oh, boy. Oh, oh.

1101
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,414
To hear that from a real person,
that is just...

1102
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,165
(EXHALING) It's not
one of those movie colony bimbos,

1103
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,711
you know, with the fancy dresses,
filling you full of hot air.

1104
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,629
Would you get over here
and sit down, please?

1105
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,881
Oh, you know, you can take it from me.

1106
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,425
You're not just a flash in the pan.

1107
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,928
No, you know, it'd be very easy
for me to trade on my looks.

1108
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,054
- Just, like that.
- Oh, sure.

1109
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,764
But I have some serious acting ambitions.

1110
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,933
You should. You should.

1111
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,270
You, you know...
I think you're great in all the funny movies.

1112
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,604
Thank you.

1113
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,814
Really, I was thinking you should,

1114
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,316
you should
play some of the more heroic parts.

1115
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,401
I want...

1116
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,153
- I tell my agent that a hundred times!
- Yeah?

1117
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,114
Well, you know, well, you could play...

1118
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,783
You could play,
like, Daniel Boone, or someone...

1119
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,535
- Lindbergh! Oh...
- Oh!

1120
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,412
- You'd be wonderful as Lindbergh.
- My God!

1121
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,456
- You are a mind reader.
- We had the same thought?

1122
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,208
- Really?
- I am on the verge of signing for that part.

1123
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,627
- No! Really?
- I'm, I am! I can taste it.

1124
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,504
Oh, you'll be wonderful.

1125
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,132
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, there's something inside you that...

1126
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,510
You have that
same kind of lone heroic quality.

1127
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,138
You're exactly right.
Everyone has been telling me not to...

1128
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,598
- You are right.
- Don't you listen.

1129
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,975
Basically, I have been a loner my entire life.

1130
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,643
Well, sure, anyone can see that.

1131
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,772
You know, you're deep
and probably complicated.

1132
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,149
Can I buy you lunch?

1133
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,609
- Me?
- Please. Can I?

1134
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,818
Please. Look, I love... I love talking to you.

1135
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,986
Oh, uh, I was just going to go upstairs...

1136
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,821
- Don't, no, really, come on...
- Really?

1137
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,324
- I open myself up around you...
- Oh...

1138
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,825
Have you ever been to Hollywood?

1139
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,243
Uh, come on, no, of course not.

1140
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,871
You, well, I would
love to just take you around Hollywood.

1141
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,331
- I would real...
- Oh.

1142
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,999
- Could I make a confession?
- Sure.

1143
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,210
Look, my real name, it's not Gil Shepherd.

1144
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,629
- It's Herman Bardebedian.
- Really?

1145
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:35,132
I've, yeah, I've been a cab driver for about...

1146
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,968
- Boy, do you have a pretty face.
- Come on.

1147
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,678
- You do!
- Oh.

1148
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,529
EMMA: Hi, big boy.

1149
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,324
You alone?

1150
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh, hello.

1151
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,664
Uh, well, I'm alone for now,
but later I have an appointment,

1152
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,833
or should I say rendezvous?

1153
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,001
Good for you.

1154
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,046
Where did you get the funny suit?

1155
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,882
- What, this?
- Yeah.

1156
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,718
You coming from a costume party?

1157
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,137
(LAUGHING)

1158
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,141
No, no, I'm Tom Baxter
of the Chicago Baxters.

1159
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,935
Explorer, poet, adventurer.
Just back from Cairo

1160
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,438
where I searched
in vain for the legendary purple rose.

1161
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,774
How about that?

1162
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,693
Well, uh, who are you?

1163
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,237
- My name's Emma.
- Oh, that's lovely.

1164
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,822
What do you do, Emma?

1165
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,574
I'm a working girl.

1166
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,993
And what do you do, you delicate creature?

1167
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,787
(CHUCKLING) Anything that'll make a buck.

1168
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,083
Well, we Baxters
never really had to worry about money.

1169
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,128
I'll bet. You want to come along with me?

1170
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,422
Where to, Emma?

1171
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,675
Where I work.
I think you might have a good time.

1172
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,846
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.

1173
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,431
I may be able to help.

1174
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,935
EMMA: Hi, girls. This is Tom.

1175
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,187
Hi there, ladies.

1176
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,771
Don't you all look enticing?

1177
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,523
I know what you want.

1178
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,776
You want to be the great white hunter
and you want me to be the tiger.

1179
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,071
(CHUCKLING) Uh, I don't get it.

1180
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,740
You will if you can afford it.

1181
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,617
I met Tom out at the amusement park.

1182
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,702
Oh, no, that's, uh, my hat.

1183
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,497
Uh, yes, I was, uh...
I was thinking about something.

1184
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,459
- I can imagine.
- Two of us at the same time?

1185
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,461
You know, I was
thinking about some very deep things.

1186
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,298
About God and his relation
with Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.

1187
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,967
And, I was thinking about life in general.

1188
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,303
The... The origin
of everything we see about us.

1189
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,973
The, uh... The finality
of death and how almost magical

1190
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,518
it seems in the... In the real world as, uh...
As opposed to the world of

1191
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,479
celluloid and flickering shadows.

1192
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,272
Where did you find this clown?

1193
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,483
For example, the miracle of birth.

1194
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,777
Now. I suppose
some of you lovely ladies are married.

1195
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,570
- Not anymore.
- No?

1196
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:07,243
Then, the absolutely
astonishing miracle of childbirth

1197
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,621
with all its attendant feelings
of humanity and pathos.

1198
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,331
I stand in awe of existence.

1199
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,626
- Do you want to tie me up?
- Tie you up?

1200
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,002
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

1201
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,422
(LAUGHING) Oh, that's very funny.
She's very funny.

1202
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,300
That's a nice sense of humor.
The absurd non sequitur.

1203
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,344
- What... What's your name, sweetheart?
- Martha.

1204
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,638
That's the same name
as the Ambassador's wife.

1205
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,015
Well, why didn't you
bring the Ambassador by?

1206
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,850
Well, he... He's still up on the screen.

1207
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:36,021
But, do you share my sense of wonderment
at the very fabric of being?

1208
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,067
The smell of a rose,
real food, sensuous music.

1209
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,027
I've got a child.

1210
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,195
- You do?
- Mmm.

1211
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,948
Oh, I see. You're a widow.
Uh, oh, poor thing.

1212
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,492
I got two kids and he's
right about giving birth.

1213
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,036
It is a beautiful experience.

1214
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,165
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I lost it.

1215
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,167
Sorry to hear that, Emma.

1216
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,044
It always makes me cry to think about it.

1217
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,588
Oh, there, there, now.
You'll have another chance.

1218
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,800
Come on, I'd be surprised
if all you ladies weren't married soon.

1219
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,385
Especially by the way you dress.

1220
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,429
It's so seductive to a man.

1221
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,389
Do you like these stockings, Tom?

1222
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,058
- Oh, they're just divine.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1223
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,853
What kind of a club is this, anyhow?

1224
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,564
God, Tom, you're a scream.

1225
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,357
He's terribly sweet.

1226
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,485
He is. I wouldn't mind doing him for nothing.

1227
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,654
Me neither, plus he's cute.

1228
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,989
Okay, you can count me in.

1229
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,241
Come on, Tom,
we're going to take you into the bedroom

1230
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,618
and give you an experience
you'll never forget.

1231
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,995
- And it's on us.
- Oh.

1232
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,580
I came here for a new experience.

1233
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,458
Well, now you're going
to get a champion roll in the hay.

1234
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,667
What? There's hay in the bedroom?

1235
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,171
(LAUGHING) You ever
been to a brothel before?

1236
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,424
- What's a brothel?
- You must be kidding.

1237
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,928
- A brothel, a bordello, a whore house.
- I'm not following.

1238
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,766
We go to bed with you
and make love and you pay us.

1239
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,644
Only because you're so sweet,
we want to treat you to a party.

1240
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,523
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1241
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,694
Boy, this doesn't
ring a bell with anything I know.

1242
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:10,949
Oh, come on, buddy.
You know about making love, don't you?

1243
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,576
I can't make love with you.

1244
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,036
Don't tell me you don't like women.

1245
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,288
Or you were wounded in the war.

1246
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,832
No, no, I'm in love with someone else.

1247
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,044
We're not talking about in love,
we're talking about making love.

1248
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,589
- But, I love Cecilia.
- Well, so what? Marry Cecilia.

1249
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,132
This is just for fun.

1250
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,051
Oh, I couldn't do that, Emma.

1251
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,345
Ladies, my, my gracious!

1252
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,890
Nah, uh, look, don't think I'm
not appreciative of your offer.

1253
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,184
Though, I must say,
the concept is totally new to me.

1254
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,939
But, I'm just... I'm hopelessly
head over heels in love with Cecilia.

1255
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,482
She is all I want.

1256
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,276
My devotion is to her, my loyalties.

1257
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,947
Every breath
she takes makes my heart dance.

1258
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,741
This guy just kills me.

1259
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,994
Are there any other guys like you out there?

1260
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,415
CECILIA: Lawson's Music Store.

1261
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,000
This store has been here since I was a kid.

1262
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,503
Yeah. I wish I could play an instrument.

1263
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:09,007
That's my other ambition in life,
is to be a great classical violinist.

1264
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,635
Thousands cheering me night after night.

1265
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,262
I can play the ukulele.

1266
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,180
- You can?
- Uh-huh. My father taught me

1267
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,974
before he ran away.

1268
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,355
I'm Alabamy bound

1269
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:27,359
There'll be no heebie jeebies hanging 'round

1270
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,113
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth

1271
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,282
All I'm worth

1272
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,535
To put my tootsies in an upper berth

1273
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,537
Just hear that choo-choo sound

1274
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,705
Whoo-hoo!

1275
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,542
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground

1276
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,212
And then I'll holler
'cause the world will know

1277
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,714
Here I go

1278
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,885
I'm Alabamy bound

1279
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,052
Whoa.

1280
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,972
I'm Alabamy bound

1281
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,682
That was just wonderful.

1282
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,850
- Oh.
- That's wonderful.

1283
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,685
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, I was never... It's like a dream.

1284
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,728
(PIANO PLAYING)

1285
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,854
Oh, listen.

1286
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,980
I love my baby...

1287
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,232
My baby loves me

1288
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,236
I don't know nobody as happy as we

1289
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,822
She's only 20

1290
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,449
And I'm 21

1291
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,577
We never worry

1292
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,537
We're just having fun

1293
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,665
Sometimes we quarrel

1294
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,210
And maybe we fight

1295
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,048
But then we make up the following night

1296
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,967
When we're together

1297
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,094
We're great company

1298
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,722
I love my baby

1299
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,766
And my baby loves me

1300
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,145
- That was wonderful. Oh, you...
- Aw, that was, you know...

1301
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,230
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1302
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,023
Well, oh, after
the Lindbergh movie you should do...

1303
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,067
- The phone.
...a musical, really.

1304
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,902
Do you think...
You know, I did a one-bit in one once.

1305
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,820
I know, I saw Dancing Doughboys, sure.

1306
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,239
(LAUGHING) Dancing Doughboys?

1307
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,532
- You remembered.
- Yeah, that was great.

1308
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,076
I remember you turned
to Ina Beasley and you said,

1309
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,620
"I won't be going south
with you this winter."

1310
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,288
That's exact... Right, right!

1311
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,667
"I won't be going south
with you this winter. We have a little, uh,

1312
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,794
"score to settle
on the other side of the Atlantic."

1313
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,505
"Does this mean
I won't be seeing you ever again?"

1314
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,674
"Well, ever is a long time."

1315
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,134
"When you leave, don't look back."

1316
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,887
(CHUCKLING) You remember that...
You remember it perfectly.

1317
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:23,225
And then... And then
I took her in my arms, and I kissed her,

1318
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,644
knowing it was for the last time.

1319
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,108
God, you're beautiful, Cecilia.

1320
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,610
Was it fun? Kissing Ina Beasley?

1321
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,279
Oh, it was just, you know, it's a movie kiss.

1322
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,780
You know,
we professionals, we can put that...

1323
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,490
That stuff on just like that.

1324
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,701
It looked like you loved her.

1325
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,005
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my goodness!

1326
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,799
Feel my heart.

1327
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,634
- Uh, I... I...
- (EXHALES)

1328
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,679
I have to... I should...
Thank you so much for the ukulele.

1329
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,514
Oh, well, don't be offended.
I didn't mean to...

1330
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,976
Oh, no. I'm not offended.
I'm just, uh... I'm confused.

1331
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,313
I'm married.
I just met a wonderful new man.

1332
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,356
He's fictional, but you can't have everything.

1333
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,191
Look, can I see you later?

1334
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,235
No, no. I'm meeting Tom.

1335
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,072
My own creation plagues me.

1336
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,284
- Anything happening out there?
- Not a thing.

1337
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,036
Life is amazing, isn't it?

1338
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,038
One little minor
character takes some action...

1339
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,164
Minor?

1340
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,665
...and the whole world
is turned upside down.

1341
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,958
COUNTESS: What if he never comes back?

1342
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,044
We just drift until they shut the projector.

1343
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,170
- Will you shut up?
- Now calm down, calm down.

1344
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,254
And stop that!

1345
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,881
- He'll be back. I feel it.
- Was she always like that?

1346
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,049
I don't want to sit around and wait.

1347
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,884
- That's exactly what they want.
- Who?

1348
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,761
- The bosses.
- Oh.

1349
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,387
Look at us!

1350
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,515
Sitting around,
slave to some stupid scenario.

1351
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,770
Meanwhile, the fat cats in Hollywood
are getting rich on our work!

1352
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,231
- Stop it!
- Studio heads, writers, movie stars!

1353
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,525
Uh, but we're the ones who sweat!

1354
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,694
We're the characters
on the screen, not them.

1355
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,779
You're a Red!

1356
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,447
I say unite, brothers,

1357
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,324
unite and take action!

1358
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,284
Why don't you shut up and sit down?

1359
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,161
- What possible action...
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1360
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,245
Shut up, will you?

1361
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,122
What if all this
is merely a matter of semantics?

1362
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,540
How can it be semantics?

1363
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,418
Well, wait a minute.
Let's just re-adjust our definitions.

1364
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,671
Let's redefine ourselves as the real world,

1365
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,382
and them as the
world of illusion and shadow.

1366
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,426
You see, we're reality, they're a dream.

1367
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,595
You better calm down.

1368
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,807
You've been up on the screen,
flickering too long.

1369
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,435
REPORTER: It's confirmed.
LAWYER: It is?

1370
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,770
LAWYER: I was afraid this might happen.

1371
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,854
REPORTER: The Tom Baxter character

1372
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,439
tried to leave the screen in four theaters.

1373
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,402
St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and Detroit,
and he almost made it in Detroit.

1374
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,654
- It looks bad.
- The movie houses in those towns

1375
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,988
are in a state of pandemonium.

1376
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,407
There's no way to keep the lid on it.

1377
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,325
I see lawsuits, hundreds of lawsuits!

1378
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,119
We better pull the picture out of release.

1379
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,454
- What, in those towns?
- No, everywhere.

1380
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,498
Something's obviously
gone very wrong here,

1381
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:55,711
and the best course of action
is to shut down, take our losses

1382
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,714
and get out of this mess
before it really gets out of hand.

1383
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,632
Sure, can you
imagine hundreds of Tom Baxters

1384
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,842
flying around wild?

1385
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,636
Right, and you
responsible for every one of them.

1386
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,098
Well, the best thing to do is to quit
while there's only one of them out there.

1387
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,349
But what do we do about him?

1388
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,101
We've got to get him back in the picture.

1389
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,854
Then we turn off the projector,
and burn the prints.

1390
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,021
And the negative.

1391
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,816
What a shame. It was such a good picture.

1392
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,901
I missed you. You're late.

1393
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,029
I'm sorry,
I just... I came as quickly as I could.

1394
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,991
- I love you.
- Oh! Oh, thank you.

1395
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,911
Tom, my feelings are so jumbled.

1396
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,414
Oh, I know, I know.
You're married, and you're old-fashioned,

1397
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,874
and I'm a whole new idea.

1398
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,501
But the truth is you're unhappily married.

1399
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,253
And I'm gonna take you away from all this.

1400
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,422
Yeah, I know you love me.

1401
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,383
Cecilia, I do love you.
Don't you share my feelings?

1402
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,343
Well, I... That's just it.

1403
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,722
(STAMMERING) You're some
kind of phantom.

1404
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:52,017
Look, I don't want
to talk any more about what's real

1405
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,395
and what's illusion. Life's too short
to spend time thinking about life.

1406
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,564
- Let's just live it.
- Live it how?

1407
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,524
Well, we'll begin with dinner.

1408
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,235
Oh, well, listen.
No, I've only got a few dollars.

1409
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,528
Well, we're not gonna use your money.

1410
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,863
Well, that's all we have!

1411
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,490
Unless you've done something.

1412
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,159
Well, say no more.
The moon will be full, the stars will be out,

1413
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,327
and we're going stepping.

1414
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,788
- But we're broke.
- Leave that to me.

1415
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,108
It's him! Tom, you're back!

1416
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,569
I want you to meet my fiancée, Cecilia.

1417
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,112
This... Oh, well, you know all these people.

1418
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,906
It's not possible!

1419
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,741
I'm in the world of the possible.

1420
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,911
Yeah? Well, you better get back
in the story, you little weasel!

1421
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,871
Ah! You anticipate me.

1422
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,458
- Follow me!
- FATHER DONNELLY: Saints preserve us.

1423
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,543
Trust me.

1424
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,419
LARRY: He just comes and goes
like he pleases.

1425
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,838
Come on.

1426
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,881
- Where am I?
- But she can't be in here.

1427
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,383
- Why not?
- Come on.

1428
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,009
- I feel so light!
- Cecilia, my money is good up here.

1429
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,678
- You've got too much money.
- Like I'm floating on air!

1430
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,971
But it'll upset the balance.

1431
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,764
- It sure does.
- What's the difference? He's back, isn't he?

1432
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,932
I told you he'd be back.

1433
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,642
Can we get on with the plot now?

1434
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,269
How can we with her here?

1435
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,771
But she's here with me,
and I'll sock any man in the jaw

1436
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,897
who makes her feel unwanted.

1437
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,567
- Well, it's about time you got back here!
- Right!

1438
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,735
Now we finally go to the Copacabana.

1439
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,404
None of us have eaten in ages.

1440
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,864
Good, I'm bringing a guest.

1441
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,408
Well, won't Kitty Haynes be surprised.

1442
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,373
- Table for seven, please, Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,542
- Seven?
- Seven.

1444
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,128
That's impossible. It's always six.

1445
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,046
We have an extra.

1446
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,631
Seven, Arturo.

1447
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,676
This person?

1448
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,224
So let's not speak of love sublime

1449
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,729
Because time brings on a breakup

1450
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:08,236
There'll be no tears
and no emotional scenes

1451
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,323
To spoil my makeup

1452
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,994
And when the end comes

1453
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,163
I'll take up the slack

1454
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,581
Would you like some more champagne?

1455
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,416
Oh, thank you.

1456
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,585
Listen, Tom,
I don't know what they're charging you,

1457
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,546
but those champagne
bottles are filled with ginger ale.

1458
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,381
- That's the movies, kid!
- Shh.

1459
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,301
Oh, I don't care. I love every minute of it.

1460
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,684
Every Sunday, Monday

1461
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:46,524
One day at a time

1462
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:53,657
Let's take it one day at a time

1463
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,994
Let's take it

1464
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:05,043
One day at a time

1465
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,840
MAN: Bravo! Bravo!

1466
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,682
Thank you, thank you.

1467
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,394
- Who are you?
- Oh, no, I'm... I just... I came with Tom.

1468
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,396
You sing so beautifully.

1469
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,315
What the hell is this?

1470
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,984
We're supposed to meet and marry.

1471
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,152
- Who's the skirt?
- My fiancée.

1472
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,404
- What?
- Oh, no, wait...

1473
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,197
- HENRY: He met her in New Jersey.
- What is this?

1474
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,907
Kitty, she's real.

1475
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,288
- (SCREAMS)
- COUNTESS: Kitty!

1476
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,708
Quick! Pour... Pour ginger ale on her!

1477
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,001
What's all the fuss about?

1478
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,794
Uh, nothing, nothing, Arturo.

1479
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,338
- We were just leaving. Come on. Let's go.
- Leaving? Leaving where?

1480
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,923
Hey, I'm all mixed up!

1481
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,591
I'm gonna show Cecilia the town.

1482
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,885
Are we just chucking out the plot, sir?

1483
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,430
Exactly. It's every man for himself!

1484
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,141
Then I don't have to seat people anymore.

1485
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,351
I can do what it is I've always wanted to do.

1486
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,519
What's that?

1487
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,603
Hit it, boys!

1488
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,188

(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

1490
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,555
I had such a wonderful time.

1491
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,973
Me, too.

1492
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,017
Where are all the others?

1493
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,979
Oh, I don't know.
Well, probably just still dancing away.

1494
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,234
Why? Does it matter?
I wanted to get you alone.

1495
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,194
It's so beautiful here.

1496
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,032
Oh! The white telephone.

1497
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,200
Oh...

1498
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,037
I've dreamed of having a white telephone.

1499
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,164
Your dreams are my dreams.

1500
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,624
My whole life, I've wondered

1501
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,335
what it would be like
to be this side of the screen.

1502
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,963
You see that city out there waking up?

1503
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,465
That's yours for the asking.

1504
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,551
My heart's beating so fast!

1505

GIL: Cecilia!

1506
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,563
Gil! What are you doing here?

1507
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,398
Well, I... I came in here to think.

1508
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,899
What are you doing here?

1509
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,527
I took her on a date, all right?

1510
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,195
Now, can't you just leave us alone?

1511
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,364
No, I can't leave her alone.

1512
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,533
I'm jealous.

1513
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,118
You're jealous?

1514

Well, what do you want me to say?

1515
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,913
I can't get Cecilia out of my mind.

1516

Gil, do you mean that?

1517
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:34,460
Oh, for God's sake,
would you go back to Hollywood? Please.

1518
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,172
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit it, Cecilia.

1519
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,883
You know, you said I had a magical glow?

1520
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,094
But that's you, you're the one that has one.

1521
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,890
And even though we've just met,
I know that this is the real thing.

1522
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,934
You can't be in love with Cecilia.
She's in love with me.

1523
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,270
I'll tell you what, why don't you
turn around and re-enter the film?

1524
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm never going back!

1525
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,607
I can't believe it, they're at it again.

Tom, will you get back up here?

1527
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,111
See, there you go, Tom.
You're ruining everything.

1528
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,696
You are!
You're the one who's ruining everything.

1529
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,364
You know, if it wasn't for me,
there wouldn't be any you!

1530
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,991
Don't be so sure! I could've been played

1531
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,910
by Fredric March or Leslie Howard!

1532
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,705
You're wrong. The part's
too insignificant to attract a major star.

1533
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,249
- Insignificant!
- Like hell it is! What are you talking about?

1534
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,751
Minor character?
I am not a minor character!

1535
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:15,919
What do you mean, a minor character?

1536
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,212
Jeez!

1537
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,631
You know, I haven't
been able to think of anything since we met.

1538
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:23,468
I just, I have to have some time with you
to show you what real life can be like

1539
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,262
if two people really care for each other.

1540
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,057
Last week, I was unloved.

1541
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:33,478
Now, two people love me,
and it's the same two people.

1542
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,647
Go with the real guy, honey. We're limited.

1543
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,857
Go with Tom. He's got no flaws.

1544
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,318
Go with somebody, child,
'cause I's getting bored.

1545
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,112
She's gonna marry me.
You're just... You're wasting your time.

1546
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,198
Will you get back on the screen?

1547
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,533
I'm trying to tell Cecilia I'm in love with her.

1548
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,995
I love you.
I'm honest, dependable, courageous,

1549
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,081
romantic and a great kisser.

1550
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,249
And I'm real!

1551
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,000
LARRY: Let's go, Cecilia!

1552
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,628
Choose one of them
so we can settle this thing.

1553
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,673
The most human of all attributes
is your ability to choose.

1554
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,132
Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1555
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,677
If she chooses Tom,
how are we gonna end the story?

1556
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,136
We'll be stuck here forever.

1557
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,681
Father Donnelly can
marry us right here in the movie house.

1558
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,015
No, that won't stand up in court.

1559
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,350
The priest has to be human.

1560
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,936
The Bible never says
a priest can't be on film!

1561
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,397
No, uh, I'm already married!

1562
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,274
Come away with me to Hollywood.

1563
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,609
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1564
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,861
Do something impulsive
for once in your life.

1565
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:28,283
I mean, just throw your stuff in a valise
and come away with me. Really.

1566
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,867
(CHUCKLING) And don't forget that ukulele.

1567
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,536
What ukulele?

1568
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,121
Look, I love you.

1569
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:37,208
I know that only happens in movies,
but I do.

1570
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,298
Tom?

1571
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,093
Cecilia, you're throwing away perfection.

1572
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,679
Don't tell her that! We need Tom back!

1573
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,306
It's so romantic.

1574
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,640
Oh, women!

1575
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,891
(SIGHS)

1576
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,730
Well, I'm crushed, I'm devastated. It's...

1577
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,650
Tom, try to understand.

1578
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,486
You'll be fine.

1579
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,157
In your world, things have a way
of always working out right.

1580
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,867
See, I'm a real person.

1581
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:16,164
No matter how tempted I am,
I have to choose the real world.

1582
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,751
I loved every minute with you.

1583
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,921
And I'll never forget our night on the town.

1584
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,926
Goodbye.

1585
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:44,442
HENRY: Well, you're better off with us,
old sport, you really are.

1586
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,778
JASON: Can we get on
with The Purple Rose of Cairo, please?

1587
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,030
COUNTESS: If anyone wants me,
I'll be in reel six.

1588
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,699
- Kitty's waiting for you.
- DELILAH: Lord have mercy!

1589
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,786
What a day! What a day!

1590
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,819
So, your explorer friend's okay?

1591
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,612
I saw him walking around town with you.

1592
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,740
Yeah, he's okay. No thanks to you.

1593
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,991
I didn't mean to be so rough on him.

1594
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,701
It's just that
I get jealous when it comes to you.

1595
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,995
- Do you?
- Christ, you know I do.

1596
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,081
I know I treat you rough. It's my way.

1597
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,834
- It doesn't mean I don't feel for you.
- Oh.

1598
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,838
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

1599
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,048
- Here we go again.
- You don't feel for me, Monk.

1600
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,633
All you feel for is yourself!

1601
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,387
Your beer, your card games, your women!

1602
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,681
Okay, I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

1603
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,183
- No, I'm not kidding...
- It's too late, Monk. It's too late, I'm going.

1604
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,018
I should have left a long time ago.

1605
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,521
I would have,
except I was scared of being alone.

1606
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,772
So what now?

1607
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,191
You found some chump
who's filling your head with big ideas?

1608
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,777
No, no, I got a chance to change my life.

1609
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,863
- I'm moving to Hollywood.
- All right, now listen, Cecilia,

1610
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,532
I said I was sorry
about being rough with your friend,

1611
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,616
but let's shape up!

1612
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,285
- It's too late, Monk!
- Look, like hell it...

1613
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,703
I said like hell it is!

1614
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,205
And don't be giving me
that big-headed stuff, you hear?

1615
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,790
Because I'm the guy
that can slap you down!

1616
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,958
Go ahead and hit me, Monk!

1617
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,793
Just go ahead and hit me!

1618
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,253
- I'm leaving anyway!
- Yeah, well,

1619
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,213
this never would have happened
if you didn't meet that guy.

1620
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,257
That's probably right,
and we would have just gone on

1621
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,469
the same way till we were too old
to even hope for something better.

1622
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,972
But I did meet him!
I did meet him, and I have feelings for him!

1623
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,725
- And he has for me!
- What about me?

1624
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,395
I still care for you, Monk,
if you can believe that.

1625
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,273
But out of the blue,
for the first time in my life,

1626
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,399
somebody's in love with me!

1627
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,902
No, but you just met each other.

1628
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,614
Love at first sight
doesn't only happen just in the movies.

1629
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:55,948
Hey, Cecilia, don't go.

1630
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,909
You hear me?
I said don't go! Now wait a minute.

1631
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,495
- Don't! I said... I said don't go!
- So long, Monk.

1632
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,622
- You stay here, you hear?
- You take care of yourself.

1633
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:05,666
Oh, yeah? All right, well, go, go!
See if I care.

1634
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,043
Go, see what it is out there!

1635
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,171
It ain't the movies! It's real life!

1636
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,089
It's real life, and you'll be back!

1637
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,592
You mark my words! You'll be back!

1638
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,787
Cecilia, what are you doing here?

1639
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,748
- Meeting Gil Shepherd.
- They all gone.

1640
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,083
They...

1641
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,793
What do... What do you mean?

1642
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,962
Went back to Hollywood.

1643
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,338
Gil, too?

1644
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,298
Mr. Shepherd, yeah.

1645
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,468
As soon as Tom Baxter
went back up on the movie screen,

1646
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,178
he couldn't wait to get out of here.

1647
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,139
He said this was a close call for his career.

1648
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,685
I think he's gonna play Charles Lindbergh.

1649
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,235
Don't forget, Cecilia,

1650
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,154
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers start today.

1651
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,853
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1652
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:56,777
And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak

1653
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:02,450
And I seem to find the happiness I seek

1654
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:09,373
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1655
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:14,545
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1656
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:21,719
And the cares that hung
around me through the week

1657
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,058
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

1658
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,065
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1659
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,235
Oh, I love to climb a mountain

1660
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,447
And to reach the highest peak

1661
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:45,076
But it doesn't thrill me half as much

1662
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,871
As dancing cheek to cheek
