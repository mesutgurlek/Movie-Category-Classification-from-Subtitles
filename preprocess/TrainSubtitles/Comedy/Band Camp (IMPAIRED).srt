00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,606
Suits you well.

159
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:25,278
Golly, jeepers, thanks. Hey, you know,
since l'm an official band geek and all...

160
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,517
can you guess
what my favourite piece of music is?

161
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,962
-l have no idea.
-The Nutcracker.

162
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,322
MATT: Step back, bitch.

163
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,682
Holy mother of Mozart.

164
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,596
This is bad.

165
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
You didn't know Jackie Chan
was in the house, did you boys, huh?

166
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,238
Stop that. Stop that now.

167
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,557
Those knob-slobbers started it.

168
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,161
That's not true, sir.
We simply reminded him to wear his beanie.

169
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,522
And then he viciously assaulted
Brandon's genitals.

170
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:54,885
-That's a lie, you dick-snot.
-Oscar, Jimmy, escort this man to see...

171
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,357
-the Macro.
-The what?

172
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,957
-You're dead.
-Now, gentlemen.

173
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,837
God, Brandon, are you okay?

174
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:06,281
You want to tell me
what the hell you're doing here, Stifler?

175
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,801
lt don't matter, Big O.
He ain't gonna be here long.

176
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,956
-Bitch!
-Get over here.

178
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,715
-What the fuck's a macro?
-The Macro.

179
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:16,923
Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer.

180
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,282
l heard this one time,
this kid went into that office...

181
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,039
a baritone and came out a soprano.

182
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,960
-Clarinet up the ass backwards, yo.
-What?

183
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,999

Oh, l'm sorry.

Frankenstein. Scary stuff.

189
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,796
l am just a Boris Karloff nut.

190
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,000
-l'm the Macro, Mr. Levenstein.
-Holy shit, you're Jim's dad.

191
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,400
He screwed that redheaded nympho chick
at my lake house.

192
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:06,036
-Oh, my, you're not a Stifler?
-Yeah, l'm Steve's brother, Matt.

193
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,877
-There are two Stiflers?
-Yes, sir. Hey, what're you doing here?

194
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:14,801
Oh, well, Jim is now out of the house,
married to Michelle...

195
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,924
that redheaded nympho chick
that you spoke of.

196
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,960
And, being a former
Tall Oaks Counsellor of the Year...

197
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,962
she was hired to be the Macro this summer,
but she got pregnant.

198
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,597
No doubt due to the tendencies
you alluded to earlier.

199
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,599
And l have a great rapport with
young people...

200
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,996
so l just stepped in and volunteered.

201
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:39,477
That cretin is not in our band,
and we are not responsible for his actions.

202
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,206
-Who pissed in your piccolo?
-l'm sensing some hostility here.

203
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,561
-He poisoned my band.
-What?

204
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,525
-l'm the Macro and it's my job to deal with...
-What is he doing here?

205
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:49,883
-Matt Stifler is pure evil just like his brother.
-...conflict.

206
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,400

She seems nice.

209
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,846
There are rules, of course.

210
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,565
-You will have to wear a beanie.
-Yeah.

211
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:04,923
Oh, l know. lt's a little silly,
but it's tradition here...

212
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,477
something you're familiar with,
being on the football team, l'm sure...

213
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,957
with your elephant walks and circle jerks
and drinking butt beer.

214
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,277
But here, you just have to wear
a silly little hat and...

215
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,801
-a somewhat stylish Tall Oaks T-shirt.
-Yeah.

216
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,363
So, just go with the flow, Matt...

217
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,756
and you will have loads of fun...

218
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,039

l really wanted to come last year,
but Computer Camp conflicted, and--

222

Oh, yeah, that was here when l arrived.
l think it has your name on it.

What is it?

Hi, welcome to Casa de Stifler.
l'll be your host, Matt.

00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,557
Every day here, l'll make it my sincere goal
not to have to kick your ass.

a whole lot better, ladies.

aren't you?

-No problem, senorita.

Well, it looks like Steve gave someone
the old Stifler bang-and-boot.

-ls there a problem here?
-No, everything's fine.

-Have fun at Band Camp.
-Thank you, l will.

-Later.
-Word.

246
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,960
You need to start showing some respect
around here, Stifler.

247
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,323
You need to show yourself
back to your table, Big Dog.

248

Out of my way, Yo.

Hola, chicas.

So, what's going on tonight?
We gonna party, get a little crazy?

251
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,235
Who wants to rack up
a few frequent fucker miles?

252
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:37,285
-You know, you are the most--
-Most sexy man ever to come to Band Camp.

-100%% hombre.
-All right, my room, 8:00.

many, many exciting activities planned...

263
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:16,242
not the least of which is
the race for the Tall Oaks Cup.

264
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,363
So let the games begin.

265

MATT: Bandeez Gone Wild.
Scene One. Party hombre.

266
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:31,279
lt's called Strip Trivia. We made it up.
lt's a Band Camp tradition.

00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:35,725
"Fourth and Long," "Sextuplets,"
"Banging Babes," and "Who Blew Me?"

268
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,884
This looks like my kind of game.
Shall we play?

269
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,725
You sit in the middle.
Your game, my seating chart.

270
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,326
Sit a little closer, ladies.

271
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,637
Don't be scared. lt's all right.

272
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,842
Okay...

273
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:51,005
the rules are simple.
You choose a category and a question...

274
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,442
and every time you miss, you strip.

275
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,562
Hell, yeah.

276
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:58,162
-l'll go first. "Who Blew Me?"
-Good.

277
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:05,605
l am a silver Stradivarius trumpet
played by a Pulitzer Prize winner.

278
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:07,881
Who blew me?

279
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,436
-Yeah, like l'd know.
-Sorry.

280
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,046
Lose the shoes, and pick again.

281
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,004
You didn't tell me this shit was about music.

282
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,557
-Well, it is Band Camp, moron.
-Hey, to be fair...

283
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,759
maybe we should just give him a head start.

284
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,805
All right. Yeah.

285
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,639
Okay, all right. All right.

286
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,965
What's wrong with you?
Scared to show off the mosquito bites?

287

l've matured since the fourth grade, Matt.
Have you?

-Quit calling me that.
-Okay, okay, moving on.

290
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:46,360
-Matt, just pick another question, please.
-All right, screw it. Whatever.

291
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,083
There you go. Suck on that.

292
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,201
-Fourth and Long.
-Sure, no problem.

293
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:00,679

which has the longest fourth movement?

Got to let the big boys breathe.
All right, we play by my rules now.

-Wait. But first, does anybody want a beer?
-l do.

301

The counsellors have a secret stash
in the fridge across the hall.

-Would you mind?
-Now we're talking about a fucking party.

So, this afternoon, while the counsellors
were practising for the talent show...

621
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:45,155
l faked an asthma attack,
and l changed both of the cameras.

622
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:47,807
lt's their talent show routine, au naturel.

623
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:50,761
Dude, you filthy little cyberfucker. Shit.

625
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:05,643
Hey, so, l took your advice about Chloe.
l used the Rover to deliver a soda.

626
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:09,882
-That was your cool, crazy idea?
-Yeah, l think she actually liked it.

627
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,879
-Yeah, that sounds gay.
-lt's not gay.

628
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:17,120
Anyway, there's
this bonfire-slushee party tonight...

Meister means "master" in German.

638
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:45,359
Get her drunk? That's the secret
of the ages? That's Step Number Two?

639
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:50,202
No, actually, it's Step Four. You don't have
the balls for Two or the tongue for Three.

640
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,800

-All right.
-Horn dog?

653
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:41,924
Yeah, it's his nickname. Dude will stick
his dick into anything. lt's unnatural.

Hey, maybe you should try a flute.

658
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,516
Now's a good time
to teach you those moves.

-You do?
-lt's what you always do. You're a fake.

You do whatever it takes
to be the centre of attention.

665
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:37,396
Just like when we were kids,
around me, you were regular old Matt...

666
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:40,958
but around Steve and his friends,
you were the Stiffmeister.

-What's up with that?
-That cock spring is getting laid?

675
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:21,845
True that. And here we are,
the two dopest homeboys in camp...

676
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:26,045
and we ain't got no prospects
for our palm pilots. That's fucked up, dawg.

and then devour him for dinner?

Stop.

-Okay.

Draw your arm back. There you go.

Shoulder to your target. Right.
Okay, now step forward.

Draw the ball over your ear...

862
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:46,084
and when you throw it, let it roll
right off your fingers, all right?

863
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:48,316
Okay.

864

See? l taught you something. What?

866
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,916
So every time l throw it,
you're gonna run and go get it?

867
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:01,679
That's generally how it works.

Okay, come by after dinner.

931
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,281
l'll leave my pompoms
in the window for you.

932
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,001
-You're late.
-Yeah, no shit. Open the window.

933
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:29,038
Hold on. Be careful with it.

934
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,884
All right, one condition
before l show you the fruits of my labours.

935
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:42,116
What's that?

936
01:05:42,447 --> 01:05:45,166
l want that picture
on that camera phone erased.

937
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,319
Nobody at school hears
about the triangle or the beanie.

938
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:01,921
l don't want anybody
to think l'm a dorky-ass bandee.

939
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:03,759
Fine. Like, now can we get on with it?

940
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:07,157
MATT: As soon as you get rid of that picture
of me on your phone.

941
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:23,686
PATTl: Are you going into town?
LAURlE: Not tonight. l'm too tired.

942
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,281
LAURlE: Besides, they're much hotter here.

943
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:29,165
l know. lt's a great crop this year.

944
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:47,121
-There. Done deal.
-Now can we see the video?

945
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,525
Stiffmeister Productions...

946
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:53,043
in association with
its talented new director, Matthew Stifler...

947
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,038
is happy to premier the unedited...

948
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:59,405
unfiltered, and un-fucking-believable
Bandeez Gone Wild.

949
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:01,802
Oh, yeah.

950
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:09,562
-Oh, my God.
-That is unbelievable.

951
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,517
-You're kidding me, right?
-That's great.

952
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:37,964
PATTl: Danielle likes Jimmy,
but she's like a foot taller than him.

953
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:39,446
And wait till you hear this.

954
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:41,995
Sheree slept with that big Oscar guy,
the drummer.

955
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:43,520
Said he was amazing.

956
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:47,159
LAURlE: l hooked up with Brandon once.
Some drummer. He has...

957
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,999
no rhythm,
and he can't even bang very long.

958
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:50,885
PATTl: Oh, my God. Are you serious?

959
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:54,960
LAURlE: Yeah, he's a preemie. l'm not talking
about the day he was born, either.

960
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:58,606
Can you get my back?
l think l got a little bit of sun today?

961
01:07:58,687 --> 01:07:59,676
Sure.

962
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:02,685
Get this. He has one ball.

963
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:05,477
PATTl: No way.
LAURlE: One ball.

964
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:09,400
Yeah, that why he carries that big stick
around everywhere.

965
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:11,443
lt's got his other ball on top.

966
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:16,245
Shit, shit, oh, shit.

967
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:17,516
[Screaming]

968
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,600
What is that thing?

969
01:08:27,647 --> 01:08:28,636
[Screaming]

970
01:08:34,087 --> 01:08:35,361
Let's kill it.

971
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:37,876
-Where'd he go?
-There he is.

972
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:39,036
Look out.

973
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,158
This is going into the lake.

974
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:22,556
No one's gonna know
about your little video.

975
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:25,161
'Cause the shit you got us doing on tape....

976
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:33,522
So we got a contest to win tomorrow.
And l don't want to see you.

977
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:35,002
Understand?

978
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:42,240
Did you help him?

979
01:10:06,207 --> 01:10:07,799
NELSON: With East Great Falls
in the lead...

980
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:10,526
Beechwood has to win
the Band Camp Playoffs.

981
01:10:10,647 --> 01:10:12,763
Direct yourselves to the marching field
in one hour.

982
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:17,398
Now, Dr. Choi, Brandon Vandecamp
from Beechwood...

983
01:10:17,487 --> 01:10:19,682
is our best musician by far...

984
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:24,557
and his father, Landon,
is our best donor, also by far.

985
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:29,520
CHOl: Robards needs talented musicians
as much as we need talented donors.

986
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,921
[Laughter]

987
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:37,961
lpecac.

988
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:43,319
-So how's it going? Are you having fun?
-lt's okay.

989
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:50,643
How about some lpecac, Vande-cooch?

990
01:10:53,447 --> 01:10:57,156
This herbal fucking extract will help you
Beechwood fief play in tune, huh?

991
01:10:58,647 --> 01:10:59,636
Shit.

992
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,036
l told you
l don't want to see you anymore, Stifler.

993
01:11:11,127 --> 01:11:13,197
Some day, you'll thank me, asshole.

994
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,401
-Orange?
-Again?

995
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:22,883
-Damn.
-That orange shit is janky.

996
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:24,798
l'm feeling grape, dawg.

997
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:31,355
OSCAR: l don't care how many times they
won. They're not getting the grape today.

998
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:33,722
JlMMY: That's what l'm talking about.

999
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:38,080
NELSON: Your five-time defending
champion...

1000
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:40,439
Beechwood Academy.

1001
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:14,324
-They're tight.
-Yeah, they're better then ever this year.

1002
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:15,806
Okay, everybody.

1003
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,403
lt's no surprise Beechwood is good.

1004
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,157
But this year is different.
This year, we can beat them.

1005
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,119
We've worked hard,
and we are good enough...

1006
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,675
and this is our time, so lets win the cup.

1007
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:30,678
Yeah!

1008
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,805
NELSON: Beechwood Academy.

1009
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:09,277
Their music today was composed
by senior drum major...

1010
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:11,244
Brandon Vandecamp.

1011
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:12,476
Beat that.

1012
01:13:15,327 --> 01:13:18,717
NELSON: East Great Falls,
you may enter the field for competition.

1013
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,364
ELYSE: Band 10 hut. One, two, ready.
MATT: Shit.

1014
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,960
Leesy, wait, no.

1015
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:42,003
No. Wait.

1016
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,117
You know, l'm so sorry.
l don't know what happened.

1017
01:13:54,207 --> 01:13:56,277
Not my shoes. Here we go.

1018
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:01,962
Stifler!

1019
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,237
MACRO: You know, you're like
your brother, Steve.

1020
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:24,797
And l don't think those are the shoes
you should be so eager to fill.

1021
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,845
You know, the people
Steve thought were his friends...

1022
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,481
-really didn't like him very much.
-What?

1023
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,966
But l think you're different.

1024
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:36,120
l think people want to like you, Matt.
You just make it really hard.

1025
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:53,596
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
When you're a loser.

1026
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:04,005
Mr. Levenstein reports
that there were a few incidents...

1027
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,315
at camp.

1028
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:08,196
But he also says that...

1029
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:11,922
you bonded with the band briefly.

1030
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:19,880
When school starts,
you're going to be on a very short leash.

1031
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:23,682
Remember, the Shermanator sees it all.

1032
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:26,235
Be gone.

1033
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,083
Did everybody hate my brother?

1034
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:47,437
Stardate: August 21, 2005.

1035
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:50,282
Some progress made with Stiffy Junior.

1036
01:15:50,687 --> 01:15:53,042
Behaviour modification evident.

1037
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:56,119
Will continue to monitor.

1038
01:15:56,727 --> 01:15:58,877
Shermanator out.

1039
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,922
A little "Double-D Sheree" action.

1040
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,124
Little bit of Dr. Robot.

1041
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,320
Crazy fucker.

1042
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:28,001
Hey, Stifler, where's your instrument?

1043
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:29,236
Dude, you're in the wrong uniform.

1044
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:32,000
Screw them, dude. They're gonna freak out
when they see the video.

1045
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:34,203
Look, we thought that if we had
an advance screening...

1046
01:17:34,287 --> 01:17:36,278
then everyone would see
that you're not really a dork.

1047
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:38,642
l can't. lt's gone.

1048
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:42,684
-What?
-The video, man, l deleted it.

1049
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:44,636
Why?

1050
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:48,087
Guess little bro's quitting
the family business.

1051
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,600
Are you kidding me?

1052
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:54,838
He went fucking bandee on us.

1053
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,196
[Bell ringing]

1054
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:12,046
Hey, what's up, guys?

1055
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:14,684
You a dead man, motherfucker.

1056
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:17,358
-You, too, little man.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1057
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:21,396
Dude, the purple puke was an accident.
Somebody switched the coolers.

1058
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:28,043
Hey, that orange shit is janky, yo.

1059
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:33,357
Chloe, we never saw Elyse,
you know, naked.

1060
01:18:34,087 --> 01:18:35,964
Matt turned off the computer.

1061
01:18:36,807 --> 01:18:39,275
So we're just supposed to forgive him now?

1062
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:42,921
-He's still an asshole.
-You're right.

1063
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,161
l am an asshole.

1064
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,717
l can't take back spying on you...

1065
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,082
and l can't win that Bandee Cup thing.

1066
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:52,960
But l can help someone
get what she deserves.

1067
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:55,837
l'm not asking you to forgive me.

1068
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:58,515
Just help me help Elyse.

1069
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:11,362
-l got the number.
-Go ahead.

1070
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:14,837
555-0171 .

1071
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:19,406
He shouldn't have been dumping lpecac
in anyone's cooler.

1072
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:21,239
We could've won on our own.

1073
01:19:23,447 --> 01:19:27,565
l don't even care that he saw me on camera.
Well, l mean l do, but....

1074
01:19:28,607 --> 01:19:30,757
Honey, this just came for you.

1075
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:35,766
lt's from Robards.

1076
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,395
What's it say?

1077
01:19:40,087 --> 01:19:42,555
Dr. Choi wants to meet with me?

1078
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:01,598
-Okay.
-Okay.

1079
01:20:01,807 --> 01:20:03,638
-Okay.
-Okay.

1080
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:06,282
Bye.

1081
01:20:21,847 --> 01:20:24,156
Hi. Elyse Houston.

1082
01:20:25,327 --> 01:20:27,966
l have an appointment with Dr. Choi.

1083
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:32,443
-You're not in the book.
-No, there must be some mistake. See...

Stifler.

1089
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,477
You son of a bitch.

1090
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:13,285
What? lt wasn't enough
for you to humiliate me at Band Camp?

1091
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:15,927
Now you have to set me up here?

1092
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:37,165
What's going on here?

Excellent audition, Miss. Houston.
Let's go discuss that scholarship.

1099

1100
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:57,084

You know...

Picardo is a brand of piccolo.

1111

You really are an asshole sometimes...

Stiffy.

Hook a brother up with some mad beats.

OSCAR: Will you cut that out?

1116
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:04,923
Your name is James Hi Ping Chong.

1117
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:06,639
Your dad owns a Chinese restaurant.

1118
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,241
You live in the suburbs.
You ain't never gonna be a gangsta.

1119
