00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,323
...a good time the other night.

315
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,986
Yeah.

316
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,720
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patrón will get you.

[LAUGHS]

318
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,494
So I was thinking...

319
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,765
...after work we could...

320
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,830
You know...

321
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:45,537
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

322
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:46,874
It was definitely fun.

323
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,950
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

324
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,145
So that's why I scheduled you.

325
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,187
To work.

326
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,984
So...

327
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,090
Are we good?

328
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,556
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

329
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:05,961
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

330
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,535
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,881
KELLI ANN:
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or?

333
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,381
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

334
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,019
KELLI ANN: Why?
- Hm?

335
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,052
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

336
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:29,848
I'll wait at the bar.

337
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:32,951
That's a great idea.

338
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,701
What can I get you?

339
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,270
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

340
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:47,135
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

341
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,873
I don't know if you'd call it "hot."

342
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,309
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time...

343
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,073
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

344
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,540
Yeah.

345
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,708
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

346
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,446
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

347
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:04,490
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

348
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,685
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting."

349
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,921
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

350
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

351
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:15,733
Okay.

352
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,701
I just was actually in the area...

353
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,138
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

354
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,610
Because I had to return his pen.

355
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,879
Had to return this pen. He left this.

356
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,010
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

357
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,617
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

And I just...

367
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,928
I thought if I just ran into him...

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,858
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

369

Wait.

so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

375
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,185
Conor's never gonna call you.

376
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,950
Oh, really. How do you know?

377
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,651
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

378
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,295
He said it was nice meeting me.

379
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,988
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

380
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,498
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

381
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,832
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

382
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,633
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

383
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,207
Or maybe he lost my number...

384
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:05,403
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,572
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

386
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:14,181
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

387
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,914
She totally wrote him off.

388
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,786
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

389
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,621
She ran into him,
and it ended up that...

390
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,457
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

391
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,622
...by the way.
The rare exception.

392
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,667
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

393
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,600
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

394
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:35,175
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

395
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,971
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,942
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

397
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:43,141
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

398
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,786
I do it early, I do it often.

399
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:50,414
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

400
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:53,083
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

401
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,126
No exceptions.

402
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,035
Thank you.

00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,450
Everything okay?

00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,749
Oh, I was up all night.

on the nutmeg copy.

409
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,255
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

410
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,295
JANINE:
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

411
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:33,798
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

412
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,630
Okay.

413
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,135
So...

414
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,472
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

415
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,771
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

416
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,246
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

417
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,512
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

418
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,555
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

419
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,659
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

420
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,795
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

421
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,022
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

422
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,427
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

423
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:11,401
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

424
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:15,407
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

425
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:18,102
And then... Oh, there was Don...

426
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,841
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

427
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:23,917
I was delusional about that relationship.

428
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,577
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

429
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:29,019
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

430
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,819
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

431
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,791
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

432
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:36,931
...and that girl ended up getting married.

433
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,159
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

434
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,972
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

435
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:50,844
So what you're saying is...

436
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,311
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

437
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,008
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

438
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,812
Yes.

439
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,854
But the rule are guys like Neil...

440
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:05,956
...who are with girls like me...

441
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,653
...for seven years and aren't married...

442
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,388
...they're never getting married.

443
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,231
- No.
- No.

444
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,924
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

445
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:17,970
- It's not what she meant in that...
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

446
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,267
I absolutely was not talking about you.

447
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:24,378
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

448
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,140
GIGI:
Just me specifically, you know?

449
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,248
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

450
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:37,687
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

451
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,955
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

452
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,121
And then he tells me that he's married.

453
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,733
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

454
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,928
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

455
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,299
But he's married.

456
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,909
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

457
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,338
What's wrong with me?

458
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,369
Okay.

459
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,312
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

460
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:07,080
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

461
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:11,954
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

462
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,461
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

463
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,999
That he had finally met the one.

464
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,931
So he divorced his wife...

465
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,368
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

466
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,838
...and they're insanely happy.

467
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,603

1095
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,721
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1096
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,924
I just mean... I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1097
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:57,899
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

1098
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,096
Again with the sensitivity.

1099
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:02,299
To sensitivity.
