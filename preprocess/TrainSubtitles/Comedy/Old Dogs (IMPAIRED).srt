1
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,716
[Bryan Adams:
You've Been a Friend To Me]

2
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,887
[man] This walk is exactly
what you need.

3
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,690
You've been coiled up like a spring.
I don't even know who you are anymore.

4
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,959
It's a big meeting, I'd think
you'd be a little nervous.

5
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,933
I don't get nervous, Dan. I get excited.

6
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,870
Please don't tell the story.

7
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,735
You're a people person,
Charlie, that's wonderful,

8
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:39,502
but in business meetings you tell
personal items from my life,

9
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:42,409
- and it embarrasses me.
- Girls, girls, girls!

10
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:46,175
- [dog grunts]
- Hey! 10 miles! [laughs]

11
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,945
- [groans]
- I'm sorry, Lucky.

12
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:51,851
I think he's too old for sprints.
I can hear his legs clicking.

13
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,377
Those are my knees.

14
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:56,152
Do you really think I tell
that story for my own amusement?

15
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,250
I do it because it's a sales tool.

16
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,285
Charlie, let's win this account
on our pitch.

17
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,160
It's sports marketing.
You need an edge.

18
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:05,826
- I don't want to be the edge.
- Hey, mister! Little help!

19
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,495
Sure thing, guys!

20
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,634
- [boy grunts]
- [Charlie] Whoa!

21
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,937
- [boy] Ow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

22
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:15,967
- Why did you do that?
- My bad! Sorry!

23
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:18,809
- I didn't mean to.
- You're a monster!

24
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,508
[Dan] I'm sorry!

25
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,312
You're allergic to anything
under 4 feet. You're a mess.

26
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:25,320
- Promise you won't tell the story.
- Fine. I won't tell the story.

27
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,990
[Charlie] OK, you guys want to hear
the greatest Dan Rayburn story ever?

28
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,117
- [Dan] No, don't.
- Please. Come on, Danny.

29
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,129
All right. 7 years ago,
Dan's divorce had just come through

30
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,393
and his ex-wife had
left his heart in tatters.

31
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,162
And his bank account drained.
Tell them that.

32
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,795
- [speaking Japanese]
- He was taking it pretty well.

33
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,362
That's good.
You're taking it like a man!

34
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:47,102
Stiff upper lip! Getting smart!

35
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:50,577
- What?
- Oh, God!

36
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,774
[Charlie] People say I saved
my partner's life that day.

37
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,407
[wailing]

38
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,680
- So many people get divorced.
- [whines]

39
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,984
And neither one of you wanted kids.
Now that seems like a stroke of genius!

40
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:03,321
But that didn't console him.
I had to act. I had to do something.

41
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,817
Mr. Good Time is going to
teach you how to live! Yeah!

42
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:10,457
- Why are there 2 pieces of luggage?
- Oh, just a little jaunt.

43
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,962
- Nothing too wild.
- [Dan screams]

44
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:19,100
Hey, Mr. Good Times.
You said we'd come to Miami, we did.

45
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,199
Can we go home now?

46
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,073
- [siren sounds]
- Whoa!

47
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:23,578
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

48
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:25,204
Does this drink
come with a diving board?

49
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,511
It's insane! Just a sip, I think.

50
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,177
So as a best friend, I felt compelled

51
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,881
to give him a gentle reminder
of what it was like to be free.

52
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:36,284
- I want it to say: "free man!"
- [slurring] Free man.

53
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,724
Big letters, right across his chest.

54
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,728
"Free man!" Comprende?

55
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,892
- [exclaims in foreign language]
- Oh. Good night, nurse.

56
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,900
- [Dan screaming]
- [crowd cheering]

57
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,731
[Charlie] I could have sworn
that guy spoke English.

58
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,103
- It was supposed to say "free man."
- [screaming]

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,506
[crowd chanting]
Fremont, Fremont, Fremont...

60
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,008
Free man!

61
00:04:58,347 --> 00:04:59,746
[screaming]

62
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,843
[chuckling] It's funny, guys.
Come on. They love it.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,312
Then the unexpected happened.

64
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:09,791
Look at all the babes.
Don't look, don't look. Now look.

65
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,952
[Charlie] 14 hours after
signing his divorce papers,

66
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,656
Dan met Vicki, the girl of his dreams.

67
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,392
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

68
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,899
[Charlie] Girl in white, 11 o'clock.

69
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,424
- Yeah, but...
- Oh, give her the Queen's wave.

70
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,903
- No, the other Queen.
- Oh. Hello.

71
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,599
[Charlie] She was traveling
with a friend.

72
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,404
I thought maybe the friend
was a magician or a jazz dancer,

73
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,001
because of the way
she was moving her hands.

74
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:30,909
T urns out she's a hand model.

75
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,244
- [speaks Japanese]...hand model.
- A hand model?

76
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,681
They model with their hands.

77
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:38,278
[Charlie] So, within minutes,
Dan is back to his old self.

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,756
No, scratch that.
He's better than his old self.

79
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,257
Charlie, look at these pictures!

80
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,022
My whole life I've never taken
a good picture.

81
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,996
<i>[Dan and Vicki] * No matter how
they toss the dice, it had to be</i>

82
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,430
[Charlie] I'd never seen him
so free, OK?

83
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,764
I mean, so impulsive.
He was a changed man.

84
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,031
- [cracking]
- [grunting]

85
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,265
[Charlie] Or maybe not so changed.

86
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,275
It's hard to explain to a guy
who's never had an impulsive moment

87
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,777
in his life there's
2 kinds of impulsives.

88
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:05,746
The good kind, OK,
but this is plain stupid!

89
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,978
That was so romantic.

90
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:16,683
But when he woke up, he remembered,
"I was just married 14 painful years

91
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,716
- and I've gone and done it again!"
- Whoops.

92
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:23,858
[Charlie] To a woman that
he barely knows. His "soul mate."

93
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,298
[speaking Japanese]

94
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,132
-...soul mate.
- [all] Soul mate!

95
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,603
[men laughing]

96
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,767
Soul mate!

97
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,144
They never laugh this much.

98
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:44,009
So, a few hours later,
my buddy here, my hombre,

99
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:47,886
is the only guy I know that's been
divorced twice in a 24-hour period.

100
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:52,417
- Now, that's a true story.
- [speaking Japanese]

101
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,124
[all chanting]
Fremont! Fremont! Fremont!

102
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:03,527
- It was supposed to say "free man."
- But it didn't. It said "Fremont."

103
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:06,097
It's a big mistake.
It's on his chest forever.

104
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:11,670
I don't really think that story
honors the feelings I had for her.

105
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:14,511
No, I'm sorry.
Dan, people love that story.

106
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,782
So just get up there and do
your thing. Because I killed.

107
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:19,947
Banzai!

108
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,252
- [shouting]
- Ixnay on the banzai.

109
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,088
- [Charlie groans]
- [Dan] Nishamura Media Group

110
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:27,220
entering the US sports market
is a huge deal.

111
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,924
Now, I know you've met
with larger groups,

112
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:34,595
but I'm about to show you
why working with a boutique firm

113
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:38,595
run by 2 seasoned pros
is a smart move for you.

114
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,298
[men cheering]

115
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,833
47 million dollars over 5 years.

116
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,369
Man, you better shape up
on your Japanese,

117
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,904
'cause you're going to Tokyo, baby!

118
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,577
Thank you. This is the kind of
opportunity I've been looking for.

119
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:53,145
And you will not be sorry.
In college my nickname was "GT '."

120
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:57,056
- That's "Go To." You go to me.
- What's the matter with you?

121
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,822
Biggest deal of our lives
isn't exciting enough for you?

122
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,922
So it's a done deal now?
There are a few small details.

123
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,592
Like next week when Nishamura
and his son come to town

124
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,100
we have to win them over
on the golf course.

125
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,601
- That'll be easy.
- I'm great at golf.

126
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,866
Then, 2 weeks from now,
we have to make a presentation

127
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,066
- to their executive board of directors.
- Done.

128
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:14,200
All right, sunshine.
What's really wrong with you?

129
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,772
- I was not divorced twice, OK?
- [chuckling]

130
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,576
One of them was an annulment.

131
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,175
- Look at that face!
- Charlie, don't!

132
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,082
Look at this, Craig.
You know what this face is?

133
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,110
- The face of a winner.
- This face is willing to hibernate

134
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:29,021
for 6 months to make the
best deal he could possibly make.

135
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,686
And I don't care who knows it. A toast
to my best buddy and business partner,

136
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,525
- Dan Rayburn! Whoo!
- Whoo!

137
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,463
- Arigato!
- [all cheering]

138
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:44,934
It all comes down to this.

139
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,440
- I don't think so.
- 3, 2, 1.

140
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,067
This one's the shooter.

141
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,372
- [Charlie] Let's see it.
- [Craig] Golden moment.

142
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,444
- Oh. Uh-oh!
- Oh, you're just sinkin' em.

143
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,278
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.

144
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,375
[Charlie]
Let's hit it. There you go.

145
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:57,885
- [Craig] It's a leaking dog.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,686
That's a... That's a neat trick.
How old is that dog?

147
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,214
I lost count. Vet said it was a record.

148
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,989
You might want to put
a diaper on him, or underwear.

149
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,053
[dog growls]

150
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:10,894
- Yo.
- Hey. Where you been?

151
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,458
Japanese real estate agents.
Some apartments for Craig-san.

152
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,527
Thank you. I just want to find
something authentic.

153
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,629
I've been getting so immersed
in Japanese culture,

154
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,141
by the time I hit Tokyo, they're
going to think I'm part Japanese.

155
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,336
They'll be like, "Who is this local?"

156
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:26,040
I don't care if you stay on the top
of Mount Fuji. Just bring home the yen.

157
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,777
- This can't be.
- What do you got?

158
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,513
- Vicki.
- Vicki who?

159
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,748
South Beach Vicki? She's in town.

160
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,748
- She wants to see me. Today.
- She just called you out of the blue?

161
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,692
- No.
- Dan? Dan?

162
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:43,527
You know last Christmas
when I moved in to the condo?

163
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,056
I was feeling really lonely.

164
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,433
And maybe I wrote a 7-to-10-page
single-spaced letter.

165
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,700
- Oh, Dan.
- [groans]

166
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,764
You've been using your feelings
for this woman

167
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,275
to avoid your life for 7 years.

168
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:58,405
I set you up in the most exclusive
adult-only condo.

169
00:09:58,447 --> 00:09:59,914
You've never been to theme nights.

170
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,917
You never once went to the
Sunday morning schmooze and schmeer.

171
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:05,181
You know, maybe she hasn't
moved on either.

172
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,710
- Well, you can't do it.
- Why?

173
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:08,916
Because we're in the middle
of our biggest deal ever,

174
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:10,049
and you don't have the time.

175
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,289
She lives in Vermont. It's perfect.
Start of a long-distance relationship.

176
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,626
You get 6 to 9 months
of the spa weekends,

177
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:18,132
late-night phone calls.
I'd still have my days free to work.

178
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,827
She wants to meet me
at Grand Central Station,

179
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,233
and I don't know what
I'm supposed to wear.

180
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:23,794
It's not formal, obviously,
it's a train station,

181
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,239
but do I wear a sport coat,
or coat and tie...

182
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:28,174
You can wear a sports coat,
but you're not going like that.

183
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,643
- [Dan] Why?
- 'Cause you look like an albino.

his complexion is ghost-like.

186
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,717
- What do you think of the El Tropical?
- Perfect beginner's tan.

187
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,415
- Oh, great.
- Yeah. Let's go!

188
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:41,979
- You all set?
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:46,927
- I'm ready. Alrighty, let's do this.
- Um... so...

190
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,591
Face forward, press the red button,
spray lasts 10 seconds.

191
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:54,227
Keep your eyes closed and call me
on the intercom when you're done.

192
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,634
OK.

193
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,067
Eyes closed. She wanted a golden god,
she's going to get one.

194
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,135
Whoa, um...

- [doors lock]
- HAL?

196
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:10,348
I definitely think that the tan line
accentuates the look, don't you?

197
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:11,943
- Uh-huh. Sexy.
- Mmm.

198
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:16,219

Stop... in the name of love.

Look, 7 years ago,
we made magic happen.

252
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:20,066
But it was bad timing.

253
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:24,306
Now, we'll take it super slow,
there'll be no outside distractions.

Just us. I, um...

All I need is your half.

- I'm going to jail.
- What?

257
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,122
Tomorrow. 2 weeks for trespassing.

258
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,592
- Why?
- A chemical company wanted

259
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,859
to build a plant that would've
drained into a stream near my house.

260
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,832
So I kind of chained myself
to a bulldozer

261
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,357
and burned the blueprints to the plant.

262
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,302
Look at you.
You're a political activist.

263
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:52,465
Well, I had ulterior motives.

264
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,442
- You're... Career politician?
- My kids.

You... you'd be attached. But...

You got so much going on, girl.
It just blows my mind.

278
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:32,375
That's good, because there's
one other small detail.

Guys, would you give us
a minute? Please.

290
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:19,517
Dan, I got your letter 6 months ago,
and I won't lie, it threw me for a loop.

291
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,961
I was completely ready to go it alone.

292
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,591
But here was this...

293
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:31,096
12-page, single-spaced letter
from the father of my kids,

294
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,699
and suddenly
I had to ask if I was being selfish.

295
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,108
Then 3 weeks ago,
we were in Friday's for dinner,

296
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,478
and Zach had to go to the bathroom,
and as I was taking him

297
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:43,143
to the ladies' room
for the umpteenth time...

298
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,679
I realized, he's never
even been in a men's room.

299
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:50,657
- Really?
- My kids are 7. They have a father.

300
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:54,457
So I thought, maybe it's time
they got to know who he is.

301
00:16:55,764 --> 00:17:00,895
I have to confess, I've always been
a little awkward around children.

302
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,041
But I guess, if they're your own,
it's a different ballgame.

303
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:11,273
Well, we got a few hours to kill
while Jenna goes out on a hand audition.

304
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,439
- Let's find out.
- OK.

305
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:19,113
But first, what do you say
we get rid of that ridiculous tan?

306
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,985
I know a few family secrets.

307
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:23,183
- You don't like it?
- I'm sorry, do you like it?

308
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:25,351
- Not at all.
- [laughing] OK.

309
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,086
- [Vicki] How's your face feel?
- Oh, pretty much everything.

310
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,827
- Come on, Dad!
- Oh, no.

311
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:34,391
Not the spinning one.
That's a recipe for disaster.

312
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:36,961
Hey, Dad? Want to see my
5 Favorite Food lists?

313
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,370
Oh, I'd love to, Z. Thanks.

314
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,874
- Zach likes to make lists.
- I love lists.

315
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,139
- [Dan] Hot wings and milkshakes.
- Chocolate?

316
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,805
Oh, no, it gives me diarrhea.

317
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:49,010
I mean, stomach problems
and frequent gas-spasms.

318
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,915
- Oh.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

319
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,078
Oh, OK.

320
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,815
Hang on. Can you watch Emily?

321
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,289
- Sure.
- I want to go to the men's room.

322
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,116
With me?

323
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,284
OK.

324
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,097
[toilet flushing]

325
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:11,235
You're pretty old. How come
you don't have any other kids?

326
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:12,967
Well, um...

327
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,034
Initially, it was kind of a...

328
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,545
You do know where kids
come from, right?

329
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,549
- Yeah, sure.
- Can you tell me?

330
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,083
Well, um...

331
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:32,354
In nature, the male and
the female of the species, uh,

332
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:37,262
in what some have called the
"dance of springtime," you know...

333
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,893
- [Zach farting]
- It's complicated.

334
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,068
- [Zach farts]
- Do I just stand here?

335
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:47,972
My mom usually waits outside.

336
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:50,068
I'll bet she does. I'm out of here.

337
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,406
[horn honks]

338
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,815
OK.

339
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,578
- Ooh! You're early.
- [Vicki] Hi, hon!

340
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,682
I can do my hand cream later. Hi!

341
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,124
- [Zach] Hi, Aunt Jenna!
- [Emily] Hi.

342
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,185
Hi, Zach. Hello, Emily!

343
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,756
- I booked it!
- [Jenna and Vicki scream]

344
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,235
- I gotta go potty.
- All right. Lemonade inside!

345
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,760
- OK, I got them.
- I got the bags.

346
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:18,704
- No, no, it's all right...
- No, please.

347
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,306
- [screaming]
- Oh!

348
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,606
Oh, no! I got it.

349
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,135
- OK, I got it.
- [car beeps]

350
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,079
- No, wait. No, please don't.
- [screaming continues]

351
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,015
[car alarm blaring]

352
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,348
- [mouthing] Oh, my God.
- [Dan] Breathe! Breathe!

353
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:32,876
Oh, sorry!

354
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,820
[yells]

355
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:39,525
- Oh...
- [siren wails]

356
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:43,455
She's gonna be fine. She's a fighter.

357
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,160
She looks good. You look good, hon.

358
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:53,169
Can you hand me my cell phone?
I have to call my agent.

359
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,369
All right. Here we go. Here it is, hon.

360
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,875
- Do you want help?
- [groans] No, no.

361
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,713
I'm going to give you a minute. [kisses]

362
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,343
- I'm so sorry.
- [grunting]

363
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,858
Oh, God! What am I gonna do?

364
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:18,297
Come on, you're a great gal. You must
have plenty of friends you could call.

365
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,893
That I could trust
with my kids for 2 weeks?

366
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:24,894
This is a disaster!
I don't have anybody else!

367
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:28,067
That's not true.
No, no. You have me.

368
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:31,078
- [sighs]
- I'll do it. I'll take the kids.

369
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:32,443
[Vicki exhales, laughs]

370
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:34,772
[Dan] I'll do it.

371
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,185
- I will.
- Really?

372
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,915
Oh, yeah.

373
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,924
- [both laughing]
- Hey, yeah, see?

374
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,587
[sighs] This is good.
This is a good thing.

375
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,860
[Vicki panting]

376
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,028
- Do you know anybody else?
- No, just me.

377
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:57,833
[Free: All Right Now]

378
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,000
[Charlie] And then suddenly,
you're supposed to take care of twins

379
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,510
when we have the biggest deal ever?
Aw, Dan!

380
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:07,002
I put their aunt in a halo for a month!
What am I supposed to do?

381
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,107
You're supposed to give them back!
They got 24 hours!

382
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,084
- They'll find another baby-sitter!
- I can't give them back!

383
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,417
They're my kids. It's not like puppies.
"Take them back."

384
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,615
- Let's break it down. It's 2 weeks.
- OK.

385
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:17,591
- Yeah.
- All right, let's see. We got, uh...

386
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,422
They sleep 10, 12 hours, right, a day?

387
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,121
- If you're lucky.
- You've got TV.

388
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:24,598
You've got bathroom time.
You give them a lot of timeouts.

389
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:25,656
You know what?

390
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,191
You're looking at about 90 minutes
of being a dad a day.

391
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,533
90 minutes?

392
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,401
It's a run-out-the-clock
situation, that's all.

393
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,929
- It's not sudden death.
- You'll be fine.

394
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:36,205
- Ha! We can do this.
- "We?" [laughs] No, no.

395
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:39,111
You are on Planet Dan now, baby.

396
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,638
I'm down here on Earth,
just cheering you on.

397
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:45,585
You started this, remember? You're
the one who took me down to Florida.

398
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,418
"Mr. Feel-good" is gonna
teach me how to live.

399
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:51,948
I wasn't alone then,
I'm not gonna be alone now, OK?

400
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:55,793
So, tomorrow morning, 7:30, I want you
outside your apartment ready to go.

401
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,230
Because if I'm going to be
an old dad for 2 weeks,

402
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:01,030
you're going to be "Uncle Charlie."

403
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,328
Well, I don't want to
take care of the kids!

404
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:10,769
[Vicki] For both of them, I've packed
enough clothes for every occasion.

405
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,439
- That everything?
- Yeah.

406
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,971
[sighs] I can't believe I'm doing this.

407
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,244
Me, too.

408
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,752
Here's the number for
the poison control center.

409
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:20,777
- Poison control?
- Do you need a list of poisons?

410
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:22,687
No, I think most of them I know.

411
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:25,386
I should have compiled a list
of commonly ingested poisons!

412
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,758
I'm not going to poison our
children. They're in safe hands.

413
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:29,228
- Have you ever been to a casino?
- [kids] No.

414
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:31,094
- Have you ever seen the movie Casino?
- No.

415
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:34,158
OK, there are only pay phones
in the common room,

416
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:35,829
so I will call you on your cell phone.

417
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,633
- OK.
- And no baby-sitters.

418
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,641
Please, Dan.
They've gone 7 years without a dad.

419
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,609
Promise me you will not
leave them with strangers.

420
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,043
- No strangers. Check.
- [Charlie] Dan! Vicki!

421
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,776
The kids have never seen
Friday the 13th, part 1 or 2!

422
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,807
- Oh, my God!
- He's kidding. He's a kidder.

423
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:52,877
He was scared of
The Wizard of Oz. He's kidding.

424
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,444
The monkeys got him nuts.

425
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,788
- Oh, and one more thing.
- [chuckling] I'm up for it.

426
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:01,852
Well, Emily has kind of concocted
this idea that you're a superhero.

427
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,454
Oh. Why?

428
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:06,729
Well, it was her way of
explaining where you were,

429
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,531
and it seemed harmless enough to me.

430
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:11,265
- What are my powers?
- You can stop bullets and you can fly.

431
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:13,933
- Bulletproof and flying.
- 1... 2... 3!

432
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,408
- [kids] Ooh!
- [Charlie] Whoa!

433
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,138
- Oh, gosh, I gotta go.
- OK.

434
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:20,507
I'm going to miss them so much.

435
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,039
OK...

436
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,580
Promise me...

437
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:28,680
You will devote every ounce of
your being to taking care of them, Dan.

438
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,020
I promise.

439
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:32,491
- Promise me.
- I promise.

440
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,688
[horns honking]

441
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,256
- So, you're not a superhero?
- Not at the present time.

442
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:39,323
[honking]

443
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:42,564
Want to pick up the pace, Chachi?
We just got passed by a street sweeper.

444
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,366
How about putting it in drive, grandma?

445
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:47,533
There are babies on board!
Excuse me, kids.

446
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:59,052
Ooh... Who's up for
chocolate chip pancakes?

447
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,646
- [kids] Me! Me!
- No chocolate chips for breakfast.

448
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,249
- Why not?
- Kids crave limits. It's in the books.

449
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,728
Hey everybody, let's kick this off
with some really healthy choices.

450
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,195
How about the heartland granola?

451
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,721
That's like nature's broom!
That's kind of wonderful.

452
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,859
Hey! Whoa!

453
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:16,335
- Sorry.
- It's OK, Zach.

454
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,201
- Here you go.
- It's an accident.

455
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,400
That kind of thing happens.
You have nothing to worry about.

456
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:22,636
- Hi there. How are you?
- [Dan] Hi.

457
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:25,305
- [Dan] Good.
- Well, hello. [chuckling]

458
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:28,042
- What's your name?
- Rochelle.

459
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:31,074
Oh, Rochelle. [chuckles]

460
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:34,451
Well, I didn't know they could
afford to hire supermodels here.

461
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,953
Hey, Pops?
Isn't being a grandparent the best?

462
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,790
I'm not a grandparent.

463
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:44,628
My grandkids call me "Nub-Nub."
What do your grandkids call you?

464
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:45,791
Nub-Nub's good.

Rochelle, Rochelle... I don't know
what happened back there.

475
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:20,163
Just a little too much
excitement for me.

476
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:22,829
Oh, no.

477
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh, no, no.
This is just an accident.

478
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,938
Don't worry. It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

479
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:30,068
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I'll get you something.

480
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:33,477
It's a glass of water, that's all.

481
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,539
One glass of water
gets my pump going, too.

00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,744
Uh-huh. Uh...

we are very focused

00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:52,032
- Would you handle them?
- [Zach] We want to Xerox our butts.

488
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,125
Will you excuse me for one moment?

489
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,295
Get off there. I'm sorry, Dan.

490
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:58,464
- What are you, a frat boy?
- I got your phone.

491
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,906
- Timeout.
- Ah! Timeout.

492
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,240
- Give that back! Yes.
- Keep-away? Are we doing this?

[Zach] Toss it to me, Emily!
Toss it to me!

Your Japanese is so terrific.

- You speak Japanese?
- Well, no.

496
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,849
But I don't have to speak Japanese

497
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,914
to see how beautiful
you are when you speak it.

498
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,086
Don't go out there! Don't go out there!
Come back this way.

- How old are they?

00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,859
- How old do you think they are?
- Um...

501

- 7?
- 7! Yeah. You're good.

Oh, jeez. When you're around
kids as much as I am,

505
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,282
you got to develop a sense of humor.

506
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,879
- But it's rewarding, too.
- Hmm...

00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:50,783
Do you like the beach,
"favorite uncle" Charlie?

Why don't you come
to Westport on Saturday.

I'm going to meet some friends

You can even bring
your niece and nephew.

Well, I just may do that,

refinish a deck and surfing.

That's my Dad List.

517

That sounds great.
Pull up your hoods, OK?

518
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,982
- Put these on, all right?
- Why?

519
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,785
Technically, you're not supposed
to be here, let alone living here.

I don't know. Maybe immigrants.
I'm not sure.

Watch out! A lot of expensive things...

Come on!

Listen. You're the one
that forced me into that place.

Look, they're going upstairs now!

This is my crib, man!
This is where I get down.

This is where I sink the 3 points.
This is where I throw the TD.

This isn't for kids, man.

Look, that pool out there,
that's got a 15-foot deep end.

Look at this place! I got
pointy-edged furniture. I got...

Those spears probably
still have poison on them.

You don't want them in this house.

I do not lead a child-safe life, man!

- Aw, don't...

I don't know these kids very long,
but I'm still their dad.

554
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:56,506
And they need a home. And so do I.

- How's everything going?
- I'm OK.

You described this house as being
a dangerous place for kids,

so I hired the best
childproofers there are.

he was a civil engineer.

behind me. Lot of potholes.

605
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:13,338
That's why I'm going to be extra
vigilant in protecting your children.

606
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,177
They're 7. And they're his kids.

607
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:17,012
- That's true.
- That's progressive,

608
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,746
- and I'm all for it.
- Oh, come on!

609
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:22,688
Even I know you do not baby-proof
a house for 7-year-olds.

610
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:24,884
- Oh!
- What about the 15-foot deep end?

611
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:27,450
Sir, you got a flamethrower
for a fireplace.

612
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,928
- It's a fashion. It's a style.
- The spears?

613
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:31,760
What guy buys poison-tipped spears?

614
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,893
A thousand years ago they were poison.
I don't know if they're poison now.

615
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,766
You bought those a thousand years ago?

616
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:40,069
- Expect me to believe that?
- You designed this house of horrors.

617
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:43,270
You brought the kids to this house.
Stop it! Don't eat that.

618
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,777
Those are dog treats.

619
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:48,942
Everything tastes like dog food
after that smoked salmon I just had.

620
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:50,176
You ate the salmon?

621
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:55,688
- That was a gift.
- Yes, it was.

622
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,826
- You guys better pack.
- Pack?

623
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:03,022
- Why are you dressed like that?
- What do we pack for?

624
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:05,327
Camping.
That's first on my Dad List.

625
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,699
And we're Pioneers, so you
have to find the nearest campground.

626
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,899
We have 50 files of Nishamura
work to do before Saturday.

627
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:15,102
Guys, camping...
I don't think we can do it.

628
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:17,474
- [Zach] But you promised!
- [Dan] I know I promised,

629
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:21,709
but I didn't realize camping involved a
camping trip, and we have to reschedule.

630
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,115
- [Zach] But you promised.
- Sometimes promises

631
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:27,518
- aren't written in stone.
- [both] But you promised!

632
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:51,803
[inhaling] We've been a Pioneer family
for 4 generations now.

633
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:55,941
I practically grew up in these woods
following Grandpa Ted.

634
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:59,146
Gramps was troop leader 63 years ago,

635
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:03,213
and was the recipient of the
supreme Pioneer honor.

636
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,055
Interred for eternity...

637
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:13,265
in a tomb erected with his own hands,

638
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,269
right here on this...
on this very campsite.

639

[shuddering]

640
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:23,239
Not in front of the kids.

Hey. Hey. Psst.

642
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:31,478
Hey! You remind me of that
old dude who stole my girlfriend.

643
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:34,646
- What?
- [man] I promised myself...

644
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,849
Yeah, you. You! Mr. Wall-of-Hair.

645
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,484
Rick, you're a counselor here.
This is sacred ground.

646
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:42,154
- Something I got to tell you.
- The Pioneers have meant

647
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:47,657
the world to the Taylor clan.
That's who I am.

648
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:51,603
Troop leader. Patriot. TSA supervisor.

649
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:55,438
And dad. I am Barry Taylor.

put down the electronic devices,

652
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,376
and try to get into it a little bit?

653
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:11,358
Hmm? After all...
we're here for the kids.

654
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,882
Fine.

- [mouthing] Sorry.

656
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,433
Here for the kids?
What's he talking about?

657
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:26,735
OK, kids. Who wants to have some fun?

658

- [all cheer]
- Yeah...!

- How about we go dig a hole.

I loved her so much.

663
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:41,721
- What are you saying?
- My beef is not with you, old woman.

664
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:44,087
- Thank you.
- [growling softly]

[indistinct chattering]

Hey, Zach, Emily.
Why don't you get your grandpa

668
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,132
- to leave the office...
- [giggling]

and come over here
and join us in the woods?

670
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:01,504
He's not our grandpa, he's our dad.

671
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,843
Sure, Zach. My grandpa
was like a dad to me, too.

672
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:16,151
He is, Troop Master Barry.
He's my dad, and that's his partner.

673
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:19,022
- It's like we have 2 dads!

Trust me. It was a surprise.

- Feels like 50.

You must have a best buddy.

[Dan] Yeah. A pal?
Someone you can...

That's our game.

Now it's all about the golf game.
How's your back?

756
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,949
- Tight.
- Untighten it.

757
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:16,012
Because Nishamura uses golf
as a metaphor for life.

758
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,957
So if you mess that up,
it's sayonara, Nishamura.

759
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:23,785
- One of my little magic pills.
- My housekeeper happens to

760
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,697
arrange them in an organized
circular fashion, like so.

761
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,564
- Pardon-moi.
- Yes.

762
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:31,400
That's amazing.
When did we become our fathers?

Man, I'd like to see Troop Leader Barry

764
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,264
deal with the side effects
of even one of these puppies.

765
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,742
Look at this. For my aging prostate.

766
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:39,472
- Right.
- Side effects include

767
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:42,948
swollen tongue, dry mouth
and pus-filled canker sores.

768
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,417
- Come on.
- This is a joint anti-inflammatory.

769
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:48,683
Maximum dosage may cause bouts
of uncontrollable appetite.

770
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,986
That's not so bad. The munchies.
I could deal with that.

771
00:41:51,024 --> 00:41:52,924
Look at this one. High blood pressure.

"Watch out for sudden loss
of depth perception."

773

This tiny pill lowers
your bad cholesterol.

774
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,901
But the first time I took it,
partial facial paralysis.

775
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:04,597
- Come on.
- I froze up like a circus clown.

776
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:05,832
- I was, like, "Ha."
- [Charlie] You're kidding.

Yeah, like... [mutters]

- Threw my back out.
- Man...

- How much longer we got?
- 1 week, 4 days, 9 hours.

- Mmm... Good Lord.
- God help us all.

781
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:24,349
Hey, Dad, I'm in
desperate need of a King Fontana.

782
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,256
- You want to play?
- My doctor says that

783
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,784
I can't get down on the floor,
even crouch, on a golf day.

784
00:42:28,828 --> 00:42:31,661
It seems I have a genetic
predisposition to knee problems.

785
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:34,724
That means you have it, too.
So you have to be very careful.

786
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,326
Nick, I told you not to use epoxy.

787
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,860
It's going to leave a
permanent stain and an odor.

788
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:42,033
Why can't you ever
tell me I did a good job?

789
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:44,043
All right, maestro, how do I do this?

790
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:48,741
Um, OK... You want to go
quarter turn clockwise,

791
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:52,240
grab the lever, then use the
counter lever to spin 180 degrees...

792
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,583
[Emily] Why are you
charging that in here?

793
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,489
I keep getting in Dad's way.
He can't do any business in here, right?

794
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:01,085
Release like that, and voil.

795

have kids' toothpaste.

That old people stuff burns my...

- I think I remember where they go.

[Zach] We'll put this one in...

OK, guys, let's go!
Are you guys still hungry?

00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,418
- We just ate.
- So did you.

I know, but I'm starved.

That's weird. Hmm.

Do you have candy bars on you?
Don't lie to me.

Go ahead. There's games

Oh, well, they're not
actually all my friends.

- Yeah.

- Everyone here is dealing with loss.

Thought you'd like to know that after
14 wonderful, fulfilling years together,

1208
01:11:50,155 --> 01:11:52,919
my true best friend, Lucky, has passed.

1209
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:56,358
Maybe my life isn't as blessed
as you paint it to be.

1210
01:11:56,394 --> 01:11:58,988
I thought you'd like to know
that the funeral is this Tuesday

1211
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,158
followed by a small,
tasteful reception at my house.

1212
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,792
I'm indifferent as to whether you come.

1213
01:12:03,835 --> 01:12:05,496
- [machine beeps]
- [Craig] Gentlemen, it's Craig,

1214
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:07,232
and I'm back in New York.

1215
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:08,603
I know I messed up.

1216
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,108
I take full responsibility
for the mistakes that I made.

1217
01:12:11,142 --> 01:12:14,134
I'm not going to beg,
and I won't call again.

1218
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:17,081
The truth is that I was a preemie.

1219
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:21,211
I was several weeks premature, and
there was talk of oxygen deprivation.

1220
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:22,879
I'm not making excuses,
but the doctor said...

1221
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,014
- [machine beeps]
- Idiot.

1222
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,071
Oh... [sighs heavily]

1223
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,539
You know someone a bunch of years,

1224
01:12:42,574 --> 01:12:46,772
and it's easy to forget
that you were fortunate enough

1225
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:49,371
to have known them for even one day.

1226
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:54,344
And that was Lucky, to me.
I mean, he was my friend.

1227
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:57,980
He... Well, even more important,
he was my family.

1228
01:12:58,022 --> 01:13:00,889
And where was I when he was
breathing his last breath?

1229
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:03,257
In Japan, making a business deal.

1230
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:08,294
Is there anyone who would like
to say anything about Lucky

1231
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,234
- before we say goodbye?
- [Dan] I would.

1232
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:22,078
I've had the great pleasure
of being the other old dog

1233
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:24,240
in Charlie's life for the past 30 years.

1234
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:28,348
Like Lucky,

1235
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:31,787
I feel like a fortunate son of a gun
to have Charlie as a friend.

1236
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,590
- You're so cute.
- [dogs barking]

1237
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,995
Here. A nice bowl of cold water.

1238
01:13:40,031 --> 01:13:42,431
- I'm really glad you came, man.
- Me too.

1239
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:43,764
It's really important to me.

1240
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:47,736
- I've said some things...
- Please, don't go there.

1241
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:49,000
- I have to.
- Why?

1242
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,032
You've always had faith in me,
even when I didn't have faith in myself.

1243
01:13:52,076 --> 01:13:54,909
You're not just my best friend,
you're the best kind of friend.

1244
01:13:55,747 --> 01:13:57,977
You're loyal, honorable...

1245
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:02,383
But? See I knew there was a "but."
This is gonna sting like a mother. Go.

1246
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,183
Aside from going into business with you,

1247
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:07,419
I've only made 2 good decisions
in my entire life.

1248
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:11,019
Marrying Vicki and taking those kids.

1249
01:14:11,062 --> 01:14:13,553
And those are the 2 most impulsive
things I've done in my entire life,

1250
01:14:13,598 --> 01:14:16,590
besides the tattoo, which,
God willing, I'll get over one day.

1251
01:14:16,634 --> 01:14:20,434
I feel another moment of Dan Rayburn
impulsivity about to happen.

1252
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,837
Charlie, this is big.
I'm talking about uprooting,

1253
01:14:22,874 --> 01:14:25,570
change of scenery,
the end of the business as we know it.

1254
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:29,603
Oh, Dan. We'll figure out the business.
We always do.

1255
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:34,277
- Yeah, but... I have to get them back.
- Nah. Absolutely not.

1256
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:37,247
We're gonna get 'em back.

1257
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:40,521
Yeah. Yeah, little man.

1258
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:55,830
- Out of the way. Dad on a mission.
- You guys aren't gonna regret this.

1259
01:14:55,874 --> 01:14:58,206
I'll do whatever it takes
to get back into your good grace...

1260
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:01,338
You want to lighten up
on the throttle, Sparky?

1261
01:15:01,379 --> 01:15:04,815
- We got a zoo exit coming up here.
- [tires screeching]

1262
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:06,578
I'm not gonna miss that birthday party.

1263
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:08,609
It's just great to get the 3 amigos
back together again.

1264
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:10,780
[both] You're still on probation!

1265
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:17,792
- [Dan] No, no. That's not a lock.
- You open?

1266
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:20,525
Nah. Sorry,
the zoo closes at 3:00 to new visitors.

1267
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:23,261
But my kids are in there.
They're having a birthday party,

1268
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:25,701
and I have to be there because I'm Dad.

1269
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:27,762
Yeah. This is Dan Rayburn, superdad.

1270
01:15:27,805 --> 01:15:30,171
Check on your list. R-A-Y-B-U-R-N.

1271
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,770
[man] Superdad is super late, all right?
Rayburn? You know what?

1272
01:15:34,812 --> 01:15:37,975
You don't even have the same last name
as the birthday kids. Can't do it.

1273
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:41,782
- How does 3 big ones sound?
- A little money, huh?

1274
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:45,516
Don't you ever hand me
3 dollars again.

1275
01:15:45,556 --> 01:15:47,649
- Come on. You can let us...
- You already have a kid there.

1276
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:49,284
- [Charlie] It's fine.
- I can't let you in.

1277
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:52,160
He's got a heart problem.
He just wants to see his kids.

1278
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:54,858
- You shall not pass.
- You're great at your job, man!

1279
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:58,625
Charlie, what are you doing?

1280
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,166
What are you thinking?

1281
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:05,267
Danny boy, I am going to
get you into that party,

1282
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,302
at great risk
to my perfect legal record.

1283
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,471
- [Craig] Through here?
- Oh, yeah. Here we go.

1284
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:13,814
- That's breaking and entering. No, no.
- Bingo!

1285
01:16:13,851 --> 01:16:15,682
- Don't do that.
- Wait. Let me do it.

1286
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,347
- [Charlie] Why?
- I'll take the risk.

1287
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:19,253
OK. Go ahead.

1288
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,752
Yeah...

1289
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:24,421
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

1290
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:28,591
- I need some help. I need help.
- [lock snaps]

1291
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:31,059
- OK.
- Go, Craig.

1292
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:33,229
- [Craig] Me? OK.
- Yeah, you first.

1293
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:36,035
- [indistinct chattering]
- What's her name?

1294
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:44,874
- We made it.
- We did it!

1295
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:49,410
Yeah! Can't keep Dan Rayburn out.

1296
01:16:49,954 --> 01:16:51,888
Never doubt you, Charlie. Never.

1297
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:54,391
- We are in the zoo, guys.
- All right, which way?

1298
01:16:54,425 --> 01:16:56,950
A moat. I wonder what lives here.

1299
01:16:56,995 --> 01:16:59,623
- [all exclaim]
- We're in the gorilla enclosure.

1300
01:16:59,664 --> 01:17:01,723
- What?
- Stand still.

1301
01:17:01,766 --> 01:17:04,166
Hold still. Don't do it. Don't move.

1302
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:07,103
- Gorilla. Silverback gorilla.
- Stay where you are.

1303
01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:09,299
Don't look at him in the eyes.
Just look away.

1304
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,366
If you don't see him, he doesn't
see you. Back up to the tunnel.

1305
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:14,878
You have to be aggressive with
the larger apes. I've read about this.

1306
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,312
- Back up to the tunnel.
- No, no. No retreat.

1307
01:17:17,348 --> 01:17:20,249
- Retreat. No, retreat.
- You retreat, we are dead.

1308
01:17:20,752 --> 01:17:23,277
He senses fear, he attacks.
Be aggressive.

1309
01:17:24,489 --> 01:17:29,222
- [howling]
- [shrieking]

1310
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,320
[all continue shouting]

1311
01:17:34,866 --> 01:17:38,302
- [Charlie] Food!
- Don't provoke it! Charlie, no!

1312
01:17:38,336 --> 01:17:39,928
Aah!

1313
01:17:43,274 --> 01:17:46,141
- Oh!
- [Dan] Charlie!

1314
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:48,202
Aggression not working.
Maybe we should be submissive.

1315
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:52,141
- Or run!
- Every man for himself!

1316
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:53,309
Run! Go!

1317
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,044
Come on, Danny boy.

1318
01:17:58,189 --> 01:17:59,213
- [grunting]
- Uh-oh.

1319
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:03,557
- [growling]
- [shrieks]

1320
01:18:06,297 --> 01:18:07,457
[both yell]

1321
01:18:14,505 --> 01:18:17,201
- We're alive!
- [chittering]

1322
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:20,335
- Penguins!
- [both] Aw...

1323
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:22,005
- I love penguins.
- Me too.

1324
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:24,713
[all screeching]

1325
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,613
- Angry penguins!
- Save yourself!

1326
01:18:28,653 --> 01:18:29,711
Go to your kids!

1327
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:33,046
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1328
01:18:35,026 --> 01:18:37,085
Charlie! Charlie!

1329
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:41,388
- I love you, Charlie!
- Ooh!

1330
01:18:45,069 --> 01:18:48,004
[whimpering]

1331
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:55,310
[softly] Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.

1332
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,838
Aahh...

1333
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,218
Everybody, it's cake time.

1334
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:06,280
Oh!

1335
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:10,721
- Birthday parties. Which way?
- They're on Adventure Island.

1336
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:13,093
But the tunnel's closed.
There's no way to get there from here.

1337
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:16,726
No, no. I got to get
to that birthday party. Please.

1338
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,060
OK.

1339
01:19:21,906 --> 01:19:23,771
- What are you doing?
- Some little girl

1340
01:19:23,808 --> 01:19:26,038
wants a superhero
to fly into her birthday party.

1341
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:29,046
- Mom calls me, I show up.
- Really?

1342
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:34,910
We're going to sing Happy Birthday.

1343
01:19:36,387 --> 01:19:38,651
- How does this work?
- You go up, you come down.

1344
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:41,886
- It's not rocket science, chief.
- And it's safe?

1345
01:19:41,926 --> 01:19:45,259
- Aah... Sure.
- Oh.

1346
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:50,592
Daddy's coming. Yeah!
Which way is the party?

1347
01:19:50,635 --> 01:19:52,762
- Northwest!
- You got it!

1348
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:55,135
- [man] Go for it!
- Yeah. Yeah!

1349
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:01,576
Killer penguins.
Killer penguins!

1350
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,739
- Killer penguins!
- [Dan] Charlie!

1351
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:08,179
Dan! What's he doing up there?

1352
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,779
Ah, he wanted to be a superhero
for his daughter's birthday.

1353
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,790
- He know what he's doing?
- It's like a ride. Don't worry.

1354
01:20:15,493 --> 01:20:19,054
Go, Danny boy!
I'm the wind beneath your wings!

1355
01:20:19,096 --> 01:20:21,792
There's no stopping Dan Rayburn!

1356
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:26,200
Did you see a little man?
He's about yea-big.

1357
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:28,671
He's got reddish hair.
He looks like a Hobbit.

1358
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:31,631
[moaning] Just go to your happy place!

1359
01:20:31,676 --> 01:20:36,807
- Just go to a happy place!
- [both] 1, 2, 3!

1360
01:20:37,114 --> 01:20:40,242
I can fly!

1361
01:20:40,818 --> 01:20:43,514
I can fly! Yes!

1362
01:20:46,991 --> 01:20:50,085
Happy birthday, Zach and Emily!

1363
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:54,297
Look, guys, it's a superhero,
just like you wanted.

1364
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:56,493
I'm coming, kids!

1365
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:59,659
- Oh, my gosh! Dan?
- It's Dad!

1366
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:02,229
- It's me, Fatherman!
- [Emily] Dad!

1367
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:03,968
[Dan] Yeah!

1368
01:21:04,008 --> 01:21:05,032
I knew it.

1369
01:21:05,076 --> 01:21:08,136
That's right, kids.
Believe what you see!

1370
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:09,203
[motor sputtering]

1371
01:21:09,247 --> 01:21:10,942
- Isn't enough fuel.
- Be careful!

1372
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:13,746

1375
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:43,046
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to make an impact.

1376
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,741
Mission accomplished.

1377
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:47,342
I'm not that bad. It doesn't hurt.
I don't need to go to the hospital.

1378
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:49,444
I just need to go home and sleep it off.

1379
01:21:49,887 --> 01:21:51,582
- You want to go home?
- Yeah.

1380
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:53,317
You're in Burlington.
You know that, right?

1381
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:56,520
I know that.
I rented a house a half mile from here.

1382
01:21:58,095 --> 01:21:59,960
You moved here?

1383
01:21:59,997 --> 01:22:03,057
Look, I know
I loused it up for us romantically

1384
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,591
when I chose Japan over you.

1385
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:09,629
And after what happened in South Beach,
that's pretty much unforgivable.

1386
01:22:10,174 --> 01:22:12,039
But these guys
weren't around in South Beach.

1387
01:22:13,077 --> 01:22:16,342
Good timing or bad timing, I love them.

1388
01:22:17,548 --> 01:22:20,415
I moved here so,
whether they want to visit me or not,

1389
01:22:20,451 --> 01:22:22,146
I could be closer to them.

1390
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:26,081
I'm not a superhero, kids.
Maybe that's a good thing

1391
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:29,320
because, you know, superheroes
are always off fighting crime.

1392
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:33,229
And I just want to be with you guys...

1393
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,123
forever, if you'll let me.

1394
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:41,928
Deal.

1395
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,601
You're on my oxygen!

1396
01:22:44,642 --> 01:22:46,872
Aah! [laughs]

[Charlie] Long story short,
he gets the kids, he gets his wife.

1402

And Nishamura calls and says,

1403
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:27,445
"We want a family man
to represent a family business."

1404
01:23:27,485 --> 01:23:30,420
Boom, $47 million in fees later,

1405
01:23:30,454 --> 01:23:32,479
here we are on my best friend's boat
going to Aruba.

1406
01:23:32,523 --> 01:23:34,889
That is a true story. I mean, come on.

1407
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:37,826
Well, it's a good thing
you brought us down here

1408
01:23:37,862 --> 01:23:41,821
because the high seas are a
dangerous mistress for these children.

1409
01:23:41,866 --> 01:23:46,132
Excuse me. What are you doing
to my boat? Oh, the safety squad? Why?

1410
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:49,970
It's my kid, OK? The fruit of my loins.
And you just relax, OK?

1411
01:23:50,007 --> 01:23:52,032
We're going to fix this boat
so it's safe for her.

1412
01:23:52,076 --> 01:23:53,600
[Dan] Your baby's only 3 months old!

1413
01:23:53,644 --> 01:23:56,272
- [moaning]
- Nick!

1414
01:23:56,313 --> 01:23:58,838
- [choking]
- This is not a Sizzler!

1415
01:23:59,683 --> 01:24:01,048
All right, so 2 weeks.

1416
01:24:01,085 --> 01:24:03,349
Keep the office running smooth
until the big guns get back.

1417
01:24:03,387 --> 01:24:05,787
- That'll be my sole scope of work.
- Now, Craig,

1418
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:08,121
no more karaoke. You are cut off.

1419
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,491
Not even in your own house.
You can do it.

1420
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:15,591
- Go To! We're gonna miss you, Go To.
- Hey, you guys are using my nickname.

1421
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,401
- Oh...
- [Gary] Nick?

1422
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,533
Listen. Are you good at puzzles?

1423
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:28,204
[Vicki] Everybody take their
seasickness pills? Come on, guys.

1424
01:24:28,245 --> 01:24:29,906
[Gary] Wow. Should we tell?

1425
01:24:29,947 --> 01:24:33,041
I think I remember where they go.

1426
01:24:33,684 --> 01:24:35,174
Yeah.

1427
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,546
All right, we got the bags stowed below.
Seasickness pills

1428
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:41,990
have been distributed.
Let's just get one bon voyage photo,

1429
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:44,392
and then
we're ready to shove off, folks.

1430
01:24:44,428 --> 01:24:46,658
All right,
everyone get together for a picture.

1431
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:48,631
Big smiles. Let's look real happy.

1432
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,930
- [Charlie] Today, Craig.
- [Vicki] Got it?

1433
01:24:50,968 --> 01:24:53,732
Maybe not quite so happy.

1434
