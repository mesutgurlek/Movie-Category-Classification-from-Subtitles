Oh, this is a Rob Roy.
It's a very popular drink, I'm told.

- No way?

Why not? I think she's very attractive.

1097
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,280
Adam, she's got "bitch"
written all over her.

You do know what "bitch" means,
don't you?

Well, yes, I do. I do have a dictionary.

why you would say that about her...

Okay, uh, Adam, I think for you,
we should aim for sweet.

Okay. I like that.

That's a lovely way of putting it.

- Lie?
- Oh, yeah.

Now, hold on. Hold on just a minute.

- Or have perfect table manners.

You know, I asked him about that.

1236
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,386
He said good manners
are just a way of showing people...

that we have respect for them.

1238
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:55,516
I didn't know that. I thought
it was a way of acting superior.

1239
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:58,435
- Oh, you know what else he told me?
- What?

1240
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,272
He thinks I'm a gentleman
and you're a lady.

- Oh, no.

1396
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,703
Where you going?

1397
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,290
- Oh, my God.
- NINA: All right, don't worry.

1398
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,585
Don't worry, he'll catch him.
Yes, this is Nina Aron.

1399
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:51,463
I've got a runaway,
and I'm gonna need police assistance.

1400
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:54,049
- No, you cannot call them.
- Young lady, I have to.

1401
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,468
If a complaint is made
and the person resists...

1402
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:57,928
No, I cannot have that.

1403
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,764
They'll come with their cars
and their guns and...

1404
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,557
All right, all right. Calm down.

1405
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:05,977
Now, that young man needs help,
and you need protection from him.

1406
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,312
I was frightened.

1407
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,983
I didn't know what to think,
but, you know, I believe him.

1408
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:13,443
I think he just...

1409
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:16,988
I do. I really think he just wants
to go home, wherever that might be.

1410
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:20,575
All right, everybody has to calm down.
That's the most important thing.

1411
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,327
- Eve. Here's my hotel key.
- Adam.

1412
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,413
You can have my baseball cards.
Don't forget to pay my bill.

1413
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,667
You stop right there.
Stop. Don't get in that truck.

1414
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,503
Adam, you gotta stop
trying to drive this truck.

1415
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:32,796
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, Adam.

1416
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:34,464
Thanks for always being happy.

1417
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:36,841
- What?
- Gay.

1418
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,596
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1419
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:44,599
That's my car, you son of a bitch!

1420
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,686
- Where the hell have you been?
- I fell down.

1421
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:50,021
You guys get the license number
on that truck?

1422
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:53,108
What are you asking them for?
They're as screwed up as he is.

1423
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,527
Everybody keep calm.
That's the important thing.

1424
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,362
Who you talking to, you stupid...?

1425
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,739
- Eve! Eve!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1426
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,501
Mom? Dad? I'm home.

1427
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,088
Oh! Oh.

1428
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,632
Adam. Oh, Adam.

1429
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,219
- Oh.
- I've got almost everything we need.

1430
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:24,389
- And this nice man...
- Archbishop Melker.

1431
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:25,974
We met previously.

1432
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:28,893
...and his church group volunteered
to help bring it down.

1433
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,813
- But we've gotta hurry.
- HELEN: Are you in trouble, son?

1434
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:34,357
I think I'm being chased
by a psychiatrist.

1435
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:36,818
- HELEN: A psychiatrist?
- It happens.

1436
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:40,530
Oh, my goodness. How bad is it up there?

1437
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:42,741
Horrible.

1438
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,494
There's something on your forehead.

1439
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,289
- HELEN: Calvin.
- I know.

1440
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,770
Okay.

1441
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:27,285
Is this it?

1442
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:35,794
- Well, what are we gonna do with it?
- Give it back to him.

1443
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:38,421
- And what if we can't find him?
- We'll find him.

1444
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:40,215
Well....

1445
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:02,904
Hey, Eve.

1446
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:07,951
Eve, uh, look what I found in the suitcase.
It's stock certificates.

1447
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,327
I mean, it's got, like...

1448
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:13,498
It's got, like, IBM and AT&T
and Polaroid and....

1449
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:17,252
Ipana? I remember this brand.

1450
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,754
I didn't know they still made this.

1451
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:27,637
Oh. Look at this.
It says, "Trademark 1961."

1452
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,768
Hurry, my friends,
we have no time to waste.

1453
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:36,646
The son has spoken. Let's step it up.

1454
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,775
ALL [CHANTING]: Leave my elevator alone.
Leave my elevator alone.

1455
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:43,528
MELKER: We're losing the light.

1456
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:47,615
Purchased in 1958 and '59?
Ten thousand shares of each?

1457
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:49,534
- Mm-hm.
- They'd be worth millions.

1458
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,787
Hell, I don't know.
Millions upon millions...

1459
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,706
Upon millions.

1460
01:35:55,124 --> 01:36:01,004
The stocks, the baseball cards,
the clothes, the toothpaste.

1461
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,173
The guy's on the level.

1462
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,383
Eve.

1463
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:09,679
Eve, a man walks into your life
who's the kindest, most polite...

1464
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,890
most incredibly rich guy
you've ever met.

1465
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:14,392
And I have him committed.

1466
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,812
Yes. Yes, you did.

1467
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,898
Yeah.

1468
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,486
Well, at least I fell for him
before I found out he was rich.

1469
01:36:24,653 --> 01:36:27,322
- That's new.
- Yeah.

1470
01:36:28,657 --> 01:36:33,244
He said today he knew where home was.
Where'd you guys go this morning?

1471
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,414
Just to pick up frozen poultry.

1472
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:39,375
- Then?
- Then back to the house.

1473
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,753
You didn't stop anywhere?

1474
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:46,591
We did. We stopped at a porn shop.

1475
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:50,595
We stopped at this adult bookstore.
Adam was very excited to see it.

1476
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:54,724
- Adam was very excited to see porn?
- Yes.

1477
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:57,769
Eve, do you think maybe his home...

1478
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:01,189
is underneath a dirty bookstore
in the Valley?

1479
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:09,906
- Is this it?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is the place.

1480
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:32,887
Harder. Adam? Adam?

1481
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:36,891
Um, heh. Do you have a basement?

1482
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:41,312
Believe me, all the really good stuff
is right up front.

1483
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,774
Is there a back entrance or something?

1484
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,943
Are you kidding? Of course.

1485
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:49,654
Nice kid. Nice kid.

1486
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:54,659
What are we looking for?
This is ridiculous.

1487
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:57,453
Why would they put a fallout shelter
under a porn shop?

1488
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:59,289
None of this was here back in '62.

1489
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:01,833
Back then this was all, like,
cute little homes...

1490
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:04,752
and, you know, fruit orchards.

1491
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,547
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?

1492
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:12,594
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah. Maybe he'll call, huh?

1493
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:13,803
[MACHINE BEEPS]

1494
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:15,930
ADAM [ON MACHINE]: Uh, Eve?

1495
01:38:16,098 --> 01:38:17,849
This is Adam.

1496
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:22,145
Look, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me.

1497
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:25,857
And I wanted to tell you that I....

1498
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,526
That, uh....

1499
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:31,029
That I wish so many good things for you.

1500
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:34,699
I wish so hard
that all of your dreams come true.

1501
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,951
And that...

1502
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,371
And that's all I... And that's all.

1503
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:09,108
MAN: Surprise. Bang! Ha-ha-ha.

1504
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,864
Stay out of here, you drunk.

1505
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:20,078
Mm-mm-mm.

1506
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,016
Adam?

1507
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:25,101
- How long you gonna set it for this time?
- I thought 10 years.

1508
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:30,314
Well, it's considerably shorter
than before...

1509
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:34,485
but I was wondering, Calvin,
I mean, why set the locks at all?

1510
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,112
I mean, the radiation's gone.

1511
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,990
To keep what's up there
from getting down here.

1512
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:42,201
It's not radiation I'm worried about.

1513
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,245
ADAM: Mom. Dad.

1514
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,000
Oh, ho.

1515
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:57,633
I would like for you to meet
Miss Eve Rustokov.

1516
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:59,969
- Mrs. Webber.
- Hello.

1517
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,846
- Mr. Webber.
- Hello.

1518
01:41:02,514 --> 01:41:05,433
Adam's told me
such wonderful things about you.

1519
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,102
Oh, well, excuse us, please.

1520
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:12,190
- We haven't entertained a guest in...
- Quite some time.

1521
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:15,193
Oh, Eve, what can I offer you?

1522
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,863
- Mom, Eve and I have to go.
- Oh, Adam, you just got here.

1523
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:22,366
I can't explain now, but I want you
to set the locks for two months.

1524
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:25,620
You've got enough of everything.
We'll be right back to get you.

1525
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,747
But I don't understand.

1526
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:31,125
And I'm asking you to trust me
without understanding why.

1527
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:34,879
- In that case, of course.
- Of course, son.

1528
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:38,341
- They really are wonderful parents.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1529
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,886
Oh, Adam.
Could you at least stay for dinner?

1530
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:44,764
- Well, we do....
- You must.

1531
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:48,935
Perfect.

1532
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,020
Now, tell me if you've heard this one.

1533
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:53,356
Duck walks into a drugstore.

1534
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:58,486
This gravy is an old favorite of Calvin's.
Now, Eve, the platter is down there.

1535
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,696
Would you get that, honey?

1536
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:04,951
The sperm swims toward the egg. Pop.

1537
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,577
- Into the egg.
- But why?

1538
01:42:06,745 --> 01:42:08,329
Because it must.

1539
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:13,084
- But why?
- Because it's out there.

1540
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:17,421
I don't mean to be nosy,
but are you and Adam dating?

1541
01:42:17,589 --> 01:42:19,632
Yeah, we are.

1542
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:24,053
And I'm from Pasadena.

1543
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,347
[LAUGHS]

1544
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:30,935
EVE:
And you thought your parents were weird.

1545
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:35,273
It's truly amazing what you can get
done when you have unlimited funds.

1546
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:39,610
Do you know you can have whole
houses built in just a matter of months?

1547
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:42,196
It's like the Garden of Eden,
don't you think?

1548
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,158
EVE: All you have to say is this:
"I don't care what it costs."

1549
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:48,452
Of course, you've gotta really mean it,
which no one ever does.

1550
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,664
It took a while
to convince Archbishop Melker...

1551
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,207
that Adam wasn't God...

1552
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,751
and he was pretty broken up
about it too.

1553
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:59,839
Until I showed him my plans
for Los Angeles' hottest nightspot.

1554

It's my goddamn malt shop.

- Let's figure out what's gonna happen.
- Okay.

1556
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:07,471
Now, I want the whole ownership
of everything downstairs, all right?

1557
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:10,433
- Well...
- I want one of my guys at the door.

EVE: Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
up to the surface very slowly...

1559
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:21,360
make them very comfortable,
and then break the bad news to them...

1560
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:24,822
that there was no nuclear holocaust.

1561

Oh, son.

Okay. And here you go. Careful.

1564
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,827
It's hot.

1565
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,537
Careful.

1566

EVE: Have you ever in your life seen a son
who did more for his parents?

1567
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,507
This is beautiful.

1568
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:28,719
- It's absolutely beautiful.
- Yeah.

1569
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:34,517
Well, we seem to have everything,
but, you know...

1570
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:39,230
it's not much different
from the fallout shelter.

1571
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:44,610
No, Calvin, this is different,
believe me.

By the way....

1575
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:02,461
Eve, her last name, Rustokov,
that's not Russian, is it?

1576
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:05,673
No, it's, uh, Ukrainian.
Her grandparents immigrated.

1577
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,887
Dad, I don't know
how to tell you this...

1578
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:15,182
and I was gonna wait for a while
to do it, but, um....

1579
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:21,480
Dad, there was no bomb.
A plane crashed in our back yard.

1580
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,358
I looked it up in old newspapers.

1581
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:27,320
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1582
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:30,406
The Soviet Union collapsed
without a shot being fired.

1583
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,074
The Cold War's over.

Oh, yes, sir.

And it's true.

1587
01:45:43,211 --> 01:45:47,465
What, the Politburo one day said:

1588
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:50,968
"We give up"? Ha-ha-ha.

1589

Yes, that's kind of how it went.

"No, we didn't drop any bombs.

1593
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:06,817
Oh, yeah, our evil empire has collapsed.
Poor us."

1594
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:11,155
I'll bet they even asked the West
for aid.

Right?

Um, I think they did.

- No, okay.

EVE: Adam says that
this is simply how things work.

1604
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:40,518
First the parents
take care of the children...

and then the children
take care of the parents.

that's how it works.

such obviously incorrect information...
