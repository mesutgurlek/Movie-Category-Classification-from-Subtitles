parting gift for your first mission.

Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

333

Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

334
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:10,075
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

335
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,114

- Chisel?

Did you say flamethrower?

- Yeah.
- Check it.

338

that fires harpoons...

339
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:24,257
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

340

It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

341

have to be individually milked.

You and I share a bond, I think.

in the mirror and not like what we see.

Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

365

Married a year later. No kids.

- No, that is a medical fact.

for me to make this decision.

Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.
