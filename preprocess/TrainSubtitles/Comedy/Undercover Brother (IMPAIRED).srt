00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,584
Yes, I know.

304
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,671
I reaIIy don't want to taIk about this
over the teIephone.

305
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,048
Perhaps we couId meet
at a secret Iocation?

306
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,717
Okay. No, that sounds great.

307
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,220
AII right. RevoIution.
Take care.

<i>Man:
''The revolution will not be televised. ''</i>

309
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,767
- This is Undercover Brother.
- Hey, how you doing?

310
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,103
Good morning!

311
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,939
Good morning?
Get on the desk!

312
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,275
<i>You brought
a spy around me?!</i>

313
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,694
Spy in the buiIding!

314
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,571
- Don't touch the 'fro.
- Back up off!

315
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,575
- Back up off "me!"
- Let me teII you something
about the word ''good.''

316
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,619
Good is an ancient
AngIo-Saxon word.

317
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,998
Go-od, meaning
the absence of coIor,

318
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,916
i.e.--
''It's aII good,''

319
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,586
which it is,
or ''Good WiII Hunting,''

320
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,921
meaning,
''I'm hunting niggas!''

321
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,091
So if you say ''good morning'' to me,
you're saying,

322
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,469
''I'm gonna kiII your bIack ass
first thing in the morning!''

323
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,097
- "ls that that damn Undercover Brother?!"
- You in troubIe.

324
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,099
- Where the heII have you been?!
- Hey.

325
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,226
This is a job, not some kind
of damn summer camp!

326
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,103
And I'm tired of you
disrespecting me!

327
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,773
Give me one good reason
why I shouIdn't fire your sorry ass!

328
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,776
Because I don't work for you?

329
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,445
Shut up!

330
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,448

for the chunky brother in the smock!

to Iaunch ''Operation Whitewash.''

338
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,408
FabuIous. I'II inform MuItinationaI

339
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,745
The onIy thing standing

And they won't be a probIem,

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,376
No, sir.

342
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,627

No! Sometimes peopIe,

365

a.k.a. Honky McGee.
