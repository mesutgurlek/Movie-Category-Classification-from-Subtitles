00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,315
I don't want it
to be one more film

158
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,840
about guys with
guns in their hands.

159
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,386
I want it, overall,
to be about love and peace.

160

But it still has to be about
these seven psychopaths,

161
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,724
so this Buddhist psychopath,

162

163

he's gonna do in the movie.

164
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,110
Maybe he could
karate chop somebody.

166
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,869

fool you can write about.

in the paper the other day

174

who got whacked?

BILLY: How about this?

176

No, this guy, he's got a
little bit more integrity.

180
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,276

188

I'll keep with the Mafia,

189
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,507
Good idea.

190

That's a great fucking psychopath, Billy.
Can I keep him?

191

You can if you let me
help write the movie with you.

Holy fuck!
What the hell happened?

471
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,180
Some punks jumped us.

472
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,470
Said they were looking
for a little shih tzu.

473
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,552
Then some other punk
killed those punks.

474
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,434
I've only been gone 10 fucking minutes.
Marty, are you okay?

475
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,807
You looked fucked.

476
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,311
I just didn't need this today.

477
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,895
He's okay. It's their blood.
It's his puke.

You wanna go to the bathroom,

479

Yeah. (BREATHING HEAVILY)

I was telling you about.

482
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,957
Where did you get this
little shih tzu, Billy? Huh?

483
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,087
I got her off some fat black
chick down at The Elephants.

484
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,754
You think she's the one
that they're after?

485
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,052
I think there's a strong
possibility, Billy.

486

MARTY: So are we gonna
give him his dog back?

487
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,768
That jerk's forfeited all right

488
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:02,355
to having a nice dog like this.
Mmm-hmm.

489
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,932
Miss?

490
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,520
Well, what are we gonna do?

491
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,862
I think we should try and find
this Jack O' Diamonds guy

492
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,489
and get him to
join forces with us.

493
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,160
And then we could take on all the
bad guys, like maybe in the desert.

494
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,118
And what do you think
we should do in real life?

495
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,337
Well, we could sober up, Marty.
How's that grab you?

496
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,711
I think we should
go to the cops.

497
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,088
Fuck the cops!
Fuck them!

498
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,219
Fuck them. All right.

499
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,297
There are some
nice cops, aren't there?

500
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,882
He's from Ireland.

501
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,308
I'm gonna head to the hospital.

502
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,478
I said I'd be with Myra
when her results come in.

503
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,146
No fucking cops.

504
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,311
No cops.

505
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,946
Who's Myra?
His wife.

506

She's just had
surgery for cancer.

507

you've got problems.

and now we don't know

to a hospital now, Charlie?

511
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,964
Yeah, let's get him
to a hospital.

512
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,418
And let's get on to the ASPCA

513
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,550
and have 'em take care
of these poor bastards.

514
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,678
Maybe we should go to the
hospital with him, Charlie.

515

like hospitals.

the guy's wife is.

you're feeling today,

518
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,363
all depressed and
alcoholic and shit?

519
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,864

Put it into your writing, man.

520

Thanks, Billy,
that's what I'll do.

522

I'll put the way I'm feeling
today into my writing.

Well, my name
is Zachariah Rigby.

534
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,276

on Billy's telephone

in answer to the advertisement.

I probably just deleted you.

I was burglarizing the house of
this judge down in Delacroix.

569
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,847
Let me tell you something,
don't never burglarize

570
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,846
the house of no judge
down in Delacroix.

571
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,349
Because when I went down
into his basement,

572
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,144
you know what
I found down there?

573
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,983
I found the corpses of
two negro girls down there.

574
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,774
And then I found a half-alive
'nother negro girl

575
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,451
chained right along with them.

Well,

577
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,248
the girl's name was Maggie.

578
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,587
She told me all about the judge

579
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,510
and she told me what
a terrible man he was,

580
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:47,342
and I think I fell in love with
Maggie right then and there.

581
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,894
And I think she did
a little with me, too.

582
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,941
Then the judge came home.

583
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,113
Yeah, and he was awful angry.

584

And what did you do?

586
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:11,407
Well, we hung him from his
neck until he was dead,

587
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:18,081
and that's when Maggie and
me got this idea, see?

What idea?

589

And through your tears,
you say,

1085
01:07:52,224 --> 01:07:53,864
(IN MOCK IRISH ACCENT)
"Ah, bejesus, Jack,

1086
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:56,524
we did more than good.
We did grand."

1087
01:07:57,145 --> 01:08:01,275
Jack says, "All I ever
wanted was to be your friend."

1088
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:03,486
"Marty, I'm your friend
now, ain't I?"

1089
01:08:03,568 --> 01:08:08,290
And you say, "Ah, bejesus, sure,
you're me best friend, Jack."

1090
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:10,038
"You're me best friend."

1091
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:12,995
And then
the Jack O' Diamonds dies.

1092
01:08:13,578 --> 01:08:17,503
And as his soul leaves his body
to go dance with the angels,

1093
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:20,005
we pan up over
the blood-strewn cemetery

1094
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:22,713
<i>and off into the pretty
blue skies of dawn.</i>

1095
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:27,643
<i>Skies blue enough to suggest
that maybe there can be peace</i>

1096
01:08:28,218 --> 01:08:31,973
one clay in this troubled
but beautiful world.

1097
01:08:32,055 --> 01:08:36,526
Maybe there can be peace
because that would be good!

1098
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:43,275
MARTY: That's the end?

1099
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:45,235
Yeah!

1100
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:47,658
Oh.

1101
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:49,740
So, opinions?

1102
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:53,793
Well...

1103
01:08:54,745 --> 01:08:55,917
It's very...

1104
01:08:58,248 --> 01:09:00,876
I like it.
You like it? Hey!

1105
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:02,468
All right.

1106
01:09:02,544 --> 01:09:05,172
It's got layers, you know.
BILLY: Layers?

1107
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:07,257
Like a pie. Like a cake.

1108
01:09:07,758 --> 01:09:10,136
It's got...
It's got many layers.

1109
01:09:10,886 --> 01:09:12,559
This is an important
demographic.

1110
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:13,851
Mmm-hmm.

1111
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,854
So, what do you think?

1112
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:18,185
I think it's very,
it's very, you know...

1113
01:09:18,268 --> 01:09:21,442
Very... Moving. Moving. Moving.

1114
01:09:21,521 --> 01:09:23,201
I was paying attention,
I'll tell you that.

1115
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:26,159
You were... Moving.

1116
01:09:26,443 --> 01:09:27,990
It's impossible

1117
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:31,866
for someone's head to actually
explode, isn't it? When it gets shot.

1118
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:33,583
No, no, it's possible.

1119
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:37,288
If the person's head was made out
of explosives, it's possible.

1120
01:09:38,038 --> 01:09:40,382
Yeah. I like that.

I'd have made a great Pope.

I'd have been very lenient.

You'd have made
an awesome Pope, Hans.

Why did you kill
all those people?

Like I told you
at Kaya's party,

1157
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:20,028
I killed all those people
to spur you on a little bit

1158
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:21,873
and give you
something to write about

1159
01:12:21,952 --> 01:12:23,795
and get you to finish
your screenplay.

1160
01:12:25,914 --> 01:12:27,632
You told me...

When?

1162
01:12:40,303 --> 01:12:44,729
I can't believe you told me
about this at the party, man!

1163
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:51,778
Maybe I am an alcoholic if I could
forget something like that.

Maybe I am an alcoholic.

1166
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,570
Okay, listen. I didn't tell
you about it at the party.

1167
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:08,082
I was just kidding about that
because you surprised me,

1168
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:10,087
and it would have been ridiculous
telling you at the party.

1169
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,918
You might have told somebody,
got me in trouble.

1170
01:13:12,002 --> 01:13:14,255
Then why did you just tell
me that you told me?

1171
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:15,972
To make you think a little bit

1172
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:17,720
about your alcohol issues.
How about that?

1173

Billy, you kill women!

1174
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:22,805
I killed a woman.
Take it easy.

1175
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:24,348
You shot her
in the stomach, Billy.

1176

That's better than
the head, ain't it?

Not really, no.

Yeah, well...

1180
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:34,612
I don't hang out with people
who kill women, Billy,

the tent up, Billy.

It's over.

My wife is sitting on a chair someplace.

1193
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:21,868
I thought she'd be in Heaven,
but she's sitting on a chair

1194
01:14:22,572 --> 01:14:24,415
with a bullet in her head.

1195
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,040
I thought they'd have cleaned
that kind of stuff up.

1196
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:28,833
Maybe you've just eaten

1197
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:30,960
too many hallucinogenic
cactuses tonight, Hans.

1198
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,792
Nothing to do with
the hallucinogens.

1199
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,001
But you've just seen Myra

on a chair with a bullet
through her head.

Wow.

Listen, Hans, what say we talk
about this on the drive home?

1215
01:15:23,174 --> 01:15:24,972
I set the car on fire.

supposed to get home?

of the fucking desert, Billy.

Yeah, that's the least
of our worries.

What else did you do?

1220
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:40,112
I'll give you a clue.

1221
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:45,072
Come on in.

1222
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:47,365
So, yeah, I just called
up old Charlie Costello

1223
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:49,543
and I told him where we were and
to come down and get his dog back

1224
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:52,497
and said if he had any trouble finding
us, just look for a Buick on fire.

1225
01:15:52,537 --> 01:15:54,289
But I did tell him to
promise to come alone

1226
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:56,090
and unarmed,
and he said he would.

1227
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:58,752
And he'll be here in a couple
of hours, depending on traffic.

1228
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:01,304
Now, I've labeled
these guns for you,

1229
01:16:01,379 --> 01:16:03,347
but you totally
don't have to use them.

I won't think you're pussies,
but I'm gonna hang on to mine.

1258
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:44,149
This guy just telephoned
a psycho-killer

1259
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:45,529
to come down
and psycho-kill us.

cactus he just ate.

me to behave? Whoa! Whoa!

1267
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,174

She had some things to say.

1268
01:18:06,504 --> 01:18:09,053
About the afterlife being
non-existent or something?

1269
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:11,266
That was the gist.

1270
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:15,813
No, no, it might
have sounded like Myra.

1271

voice pretty good.

1274

ago and I pretended to be her.

did you say?
