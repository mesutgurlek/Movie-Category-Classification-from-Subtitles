Every hundred million years or so,

563

the world gets a cosmic cleansing.

564
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,091
Before the dinosaurs,

565
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,130
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

566

Ugh! Yuck.

567
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,449
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

568
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,846
an asteroid hit.

The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

581
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,320
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

582
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,847
Hey, that wasn't there before.

583
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,923
And look what it's doing to the sky.

584
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,321
No worries. Because I've got a plan.

585
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,051
Really? To stop an asteroid?

586
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,648
Look, the last two asteroids

587
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,722
have pummeled the earth in the same spot.

588
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,803
And it's about to happen again.

589
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,485
We've got to go there

590
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,324
and see what's attracting the asteroid.

591
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,330
Once we know why it's coming...

592
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,721
we can figure out how to send it
somewhere else.

593
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,405
That plan is so dumb,

594

Let me get this straight.

596
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,606
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

597
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,967
you want us to run directly towards it?

598
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,090
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

599
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,447
it'll kill us no matter where we went.

Okay, but even if
we get to the crash site...

602

Ah, my cynical friend.

the face of the Earth,

but some escaped.

607

They changed their fate
and we can change ours, too.

I don't know what to believe.
