I always bring my flatmates out

No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,996
It means to make things worse.

No, I haven't forgotten.

- What?

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,278
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

Oooh! How are you doing?

- Yeah, I just bought a place.

How long's that been now?

- Did you do anything special?

194

Tidying up.

red wine instead of beer!

It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

You weren't easy to live with.

Sorry, Mother... Mum!

he touched me?

648

That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

662

- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

No, it's probably best if we...

Worry about your mother.

And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

- This is not about you and me.

- They know us.

- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

763
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,478
Would you just...take care of your mum?

764
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,996
There's a good boy.

765
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,354
- Ed, can you pull over?
- 2 seconds.

766
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,474
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

767
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,318
- Just pull over!
- All right.

768
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,119
Whoa, momma!

769
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,470
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

770
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,590
Stop telling me to chill out!

771
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,996
- And everybody is not all right.
- (Liz) What's wrong?

772
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,554
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

773
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,068
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

774
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,275
No, he isn't.

775
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,231
Get out!

776
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,795
Jesus!

777
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,991
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

778
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,031
(Di) Quick!

779
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,310
(Music starts again)

780
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,271
- The child lock!
- Ed!

781
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,350
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

782
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,029
- (Liz) How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

783
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,719
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

784
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,716
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

785
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,038
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

786
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,278
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

787
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,470
(Turns music off)

788
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,556
Let's go, shall we?

789
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,830
You're not suggesting we walk?

790
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,799
- Everybody OK?
- (Ed) Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

791
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,912
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

792
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,916
Do you know where we're going?

793
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,349
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

794
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,709
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

795
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,273
Are we close?

796
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,155
We're pretty close.

797
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,998
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

798
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,838
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

799
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,758
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

800
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,758
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

801
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,473
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

802
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,318
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

803
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,559
You're not just trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

804
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,716
(Distant screaming and shouting)

805
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,957
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

806
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,558
Shaun.

807
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,999
Yvonne.

808
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,713
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

809
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,228
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

810
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,918
Hey, Yvonne.

811
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,713
Erm...this is my boyfriend, Declan.

812
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,751
Erm...my friends Mark, Maggie,

813
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,156
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

814
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,634
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

815
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,558
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

816
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,670
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

817
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,632
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

818
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,070
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

819
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,553
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

820
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,918
(Both) Hi.

821
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,393
(Both) Hello.

822
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,509
Hi.

823
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,278
(Both) Hello.

824
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,912
(Both) All right.

825
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,829
See? The Winchester's just over there.

826
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,189
- Over where?
- Over there.

827
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,708
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

828
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,512
What's the matter, David?

829
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,196
Never taken a short cut before?

830
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,952
Shaun.

831
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,673
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

832
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,113
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

833
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,311
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

834
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,875
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yes.
- There's 6 of us.

835
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,115
- (Screaming)
- Mum!

836
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,711
I'm coming!

837
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,354
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

838
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,119
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

839
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,913
Shaun?

840
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,356
Are you all right?

841
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,035
(Footsteps and scuffling)

842
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,639
What are you doing?

843
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,631
Shaun!

844
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,232
Yes!

845
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,950
No, that's rubbish.

846
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,236
- Ooh!
- Yes!

847
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,150
Feel free to step in any time.

848
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,192
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

849
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,310
I'm so sorry about that.

850
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,076
Right.

851
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,916
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

852
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,391
- Is it clear?
- No.

853
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,510
- How many?
- Lots.

854
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,192
Oh, well, that is just great.

855
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,356
There are a fair few of them, yes.

856
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,631
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

857
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,796
This is hardly constructive, David!

858
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,515
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

859
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,758
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

860
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,076
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

861
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,350
(Low groaning)

862
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,397
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

863
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,510
Or not.

864
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,155
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

865
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,479
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

866
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,715
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

867
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,751
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

868
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,359
(Groans)

869
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,439
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

870
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,869
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

871
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,559
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

872
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,511
- Come on!
- Urgh.

873
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,836
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

874
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,552
Uuurgh.

875
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,433
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

876
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,710
This is the night!

877
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,069
- What is that?
- What about yours?

878
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,998
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

879
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,632
Don't...

880
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,194
(Groans)

881
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,151
Yeah, that's pretty good.

882
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,877
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
1, 2, 3.

883
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,791
Go, go, go, go.

884
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,349
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

885
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,678
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

886
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,715
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

887
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,239
- They know.
- Stay in character!

888
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,397
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

889
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,954
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

890
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,673
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

891
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,676
- Yeah, there's...
- (Mobile)

892
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,029
2 seconds. Hey, Noodle.

893
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,719
<i>- 'All right?'</i>
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.</i>

894
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,513
<i>- 'You get anything yet?'</i>
- I got nothing.</i>

895
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,393
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

896
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,149
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

897
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,668
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!.

898
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,110
Fuck fucking off!. I've spent an entire life...

899
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,277
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

900
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,471
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

901
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,512
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

902
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,471
Shaun.

903
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,748
Oh.

904
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,559
You were saying about another way in?

905
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,636
Yeah, there's a...

906
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,194
What are you doing?

907
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,437
- (Shaun) No!
- Get inside.

908
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,109
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

909
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,994
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

910
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,033
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

911
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,992
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

912
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,918
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

913
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,557
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

914
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,910
Come on, this way, that's it!

915
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,714
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

916
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,196
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

917
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,356
All you can eat!

918
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,391
Shall we go in, then?

919
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,630
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

920
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,359
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

921
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:08,793
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

922
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,276
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

923
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,713
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

924
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,468
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

925
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,830
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

926
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,714
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

927
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,671
I'm just being proactive.

928
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,952
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

929
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,515
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

930
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,314
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

931
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,512
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

932
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,597
then perhaps...I should.

933
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,916
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- (Liz) He'll be back soon.

934
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,758
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

935
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,796
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

936
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,277
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

937
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,312
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

938
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,874
I could get a round in.

939
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,549
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

940
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,558
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

941
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,716
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

942
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,230
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

943
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,510
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

944
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,519
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

945
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,429
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

946
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,517
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

947
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,951
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

948
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,391
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

949
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,873
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

950
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,912
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

951
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,076
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

952
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,635
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

953
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,275
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

954
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,756
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

955
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,433
Pickle!

956
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,152
Hello, Mum. You all right?

957
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,191
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

958
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,390
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

959
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,590
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

960
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,074
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

961
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,999
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

962
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,554
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't l?

963
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,833
How did you lose them?

964
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,875
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

965
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,593
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

966
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,029
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

967
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,311
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

968
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,989
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

969
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,076
Thanks, babe.

970
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,431
So, what's the plan, then?

971
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,513
Would anyone like a peanut?

972
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,636
Why don't you do your Clyde?

973
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,592
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

974
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,473
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

975
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,114
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

976
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,879
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

977
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,957
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

978
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,798
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

979
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,308
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

980
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,396
I'm not a performing monkey.

981
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,991
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

982
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,828
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

983
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,555
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

984
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,275
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

985
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,595
It's quite simple, David.

986
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,920
- Is that it?
- (Liz) That's it.

987
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,834
(Hammering on the door)

988
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,436
Liz, erm...have you got a quid?

989
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,277
Erm...

990
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,718
Yeah.

991
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,275
Never anything on, is there?

992
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,398
What?

993
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,233
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

994
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,749
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

995
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,075
Yeah.

996
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,557
(Whispering) Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

997
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,911
What?

998
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,598
(Loud jingle on fruit machine)

999
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,995
Ed, no!

1000
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,076
Turn it off!.

1001
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,955
(Windows rattling)

1002
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,231
(Low groaning)

1003
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,157
Shit!

1004
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,794
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

1005
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,515
(# Queen: Don't Stop Me Now)

1006
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,472
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

1007
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,637
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

1008
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,398
- What?!
- The jukebox!

1009
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,034
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

1010
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,071
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

1011
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,476
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

1012
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,478
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

1013
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,397
How about pool?

- What was Ed's experience?

29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,674
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

that will redeem mankind is co-operation.

1066
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,670
I think we can all appreciate that now.

1067
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,235
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1068
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,111
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1069
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,639
(Crashing)

1070
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,717
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1071
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,309
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1072
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,710
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

1073
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,718
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

1074
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,154
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

1075
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,191
- Really?
- Yeah.

1076
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,151
- Ah!
- Barbara?

1077
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,988
Are you all right?

1078
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,837
I've got something for you.

1079
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,509
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1080
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,996
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

1081
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,918
It seems only right.

1082
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,596
I didn't want to say anything.

1083
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,756
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1084
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,152
Liz!

1085
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,918
Here they come!

1086
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,395
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

1087
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,795
Sorry, we're closed!

1088
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,070
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

1089
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,190
Cock it!

1090
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,758
- There!
- Where?

1091
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,711
3 o'clock!

1092
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,275
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to 12.
- What?

1093
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,390
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1094
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,272
Top left!

1095
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,476
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1096
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,556
Come on, come on.

1097
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,592
Nice shot.

1098
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,200
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1099
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,356
Ed, take over a sec.

1100
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,671
- What is it? What's wrong?
- (Liz) Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1101
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,633
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1102
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,750
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1103
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,917
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1104
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,918
No, you should've said.

1105
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,997
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1106
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,429
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1107
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,597
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1108
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,471
(Ed) Jesus.

1109
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,556
(Di) I know first aid.

1110
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,433
Just hang on. Mum!

1111
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,869
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1112
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,150
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1113
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,237
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1114
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,274
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1115
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,833
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1116
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,638
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1117
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,796
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1118
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,115
(Sobbing) Mum. Please don't go.

1119
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,153
(Gun cocks)

1120
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,078
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1121
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,634
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1122
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,955
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1123
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,309
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1124
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,999
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1125
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,275
Move aside. I'm gonna count to 3.

1126
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,311
1...

1127
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,759
2...

1128
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,994
3!

1129
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,713
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1130
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,194
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1131
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,595
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1132
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,915
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1133
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,757
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1134
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,758
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1135
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,597
Tell him to put the gun down!

1136
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,790
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1137
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,960
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1138
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,151
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1139
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,589
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1140
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,235
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1141
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,397
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1142
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,795
- That is not true.
- (Shaun) Yes it is!

1143
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,796
- That is not true.
- (Di) Yes it is.

1144
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,434
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1145
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:52,270
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1146
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,915
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1147
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,191
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1148
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,233
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1149
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,273
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1150
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,278
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1151
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,356
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1152
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,039
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1153
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,832
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1154
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,996
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1155
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,952
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1156
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,549
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1157
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,672
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1158
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,508
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1159
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,510
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1160
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,755
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1161
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,552
Yep.

1162
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,398
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1163
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,510
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1164
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,915
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1165
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,759
Shaun, babe...

1166
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,712
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1167
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,311
You do it.

1168
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,876
I'm sorry, Mum.

1169
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,475
Do it!

1170
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,197
Well...I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1171
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,910
David, no!

1172
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,034
David!

1173
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,513
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1174
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,757
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1175
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,110
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1176
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,515
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1177
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,269
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1178
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,629
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1179
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,875
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1180
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,879
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1181
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,593
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1182
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,437
David!

1183
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,676
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1184
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,633
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1185
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,917
Shaun...

1186
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,791
(Crash)

1187
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,717
David! No!

1188
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,990
No! No! No!

1189
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,597
David!

1190
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,236
- No! No!
- David!

1191
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,350
David!

1192
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,638
Dianne, no!

1193
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,238
I'm coming, David!

1194
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,755
David!

1195
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,597
Oh dear.

1196
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,756
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1197
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,912
Stay back!

1198
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,632
Shaun, hold them!

1199
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,432
Heads!

1200
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,991
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1201
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,029
Shauny, look who it is.

1202
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,548
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1203
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,632
Ed!

1204
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,557
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1205
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,511
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1206
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,312
I can't hold them!

1207
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,153
No!

1208
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,798
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1209
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,711
I said leave him alone!

1210
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,598
Ed. Ed!

1211
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,598
Shaun, bar!

1212
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,037
Ed!

1213
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,671
Ed!

1214
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,840
Ed!

1215
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,711
What?

1216
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,910
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1217
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,949
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1218
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,434
Oh, fuck.

1219
