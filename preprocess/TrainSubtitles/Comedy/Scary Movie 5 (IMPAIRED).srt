00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,006
Maybe you're going to get superpowers.

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,003
Ain't no black superheroes.

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,006
Yo. D'Andre, I think they're
the missing kids from the news.

162
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,525
How can you be so sure?
Look.

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,888
(D'ANDRE) I don't know, man.
Well, if it is the missing kids,

164
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,042
I'm gonna take that reward money,
and I'm gonna buy me

165
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,244
a yacht, fill it with cash,
bitches and a shark.

166
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,731
Why would you want to buy a shark?

167
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,803
Trust me... we're gonna need a shark.

168
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,211
No, this can't be right.

Hi, Mom. (SHRIEKS)

174
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,924
I got to call you back.

No!

...with anticipation over
the outcome of this iPregnancy test,

179

180
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,371
You got to be kidding me.

181
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,241
Oh, no.

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,925
Not pregnant.

(SIGHS) Thank you, God. Sweet!

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,403
Great news:
They found my brother's kids.

186
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,846
Oh, crap.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,571
(MAN) We're very fortunate
the older one, Kathy, has retained

most of her vocabulary.

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,488
The baby hasn't actually said a word.

190
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,968
Why not?
Because he's a baby.

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,567
They've been alone here
over three long months.

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,362
I need to warn both of you
that this is not going to be easy.

193
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,602
I'm ready for it.

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,286
Hello.
No, no. Wrong window.

195
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Here's where the children are.

(MAN) In order to survive

198
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,282
their extreme isolation, the girls
created an imaginary guardian,

199
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,650
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them. They call her Mama.

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,446
But these may help you break through.

201
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,329
And the Ritalin may help, as well.

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,767
The proper dosage
for someone their age is...

OK.

It's OK, Kathy. Remember these?

You used to wear them
to help you see better.

No, no, no!

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,844
Maybe we should get her
some contacts... the soft kind.

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,011
Daddy?

No, sweetheart. Not Daddy.

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,164
I'm your Uncle Dan. Remember?

215
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,765
And this is Jody.

216
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,888
Jo...

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,884
Jody.
No pause between "Jo" and "dy."

Dan, we're at an impasse.
I see constant conflict.

It's fine. They'll warm up to you.

Oh!

Hey, hey, hey, little lady,
that's not how...

223
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,810
You little mother...!

224
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,047
Well, everything checks out.
They seem like good kids, Doc.

225
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,486
Just validate our parking.
We'll take them home.

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,927
Folks, I wish it were that easy.
You don't validate?

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,321
I'm saying the kids
are not yours to take.

228
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,448
Well, you can't win them all.
Let's skedaddle.

229
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,611
That's not fair. They're my brother
Charlie's kids. We deserve them.

230
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,128
Do you? Your wife plays in a punk rock
band, staying out all night long,

231
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,965
high on drugs, sleeping with
a different man every night.

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,885
I don't think the courts
are gonna look upon that too favorably.

233
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,371
But...
I was just messing with you.

234
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
The kids are yours.
They are?

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,365
Did you hear that, honey? They're ours!

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,127
On one condition. This house is owned
by the Institute for Case Studies.

237
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,328
Every room is fully wired with cameras.

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,086
If you move into the house,
you get the kids.

239
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,130
Can't we just sell the house and put
the kids in a high-end orphanage?

240
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,487
Jody, do you really think
you're out out to be a mom?

241
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,641
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,046
Of course she is.

243
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,124
Now, no more rock band,
no more silly wig.

244
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,362
It's not silly. It's all a part of me.

245
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,363
And no more tattoos.
What are you doing?

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,166
What I had to.
We're a perfect suburban couple.

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,087
(NARRATOR) And so Dan and Jody headed to
their new house with their new children.

248
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,562
But, like a slutty sorority girl
returning from spring break,

249
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,282
they were also bringing home
a hidden evil.

here's our new house.

Hi. Don't forget about mommy!

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Dan, I'm not their mommy.
They can call me Aunt Jody.

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,641
Or Jodes, J-Mom, Mrs. Sanders.

to call me... Garage!

Oh, my God, Aidan!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

260
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,643
Maybe we should put him in the carrier.

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,010
There, see, that's better.
Come on, Aidan. What, what, what?

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,447
Relax, it's OK.
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh, my gosh, Aidan!

1241
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,242
Every cent I have
has been put into this room.

1242
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,280
I don't know what I'm going to do.
(SOBBING)

1243
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,006
Oh, cry me a river.

1244
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:44,609
I'm going to need a little help.
I don't have a penis.

1245
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,491
(LAUGHING)

1246
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,365
It does not come off.

1247
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,568
It does not come off. I'm sorry.

1248
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,643
I'm getting tired of talking
about this... (BLEEP)

1249
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,768
In the woods with this man.

1250
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,481
(BLEEP) ...man, we keep going in
circles, talking about a... (BLEEP) man.

1251
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,971
Let's talk about a... (BLEEP) man,

1252
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,804
or getting some...
(BLEEP) getting some...

1253
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,962
Talking about... (BLEEP)
these two dudes in the woods.

1254
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,250
If we had a... (BLEEP) here, she could
wash our... (BLEEP) off right now.

1255
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,880
You understand me?
That's the way I would say it.

1256
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,764
Hey, babe, check out
this psychic's book for a clue.

1257
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,685
It really freaks me out.
Come on, there's nothing to be...

1258
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,604
Nuh!

1259
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,491
These books are all...
(SCREAMS)

1260
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,211
There's nothing to be scared...
(SCREAMING)

1261
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,483
...to be scared... (SCREAMING)

1262
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,131
Oh, there's nothing to be scared...

1263
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,089
Oh, wrong animal. (BLEEP)

1264
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,643
...be scared... A dinosaur? (BLEEP)

1265
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,808
What does this have to do with...?

1266
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,689
(LAUGHING)

1267
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,207
I know. Sorry.

1268
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,088
(MAN) And... action!

1269
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,847
What does this have to do with...?
(LAUGHTER) Sorry.

1270
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,320
You just keep cupping your boobs.
OK, sorry.

1271
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,482
OK, how do we know who's a witch?

1272
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,242
Do they have a broom?

1273
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,811
Do they have a pointy nose?

1274
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,725
(ALL LAUGHING)

1275
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,285
I'm... I'm going to pee my pants!

1276
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,365
So, what, I didn't get the part?

1277
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,409
Where's everybody going?

1278
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,361
(SCORE PLAYING THROUGH HEADPHONES)

1279
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,321
I just had the most bizarro dream.

1280
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,687
Demons, apes, a ballet.

1281
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,127
You have a very active subconscious.

1282
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,521
Anyway, the idea took hold.

1283
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,570
Lindsay Lohan's coming over
to spend the night with you.

1284
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,563
Awesome!
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

1285
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,920
You were driving.
