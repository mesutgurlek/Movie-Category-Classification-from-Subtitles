It's the chips. They're not shielded
against an electromagnetic pulse.

A nuclear blast
would wipe them out.

01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,660
Could we use those to create
a big enough electromagnetic whatever?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We get 'em to explode.

Yeah, that would fry
their chips for sure.

1280
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,610
You could connect
the transformers together.

We just need to put something
metal between the transformers
to complete the circuit.

Who's to say they wrong or right,

But we die
Gatherin' up my soldiers

Mo Thug, mine are prepared for war
Because it's over, over

Red light, red light ride or die

Oh, war

01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:05,410
It ain't nothin'
but a heartbreaker

1536
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,450
What is it good for

01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,510
- Absolutely nothin', nothin'
- Friend only to the undertaker

1538
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:15,040
- War, war, war, war
- Oh, war is an enemy to all mankind

1539
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,060
What is it good for

1540
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,750
- Absolutely nothin'
- The thought of war blows my mind

1541
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:25,490
- War, war, war, war
- War has caused unrest within
the younger generation

1542
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:27,500
- What is it good for
- induction, then destruction

1543
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:30,760
- Absolutely nothin', nothin' War
- Who wants to die

1544
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,700
Are you ready
Hey, are you ready for this

1545
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:34,800
Are you hangin' on the edge
of your seat

1546
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,610
- Are you ready
Hey, are you ready for this
- l need a break, huh

1547
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,800
- Are you hangin' on the edge
of your seat
- l need a break, huh

1548
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:42,040
Are you ready
Hey, are you ready for this

1549
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,380
- Are you hangin' on the edge
of your seat
- l need a break, huh

1550
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:46,680
Outta the doorway
the bullets rip

1551
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,690
Repeat to the sound
of the beat, hey

1552
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:58,360
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1553
01:46:58,430 --> 01:47:01,870
Listen, baby, can't nobody
separate us except us

1554
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,990
And yet, there've been the few
that come along and test us

1555
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:06,730
Oh, they envy us
They love to stress us

1556
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:09,900
Even under pressure
Bless us, it's just us

1557
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,910
Everybody wanted to be us
when they see us

1558
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:14,070
We was the type to be
all over each other

1559
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:16,620
Whenever we lust
no matter where we was

1560
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,550
- Love is a battlefield
- if only we could do this
We've got a strong love

1561
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:22,320
But we need trust

1562
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:25,090
We need that trust
Trust

1563
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,650
You're begging me go

1564
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:30,890
Then making me stay

1565
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,630
Why do you hurt me so bad

1566
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,170
It would help me to know

1567
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,500
Do l stand in your way

1568
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:46,270
Or am l the best thing
you've had

1569
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:48,710
Believe me
Believe me

1570
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:51,440
l can't tell you why

1571
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:54,110
But I'm trapped by your love

1572
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:58,280
And I'm chained to your side

1573
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:05,090
We are young

1574
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:10,230
Heartache to heartache
We stand

1575
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,970
No one can tell us
we're wrong

1576
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,410
You can't tell us nothin'
Can't tell us nothin'

1577
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:21,000
Searching our hearts
for some love

1578
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,240
Both of us knowing

1579
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,980
Love is a battlefield

1580
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:34,990
[ Whistling ]

1581
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:28,710
Nuclear warhead?
What are you talkin' about?

1582
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:31,480
- [ Man ] Cut.
- Was that too much?

1583
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:34,490
- Why, Phil.
- [ Laughter ]

1584
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:40,860
