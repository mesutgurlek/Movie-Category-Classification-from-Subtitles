No, there shouldn't be a problem.

1105

It's just that
all of these transfer documents,

1106
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,328
they need to be witnessed
by a notary public.

1107
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,294

in the presence of our notary.

in Europe saving elephants.

Amino Tropical Blast's benefits

1122

were totally undocumented.

Can I see you in the office
for a minute, John?

1124

You're still a notary, aren't you?

1125

Yeah. Technically, I guess. Why?

1126
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,707
Well, I was hoping
you could transfer some property.

1127
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,167

he cannot come back, okay?

He's out there trying
to impact the world in a positive way.

1132
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,309
No, that's the only reason for a notary,

1133
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,887
is that I have to
witness the signing of the document.

1134
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,348
Otherwise, somebody
could just come in off the street,

and take all their shit.

1138
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,275
No, you can't borrow my stamp.

But this guy, he knows who I am.

1161
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,221

You guys like that?

You like that fine Russian pussy?

1574
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,167
That was mine.

1575
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,415
I gave it to him. Like nothing.

1576
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,837
Now if we're gonna roll,
we're gonna chase tail,

01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,635
we got to do it my way, okay?

No pickle-licking around here. Let's go.

Break it off. Remind your folks

about Neighborhood Watch, okay?

1581

You, you, you and you, jog it home.

he paid in cash?

1588

Yes. 100,000.

1589

- Cash?
- Cash.

1590

- This didn't surprise you.
- No.

1591
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,833
I thought maybe he was in sports, rap.

1592
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,041
You know, he is black.

1593
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:13,793
Yeah.

1594
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,337
Well, you don't think it was strange

1595
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,714
that Mr. Kershaw never said goodbye?

WOMAN: He was a dick.
Always making fat jokes.

1597

One time he told me
if I can cut out snacking,

that they can cure world hunger.

Yeah, he can be kind of rude that way.

What do you think of the new guy?

1601
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,986
Awesome. He says I'm a do-er.

DANIEL: Our Neighborhood Watch
is about to start.

Can I get everybody's attention?

1604
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,744
Would you like one? Those are so cute.

1605
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,537
They're like little edible penises.

1606
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,540
I wish they had them in the strip club.
They're great niblets.

01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,079
This is delicious.

Now, we'd all like to believe

1613

we're safe here in
Old Cutler Cove Estates.

I know I feel more snug
and secure than I've ever.

And I feel very welcomed,

1616
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,677
and I want to
thank you all for that. Okay?

1617
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,729
But this is a very serious situation.

1618
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,723
Okay? There are bad guys out there

1619

that are waiting for
good people like us to drop our guard.

Bad guys are everywhere.

I should know, okay.
I work for the government.

And I've been to prison.

of the Neighborhood Watch,

1626
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,780
a few ways we can keep ourselves safe.

- My pal, Dick... (SNAPPING FINGERS)
- Yeah.

...who works with me at the government,

1629

will now hand out
your preparedness packs.

1630
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,169
Right.

1631
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,292
That means we have to hand
out the preparedness packs,

1632
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,793
-thank you.
- PAUL: Yeah. Right away.

1633
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,170
In our own corner
of the American dream,

1634
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,547
safety requires vigilance.

1635
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,428
Okay, look at our chart here.

1636
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,598
Number one thing,
vigilance equals safety.

1637

-(SNIFFING)
- Number two, recognizing...

1638

PAUL: Oh, baby. That's the one. Yeah.

1639
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,725
Okay. First thing,
recognizing a potential attacker.

1640
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,523
Sorry about that. There it is.

1641
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:56,604

Each pack has
pepper spray and a taser.

1645

Ladies, these things work.

1646
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,664
You can zap a guy's balls off
with one hit, all right.

1647
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,662
Okay! The lovely Sorina here...

1648
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,539
- Ta-da!

MAN 2: Right here!

1652
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,333
Me. Pick me.

1653
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,008
Can you pick me? Can you pick me?

1654
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,758
We're only picking one, guys.
This is not a gang rape, okay.

1655
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,089
You sit down. We'll take Brad.

- It was nice meeting you.

1663

This is only a simulation, okay?
Cairn it down.

1664
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,859

I'd do in this situation.

1665
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,608
I'll fuck him up!

1666

1667

Honey, I had to grab her <i>ass.</i>
Look, I was the rapist!

1670

What?

1671

This is a critical time, Paul. Okay?

We cannot afford to mess this up.

1675

I agree. You don't need
all this Kumbaya shit.

like a pissed-off wife.</i>

2664
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:01,852
Sir, I officially divorced him last night.

2665
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:04,856
That's why I can testify
against him today.

2666
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:08,860
Well, I've been working
in the penis industry for 19 months.

2667
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:11,533
I think he lifted weights
to try to compensate

2668
01:57:11,608 --> 01:57:15,033
for the fact that he had a very tiny penis.

2669
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:20,122
It was bent on a 25 degree angle,
like a boomerang.

2670
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:24,079
You see, erectile dysfunction
is nothing to be ashamed about

2671
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:26,290
but being an unfaithful lying shit

2672
01:57:26,373 --> 01:57:28,296
who I know for a fact tried to finger bang

2673
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:31,049
his paralegal in the interview room,

2674
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:33,050
that's a little shamey.

2675
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,675
But being in the medical profession,
I prefer not to judge.

2676
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:39,178
But that lady's a whore.

2677
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,852
- Yeah, you, you fucking bitch.
- No further questions.

2678
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:45,141
<i>ED". The state was very thorough.</i>

2679
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,523
<i>Frankly, it had a lotto make up for.</i>

2680
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:50,739
We're going to walk on this.
They ain't got no proof.

2681
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:53,700
<i>At first, the evidence
was mostly circumstantial,</i>

2682
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:57,279
<i>physical proof of the murders
being hard to come by.</i>

2683
01:57:57,362 --> 01:58:00,241
<i>Eventually, they found
the barrels and bodies,</i>

2684
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:02,792
<i>but no fingerprints.
And then, for the first time</i>

2685
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:04,335
<i>in the history of the United States...</i>

2686
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:07,585
PROSECUTOR:
Two 750 cc breast implants.

2687
01:58:07,664 --> 01:58:09,132
<i>ED". ...they used the manufacturer's</i>

2688
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:11,505
<i>unique serial numbers for identification.</i>

2689
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:15,760
<i>Paul Doyle seemed to embrace
the concept of confession.</i>

2690
01:58:15,839 --> 01:58:17,807
They kidnapped Kershaw,
they tried to kill him.

2691
01:58:17,882 --> 01:58:20,010
<i>I just want to go back to prison.</i>

2692
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:22,095
<i>They used chainsaws to cut them up!</i>

2693
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:24,681
<i>He said no one would get hurt.
They hurt Pepe.</i>

2694
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,437
<i>They hurt him bad. They hurt my friend.</i>

2695
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,234
Manipulator of manipulators.

2696
01:58:28,685 --> 01:58:30,858
<i>PAUL". Wow. That felt good.</i>

2697
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,948
All they got is testimony
from some fucking cokehead.

2698
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,401
<i>ED". In the end, though,</i>

2699
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:37,736
<i>all justice really needed
to do was listen to</i>

2700
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:39,742
<i>the right guy at the right time.</i>

2701
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:41,038
<i>In light of his cooperation,</i>

2702
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:43,958
<i>Mr. Doyle was given only 15 years.</i>

2703
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:46,787
<i>A sentence for which
he seemed legitimately grateful.</i>

2704
01:58:47,287 --> 01:58:52,088
<i>I once was lost</i>

2705
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:57,006
<i>But now I'm found...</i>

2706
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,926
<i>ED". Daniel Lugo and Adrian Doorba!</i>

2707
01:59:01,009 --> 01:59:04,229
<i>were found guilty
of double murder, racketeering,</i>

2708
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,477
<i>attempted extortion, theft,</i>

2709
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:08,274
<i>attempted murder, armed robbery,</i>

2710
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:10,523
<i>burglary, money laundering and forgery.</i>

2711
01:59:10,602 --> 01:59:12,730
<i>In fact, the only thing
they weren't found guilty of</i>

2712
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,235
<i>was the one thing
they were most guilty of,</i>

2713
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:17,491
<i>being dumb stupid fucks.</i>

2714
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:20,203
<i>It took the jury only 14 minutes</i>

2715
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:22,076
to sentence them both to death.

2716

(SIGHS)

2717
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:42,350
This seems like such a waste.

2718
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:44,848
People's lives.

2719
01:59:45,804 --> 01:59:47,101
You know?

2720
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:50,900
Some people just don't
know a good thing

2721
01:59:50,975 --> 01:59:53,194
when it's staring them in the face.

(SIGHS)

2723
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:59,655
<i>ED". It really is the
simple things in life.</i>

2724
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:03,321
<i>Daniel just wanted to be like everyone.</i>

2725
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,158
<i>Everyone that wants
the American dream.</i>

2726
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:09,036
<i>DANIEL: All I ever wanted out of life</i>

2727
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,746
<i>was what everyone else had.</i>

2728
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:13,799
<i>Not more.
Just not the less I was used to.</i>

2729
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:16,918
<i>Well, I took a real swing for it,
you know?</i>

2730
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:20,843
<i>And for a while, it was like
I always thought it would be.</i>

2731
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,299
<i>I was one of you.</i>

2732
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,009
<i>And it felt good.</i>

2733
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,561
<i>People finally saw me like I saw myself</i>

2734
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:28,309
<i>and you can't ask for more than that.</i>

2735
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,974
<i>Maybe I did, though.</i>

2736
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:34,311
<i>Maybe it got so I didn't want to
be "equal to" anymore.</i>

2737
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,692
<i>I wanted to be "better than.“</i>

2738
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,907
<i>And that's a recipe for injury.</i>

2739
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:41,076
<i>That doesn't mean you give up, though.</i>

2740
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:44,371
<i>You rest, you heal and
you get back on that bench.</i>

2741
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,740
<i>Life is going to give me another set.</i>

2742
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,120
<i>And I am going to rock it.</i>

2743
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:49,826
<i>Because my name is Daniel Lugo,</i>

2744
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,911
<i>and I believe in fitness.</i>

That's the American dream.
