for a few questions?

about the show?

I'm very excited.

see the models?

They hate themselves.

118

That's easy for you to say.

119

I wasn't born with
that thick Hennings skin.

No, you weren't, and that
is what I love about you.

a meeting in the Bronx.

But you go and enjoy, and
I'll see you later. Okay?

124

Oh, and, hey, we've got that
thing tonight at Lincoln Center.

125

[Sighs] Right, the thing...
with your mother.

That's tonight.

129
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,087
I'm afraid so.

130
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,129
Okay.

I am so proud of you.

a little late.

He told me to take you inside
so you wouldn't have to wait.

too long.

won't you come in?

144
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,938
So... have you made a decision?

145
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,190
A-bout what?

146
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,524
Ireland.

I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

some sort of medication?

What's going on?
Where are we?

Oh, my God.

Melanie Carmichael...

157
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,704
will you marry me?

158
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,916
Are you sure?

159
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,585
I mean, a-a-are
you really sure?

anything rash.

the answer to,

being rejected twice,

Will you marry me?

One shot!

Can you comment on
the Watson bill?

Your Honor,
how do you answer those

184
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,948
who are opposed to
the street-improvement project

185

you put before
the city council today?

186
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,494
I suggest they take a drive on
some of the streets in Brooklyn.

187
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,456
Maybe they'll disappear
into a pothole.

Your son's relationship
with Melanie Carmichael...

Do you have a comment?

190
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,632
Trust me, if my son were
engaged, I'd have a comment.

Honey, would you
mind terribly

203
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,538
if we just kept this to
ourselves for a few days?

204

Mel, it's gonna come out
sooner or later.

No, l-I know,

206
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,420
it's just, I haven't seen
my folks in about 7 years,

207

probably tell them in person.

Of course.

And, um... l-I think
I should do it alone.

meet them eventually.

Is it because
I'm a Yankee?

about children?

I'm sorry we're late.

That shade of lipstick does
nothing for you. What kept you?

Oh, it's none of your business.

...What, are you a clairvoyant?

Oh, honey, you didn't need
to call, then. Just come on by.

Uh... well, that's the thing.

I was sorta hoping
Daddy could come get me.

Earl: So, what put you
in jail this time?

482
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,544
Melanie: Jake and
his big, fat mouth.

483
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,672
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

484
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,799
Yeah, kinda like that
weddin' I paid for, huh?

485
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,135
I would hardly call that
a wedding.

from the night before.

Yes, I can!

by myself with puke

all down my dress while he slept
it off in the Travelodge,

Can we just
not talk about Jake, okay?

had, but I'm your only daughter,

were supposed to come visit me?

both ways, sweetie.

two olives, dirty. Thanks.

785
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,578
# Well... #

786
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,372
Oh... my... God!

787
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,584
Melanie?!

788
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,919
Lurlynn?

789
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,922
Yes! Oh, my God!

790
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,757
L-Look at you,
all fancy.

791
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,885
You look like you just
stepped out of a magazine.

792
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,931
Oh, well, thank you.
Um, look at you.

793
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,599
You have a baby...

794
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,100
in a bar.

795
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,936
Hell, I got three
more at home.

796
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,939
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

797
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,399
...[Baby gurgles]
...Right.

798
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,736
I almost bought that exact same
top the other day.

799
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,447
But Clinton'd kill me
if I spent 30 bucks

800
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,908
on a sweater thing.

801
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,870
Ah, that Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doin'.

802
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,747
Actually, it's mine.

803
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,291
Bergdorf's just picked it up.

804
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,463
I design clothes now.

805
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,424
Oh, mmm, now that
you mention it,

806
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:27,761
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I heard that. [Chuckles]

807
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,888
...[Cheers and applause]
...So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

808
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,228
Mind if I join you?

809
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,314
Actually, we do.

810
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,275
You must be Jake's hot date.

811
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,776
I'm Starr.

812
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,529
Hi, I'm Melanie, Jake's
snotty Yankee-bitch wife,

813
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,072
whom he refuses to divorce,

814
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,408
even though
I'm engaged to another man.

815
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,785
Hot dog, Jake, look at
the size of that thing.

816
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,245
...Honey?
...Huh?

817
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,998
Why don't you get us
a couple drinks, all right?

818
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,624
Okay. [Giggles]

819
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,421
Is that a martini?

820
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:07,801
Not "me and her" us.
"You and l" us.

821
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,188
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

822
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,522
Is that what you want...

823
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:23,192
to be humiliated in front
of all of your friends?

824
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:26,278
Oh, come on, Mel,
we were your friends, too.

825
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,324
Well, looky, looky there!

826
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,825
Well, well, well,

827
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,703
if it isn't the two
groomsmen of the apocalypse.

828
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,166
...Hey, Eldon!
...Yep?

829
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,126
Are you hungry?!

830
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,753
Starved!

831
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,838
No, no, no!
No, don't you dare!

832
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,840
I could use a Melanie
sandwich!

833
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,718
Just seems like old times,
doesn't it?

834
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:50,844
Get off me!

835
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,179
Ugh!

836
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,474
No, not like old times,
all right?

837
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,351
Times have changed.

838
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:00,270
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,

839
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,731
and no more Melanie
corn dog, all right?

840
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,858
...Sure... sorry.
...Just playin' with you.

841
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,151
Come on, guys,
just grab a stick.

842
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,361
Let's play some pool,
all right?

843
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,487
And if you can't find a cue,

844
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,531
just pull the one
shoved up her ass.

845
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,658
[Laughter,
cheers and applause]

846
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:21,500
Eldon, you're still wearing
that same old stupid hat.

847
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,877
Well, I... just about
got it broken in.

848
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,171
Now, you sit your
bony ass down there

849
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,423
and watch and see me
teach Jake here

850
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,050
how to lose at pool.

851
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,220
Well, see, that's the thing.

852
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,848
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl...

853
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,516
am I, Jake?

854
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,237
Woman: Come on, now,
Bobby Ray, you got it.

855
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,281
[Drunkenly] Bobby Ray...

856
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,783
...[Laughs]
...[Laughs, snorts]

857
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:58,704
Don't blow this one,
okay?

858
00:42:58,787 --> 00:42:59,955
All right, baby?

859
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,957
You can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk,

860
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,543
but you can't take the
honky-tonk out of the girl.

861
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,378
[All groaning]

862
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:07,921
Eldon: So, Jake...

863
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:13,051
are you going to divorce
this girl or what?

864
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,555
Well, she waited 7 years.

865
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,558
A couple more days
won't kill her...

866
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,767
unfortunately.

867
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,061
Like it's gonna
make a difference.

868
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,521
You never know.

869
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,899
You might be interested to learn
Jake has this whole...

870
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,277
Hey, hey, let her think
whatever she wants, Clinton.

871
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,238
She made up her mind
about me a long time ago.

872
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:34,948
Some things never change.

873
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,450
[All groaning]

874
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,327
Like Eldon here!

875
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,413
He never could get
his balls in the right pocket.

876
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:42,998
[Laughter]

877
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,959
Okay, Jake,
it's you and Mel.

878
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:47,294
Clutch time, man.

879
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,129
It's just like
state playoffs.

880
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,756
We're down by 6,
7 seconds to go.

881
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,468
We need that big, beautiful
52-yard bomb!

882
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,345
[Cheers and applause]

883
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,890
Do you remember that,
Mel?

884
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,433
How could I forget?

885
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,686
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

886
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,021
All: Ooh.

887
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,815
Why don't you just go
public with that shit?

888
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,192
Oh, come on.

889
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:14,029
It's not like anybody can
keep a secret around here...

890
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,739
except for Bobby Ray.

891
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,325
Now, what did I
ever do to you?

892
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,827
You never did anything
to me, darlin'...

893
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,829
or any other girl in town.

894
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:23,872
[Laughter]

895
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,500
Melanie, what is
the matter with you?

896
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,336
...What do you mean?
...Oh, she's just unhappy.

897
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:30,921
Well, of course,
I would be, too,

898
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,340
if "Women's Wear Daily"
called me "less than mediocre."

899
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,967
[Laughter]

900
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:39,346
Why don't you just
go to a gay bar?!

901
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:42,224
...Ooh!
...[Light laughter]

902
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:46,019
[Laughing] Now, what would
"B" Ray do at a gay bar?

903
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,324
Well...

904
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,076
[Pool cue clatters]

905
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,245
I think I had about
enough fun for one night.

906
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,499
Oh, come on,
I was just kidding.

907
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,377
Hey, Stella!

908
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:13,380
How 'bout another round of
drinks for my friends here?

909
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,174
Honey, I think you've
had about enough.

910
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:20,304
You know what?

911
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,015
I think you're right.

912
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,392
I have had enough.

913
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,645
I mean, how do you people live
like this, anyway?

914
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,898
All right, that's it,
that's it. Come on.

915
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,942
Did you know that there's
a great, big world out there?

916
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:37,404
It has absolutely nothin'
to do with chitlins

917
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:38,906
or children or beer!

918
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:41,450
I liked her better
when she was crazy.

919
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,784
[Sighs] Jake!

920
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,494
What makes you think
you can treat them

921
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,538
like somethin' you stepped in
in them fancy shoes, huh?!

922
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:48,415
...You asked for it!
...I asked for it?!

923
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,417
You show up here,
you steal my money,

924
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,212
you rearrange my house, and
then you insult my friends,

925
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:55,172
actin' like you're
better than 'em!

926
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:56,715
I am better than them!

927
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,259
And you stole my pen!

928
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,345
That's all that matters
to you, isn't it?

929
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:02,763
...Jake...
...The money...

930
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,598
the labels, the shoes...

931
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:05,641
you're pathetic!

932
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh, like you're
goin' places!

933
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,894
Well, I am as soon as I
get my keys out of here.

934
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,938
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't, Mel.

935
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,856
...Give me my purse!
...You want to kill yourself?

936
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,025
You want to kill yourself,
you do it somewhere else.

937
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:17,277
At least I'm doin'
somethin' with my life.

938
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,112
So what if you can't
play football anymore?!

939

...Get a new dream!
...Get in the car.

...Get in the truck, Mel.
...I did.

941
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,701

01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:22,089
[Voice breaking]
you never left my side.

1259
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:30,597
And then I just left you.

1260
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:41,942
[Crying] I bet you sat there
wondering what you'd done wrong.

1261
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,700
I told him
it was my fault.

1262
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,787
[Sighs]

1263
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:56,039
[Sniffs]
Quit bein' so nice.

1264
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,542
It's the truth.

1265
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,503
How come it has to be
so complicated?

1266
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:02,588
What?

1267
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:04,131
Truth...

1268
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:08,468
[Sniffs] life...

1269
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,512
this.

1270
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,975
He was one hell
of a good dog, wasn't he?

1271
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:18,312
[Sighs, sniffs]
Yeah.

1272
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:22,941
You looked like you were
having fun out there tonight.

1273
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:28,197
I'm happy
in New York, Jake.

1274
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,657
[Sighs]

1275
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:34,745
But then I come down here
and...

1276
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,747
this fits, too.

1277
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,000
Since when does it have to be
one or the other?

1278
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,669
You can have roots
and wings, Mel.

1279
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,841
Maybe I could just fly south
for the winter.

1280
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,680
Look.

1281
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,516
What?

1282
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,559
There.
Do you see 'em?

1283
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,857
[Chuckles]
Lightning bugs?

1284
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,193
Only you.
[Sniffs]

1285
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,570
[Chuckles]

1286
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:11,240
You know, I still go
out there sometimes.

1287
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,495
I see those big thunderheads
rollin' in.

1288
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,582
It's like a religion.
[Chuckles]

1289
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:24,211
I had a dream about it
the other night.

1290
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:29,216
You ever wonder
what would have happened

1291
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,218
if we hadn't have gotten
pregnant?

1292
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,845
Jake...

1293
01:07:32,928 --> 01:07:34,930
Just...

1294
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:38,100
let me get this out
before I can't.

1295
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:42,062
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

1296
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:45,899
And it took me a while
to realize

1297
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:49,736
it would have been
your only adventure.

1298
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:52,865
I just guess Mother Nature
knew better, huh?

1299
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:57,953
I was so ashamed...

1300
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:04,251
...'cause I felt...

1301
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,004
relieved.

1302
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:15,012
And all of a sudden, I just...
needed a different life.

1303
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,394
You done real well
for yourself.

1304
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,688
I'm proud of you, Mel.

1305
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:30,277
I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our weddin'.

1306
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:38,327
I'm sure this next one's
gonna go better for ya.

1307
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:45,792
Jake, I can't do this.

1308
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,419
Hey...

1309
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,551
I know.

1310
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:22,204
Go home.

1311
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,302
Well, I'm just sayin',
is all.

1312
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,679
I mean, I... I saw

1313
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,514
the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

1314
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:42,474
Will you just shut up
about it, Mama?!

1315
01:09:42,558 --> 01:09:44,601
I can't help
the way Jake feels about me!

1316
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,228
He hasn't done
anything wrong!

1317
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,188
He hasn't done anything right
either!

1318
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,190
I can't believe I'm even
having this argument!

1319
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,192
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

1320
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:53,694
I'm marrying another man!

1321
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:56,905
Yes, that's right, you get
a second chance, so please

1322
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:57,865
don't mess it up!

1323
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,576
For who?
For me or for you?

1324
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:01,869
Don't sass me, okay?

1325
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:04,705
Don't you dare sass me,
'cause I have put up

1326
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:06,874
with an awful lot from you
over the years.

1327
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,918
Like what?! L-Like me quitting
your precious pageants?

1328
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:13,046
I didn't want you to
end up like me! Damn it!

1329
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,758
Now, you need to stay as far
away from here as you can.

1330
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:18,385
That boy is quicksand.

1331
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:21,805
What's so wrong
with being you, Mama?

1332
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:26,810
I just think that you
deserve better, that's all.

1333
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:29,730
I know you do.

1334
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:35,402
You always have.

1335
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:38,488
I'll see you in New York,
all right?

1336
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:39,907
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:42,242
You'll like it.

1338
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:44,369
I promise.

1339
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,168
Now, don't you forget to
say goodbye to your daddy.

...Good, thanks. Yourself?

You, uh, you here
to see Bobby Ray?

...My fiancee.

You got the wrong house,
don't ya?

1368

This is, uh,
the Carmichael place, isn't it?

about the same girl?

I'm just, uh, talkin'
to Mel's fiance here.

where she is.

her, uh, cousin?

Family! God, it's great
to meet you both.

1386
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,284
I think Melanie said
somethin' last night

1387
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:30,786
about, uh, visitin'
her daddy

1388
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,579
u-up at the...
up at the battlefield.

1389
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,915
...The battlefield?
...You know us Southerners.

1390
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,583
I mean, the minute
the Confederacy died,

1391
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:37,960
it became a moral issue.

1392
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:42,256
Come on, I'll, uh, I'll
give you a ride up there.

That's great. Thank you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

# What this world needs
is a few more rednecks #

# So people ain't afraid
to take a stand #

1396
01:13:54,768 --> 01:13:58,772
So, who's...
Melanie... Smooter?

1397
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,066
Local hero around here.

1398
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:02,943
Why is that?

1399
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,278
She blew up the bank.

1400
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,613
And that made her a hero?

1401
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:10,826
Well, notorious, anyway.
She was 10.

1402
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,160
Oh.

1403
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:16,456
Fortunately, nobody was hurt...
except, maybe, the cat.

1404
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:18,667
What cat?

1405
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,253
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

1406
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:24,131
She blew up a cat?

1407
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,550
...He was scheduled to die.
...From dynamite?

1408
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,136
The vet said it had cancer,

1409
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,181
so Eldon thought it'd be put
in one of those chambers,

1410
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,933
you know, the ones
that suck their lungs out.

1411
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,811
Little Mel, she couldn't bear
the thought of that.

1412
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:40,314
She, uh, she wanted
somethin' more humane.

1413
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,316
Yeah, sure.

1414
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:45,527
So, they were doing some
blastin' out by the new highway.

1415
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:48,697
So, we, uh, we took
old Fuzz up there,

1416
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,157
taped him up.

1417
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:53,702
Used about 30 feet of fuse
just to be on the safe side,

1418
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:55,537
said our prayers,
and ran like hell.

1419
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,497
Of course.

1420
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:59,499
So, there we were,
sittin' in Virgie's Diner,

1421
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,085
feelin' pretty blue.

1422
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:04,171
When Mel looks up and sees
that damn cat,

1423
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:07,382
trottin' down the road,
searchin' for Eldon.

1424
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,843
No shit.

1425
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,678
Yeah, and we
would have caught him, too,

1426
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,932
but once that fuse hit his tail,
boom, he took off like a shot.

1427
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:16,391
And into the bank.

1428
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:19,019
Well... the theory is,

1429
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:21,104
he probably wriggled loose
from the explosive.

1430
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:24,566
'Cause, uh, people still
see him from time to time,

1431
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,360
scorched tail and all.

1432
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:29,696
He's a little skittish
around humans.

1433
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:32,199
That's quite a story.

1434
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:34,368
She was quite a girl.

1435
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:37,287
# A little less talk
and a little more action #

1436
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,289
Whatever happened to her?

1437
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,707
# And a few more rednecks... #

1438
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:44,002
Oh, you know...
wound up pregnant,

1439
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:48,090
married some loser
right out of high school.

1440
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:53,554
[Trumpet playing "Taps"]

1441
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:08,193
["Taps" ends]

1442
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:11,280
[Whistling,
cheers and applause]

1443
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,001
Are you surprised?

1444
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:29,298
What are you doing here?

1445
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,508
Well, I came to deliver
your fiance.

1446
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:32,843
I think
she was talking to me.

1447
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:33,969
Jake...

1448
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:35,679
Must be exhaustin'.

1449
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:36,680
...What?
...What?

1450
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:38,223
Livin' a lie.

1451
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:39,516
What's he talking about?

1452
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:43,979
You and I are in love
with two different people.

1453
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:52,362
Is he a second cousin?

1454
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:55,282
He's my husband.

1455
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,491
Your what?

1456
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,576
I mean my ex-husband.

1457
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,119
You married your cousin?!

1458
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:01,955
No, I came down here
to finalize my divorce.

1459
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,499
Hey, darlin',
thought that was you.

1460
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,795
Must be your new someone.

1461
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,299
Earl Smooter...
glad to meet ya.

1462
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:17,846
Melanie Smooter.

1463
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:21,642
Andrew, wait.

1464
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,310
Wait!

1465
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,313
Andrew! Wait!

1466
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:27,314
I just...

1467
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:28,524
Please.

1468
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:30,484
Let me try
and explain myself!

1469
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,528
You don't understand!

1470
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:34,988
This is not
who I am anymore!

1471
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,032
Look, I don't know who you are
or what else you lied about,

1472
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,534
but I know one thing...

1473
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:42,246
there is a Lear Jet
in Mobile, and I am on it.

1474
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,583
[Sighs]

1475
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,184
I know you're thinkin'

1476
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:07,020
I spoiled things good
this time.

1477
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:10,774
Oh, hon, don't go accusin' me
of thinkin'.

1478
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,986
I ain't done
anything of the sort.

1479
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:17,030
Anyway, spoiled's in the eye
of the beholder...

1480
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,158
...like these plums here.

1481
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:24,037
Some people might
call them "spoiled"...

1482
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,375
but I think that, um,
these almost-ruined ones

1483
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:31,378
sometimes make
the sweetest jam.

1484
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,257
Do you need any help?

1485
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,969
It was kind of fun,

1486
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:41,305
seeing Daddy up there,
surrendering.

1487
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,348
Yeah.

1488
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,226
He sure does have
a flair for the dramatic.

1489
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:49,396
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

1490
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,358
Hey, y'all.

1491
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,736
Look who I found
walkin' down l-58.

1492
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,613
Hi.

1493
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,532
Hi.

1494
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,829
I thought you'd be
halfway to New York by now.

1495
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:08,916
So did I.

1496
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:12,336
Ooh, if I'd known
company was comin',

1497
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,588
I'd have put on the dog.

1498
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:17,925
This is my mama.

1499
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,302
Hi.

1500
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,262
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

1501
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:24,431
[Scoffs] Oh.

1502
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:27,100
And my dad...
you... you already met him.

1503
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:28,310
Yeah.

1504
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:33,106
And this is our home.

1505
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,651
This is where I grew up.

1506
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,279
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you both.

1507
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,657
I'm... Andrew Hennings...

1508
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,951
Melanie's fiance...

1509
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:48,664
well... that is... if...
if she'll still have me.

1510
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:56,755
Look, Mel...

1511
01:19:56,797 --> 01:20:00,259
I really don't care
what happened down here.

1512
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,261
So... you have a past.

1513
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:04,304
I mean, who doesn't?

1514
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,812
What I need to know

1515
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:15,524
is if there is a place for me
in your future.

1516
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:20,529
Oh, good Lord.
That is the sweetest thing.

1517
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,532
Well, go on.

1518
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:32,708
Oh! Hello, New York City!

1519
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,169
Woman, what the hell
you gassin' about?

1520
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:37,629
Well, sir...

1521
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,798
my mother happens to be
the mayor up there,

1522
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,842
and, uh, she'd like
nothing better

1523
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,344
than a big, snazzy
New York wedding.

1524
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:48,891
Well, uh...

1525
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:51,435
yeah, I suppose
I can take off work.

1526
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:56,857
Andrew, I, um...
actually, I was thinking,

1527
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,942
maybe we could have
the wedding here.

1528
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:02,863
Here.

1529
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:05,199
In my hometown.

1530
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,452
Look, Mel, if you're worried
about the money, don't.

1531
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,954
It's not about
the money, Andrew...

1532
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,247
not down here.

1533
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,920
You know...
a lot of people

1534
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,507
are expecting us
to get married in the city,

1535
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,884
but I think a nice,
quiet, country wedding

1536
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,093
is just the ticket.

1537
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:29,097
Earl...

1538
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,724
Pearl, if you...
if you folks could

1539
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:33,185
take care
of the rehearsal dinner,

1540
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:36,104
I'd really like
to take care of the rest.

1541
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,732
Well, I think
we could cover that.

1542
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:41,944
Heck. [Chuckles]

1543
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:45,322
How many times does
your only daughter get married?

1544
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:48,075
[Chuckling]

1545
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:53,080
Other than before.

1546
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:54,831
Felony Melanie?

1547
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,083
She was never convicted.

1548
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,292
Oh-ho.

1549
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,253
I don't know
which is worse...

1550
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,964
child cat killer
or sons of the Confederacy.

1551
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,050
What would you suggest I do...
dump her for being poor?

1552
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,010
You're supposed to be
a Democrat, remember?

1553
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,054
There is nothing wrong
with being poor.

1554
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,681
I get elected by poor people,

1555
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,641
and I'm a big enough person
to commend her

1556
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,768
for making something of herself.

1557
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:16,854
What upsets me
is that she lied to you.

1558
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:19,398
So what? She was ashamed
of her background.

1559
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,317
Who hasn't been embarrassed by
their parents at one point?

1560
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:25,112
I'm going to assume that
was a rhetorical question.

1561
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:26,947
Assume away.

1562
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:32,119
[Sighs] No one is going to
change my mind about this...

1563
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,371
not you, not the media,
not anyone.

1564
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:37,457
Fine...

1565
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:40,627
but admit it...
I was right.

1566
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:43,255
Yes... you were right.

1567
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,925
There is a wedding
in your future,

1568
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:48,844
whether you like it or not.

1569
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,390
And how, exactly,
does Little Miss Alabama

1570
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,601
plan to accommodate
500 people?

1571
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:57,644
I suppose she has connections
at the jail.

1572
01:22:57,728 --> 01:22:59,396
Well, there are
several excellent choices...

1573
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:02,900
the Travelodge,
Days Inn, a Motel 6,

1574
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:04,860
oh, and
