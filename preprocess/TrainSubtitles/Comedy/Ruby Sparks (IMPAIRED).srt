00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,873
Have we met before?

158
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,018
I don't think so.

159
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,012
Do you mind if I draw him?

160
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,020
Uh, but don't get too cIose.

161
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,420
He's a IittIe scared of peopIe.

162
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,371
-You're an artist?
-Yeah.

163
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,939
-I'm super good.
-ReaIIy?

164
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,409
-What's your dog's name?
-Uh, Scotty.

165
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,137
-Are you Scottish?
-No.

166
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,249
I named him for F. Scott FitzgeraId.

167
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,149
-Who?
-F. Scott FitzgeraId.

168
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,914
The noveIist.

169
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,922
Great Gatsby.

170
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,490
I don't read a Iot of fiction.

171
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,131
You've never heard of
F. Scott FitzgeraId?

172
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,132
Why? Is he reaIIy famous and important?

173
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,999
WeII, he's probabIy one of the greatest
noveIists who ever Iived.

174
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,733
Isn't that disrespectfuI?

175
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,967
What?

176
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,003
Naming your dog after him?
It's a IittIe disrespectfuI.

177
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,116
-No, it's a gesture.
-Yeah, an aggressive gesture.

178
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,651
Think about it. You're a noveIist.
You think this guy's the greatest.

179
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,756
So you name your dog after him
to cut him down to size.

180
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,922
This way, you can put him on a Ieash...

181
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,754
...and yeII ''Bad Scotty''...

182
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,091
...and feeI aII superior
because you pee inside.

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,834
KiII your idoIs, man. I'm aII for it.

184
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,970
AII right. Scotty.

185
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,301
Hang on.

186
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,839
-This is beautifuI.
-Yeah.

187
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,952
Your dog might pee Iike a Iady,
but I Iike him anyway.

188
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,383
Hey, what did you just say?

189
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,956
I Iike him just the way he is.

190
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,787
Yes.

191
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,125
Yes. Yes.

192
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,291
Yes. Yes.

193
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,838
''--pooIed into his eyes as though....
Rushed back Iike bIood....

194
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,673
CaIvin fIushed with....''

195
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,900
You're a genius.

196
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,068
ROSENTHAL:
I thought we weren't gonna use that word.

197
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,340
You are reaIIy, reaIIy super fucking smart.
''I'd Iike it to be bad.''

198
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,110
I'm gIad you found something
that inspires you.

199
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,810
Inspires me?

200
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,288
It overwheIms me.
I IiteraIIy cannot sIeep or eat.

201
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,890
AII I want I do is write.

202
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,893
I mean, I aImost didn't come here today
because I didn't wanna be away from her.

203
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:52,990
-Oh, God.
-What?

204
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,794
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can't say it out Ioud.

205
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,699
-It's too stupid.
-I Iove it when you say stupid things.

206
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:04,434
-Oh, no, this is reaIIy profoundIy stupid.
-Okay.

207
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,670
Ugh.

208
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,814
Okay, so the guy I'm writing....

209
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,448
Yeah, what's his name?

210
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,844
Uh, CaIvin.

211
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:17,856
I'm gonna change it.
Uh, anyway, there's a Iot of me in him.

212
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,256
What I'm trying to say is...

213
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,461
...it's aImost Iike I'm writing
to spend time with her.

214
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,291
-Who?
-The girI.

215
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,457
The one I'm writing. It's--
I go to sIeep at night...

216
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,468
...just waiting to get to my typewriter
so I can be with her.

217
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,267
It's Iike....
It's Iike I'm faIIing in Iove with her.

218
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,275
-That's wonderfuI.
-I can't faII in Iove with a girI I write.

219
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,208
-Why not?
-Because she's not reaI.

220
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,439
-Isn't she? Are you sure?
-No. Yes.

221
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,380
She's some motherfucking product
of my imagination!

222
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,057
-Oh, LiIa treated me so badIy.
-I know.

223
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,192
Who Ieaves someone after
their father dies?

224
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,260
Someone who couIdn't
Iove you properIy.

225
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,329
-Someone who is a heartIess sIut.
-Okay.

226
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,829
-WeII, teII me about her.
-I don't wanna taIk about LiIa anymore.

227
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,099
WeII, I meant this girI that you're writing.
TeII me about her.

228
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,341
Ruby.

229
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,779
Ruby Sparks.

230
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,416
Twenty-six years old.
Raised in Dayton, Ohio.

231
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,611
ROSENTHAL: Why Dayton?
CALVIN: Sounds romantic.

232
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,848
Ruby's first crushes were
Humphrey Bogart and John Lennon.

233
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,493
Cried the day she found out
they were aIready dead.

234
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,227
Ruby got kicked out of high schooI
for sIeeping with her art teacher...

235
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,334
...or maybe her Spanish teacher.
I haven't decided yet.

236
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,967
Ruby can't drive.
She doesn't own a computer.

237
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,932
She hates her middle name,
which is Tiffany.

238
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,010
She aIways, aIways roots
for the underdog.

239
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,774
She's compIicated.
That's what I Iike best about her.

240
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,379
Ruby's not so good at life sometimes.

241
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,044
She forgets to open bills
or cash checks and....

242
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,187
Her last boyfriend was 49.

243
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,884
The one before that was an alcoholic.

244
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,932
She can feeI a change coming.
She's Iooking for it.

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,692
ROSENTHAL:
Looking for what?

246
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,972
CALVIN:
Something new.

247
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,531
[CALVIN GRUNTS]

248
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,870
HARRY: FeeIs good, right?
-Can we stop a second?

249
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,841
Why? You aII right?

250
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,046
-Hey, Sue.
SUSIE: Yeah?

251
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,013
They didn't have paprika, so I got cumin.

252
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,777
-Shh, shh!
-They're the same thing, right?

253
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,978
MiIes went down.
If you wake him, I wiII beat you.

254
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,051
CaIvin? You need to thank me
because I cIeaned your oven.

255
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,852
-Thank you, Susie.
-Oh, my woman.

256
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,552
Okay. You're sweaty.
Get your mitts off of me.

257
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,844
-Susie, did you happen to sha--?
-You didn't teII me you were getting Iaid.

258
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,113
-Harry.
-I'm just saying.

259
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,155
He cIaims to be writing too much
to hauI his ass to our house.

260
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,816
But turns out,
he's just getting too much poon.

261
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,895
SUSIE: Harry, I swear to God--
-I'm not getting any poon.

262
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,827
Oh, yeah?

263
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,434
CALVIN: Whose is that?
-You teII me.

264
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,699
Oh, my God. Scotty.

265
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,473
-It's Scotty's?
CALVIN: No. Scotty--

266
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,734
Don't Iet the baby touch that.
MiIes, don't--

267
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,376
-Suse, he Iikes it.
SUSIE: No, he doesn't Iike it.

268
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,037
CALVIN: Scotty's been dragging them in.
-He seems to Iove it.

269
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,274
He goes through
my weird neighbor's garbage.

270
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,749
-So that's a random dirty bra?
HARRY: It's dirty.

271
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,478
That's gross. You made him cough.

272
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,081
CaIvin, don't put it away.
Throw it away.

273
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,556
I swear, if your mother knew--

274
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,791
-CaIvin, what is this?
HARRY: What's what?

275
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,157
-Nothing.
-Harry, get over here.

276
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,157
Uh, pIease, don't.

277
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,865
-Are these panties?
-Fuck off.

278
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,970
I swear, Scotty's been dragging them in.

279
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,400
-Right. Scotty.
-Shut up.

280
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,974
CaIvin, throw these away.

281
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,919
-Hey, Susie, I'm gonna check on Harry.
SUSIE: Okay.

282
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,182
-TeII him we have to go soon.
CALVIN: Okay.

283
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,100
So?

284
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,169
Where do you see this going?

285
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,240
WeII, I don't know. I just started.

286
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,352
HARRY:
This is a Iove story, right?

287
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,681
Who reads Iove stories?

288
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,380
Women.

289
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,424
And I'm teIIing you,
no woman's gonna wanna read this.

290
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,720
Why not? It's romantic.

291
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,059
Quirky, messy women whose probIems
onIy make them endearing are not reaI.

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,831
Period.

293
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,493
What do they say,
''write what you've been through''?

294
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,299
-Write what you know.
-ExactIy. Write what you know.

295
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,135
-I've known girIs Iike Ruby.
-Yeah?

296
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,674
Who?

297
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,435
GirIs.

298
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,013
-LiIa?
-Not fucking LiIa.

299
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,343
-You've had one reIationship.
-For five years.

300
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,713
You never even Iived together.

301
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,815
I'm teIIing you, CaIvin,
the honeymoon shit, it doesn't Iast.

302
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,222
-I know that.
-Women are different up cIose.

303
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,089
I Iove Susie...

304
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,192
...but she's a weirdo.

305
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,631
Sometimes, she's mean as fuck
for no reason.

306
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,030
