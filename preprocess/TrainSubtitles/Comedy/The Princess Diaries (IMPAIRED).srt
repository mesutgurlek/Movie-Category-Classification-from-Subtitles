Emotions running away with me

00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,760
-No!
-No!

489
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,028
MlA/ Guys,
l really appreciate this.

490
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,365
Thank you.

491
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,701
She's got her bathing suit off.

492
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:36,070
OK, now!

493
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,201
Princess, hi!

494
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:38,607
Aah!

495
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,045
REPORTER/ That was
the scream of Princess Mia.

496
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,241
Go away, aII of you, pIease!

497
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:45,477
HARBULA/
OK. Come here, Mia.

498
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:49,113
Piranhas, aII of you!
Back off!

499
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:54,923
HELEN/ My mom always told me
l couldn't cry...

500
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,087
and toId me to be a big girI...

501
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,121
but you've been hurt,
so you just cry.

502
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,792
[Crying]

503
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,269
It was reaIIy bad.

504
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:08,797
My foot didn't even pop.

505
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,206
SUKl/
lt was just last night...

506
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,177
that San Francisco's
own IittIe princess...

507
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:13,576
partied at the beach...

508
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,604
but what started out
as innocent fun...

509
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:19,345
soon turned into
allegedly too much fun.

510
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:22,479
This is Suki Sanchez
for KPFW.

511
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:25,652
PIease say something.

512
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,592
CLARlSSE/
Well, there's not much to say.

513
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:30,391
A picture's
worth a thousand words...

514
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,025
and you have two pictures.

515
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,865
I embarrassed the famiIy,
didn't I?

516
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:41,135
Not to put too fine
a point on it, yes, you did.

517
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,471
I think you're making
a wise decision...

518
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,534
to abstain from the job.

519
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:49,843
I suppose
I won't come to the baII.

520
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:51,679
CLARlSSE/
Of course you should come.

521
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:52,844
You're stiII famiIy.

522
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,512
Just because you don't
want to be our princess...

523
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:57,114
doesn't mean
we're sending you into exile.

524
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:58,555
Your mother's planning to come.

525
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,491
All your guests are invited.

526
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,653
Ex cept for your beach friends.

527
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:05,220
Now, if you'll ex cuse me...

528
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,858
I'm meeting with the press
to do some damage controI.

529
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,040
You can come in now.

530
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:25,275
If I may say so...

531
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,218
that did not go very weII.

532
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:30,313
Is this the way
a princess shouId act?

533
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:33,018
My information teIIs me
that boy was using her.

534
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,152
The kiss
was mereIy a device...

535
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:37,958
so that he couId get
his 15 minutes of fame.

536
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:39,487
And her friends
didn't heIp, either.

537
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,558
Anna, FaIana, Banana,
Bandana, Montana...

538
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,968
I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

539
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,868
Why didn't she have
enough common sense...

540
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,133
to deaI with this?

541
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,674
She's onIy 15...

542
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,711
but today,
she acted beyond her years.

543
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,305
She showed great respect...

544
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:56,975
and gracefuIIy accepted
your criticism.

545
00:22:57,016 --> 00:23:00,076
You're saying that as a queen,
I was too harsh on her.

546
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,747
I was criticaI of the person...

547
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,952
who couId become
the next ruIer of my country.

548
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:07,550
No. I'm saying,
as a grandmother...

549
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:11,188
you might have been too harsh
on your granddaughter.

550
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,562
[Sighs]

551
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,363
Do you think she can do it?

552
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,405
Oh, I have no doubts, ma'am.

553
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:22,771
I thought so, too.

554
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,807
What makes you different

555
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:31,442
Makes you beautiful

556
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,384
What's there inside you

557
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,820
Shines through to me

558
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:39,256
ln your eyes l see

559
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:43,058
All the love l'll ever need

560
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:44,926
BOY:
Hey, it's Mia ThermopoIips.

561
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:48,730
Can you autograph your picture?
Josh did.

562
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,963
Hey, there's Princess Pucker-up.

563
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:52,299
[BeII rings]

564
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,932
What makes you different
makes you beautiful

565
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,476
What's there inside you

566
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:01,207
Shines through to me

567
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,681
ln your eyes l see

568
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:06,116
All the love l'll ever need

569
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,619
LiIIy?

570
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:11,749
Hey, can I taIk to you
for a minute, pIease?

571
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,624
LiIIy, can I just
taIk to you for a minute?

572
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,925
-Is that cooI?
-Sure. Let's taIk.

573
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:20,125
But about what, hmm?

574
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,793
How you broke
my brother's heart...

575
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,927
or how you stuck me
with Jeremiah...

576
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,335
during my cabIe show doing...

577
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:27,668
''Pick a card, pick a card.''
Mwah mwah mwah!

578
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,900
I'm sorry, OK?

579
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,169
I forgot to caII you
and teII you...

580
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,267
that I couIdn't make it.

581
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,608
So I was stuck with
the Happy Houdini...

582
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,978
whiIe you make out
with the Yachting Yahoo.

583
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,846
Those are reaIIy
good aIIiterations.

584
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,079
No! I don't want to taIk
about aIIiterations!

585
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,849
LiIIy, I came up here
to teII you that I'm sorry!

586
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:45,119
I'm sorry I missed
your cabIe show...

587
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:48,456
and I'm just reaIIy sorry.

588
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:52,191
LILL Y: I can't beIieve
that you hung me up...

589
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,960
after aII I did for you.

590
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,230
I kept your royaI secret.

591
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,861
And do you know
how hard it is...

592
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,768
to have a cabIe show
and keep a secret?

593
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,363
You didn't keep it
a secret from me...

594
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,670
how jerky you thought
my being a princess was.

595
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,609
WeII, congratuIations.
You got your wish.

596
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,203
I'm not gonna be a princess.

597
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:08,440
You're not?

598
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,846
No.

599
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:13,249
But I want you to be.

600
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,220
What?

601
00:25:15,254 --> 00:25:17,085
[Sighs]

602
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:18,647
I didn't mean it.

603
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,251
The green monster
of jeaIousy came out...

604
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:23,489
because you were Miss PopuIar...

605
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,497
and l thought l was
losing my best friend...

606
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:29,433
so I got angry and upset
and hurt and...

607
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,958
I toId you!

608
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,028
I need an attitude adjustment.

609
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,938
But the truth is...

610
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:39,775
you being a princess
is kind of a miracIe.

611
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,439
Whoa! No!

612
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,311
What miracIe?

613
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:45,510
It's a nightmare!

614
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,746
No! Think about it!

615
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,687
I just found out
that my cabIe show...

616
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,314
onIy reaches 12 peopIe.

617
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:55,919
Wanting to rock the world,
but having zip power like me--

618
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:57,623
now, that's a nightmare.

619
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,927
But you--Wow!

620
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,934
I mean...

621
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:05,165
MIA: What is so ''Wow''?

622
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,706
Wow is having the power
to affect change...

623
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,004
make peopIe Iisten.

624
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,204
How many teenagers
have that power?

625
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:15,042
What more of a miracIe
do you want?

626
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,514
WeII...

627
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,383
we'II just have to find
a different miracIe.

628
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:23,684
Not more, just different.

629
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:27,624
Listen...

630
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,820
tomorrow night...

631
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:31,022
is the Genovian
Independence Day baII...

632
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:33,293
and to make up for
my missing your cabIe show...

633
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:35,266
I'm inviting you.

634
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,031
I hope you'II forgive me...

635
00:26:38,104 --> 00:26:41,733
and I hope you come.

636
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,676

Mmm! Yay!

638
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:56,021
I don't know, but it
doesn't reaIIy matter.

639
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,613
I'm just happy
that you're gonna come!

640
00:26:57,656 --> 00:27:00,022
LILL Y: Thanks.
And you can be a princess.

641
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,720
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:04,127
-Yes, you can.
-No, l can't.

Move in! Let's go!

Yes, Mom. I'II go to

today is my first official day
as Princess of Genovia.

and the people...

1129
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:22,369
before beginning
my royal duties.

1130
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:25,847
Mom is, of course,
moving to Genovia with me...

1131
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:29,182
and will continue painting--
without the balloons.

my Mustang brought over...

And Joseph? Well,
he's watching nearby as usual.

1138
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:48,334
Everybody's got
pre-coronation jitters...

1139
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:49,805
including me.

1140

Everybody, that is,
ex cept Fat Louie.

1141
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:55,777
He's totally adapted
to being a royal.
