1
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,237
Heads up! Good defence!

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,799
Good defence!

3
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,075
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,956
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,669
What do you want?

6
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,596
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. I have a package for you.

7
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,993
It sounds broken.

8
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,518
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

9
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,399
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,234
...we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,792
That's a lovely dog.

12
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,510
- Do you mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

13
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,552
Oh, brother!

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,716
That's fine. I can finish the rest.

15
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,396
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

16
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,271
Excuse me! HDS!

17
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,272
HDS! Coming through!

18
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,873
Got a package, people!

19
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,193
Get away from the door.

20
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,438
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

21
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,355
Son of a bitch!

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,429
That was a close one!

23
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,715
Unfortunately...

24
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,157
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

25
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,435
Hungry, fellow?

26
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,193
There you go.

27
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,677
No problem. It gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

28
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,792
Or we can try it now.

29
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,075
Puts!

30
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,315
Come on!

31
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,711
Get out! Get out!

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,272
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

33
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,869
Give me a push while you're back there.

34
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,831
Alrighty, then!

35
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,273
It's alive!

36
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,158
It's alive!

37
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,556
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

38
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,032
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

39
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,156
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
goanna hurt my baby, no he's not.

40
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,636
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,238
How can I ever repay you?

42
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,754
A reward would be good.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,879
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

44
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,158
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

45
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Gee! Let me think.

46
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,554
Sure.

47
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,473
People are real friendly around here.

48
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,718
Ventura!

49
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,279
Yes, Satan?

50
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,153
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

51
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,828
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

52
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,679
You owe me rent.

53
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,872
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

54
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,510
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

55
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,439
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

56
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,877
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

57
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,997
As soon as I find this bird...

58
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,116
...you're paid.

59
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,715
I heard animals in there.

60
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,633
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

61
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,796
I never bring my work home with me.

62
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,274
Oh, yeah?

63
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,199
What's all this pet food for?

64
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,996
Fibber.

65
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,791
Want to take a look inside? Come on!

66
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,669
Come on!

67
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,471
Go ahead. Snoop around!

68
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,149
Well?

69
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,038
Are you satisfied?

70
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,598
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

71
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,034
All right.

72
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,475
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

73
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,588
Loser!

74
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,352
Come to me, jungle friends.

75
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,673
Roger, let me ask you one question.

76
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,480
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

77
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,956
What?

78
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm sorry, I was just going to say...

79
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,239
...that it's not a fish. It's a mammal.

80
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,510
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

81
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,558
She didn't mean anything by that.

82
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,951
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

83
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,469
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

84
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,911
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

85
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,635
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

86
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,879
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

87
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,993
You know how superstitious
these players are.

88
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,519
I have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

89
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,673
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

90
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,514
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

91
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,310
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

92
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,993
Find the fish...

93
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,832
...or find new jobs!

94
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,833
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

95
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,873
I'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

96
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,752
Always out with their signs:

97
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,798
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

98
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,991
That fish lives better than they do.

99
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,671
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

100
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,031
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

101
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,998
...I hired a pet detective.

102
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,515
A what?

103
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,150
A pet detective.

104
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,353
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

105
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,676
Well, actually, he was quite good.

106
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,357
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

107
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,272
Like a glove!

108
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,116
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

109
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,109
Thanks, Martha.

110
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,833
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,268
Pleasure to meet you.

112
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,313
Any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,599
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,678
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

115
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,077
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll get right to the point.

116
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,196
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

117
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,555
Negative.

118
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,270
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

119
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,677
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

120
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,830
<i>Let's go.</i>

121
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,991
<i>Blue 42, blue 42!</i>

122
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,355
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

123
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,836
<i>All right!</i>

124
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,472
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

125
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,712
<i>Good boy!</i>

126
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,199
Would you like an ashtray?

127
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,034
I don't smoke.

128
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,271
It's a disgusting habit.

129
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,359
The police came today.

130
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,632
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a...

131
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,913
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

132
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,793
Roger, how you holding up?

133
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,875
If I'm walking funny it's because
I got two dozen reporters up my ass.

134
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,038
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

135
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,109
Who's he?

136
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,669
Roger Podcaster, meet Ace Ventura.

137
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,678
He's our pet detective.

138
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,558
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

139
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,119
Martha Mertz?

140
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,832
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

141
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,518
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when I found her.

142
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,034
Is that the tank?

143
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,994
Excuse me.

144
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,909
- Cops drain it?
- Yes, this morning.

145
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,796
If I'm not back in five minutes...

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,439
...just wait longer.

147
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,670
Captain's log, star date 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

148
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,875
We've travelled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

149
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,190
So far...

150
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,518
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it.

151
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,837
If I have to tear another black hole,
I'm going to find it!

152
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,476
I've got to, mister!

153
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,312
Oh, great!

154
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,439
I'll try to head them off.

155
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,557
Ace, get out of the tank.

156
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,352
I just can't do it, captain!

157
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,431
I don't have the power!

158
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,035
People!

159
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,510
I said, get out of the tank now!

160
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,235
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man!

161
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,833
Where's Snowflake?

162
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,918
Snowflake is not available right now.

163
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,398
Roger, I've been waiting all day.
I got to get a shot of his new trick!

164
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,073
What, is he sick?

165
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,433
People, people!

166
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,952
Lassie must be missing.

167
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,959
Make any good collars lately?

168
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,838
Or were they leashes?

169
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,752
Homicide, Ventura.

170
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,190
How are you goanna solve that one?

171
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,356
Good question, Aguado!

172
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,953
First, I'd establish a motive.

173
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,716
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

174
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,474
Then I'd lose 30 pounds
parking his wife!

175
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,834
Come on!

176
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,633
Now, kiss and make up!

177
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,989
Excuse me.

178
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,629
I'd like to ass you a few questions.

179
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,598
This is not the time, Ace.

180
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,231
If Einkorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

181
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,396
I can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

182
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,916
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

183
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,357
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

184
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,909
Five minutes alone, that's all I need!

185
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,799
Better look alive.
Einkorn’s on her way down.

186
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,438
Come on, now. Ace, please.

187
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,639
What's that matter?
Afraid I'll make a stink? Come on!

188
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,996
Aguado's working the case, all right?

189
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,389
Aguado!

190
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,754
Good call!

191
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,996
We're just a little busy now...

192
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,909
...with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

193
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,993
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

194
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,358
Now you've pissed him off.

195
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,592
- Would you give me a break?
- I can't hold him much longer!

196
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,795
My boss is coming!

197
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,798
Okay, look.

198
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,634
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

199
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,839
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

200
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,152
<i>So far, nothing, nothing', nada.
All right?</i>

201
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,553
Any unusual bets being made?

202
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,711
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

203
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,434
- What'd you find out about the tank?
- Nothing.

204
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,757
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

205
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,393
- That's it?
- I swear.

206
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,717
Now will you please get out of here
before I get in trouble?

207
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,672
Thank you for your cooperation.

208
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,754
By the way, do you have a mint?

209
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,111
Perhaps some Binaca?

210
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,428
<i>Assholomio</i>

211
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,396
<i>Osadomia</i>

212
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,711
Holy testicle Tuesday!

213
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,914
What the hell is he doing here?

214
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,673
I came to confess.

215
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,277
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

216
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,238
Spare me the routine. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

217
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,235
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

218
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,590
We'll find the porpoise.

219
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,879
Now I feel better.

220
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,076
Of course, that might not do any good.

221
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,670
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
It's a dolphin that's been taken.

222
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,480
The common harbour
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

223
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,593
...while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncates...

224
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,112
...has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

225
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,954
But I'm sure you already knew that.

226
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,430
That's what turns me on about you.

227
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,193
Your attention to detail.

228
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,672
Listen, pet dick...

229
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,710
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

230
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,876
Well, I'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

231
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,991
But thank you for asking.

232
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,271
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

233
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,799
Your number still 911?

234
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,792
Alrighty, then!

235
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,550
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

236
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,669
Thank you!

237
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,432
What's the password?

238
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,148
New England clam chowder.

239
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
Is that the red or the white?

240
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,232
I can never remember that!

241
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,315
White?

242
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,236
Hey, Woodstock!

243
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,590
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

244
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,150
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

245
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,355
Do you?

246
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,749
Don't I?

247
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,636
So what are you up to?

248
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,314
Just watching the fishiest.

249
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,592
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

250
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,511
I'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

251
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,871
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

252
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,832
...before they find any whales.

253
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,471
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

254
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,994
Of course I can. Why?

255
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,310
I want to trace the sale of equipment...

256
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,358
...for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

257
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,558
Come on, I thought you had
a challenge for me.

258
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,356
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank...

259
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,510
Wait a minute. Look here.

260
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,471
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

261
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,518
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

262
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,069
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

263
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,949
Really?

264
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,112
That is the face of the enemy.

265
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,951
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

266
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,635
Hold on.

267
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,637
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

268
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,350
That sub genius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

269
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,549
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

270
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,316
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

271
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,515
I'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

272
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,555
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

273
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,196
If you do anything to embarrass me...

274
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,237
What? Like this?

275
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,958
Hi, Captain Stubbing.

276
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,713
How are Gopher and Doc?

277
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,311
Permission to come aboard, sir.

278
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,599
I'm sorry, ladies.

279
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,193
Glad you could make it.

280
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,879
Thank you.

281
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,389
You look wonderful.

282
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,198
And who is he, a friend?

283
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,200
No, this is...
This is my date.

284
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,638
He's a lawyer.

285
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,872
Does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

286
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,551
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...

287
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,393
Tom Ace.

288
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,713
Pleasure to meet you.

289
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,831
Congratulations on all your success.

290
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,513
You smell terrific!

291
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,554
One of the first lessons we learned...

292
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,829
...back at...

293
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,995
...Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

294
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,431
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

295
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,834
...with little else.

296
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,951
How is everybody feeling tonight?

297
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,631
Very, very well, thank you.

298
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,635
Look, honey...

299
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,552
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

300
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,990
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

301
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,476
What are you trying to do?

302
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,917
Will you keep him occupied
while I work my magic, please?

303
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,118
Smooshy, isn't it?

304
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,278
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

305
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,753
Excuse me, Ron...

306
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,911
...I need to use the bathroom.

307
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,276
I think it's the pâté.

308
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,158
Sure, it's over there.

309
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,919
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

310
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,475
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

311
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,709
Gravy!

312
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,792
Don't worry, Snowflake.

313
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,678
Ace Ventura's here.

314
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,108
Yummy!

315
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,788
Snowflake!

316
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,833
Here, Snowflake.

317
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,031
I've got a snack for you.

318
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,592
They're wonderful, aren't they?

319
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,191
Yes, they certainly are.

320
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,116
No matter what's going on in my life...

321
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,316
...I can always watch them swim...

322
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,870
...and be totally at peace.

323
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,513
It's not Snowflake!

324
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,878
It's not Snowflake!

325
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,880
It's not Snowflake!

326
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,911
Are you sure your date is all right?

327
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,957
It's been an awfully long time.

328
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,474
Who, Tom?

329
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,870
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

330
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,071
Do not go in there!

331
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,909
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

332
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,073
Do that! If I'd been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

333
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,356
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

334
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,359
What're you doing?

335
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,033
I'm sorry, Ron.

336
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,554
What's he doing?

337
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,119
Let's go!

338
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,799
Stop it!

339
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,872
I don't even want to know
why your pants are missing!

340
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,838
You could've cost me my job!

341
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,956
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

342
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,270
I found it in the filter, thank you.

343
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,798
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

344
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,038
What're you talking about?

345
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,352
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

346
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,631
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

347
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,189
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

348
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,278
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

349
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,277
Ring? What ring?

350
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,037
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

351
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,514
I find the ring with a missing stone,
I find Snowflake.

352
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,312
How you goanna do that?

353
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,554
Simple.

354
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,436
Loser!

355
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,790
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

356
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,948
You want to play?

357
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,708
Damn it!

358
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,271
That stone could've come from anywhere.

359
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,112
It could've come from...

360
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,193
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

361
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,553
It came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

362
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,156
Einkorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

363
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,351
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

364
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,516
Over half a million members worldwide?

365
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,551
No. Who are they?

366
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,389
Did you know...

367
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,758
...they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

368
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,439
What do you feed your dog?

369
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,076
Dog food. Why?

370
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,679
He is miserable!

371
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,553
What are you talking about?

372
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,594
He's very unhappy. I feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

373
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,831
It's amazing he's still alive.

374
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,832
You're just mad because you’re stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

375
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,393
You can't express anger.

376
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,111
Yeah? And you're ugly.

377
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,798
I'm not even goanna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

378
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,797
Why? So you can beat him?

379
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,029
Fatty!

380
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,159
You're unbelievable!

381
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,550
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

382
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,513
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

383
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,759
You like her, huh?

384
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,198
Yeah, she's all right.

385
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,351
Look, Melissa, I...

386
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,919
I'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

387
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,675
...where Roger Podcaster, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

388
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,911
...has apparently committed suicide...

389
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,789
...allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony...

390
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,879
You okay?

391
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,595
I told you. I was in my apartment...

392
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,949
...across the hall.

393
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,238
I heard a scream...

394
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,357
...so I called the manager.

395
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,111
The place was empty, except for the dog.

396
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,754
I opened the balcony door
and looked out...

397
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,030
...splat, bang, pancake time.

398
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,271
Okay, thank you very much.

399
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,679
Hi there, fella.

400
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,273
Have a bad night?

401
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,835
So...

402
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,191
...animals can sense evil.

403
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,192
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

404
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,829
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

405
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,756
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

406
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,350
Face it...

407
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,551
Forget it. She's right.

408
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,755
Besides...

409
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,312
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

410
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,514
So...

411
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,389
...you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

412
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,078
I wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

413
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,471
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

414
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,310
May I tell you what I think happened?

415
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,879
Alrighty, then!

416
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,595
Roger Podcaster went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

417
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,469
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

418
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,148
...and he was thrown over that balcony.

419
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,749
Roger Podcaster didn't commit suicide.

420
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,678
He was murdered.

421
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,555
That's a very entertaining story...

422
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,839
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

423
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,553
...evidence.

424
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,791
I think I heard a toilet flush.

425
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,235
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

426
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,159
Well, I...

427
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,990
I guess I'm out of my league here.

428
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,553
Good work.

429
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,349
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

430
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,953
This woman is Roger Podcaster’s neighbour.

431
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,395
She said she heard a scream. Right?

432
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,478
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

433
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,076
- That's true.
- You're sure you had to open this door?

434
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,275
I'm certain.

435
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,431
What's the point, Ventura?

436
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,951
Only this.

437
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,391
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

438
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,076
...she could have heard
Podcaster scream on the way down.

439
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,550
The scream she heard
came from inside...

440
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,476
...before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

441
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,431
Can you feel that, buddy?

442
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,513
I have exorcized the demons!

443
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,034
This house is clear.

444
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,958
- Losers.
- Get him out of here!

445
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,557
- Losers! Losers!
- Let's go, Ace.

446
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,389
Losers.

447
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,835
Come on.

448
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,758
Back to the zoo.

449
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,313
What are you thinking?

450
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,275
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

451
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,269
I want to find that other ring.

452
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,190
Ace, you checked all the rings.

453
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,510
Receipts? What about receipts?

454
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,352
There's got to be receipts.

455
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,311
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

456
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,632
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,559
I was there.

458
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,269
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

459
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,351
I don't do humans.

460
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,118
You really love animals.

461
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,478
If it gets cold enough.

462
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,834
No, I have a kinship with them.

463
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,513
I understand them.

464
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,271
Want to hear something spooky?

465
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,674
Sure.

466
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,432
One time when I was about 12, I had
a dream that I was being followed by...

467
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,398
...a big dog with rabies.

468
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,471
He had these bloodshot eyes...

469
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,432
...and foam came out of his mouth.

470
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,550
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

471
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,439
Then just before I got
to my front door...

472
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,149
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

473
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,917
That's when I woke up...

474
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,118
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

475
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,514
Bastard!

476
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,360
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

477
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,832
Want to know why I do this?

478
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,712
I'm not sure anymore.

479
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,353
You better be sure...

480
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,429
...because once you get
inside my head...

481
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,312
...there's no turning back.

482
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,395
So...

483
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,436
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

484
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,671
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

485
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,478
Who the hell is that?

486
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,074
What?

487
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,188
That.

488
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,671
Who the hell is that?

489
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,596
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

490
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,992
Why isn't he in this picture?

491
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,910
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

492
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,516
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

493
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,318
Cost the Dolphins the game.

494
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,870
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

495
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,314
Definitely.

496
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,273
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

497
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,114
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

498
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,551
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

499
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,514
"The kick heard round the world."

500
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,991
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

501
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,760
Poor guy.

502
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,155
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

503
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,999
Where is he now?

504
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,312
I heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

505
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,630
Really?

506
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,790
You're goanna drop me off before you go?

507
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,274
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

508
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,988
It might not be safe at your apartment.

509
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,432
What do you suggest?

510
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,519
Oh, my God!

511
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,958
Oh, my God.

512
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,112
Three times?

513
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,274
I'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

514
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,712
I must be tired.

515
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,752
Okay, I'm ready again.

516
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,591
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

517
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,517
...and a clean pair of shorts.

518
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,518
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

519
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,512
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

520
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,355
Stetson University honours graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

521
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,113
Most points and distance.

522
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,073
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

523
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,033
And one hell of a model American.

524
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,239
<i>Are you another one of them
Hard Copy guys?</i>

525
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,469
No, sir.

526
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,113
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

527
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,950
This is my Graceland, sir.

528
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,751
Will you put that gun down?

529
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,232
The boy is a fan of our son.

530
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,072
So nice to meet you.

531
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,719
I'm Ray's mother...

532
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,598
...and this is Ray's father.

533
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,032
It's a real honour!

534
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,473
It's an honour to have you here.

535
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,878
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

536
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,509
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

537
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,830
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

538
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,594
Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

539
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,397
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

540
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,238
Yummy!

541
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,350
Ray Finkle's house.

542
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,198
I can't wait to meet him.

543
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,870
Ray ain't coming home.

544
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,596
But your wife expects him any minute.

545
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,360
She expects him home any minute.

546
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,989
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

547
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,509
Eight years ago...

548
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,673
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

549
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,633
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

550
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,350
It was all that Dan Marino's fault.
Everyone knows that.

551
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,752
If he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

552
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,275
...Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

553
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,639
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhoea and rot in hell.

554
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,791
Would you like a cookie, son?

555
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,833
What do you know?

556
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,157
They're little footballs.

557
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,679
Laces out.

558
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,879
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

559
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,350
...he'll never even know he was gone.

560
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,353
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

561
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,234
Oh, boy!

562
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,155
What a sports nut, huh?

563
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,390
May I?

564
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,596
Oh, yes, by all means.

565
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,151
<i>Five seconds to go here
in Super Bowl 17.</i>

566
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,118
<i>Dolphins trailing the 49ers...</i>

567
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,949
<i>... by one. This will
win the game for Miami.</i>

568
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,792
<i>There's the snap.</i>

569
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,189
<i>Marino holds.</i>

570
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,555
<i>The kick...</i>

571
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,151
<i>... and it's high. No, it's...</i>

572
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,236
<i>... no good.</i>

573
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,234
<i>Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!</i>

574
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,277
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

575
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,152
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>

576
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,399
<i>The Dolphins lose!
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!</i>

577
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,269
<i>- Melissa, it's Ace!
- Where are you?</i>

578
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,956
I'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

579
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,315
Why?

580
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,557
He's about to join Snowflake.
I've got to know where he is!

581
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,833
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

582
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,998
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

583
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,117
Ace, what's going on?

584
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,155
Thought I left?

585
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,838
I'm really goanna go this time.

586
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,230
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

587
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,310
Action!

588
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,439
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

589
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,352
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

590
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,228
...with Isotoner gloves!

591
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,311
Cut! Again from the top.

592
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,555
I said, cut!

593
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,028
Guys, it's a cut!

594
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,515
What the hell are they doing?

595
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,318
That's a cut!

596
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,634
- What is this, a rewrite?
- Shut up!

597
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,279
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!

598
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,475
Let's go!

599
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,793
Excuse me, gentlemen!

600
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,109
Pet detective!

601
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,395
Come on!

602
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,828
What's wrong?

603
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,473
Can't you hit me?

604
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,677
Have there been ransom demands?

605
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,275
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

606
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,357
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

607
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,033
The game is on as scheduled.

608
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,111
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

609
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,232
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

610
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,274
- Are the crimes related?
- I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

611
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,351
Now, if you'll excuse me...

612
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,430
Get me the autopsy on Podcaster!

613
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,399
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

614
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,108
And somebody get me some coffee!

615
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,069
<i>Tonight on Miami Vice,
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!</i>

616
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,308
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

617
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,876
Is it number one or number two?

618
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,276
I just want to know how much time I have.

619
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,118
By the way,
I went ahead and solved that...

620
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,193
...pesky Snowflake-Podcaster-
Marino thing.

621
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,395
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

622
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,678
All right, Ventura...

623
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,029
...make it quick.

624
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,392
I found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

625
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,200
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

626
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,432
It would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

627
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,551
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

628
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,237
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room.

629
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,590
Cosy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

630
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,635
So how does Roger Podcaster fit in?

631
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,631
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podcaster recognized him. End of story.

632
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,311
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

633
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,272
Finkle took it personally.

634
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,238
So where is Finkle now?

635
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,718
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

636
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,520
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

637
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,517
The time when it'd hurt them most:

638
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,790
Super Bowl time.

639
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,315
Man, I'm tired of being right!

640
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,078
Congratulations.

641
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,959
You've done some fine detective work...

642
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,909
...Ace.

643
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,034
I'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

644
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,316
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

645
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,277
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

646
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,674
Your gun is digging into my hip.

647
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,319
What's wrong?

648
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,915
Want me to read you your rights?

649
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,398
Maybe later.

650
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,509
What is it?

651
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,273
That bony little bitch...

652
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,158
...Melissa Robinson?

653
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,831
You just don't do anything for me.

654
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,434
Down, boy!

655
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,034
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

656
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,993
Fine, sergeant.

657
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,032
You want me to throw him out?

658
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,229
Why don't you throw yourself out?

659
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,388
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,273
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

661
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,637
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

662
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,472
When we find Marino...

663
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,676
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

664
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,911
When I find Snowflake...

665
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,998
...I'll deliver Marino.

666
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,789
Melissa, it's Ace!

667
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,793
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

668
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,431
You have to commit me.

669
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,870
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

670
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,270
They aren't goanna let us look around.

671
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,555
I know.

672
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,519
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

673
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,749
Mrs. Robinson...

674
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,036
...I'm Dr. Handily.

675
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,589
Now who is it you want us to look at?

676
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,034
My brother...

677
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,789
...Larry.

678
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,234
I'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

679
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,273
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

680
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,198
Just got to stay positive.

681
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,317
I'm goanna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

682
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,428
Let's see that...

683
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,238
...in an instant replay.

684
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,111
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

685
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,954
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're very sensitive...

686
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,555
...to the stress athletes
have to endure.

687
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,677
I'm open! I'm open!

688
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,118
I'm open!

689
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,309
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

690
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,630
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

691
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,393
Over here!

692
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,158
351!

693
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,318
351!

694
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,437
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

695
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,393
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

696
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,871
Has he had a history of mental illness?

697
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,998
As long as I've known him.

698
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,354
This is one of our therapy rooms.

699
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,476
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

700
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,474
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...

701
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,153
Halftime!

702
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,314
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

703
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,070
I'll show you the dormitories, then.

704
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,558
Isotoners.

705
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,390
Obsess much?

706
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,518
Where are you going?

707
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,638
- To clean the storage room.
- No, clean the cafeteria.

708
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,831
I don't tell you how to do your job.

709
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,638
The schedule says...

710
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,189
...clean the cafeteria.
- I know what I'm doing.

711
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,634
You should've done it earlier.

712
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,997
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
I'm cleaning in here!

713
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,191
You take breaks too long. You smoke...

714
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,590
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

715
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,829
"Search called off for missing hiker."

716
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,869
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

717
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,556
...were unable to find the body
of Lois Einkorn."

718
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,190
A hiker missing since Friday?

719
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,953
Lois Einkorn?

720
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,794
Holy shitballs!

721
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,679
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

722
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,868
"Love, Roger"?

723
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,274
<i>Ace, it's E.</i>

724
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,472
<i>You think the article you found
was something?</i>

725
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,109
<i>I got a note from Roger to Einkorn...</i>

726
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,590
<i>... thanking her for a wonderful evening.</i>

727
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,308
<i>Something ain't stirring
the Kool-Aid, man.</i>

728
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,357
Wiggles, rewind.

729
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,591
What the hell does Lois Einkorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

730
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,833
Come on, think!

731
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,077
Finkle and Einkorn, in it together.
How? Why?

732
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,399
All right! Here we go.

733
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,712
Answer's right there!
Just got to get blood to the brain!

734
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,840
Finkle and Einkorn! Finkle and Einkorn!

735
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,315
Finkle and Einkorn! Finkle and Einkorn!

736
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,154
Quitter!

737
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,071
What do you want?

738
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,994
I don't have any food for you.

739
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,000
I have to have money to buy food.

740
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,471
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

741
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,794
Let's face it...

742
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,996
...your master is a loser.

743
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,277
What the?

744
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,991
That's it.

745
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,559
That's it!

746
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,229
Einkorn is Finkle.

747
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,755
Finkle is Einkorn!

748
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,315
Einkorn is a man!

749
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,671
Oh, my God!

750
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,548
Einkorn is a man!

751
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,115
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

752
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,359
God!

753
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,271
<i>And the big story in this
Super Bowl game is the abduction...</i>

754
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,438
<i>... of Miami's starting quarterback,
Dan Marino.</i>

755
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,672
<i>It's got to be a strain
on this Miami team, Bob...</i>

756
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,796
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

757
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,675
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

758
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,115
A magical afternoon...

759
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,630
...where dreams are made...

760
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,113
...and crushed.

761
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,796
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

762
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,716
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

763
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,990
...met someplace before?

764
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,868
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

765
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,430
<i>Now the coin toss.</i>

766
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,354
Kickoff time.

767
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,878
My favourite thing.

768
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,759
Laces out!

769
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,596
I made some refreshments, Dan.

770
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,229
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

771
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,311
I'll be right back, Dan.

772
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,233
I don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but I'll double it.

773
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,552
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

774
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,397
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

775
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,238
Check it out, Marino.

776
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,670
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

777
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,476
Damn!

778
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,398
Go get some more fish!

779
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,199
I'm goanna kill that dolphin.

780
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,998
Lovely party.

781
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,912
Pity I wasn't invited.

782
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,911
Where the hell's the smelt?

783
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,431
Unconscious. Exactly as I planned.

784
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,239
What the hell was that?

785
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,955
Shit!

786
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,358
What happened? What's going on?

787
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,510
You okay?

788
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,029
Guess what?

789
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,429
It's naptime!

790
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,399
<i>What a hit!</i>

791
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,474
Heads up!

792
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,629
Who are you?

793
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,116
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

794
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,918
The quarterback sneak.

795
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,756
Penalty!

796
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,999
Too many men on the field.

797
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,511
I warned you, Ventura.

798
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,673
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

799
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,598
Good question.

800
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:54,472
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumour.

801
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,310
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einkorn.

802
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,155
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

803
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,709
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

804
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,708
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

805
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,277
<i>Code 11 in progress,
343 Victorville Road...</i>

806
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,033
<i>... at the Palmdale basin.</i>

807
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,391
<i>Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura...</i>

808
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,108
<i>... should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

809
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,360
It's Ace. We got to break out of here.

810
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,154
Is he in trouble?

811
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,709
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

812
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,076
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

813
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,875
Don't kill me!

814
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,038
Please!

815
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,675
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

816
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,150
- He's who you want! Kill him!
- Kill him!

817
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,039
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

818
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,793
Come on, look at him!

819
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,234
- Cry baby!
- Jock!

820
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,356
- Wimp.
- Muscle head.

821
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,033
Shut up!

822
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,478
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

823
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,758
<i>And there's the snap.</i>

824
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,836
<i>The kick!</i>

825
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,036
<i>And it's good!</i>

826
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,038
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

827
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,032
What would you know about pressure?

828
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,754
Well, I have kissed a man.

829
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,872
<i>Of course, there's never been
a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...</i>

830
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,310
<i>... than the "kick
heard around the world."</i>

831
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,669
<i>I mean, it's clear to me that it was
a good hold. Finkle just booted it.</i>

832
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,153
The laces were in!

833
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,158
They were in!

834
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,158
You like that?

835
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,515
You like that?

836
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,597
And that! And that!

837
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,995
Having a little trouble with the lady?

838
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,799
You don't understand...

839
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,189
...she's a...

840
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,911
Get him, Lois! Get him!

841
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,033
Get him!

842
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,429
Shoot him!

843
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,356
- Shoot him!
- Hold your fire!

844
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,195
Don't shoot!

845
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,550
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

846
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,719
I mean it!

847
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,276
She's not joking!

848
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,959
He kidnapped Snowflake!

849
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,591
He killed Roger Podcaster and was about
to kill Marino and me!

850
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,749
Fiction can be fun!

851
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,798
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

852
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,359
For instance...

853
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,794
...if you look up...

854
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,318
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

855
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,116
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

856
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,797
...who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

857
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,235
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

858
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,631
...only to escape and join the police...

859
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,952
...in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

860
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,236
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

861
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,312
What are you talking about?

862
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,513
She's not Lois Einkorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

863
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,755
He's lying!

864
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,228
Shoot him!

865
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,238
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

866
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:57,314
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

867
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,071
Boy, that's really on there!

868
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,238
But tell me this:

869
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,953
Would a real woman...

870
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,316
...be missing these?

871
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,313
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

872
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,592
But I doubt very much...

873
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,669
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

874
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,194
...to get rid of...

875
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,429
...big old...

876
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,198
...Mr. Knish!

877
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,153
Oh, boy!

878
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,235
Come here.

879
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,759
Would you excuse me for just one second?

880
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,358
Ladies and gentlemen...

881
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,719
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

882
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,551
...brought new evidence to my attention.

883
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,755
Now...

884
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,829
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

885
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,799
...criminal investigator can be wrong.

886
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,996
But if I am mistaken...

887
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,198
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

888
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,635
...as she claims to be...

889
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,995
...then, my friend...

890
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,631
...she is suffering from the worst case
of haemorrhoids I have ever seen!

891
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,315
That's why Roger Podcaster is dead!

892
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,875
He found Captain Winkie!

893
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,795
Good night!

894
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,390
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

895
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,151
Die, animal boy!

896
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,194
Quick decision.

897
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,799
Loser!

898
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,834
You have any more gum?

899
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,198
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

900
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,474
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

901
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,235
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:58,675
<i>... returning for the second half,
the Dolphins' most valuable player...</i>

909

<i>... Dan Marino!</i>

910
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,356
Idiot!

911
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:52,110
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

912
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,231
Yeah? Blow me!

913
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,154
Really?

<i>The National Football League...</i>
