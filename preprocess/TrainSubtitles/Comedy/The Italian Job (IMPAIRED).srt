If it's the Bank of England, it's out.

Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy of the country.

184
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:44,886
Exactly, Freddie.
Now, tell Bridger this is a foreign job

of payments.

that Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

- Well, I've apologised, Bridger.
- And so you should have.

- I'm interested in his scheme.
- But, Mr Bridger...

304
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:34,924
What you fail to realise is, Freddie,
that we have a new objective.

305
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:40,054
The Chinese are giving Fiat
$4 million in gold

306
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,850
as a down payment on a car plant
they're constructing near Peking.

307
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:46,477
- But Croker...
- Croker can handle it.

308
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:48,271
He's got everything going for him.

309
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:51,899
There's even a football match in Turin
the day before the delivery.

310
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:53,901
England versus Italy.

311
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:55,820
So there'll be enough
English supporters wandering about

312
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:59,574
to cover his movements,
and even to help him, if required.

313
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:04,744
There's only one snag.
We need an expert in computers,

314
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,663
someone to look after the technical end.

315
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:09,291
Well, the top man in the country
is Professor Peach.

316
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,293
I've seen him on television.

317
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,254
- Tell Croker to get him.
- But how?

318
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,256
Maybe the Professor's not bent.

319
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:21,428
Camp Freddie,
everybody in the world is bent.

320
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:24,973
Yes, well, my brother's no longer
with us, I'm afraid.

321
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:27,767
No.

322
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:34,232
- You mean, he's...
- No, no, no. Nothing like that.

323
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:38,779
Well, actually, he's in a home.

324
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:42,699
Yes. Well, we thought it best.
For his own good, you know?

325
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,703
Was it serious, Miss Peach?

326
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:49,956
- Pam.
- Serious, was it?

327
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,293
- What?
- CHARLIE: Your brother. In the home.

328
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:56,338
Yes, I'm afraid
it was quite serious, dear.

329
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:59,966
- Isn't this greenfly awful?
- Yes.

330
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:04,805
Yes, well,
not to put a too fine point to it,

331
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,141
he was discovered in the lounge.

332
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:14,356
- Doing what, Miss Peach?
- Where?

333
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:18,819
- In the lounge.
- Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

334
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:20,654
What?

335
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:21,863
Oh!

336
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:24,825
Something quite obscene with Annette.

337
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:34,835
- A net?
- Annette. She was terrified, of course.

338
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,420
- Naturally.
- Yes, well. Would you like some tea?

339
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,383
Tea. Would you like some?

340
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,427
- You're very kind. Yes, please.
- Good.

341
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,513
Excuse me a minute.

342
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,183
Annette?

343
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:55,937
Annette, would you like to serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

344
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:02,402
Oh, I shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

345
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:10,326
This is Annette.

346
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,124
Professor Peach,
do you see what I'm getting at?

347
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:20,295
Hmm. Your brawn, my brain.
I'm not stupid, you know.

348
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:25,592
It's cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

349
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:28,887
- Flagpole?
- The flagpole in the yard.

350
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:33,725
I mean, I know
if there was a convex mirror up there,

351
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,604
27 degrees vertical,
42 degrees horizontal,

352
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:40,523
I could see
straight into Matron's bedroom.

353
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,735
Of course, somebody else
would have to be up the pole to fix it.

354
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,570
I couldn't do it meself.

355
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,656
It's cooperation, you see?
She's a big woman, you know?

356
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:52,243
Here, wait till you see them Italian birds.

357
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,246
- Are they big? I like them big.
- They're enormous.

358
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,208
- Really?
- Very, very, very big.

359
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,377
Would we wear stockings
over our heads?

360
00:31:01,586 --> 00:31:04,547
- No need for you to.
- I'd like that.

361
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,884
I could steal one of Matron's, couldn't I?

362
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,386
We'll have you out of here in no time.

363
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,764
Of course, I wouldn't want
to get Matron into trouble.

364
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,558
Not that way, anyway. She's big. Big.

365
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:18,727
Look out the window, Professor.

366
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,729
- Do what?
- Look out the window at my car.

367
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,439
- Come on.
- Car?

368
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,108
- What car?
- Down there.

369
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,987
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING)

370
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,874
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

371
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:46,547
We are about to do a job in Italy,

372
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,298
and I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

373
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,925
And I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

374
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,929
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

375
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:57,933
Now, you all know Bill.
He's just done three years in Parkhurst.

376
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:01,270
He's as honest as the day is long,
and you can trust him.

377
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:05,399
Second, the getaway.
This will be done in three Mini Coopers.

378
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:10,529
And they will be driven by Chris,
Tony and Dominic.

379
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:11,947
Hello, chaps.

380
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:13,282
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:15,284
All right, all right, all right, all right.

382
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,161
These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

383
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,955
faster than anyone else on four wheels.

384
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,166
Remember that.

385
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,127
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

386
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,422
The coach will be driven
by William here,

387
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,634
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

388
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,388
Now we come to the professor here.

389
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:42,477
The professor is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

390
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:47,148
So I don't want anyone putting him down
because he's a man of reading.

391
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:52,945
I know he's got some very funny habits,
but make him feel at home.

392
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,782
He's very important to the operation.

393
00:32:55,907 --> 00:33:01,204
Finally, and very quickly, I would like
to introduce you to all the lads

394
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,247
who are going to do the job with me.

395
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:10,254
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco, Yellow,

396
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:14,258
Camp Freddie you all know.

397
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:20,765
Roger, Dave and Lorna
will be in reserve with three fast cars

398
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,725
in case anything goes wrong.

399
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,935
Right?

400
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,021
Now, it's a very difficult job

401
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:32,526
and the only way to get through it is,
we all work together as a team.

402
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:36,363
And that means you do everything I say.

403
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:42,119
Here's Charlie.

404
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,080
Charlie.

405
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:52,379
Putting the jib on.

406
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,339
Well,
don't just stand there doing nothing.

407
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:56,174
- Get on with something.
- I am, Charlie. I'm seeing...

408
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,051
Well, get on with it, then.

409
00:33:58,552 --> 00:33:59,553
Rozzer?

410
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:01,096
Rozzer's having trouble
with his differential there.

411
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,640
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Hurry up.

412
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,978
Dippers for the Continent.
Just changing the...

413
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:09,104
- The other way round.
- Right.

414
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:10,939
- Are they quartz-iodide?
- Yeah, that's right, governor.

415
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:12,399
All right.

416
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,819
We couldn't afford the gold yet,
so we're using lead, Charlie.

417
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:17,737
Will it take the weight?

418
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,865
- Take the weight.
- Yeah, all right, Charlie.

419
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,826
- Will it take the weight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Charlie.

420
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,786
Mind your face, Charles.

421
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:28,248
- How you doing? All right?
- Okay, but I don't like the colour.

422
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:31,917
It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Carry on.

423
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,087
CHARLIE: Lorna!

424
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,637
Does he really need all this equipment?

425
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,139
He says he does.

426
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:00,780
No.

427
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:04,033
You're meant to use your brakes, Chris.

428
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,410
Terribly sorry, Charles.

429
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:10,581
- How many cars have we got left, Bill?
- A couple, Charlie.

430
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,958
Send the next one up.
Let's hope he gets it right.

431
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,252
(BILL WHISTLING)

432
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:35,563
What do you mean they're written off?

433
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:39,609
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
I promise there'll be no more.

434
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:45,490
Five, four, three,

435
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:49,369
two, one, go.

436
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:04,175
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

437
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,327
How's your new house, Fred?

438
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:34,456
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

439
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,333
My pleasure.

440
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:04,402
<i>Beckerman's done his homework
very well.</i>

441
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,989
<i>The getaway is possible, but not easy.</i>

442
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:11,743
<i>For a start, the attack has to be made
in this square</i>

443
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:17,081
<i>and it must be completed
inside of three minutes.</i>

444
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,584
<i>Apart from knocking over
a few old dears with their carrycots,</i>

445
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:20,710
<i>I think we can manage it.</i>

446
00:37:21,294 --> 00:37:24,339
Now, you all understand
what you've got to do.

447
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,508
Okay? Now, Bill.

448
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:30,886
Uh...

449
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:34,932
Oh, yeah, the transporters
will move in here and here,

450
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:39,353
- and they'll block off the main drag.
- Right. Roger.

451
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,898
Arthur and Lorna park
the three fast cars here

452
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:45,484
in case anything goes wrong and
we gotta make a quick getaway, right?

453
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,152
Correct. Now, it's 12:10.

454
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,780
The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

455
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:54,033
and will be forced slowly

01:23:02,951 --> 01:23:04,369
We can't go round here all night.

774
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:29,351
- Manzo?
- Yes, sir.

775
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:31,937
Check the railway station, all trains.

776
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:34,023
Check all names of passengers

777
01:23:34,148 --> 01:23:37,068
who boarded aeroplanes
at Linate or Malpensa.

778
01:23:37,193 --> 01:23:38,861
This was a big operation.

779
01:23:38,986 --> 01:23:42,490
Those who were engaged in the earlier
part will already have left the town,

780
01:23:42,615 --> 01:23:43,783
- probably by air.
- Yes, sir.

781
01:23:43,908 --> 01:23:46,327
- Check the autostradas.
- But the police will be doing this.

782
01:23:46,452 --> 01:23:49,163
We know who they are, the police don't.
Also, have my plane made ready.

783
01:23:49,288 --> 01:23:50,956
- Yes, sir.
- They can't get out.

784
01:23:51,082 --> 01:23:52,416
Nothing can move in this mess.

785
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,252
If they planned this jam,
they must have planned a way out.

786
01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:11,435
I think you might make an effort
to keep up with the others, Tony.

787
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,561
All right. All right.

788
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:16,065
Here, make a wish.

789
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:21,112
Look out. They're behind us.

790
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:23,279
You better put your foot down,
we'll lose them easy.

791
01:24:36,334 --> 01:24:38,336

(SHOUTS IN ITALIAN)

793
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:28,821
CHARLIE: Hurry up, Dominic.

794
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:12,113
(LAUGHING) Let's go.

795
01:27:12,989 --> 01:27:13,990
(MEN CHEERING)

796
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:16,534
Have you heard the news, sir?
They've done it, Mr Bridger.

797
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:19,662
All the men are yelling for you, sir.
They've done it.

798
01:27:19,787 --> 01:27:22,248
- Done what, Keats?
- The job, sir.

799
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,936
ALL: England!

800
01:27:46,355 --> 01:27:47,982
England!

801
01:27:50,526 --> 01:27:52,153
England!

802
01:27:54,363 --> 01:27:55,990
England!

803
01:28:45,746 --> 01:28:48,791
Get the wheels in line.
Get the wheels in line with it,

804
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:51,127
and then slam your brakes,
or we'll be in the cabin.

805
01:28:56,757 --> 01:28:59,635
You should've used more speed
on the up, accelerate and...

806
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,727
England!

807
01:29:10,271 --> 01:29:11,897
England!

808
01:29:24,076 --> 01:29:25,077
That's it. Go on now.

809
01:29:27,705 --> 01:29:29,331
England!

810
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:32,835
England!

811
01:29:42,428 --> 01:29:43,429
Okay, hang on.

812
01:29:54,147 --> 01:29:55,815
- Be very careful.
- Okay.

813
01:29:59,903 --> 01:30:01,529
England!

814
01:30:04,074 --> 01:30:06,826
Right, everybody out.
Start unloading the gold.

815
01:30:26,137 --> 01:30:27,764
England!

816
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:46,866
England!

817
01:31:03,924 --> 01:31:05,384
England!

818
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:32,536
Charlie boy?

819
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:39,209
Now!

820
01:31:56,602 --> 01:31:58,103
Ready, Charlie?

821
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:04,735
Now!

822
01:32:31,094 --> 01:32:32,095
Ready?

823
01:32:35,473 --> 01:32:36,474
Now!

824
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:06,879
Okay, out. Out you come.
Out you come.

825
01:33:07,004 --> 01:33:10,173
Leave the beer. Leave the beer. Get in.

826
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:12,843
Come on.

827
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:15,846
Okay, William, go!

828
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,086

(ALL GRUMBLING)

834

CHARLIE: Hold still.
Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.

835
01:34:45,267 --> 01:34:46,685
Nobody move.

836
01:35:00,032 --> 01:35:03,577
We're balancing right on the edge.

837
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:07,498
Very slowly, move this way.

838
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:11,669
Very slowly.
Don't make a sharp movement.

839
01:35:12,795 --> 01:35:15,589
Come as far up this end as you can get.

840
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:41,073
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it, Bill.

841
01:35:50,499 --> 01:35:54,712
The gold is pulling it over the edge.
We'll have to get it back.

842
01:36:16,024 --> 01:36:17,776
Get back! Get back!

843
01:36:24,782 --> 01:36:28,327
Now hold still. Don't move.
Don't move at all.

844
01:36:32,915 --> 01:36:37,878
Don't no one get out the door, neither.
Otherwise we'll all go.

845
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:03,027
Edge back as far as you can go

846
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:07,198
to counterbalance me. Now...

847
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:06,007
Hang on a minute, lads.
I've got a great idea.
