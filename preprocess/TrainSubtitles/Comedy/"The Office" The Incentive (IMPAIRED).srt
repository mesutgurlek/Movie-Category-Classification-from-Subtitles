- No, he hasn't.

I mean, he's gotten worse
over the years, but...

16

He's making a statement.

17

on our expectations of him.

Would you like to join me?
That sounds nice.

329
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,689
Great.

330
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,325
You have a walking buddy.

331
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,560
I do!

332
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,729
- Thanks for coming in, guys.
- You don't have to thank us

333
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,731
for coming in-- It's our job.

334
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,067
Well, I never got thanked
for coming into a meeting,

335
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,636
and I always wanted to be,
so I'm gonna thank people.

336
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,904
What's under the blanket?

337
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:59,758
This is what's under
the blanket.

338
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,677
We...Don't get it.

339
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,295
These are incentives.

340
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,580
It's how we're gonna
double growth.

341
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,749
Now, you're probably all
asking yourselves,

342
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,851
"well, how does this work?"

343
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,186
Seems like a basic
reward system

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,638
where you give us points

345
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,357
and then we redeem those points
for prizes.

346
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,476
You're exactly right,
and you get a point.

347
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:19,945
- Oh!
- Is that a vibrator?

348
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,931
- 20 points.
- How does one get a point?

349
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,833
I've outlined the exact
parameters in an email,

350
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,068
so check your spam folders.

351
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,502
But basically...

352
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:29,204
You do your job better,
you get points.

353
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:31,606
So... Collect 15 points,

354
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,209
and redeem them for
this polar bear.

355
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,877
Why is it all kids' stuff
and a vibrator?

356
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,012
It's so gross.

357
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,647
There's lots of stuff.

358
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,817
John Irving, collected works.
22 points.

359
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:45,286
Or you can pool your points
and redeem 55

360
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,122
for this maternity shirt.

361
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,007
- [Ah-hem]
- How about you want us

362
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:51,292
to work harder, pay us more?
I can't.

363
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,961
This point system
is really insulting.

364
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,347
Ooh. Well, I didn't
mean to offend you,

365
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:57,399
and I hope you'll forgive me,

366
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,634
because I'm very, very...
Sari.

367
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,154
16 points.
It's a tablecloth.

368
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,972
What if went all the way up
to 500 points?

369
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,490
That's a crazy
amount of points.

370
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,376
- But what if?
- Well, what do you want?

371
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,528
I don't know.
For such a crazy number,

372
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,313
I'd like something
pretty crazy.

373
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,081
All right.
For 500 points,

374
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,683
I will wear a dress to work.

375
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,151
[Laughter] Ah!

376
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,318
That's pretty good.

377
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,088
What about, uh, for
1,000 points?

378
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,656
I'll run naked
through the parking lot

379
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:23,542
with a doughnut on my dingdong.

380
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:24,760
[Laughter]

381
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,178
Yeah? You like that?

382
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,897
All right, for 5,000 points,

383
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,633
I will...Let you
tattoo whatever you want

384
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,202
on the stern
of the old <i>SS Bernard.</i>

385
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,554
- Oh!
- Here we go!

386
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,773
All right, all right,
and you are totally serious.

387
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,392
Swear to God, hope to die.
Now, let's get to work!

388
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:43,945
Wait. But you did say
we could pool our points, right?

389
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,897
In that case,
let's get to work.

390
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,949
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

391
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,201
[Applause]

392
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,235
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

393
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,228
All right, thank you very much.

394
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,430
Uh, Phyllis, brachen auto?

395
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,499
Ask for Donald.
Karen's bananas.

396
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,001
I just want you to benefit
from our...

397
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,203
T-bag-bone.

[Indistinct chatter]

400
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,041
Have you noticed just
a little bit

401
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,276
of a mood shift around here?

402
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,944
No, I haven't noticed anything.

403
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,095
Really?

404
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,181
Because I sat next to Stanley
for years,

405
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,850
and this is naptime.

406
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,951
- Yeah?
- Open-eye naptime.

407
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,219
He balances the phone
on his shoulder

408
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,220
and just powers down.

409
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,254
Now look at him.

410
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,440
You've got to unleash the power

411
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,691
of the pyramid.

412
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,694
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

413
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,029
You think it
has something to do

414
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,330
with that incentive program?

415
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,364
Oh, 100%.

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,449
We all want to see you
tattoo your ass.

417
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,867
Uh...

418
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,235
I think people thought
I was kidding

419
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,303
when I said that.

420
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,604
No, you definitely
weren't kidding.

421
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,439
That came across
loud and clear.

422
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh, by the way,
wanna hand this in?

423

120 points?

424
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,343
Yeah, big sale.

425

Don't worry about it, though.

426

I don't really care
about the points.

I would like
a point receipt, though.

00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,426
- It's funny.
- It's apropos.

492
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,546
[Tattoo gun buzzing]

493
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,098
Just need a second outside.

494
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,191
- You getting psyched up?
- Yeah.

495
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,476
Andy, nobody really expects
you to go through with this.

496
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,661
Tunes...

497
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,930
What am I doing here?

498
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,099
Why did Robert pick me?

499
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:24,269
Confession,
I don't know what I'm doing.

500
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,538
I mean, do you like it?

501
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,656
You having fun?

502
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,308
[Mumbles and scoffs]

503
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,409
Tell you this,

504
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,311
everybody else is having
a lot of fun.

505
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,630
And you did that.

506
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,415
But my ass is only so big.

507
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,850
I mean, I can't do this
every day.

508
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,351
But I think it's big enough
to buy you some time

509
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,170
till your next great idea.

510
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,056
Which, by the way,
I can't wait for.

511
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,294
No one expects me to go
through with this, right?

512
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,896
Absolutely not.

513
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,986
Let's ink my stink!

514
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,188
[Cheers]

515
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,823
- Andy!
- Yeah!

516
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,825
My heart belongs to music.

517
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,378
But my ass belongs
to these people.

518
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,913
Whoa!

519
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,649
Good stuff.

520
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,420
Do your worst.

521
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,672
Uh, you can keep
your pants on, actually.

522
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:17,823
If you just drop 'em
down a bit,

523
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:18,990
that'd be great.

524
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,259
They're already off,
my good sir.

525
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,494
I'd really prefer
they not be down.

526
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,662
Well, I think down's better.

527
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,097
Sweating pretty heavily
down there.

528
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,799
[All murmur]

529
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,721
Do you think you could work
from this?

530
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,339
We made some small adjustments.

531
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,041
- Okay, you want me to--
- Just these few adjustments.

532
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,726
Yeah.

533
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,611
All right, let's begin.

534
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,230
This is where I grin and--
Ow! Ow!

535
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,347
That was just a cotton swab.

536
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,200
Invest in softer cotton, sir.

537
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,853
[Buzzing] Whew.

538
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,354
Oh, boy.

539
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,206
<i>Oww!</i>

540
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,458
Ohhh! Ho, ho!

541
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,543
[Laughter]

542
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:55,878
Ohhh!

543
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,296
Whoa!

544
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,765
Obviously, you can go
the ass tattoo route.

545
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,301
And obviously,
I'm gonna like it.

546
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,436
Draw some blood!
Ha!

547

[Andy pounding on chair]

Ahhhhh-haaaaa!

549
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,345
Great tattoo.

550
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,881
Why did I choose Andy
to run the office?

551
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,218
Because he's all surface,
uncomplicated.

552
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,153
What you see is what you get.

553
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,989
Could be a recipe
for mediocrity, yes,

554
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,724
but then again,
it might just be

555
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:29,444
why people fight for him.

556
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,396
It's a nard dog.

557
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,665
[All cheering and laughing]

558
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,117
That's my nickety-name.

00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,169
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

560
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,587
I love it.
I love it.

561
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:39,788
Pull up your pants.

562
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,457
There's something
about an underdog

563
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,212
that really inspires
the unexceptional.

564
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,715
Um, what should we talk about?

565
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,101
Well, we could talk
about an ethical dilemma

566
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,386
I'm having.

567
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:55,553
Oh, yeah, sure.

568
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,322
Um, I hope I can help.

569
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,192
A coworker of mine is drinking
caffeine while pregnant,

570
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,593
and I don't know if I should
call social services

571
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,778
about it.

572
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,030
Angela, that's pretty
transparently me.

573
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,898
Maybe.

574
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,733
You know, it's just herbal tea.

In mugs with trace amounts
of coffee.

576

Yeah, I think you should
call social services.

577
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,698
I already did.

578
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,247
You know, maybe we should just
have our own pregnancy as

579
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,347
in not pretend like we
are in this together.

580

- Fine.
- Fine.
