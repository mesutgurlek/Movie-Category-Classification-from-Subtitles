Aah!

818
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:53,480
Aah!

819
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:56,847
We'll have you at
the hospital in no time.

820
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:02,182
Aah!

821
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:04,225
Good morning!
Excuse me!

822
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:06,751
Wait, guys, wait! Aah!

823
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,763
Let's go, let's go.

824
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:11,924
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

825
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,033
Let's move.

826
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:15,535
What a ride.

827
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:17,469
Wash Out, you made it.

828
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:18,972
Why, thank you, Andre.

829
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,974
I'll have the veal piccata.

830
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:25,580
Oh! Don't forget
the cardio readout.

831
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:26,944
Where is it?

832
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,039
Um...

833
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,140
It's, uh...

834
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:30,149
Hey, fellas...

835
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:31,845
inside on the left.

836
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,683
I can't find it!

837
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:36,489
Doctor.

838
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:37,490
<i>What happened?</i>

839
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:38,491
Plane crash.

840
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:42,523
I got to work fast.
I got a lunch.

841
00:45:42,597 --> 00:45:44,758
You're missing
the big picture.

842
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,767
Is his penis longer
than mine?

843
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:47,767
No, Doctor.

844
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:49,269
Good. This will hurt.

845
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:50,269
Aah!

846
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:52,772
Give me 15ccs of morphine
quickly.

847
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:54,274
Can you save him?

848
00:45:54,342 --> 00:45:56,776
Can't be sure.
I'm not a very good doctor.

849
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:58,540
Thanks, Nurse. Wait here.

850
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:00,046
You going to be O. K?

851
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:03,243
I'm in a hospital.
What could go wrong?

852
00:46:10,892 --> 00:46:14,055
Mrs. Thompson,
I know you must hate me,

853
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:16,563
but there's something
I want you to have.

854
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:18,565
I've been putting
a little away

855
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:19,827
for 10 years.

856
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:21,334
It's not much... 2,500.

857
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,928
I wish I could do more.

858
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:26,371
Why, Topper...

859
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:29,171
th-that's so sweet.

860
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:33,413
Why, with the 3 million
that I won

861
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:34,914
on this
lucky lotto ticket,

862
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:39,477
I can take this 2,500
and blow it all on hats.

863
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:46,619
Right and halt.

864
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:51,358
[Arf Arf]

865
00:46:56,871 --> 00:47:01,205
Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson
is dead.

866
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,267
<i>So is Mo Green,</i>

867
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:05,745
Tataglia, Barzini,

868
00:47:05,814 --> 00:47:08,783
the heads of all
the five families.

869
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,286
<i>It is at moments like these,
my dear friends,</i>

870
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:14,049
<i>we must ask ourselves,</i>

871
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,387
<i>"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"</i>

872
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,892
Do good men
like Dead Meat Thompson

873
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,622
just blink out
like a bad bulb?

874
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:25,132
<i>One minute, you're in bed
with a knockout gal or guy,</i>

875
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,327
the next,
you're a compost heap.

876
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:30,098
<i>Well, doesn't that
bother any of you?</i>

877
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:33,140
Because it scares
the living piss out of me!

878
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:36,143
<i>[Block] I never thought
something like this could happen.</i>

879
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:38,611
<i>Don't we have what we need?</i>

880
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,581
This should prove
our planes need replacing.

881
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:44,083
<i>No, those planes
have to fail in combat</i>

882
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,086
for the world
to take notice.

883
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,315
This is a minor incident.

884
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,858
Minor? I lost
one of my best men.

885
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,594
Are you backing out on us?

886
00:47:54,662 --> 00:47:58,098
I'm doing this for my country,
not for you.

887
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,801
We'll need the backup plan.

888
00:48:05,874 --> 00:48:06,863
Aim.

889
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,636
Fire!

890
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,234
Jumping Jesus, they're back.

891
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:11,300
<i>Fire!</i>

892
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:13,279
People, take cover!

893
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,838
Hit the dirt!

894
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:17,713
Cover me!

895
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:19,185
Battle stations!

896
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:20,983
Battle stations!

897
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,260
Have they no respect
for the dead?

898
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:28,192
Aah!

899
00:48:28,263 --> 00:48:29,890
Aah!

900
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:36,662
God, I love a good funeral.

901
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:55,919
Topper.

902
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,254
Where are you going?

903
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm handing in my resignation.

904
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:03,263
You said I was dangerous,
and I am.

905
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,559
Topper, wait.

906
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:07,032
<i>Please, let's talk.</i>

907
00:49:07,102 --> 00:49:08,797
Huh?

908
00:49:11,172 --> 00:49:12,104
They're right.

909
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:14,266
I'm no better than my father.

910
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:16,503
Seems no matter what I do,

911
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,478
I end up hurting someone.

912
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:21,008
Ouch.

913
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:26,247
You've got to stop comparing
yourself with your father.

914
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:27,754
You're two different people.

915
00:49:27,822 --> 00:49:29,756
We both killed a man.

916
00:49:29,824 --> 00:49:31,257
That's just a coincidence.

917
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:33,260
He loved jets.
So do I.

918
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:35,694
He was a loner just like me.

919
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:38,323
I've even got my father's eyes.

920
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:40,094
Topper, please.

921
00:49:41,169 --> 00:49:42,796
They're just for luck.

922
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:44,998
You've got to
make your own luck.

923
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:46,904
You've got to
get back in the sky

924
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,272
and prove yourself.

925
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:50,470
Besides, there's
something else.

926
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:54,174
After our first meeting
in my office,

927
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:56,683
I sent my evaluation
to Commander Block.

928
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,685
I recommended you be grounded.

929
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:00,812
I was afraid
someone might get hurt.

930
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:03,449
What are you saying?

931
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:07,291
I think someone wants
Sleepy Weasel to fail.

932
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:09,057
That's heavy.

933
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,392
Totally.

934
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,195
That's the other reason
why you need to fly.

935
00:50:13,268 --> 00:50:16,396
This could well be your only
opportunity to save the mission

936
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,406
and solve your
personal problems,

937
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,339
all in one fell swoop.

938
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,248
Read that back to me,
Francine.

939
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,757
"And if you ever put
your goddamn hands

940
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:40,589
on my wife again,
I will..."

941
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,594
<i>[Knock On Door]</i>

942
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,961
You wanted to see me, sir?

943
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:45,465
Blank, come on in.

944
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:46,966
Been expecting someone.

945
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:48,593
That'll be all, Francine.

946
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,602
Yes, sir.

947
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:54,640
Pudding?

948
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,337
No, thank you, sir.

949
00:50:57,412 --> 00:50:59,141
I'll put this to you straight.

950
00:50:59,214 --> 00:51:01,148
Thompson's death
was a shock to us all,

951
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:03,377
and that hot shot Harley
is responsible.

952
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:07,478
I want that smirking
little wise-ass out of here.

953
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:10,922
The morale on this base
is shot to hell.

954
00:51:10,992 --> 00:51:12,755
Just look out there.

955
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:15,059
<i>Quiet.</i>

956
00:51:15,129 --> 00:51:17,290
Hardly a man moving.

957
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,230
Roy.

958
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,232
Roy!

959
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:21,233
Ah. Huh?

960
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:23,566
I went to school with that man.

961
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:25,071
<i>He's just not the same.</i>

962
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:26,834
Been ignoring me all day.

963
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:29,001
Remind me to send him a note.

964
00:51:29,077 --> 00:51:30,635
May I say something?

965
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,644
I have no doubt
that Harley acted irresponsibly,

966
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,650
but his kind
lives on the edge,

967
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,811
<i>always willing
to take a chance.</i>

968
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:41,878
We need Topper for this mission
for that reason.

969
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:47,627
I like your thinking, Carl.

970
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:50,755
Besides, Dead Meat wasn't
all that good a pilot anyway.

971
00:51:50,832 --> 00:51:52,766
He only had a small family.

972
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:55,268
His kids are a pain in the ass.

973
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:56,769
Wife's on the sauce.

974
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:58,430
Poor bastard's better off dead.

975
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:01,066
What size shoes do you wear?

976
00:52:01,142 --> 00:52:02,404
A 9, sir.

977
00:52:02,477 --> 00:52:04,570
Good. It's settled then.

978
00:52:04,646 --> 00:52:07,080
We'll send Harley to the front.

979
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:10,914
By the way, thanks for dinner
the other night.

980
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:12,919
Cheryl and I thought
the stroganoff was marvelous.

981
00:52:12,987 --> 00:52:15,285
We didn't have dinner
the other night.

982
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:16,288
Really?

983
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:18,291
Where the hell was I?

984
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:20,327
And who's this Cheryl?

985
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:22,226
Ah, doesn't matter.

986
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:23,730
Run along, Sid.

987
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:27,663
Cheryl?

988
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:34,306
Kent?

989
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:40,341
I came to get my chafing dish.

990
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:41,882
Our orders just came through.

991
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:43,883
We're shipping out in one hour.

992
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:45,475
Are you coming this time?

993
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:47,783
- The chafing dish isn't yours.
- It is.

994
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:49,254
- It isn't.
- I don't want it.

995
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:50,723
- Take it.
- I'll take it.

996
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,852
- You stay out of it.
- This is not the time or place,

997
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:58,058
but I've got a big score
to settle with you, my friend.

998
00:52:58,132 --> 00:52:59,394
Excuse me.

999
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:06,232
I've hurt him.

1000
00:53:06,306 --> 00:53:07,273
Topper.

1001
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,865
Topper, you better go.

1002
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:11,808
I have to think.

1003
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:13,436
Well, I don't.

1004
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:16,448
I've fallen for you
like a blind roofer.

1005
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,040
I'm sorry?

1006
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:21,383
My heart has fallen down
around my ankles

1007
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:24,116
like a wet pair of pants.

1008
00:53:24,191 --> 00:53:27,160
My whole life,
all I've wanted to do is fly.

1009

Bomb stuff.

1010

Shoot people down.

1011
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:32,629
But we've been through
so much together.
