2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,334
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: <i>Yes, Connie, I'm
coming to you</i> <i>from Fort Lauderdale,</i>

3
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,901
<i>and we're rockin' to celebrate</i>
<i>summer's last hurrah,</i>

4
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:23,766
<i>Labor Day weekend. </i>

5
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,199
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>why we're on,</i>

6
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,332
<i>because you'd have to be</i>
<i>a real no-life</i>

7
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>to be home on a</i>
<i>picture-perfect day like this. </i>

8
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,032
Mom, please.

9
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,400
Is this how I'm gonna spend
my Labor Day weekend?

10
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,201
Sitting between
my mother

11
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:41,968
and a pizza
with everything?

12
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,766
The holiday
got you down, Kel?

13
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,450
Let's just pretend
it's a normal day.

14
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:49,959
Get up on the table,
dance around,

15
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,434
and me and Mom
will put dollars

16
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,234
down your blouse.

17
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,566
Now, Bud,

18
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,300
not everything
Reverend Felcher says

19
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,934
from the pulpit
is true.

20
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,234
Ha, ha, ha.

21
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,733
Greeting, vultures.

22
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,100
You meal ticket's here.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

24
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,667
Guess where
I have been.

25
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,767
Locked in the trunk
of your car

26
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,899
with a dead cat?

27
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:30,899
And no one understands

28
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,133
why I scream
on the way home.

29
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:34,499
Anyhow,
I was thinking,

30
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,968
how could we have
a perfect Labor Day?

31
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:37,933
And then it hit me.

32
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,766
While all those
families of morons

33
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:42,167
are wasting their time
going to the beach,

34
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,332
guess where we're gonna be.

35
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,067
No, not another
family barbecue.

36
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,365
Yes, a family
barbecue!

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,801
Who's going to give it
a "Whoa, Bundy," here?

38
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:54,199
Huh?

39
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,899
No one? Fine.

40
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,801
Oh, Al. Honey,
don't get us wrong.

41
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,501
It's not that
we don't enjoy

42
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,301
sweltering
in the back yard,

43
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,032
being bitten
by horseflies

44
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,067
and watching you scratch
your sweaty back

45
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,567
with our salad forks.

46
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,998
But, honey,
just once

47
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,150
we would like to do
something we want.

48
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:15,267
We can't do something
that you want,

49
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:16,899
and I'll tell you why.

50
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:20,133
Because it's Labor Day,
not Leech Day.

51
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,599
That's Christmas.

52
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,267
It's not Parasite Day.

53
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:25,866
That's Mother's Day.

54
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,934
See, this is a holiday
for the working guy.

55
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,767
It celebrates
all the people who work,

56
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:33,666
so that all the people
who don't

57
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,534
can live longer and
have more than he does.

58
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:37,866
So tomorrow...

59
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,384
unless, God willing,
I die in my sleep...

60
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,868
I get up for me
and celebrate for me.

61
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:50,332
Tomorrow is Al Bun-Day.

62
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,601
Gee, I thought
that was Al-oween.

63
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,167
I don't want to sit
around the house

64
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,699
all day and sleep.

65
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,899
It's like being
at school.

66
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:04,134
No, the difference between
here and school

67
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,334
is you'll be out of here
when you're 18.

68
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,500
Now, tomorrow your job
is to go shopping.

69
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:20,667
Why can't we shop today?
Traffic too light?

70
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,334
Because, if you were
paying attention

71
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:23,566
all these years,

72
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,400
you'd know that
Al Bundy doesn't barbecue

73
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:26,666
with day-old fixin's.

74
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,632
Now, it's your job tomorrow

75
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,167
to get me fresh meat,
fresh cheese,

76
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,301
and fresh charcoal.

77
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:32,365
And watch those chips.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,317
I don't want you
getting anything

79
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:36,234
that says
"natural ingredients. "

80
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:37,666
Now, kids,

81
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,300
since we're all gonna spend
the whole day together tomorrow,

82
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,467
today, get out.

83
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,199
Oh, and don't forget.

84
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:47,567
I don't want my ketchup
in those plastic squeeze things.

85
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:49,801
I want bottles,
just like the Pilgrims had.

86
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:53,133
I wish you could
have seen your father

87
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,634
when he was
in high school,

88
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,065
before all this happened.

89
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,434
As I recall,
they almost did.

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,817
I can't wait
to have kids

91
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,399
so I can
make them suffer.

92
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:07,884
And when they ask
who their dad is,

93
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,334
you can play
"Wheel of Father. "

94
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:15,766
Now, Peg,

95
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:16,766
I don't want you to think

96
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,584
that I forgot you
in all this.

97
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,332
Your job
is very important too.

98
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,467
You get to bring the benches
from the basement

99
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:25,098
and scrape off
the bird doody.

100
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,733
Traditionally,
the job of the queen.

101
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,334
That, and killing
and eating her mate.

102
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,666
Heh, heh, heh.

103
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,417
Oh, what a day
this is gonna be!

104
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,676
Can you feel
the excitement, Peg?

105
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,901
Oh, Al, I've given up
on excitement.

106
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,132
I'm going for relief.

107
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,200
Which brings us
to a little promise

108
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:45,300
you made
just last spring.

109
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:49,199
Sex again.

110
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:51,100
Peg, we've been married
for 17 years now.

111
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,284
Can't we
just be friends?

112
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,399
No.
I don't like you,

113
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,734
I just want
to have sex with you.

114

[DOORBELL RINGS]

115
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,799
Oh, come on, honey.

116
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,968
You promised me that when
you were rested,

117
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,232
we could do it.

118
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,484
And besides,
the way you do it,

119
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,701
it's just like
resting anyway.

120
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,300
Oh, Peggy, I don't
know what to do.

121
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,100
Steve is
an unfeeling cur.

122
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,132
As you know,

123
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,098
my sainted Aunt Tuney
passed away.

124
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,367
Sainted, my foot.
She used to pay for sailors.

125
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:30,200
She was 67, and they
wouldn't come for free.

126
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,965
Anyw...

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,466
Anyway, I was
her favorite,

128
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,734
and the honor of caring
for her sainted ashes

129
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:37,833
fell to me.

130
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,434
And the horrible
cross to bear

131
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,000
of caring
for her $100,000

132
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,299
fell to her cats.

133
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,767
Oh, Aunt Tuney,
no one understands but me.

134
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:49,232
Oh, we understand.
You're insane.

135
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,501
Must you carry that urn
wherever you go?

136
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,734
She sleeps with it,
you know.

137
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,734
I can't throw stones.

138
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,767
Look, Marcy,
all I am saying

139
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,365
is that
it is unhealthy

140
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,434
for you to walk around
with a load of ashes,

141
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,566
while five moth-eaten cats

142
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,033
have a bigger Mercedes
than I do.

143
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:13,201
Damn nouveau cats.

144
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:15,299
Guys, guys, guys.

145
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,965
This should be
a happy day,

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,367
not fighting,
and arguing, and...

147
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,818
having sex
with our spouses.

148
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:23,943
So I'm going
to do something

149
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,033
that I wouldn't
normally do.

150
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,833
Use a Q-Tip?

151
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:32,265
Oh, want
some lovin', babe?

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,601
Anyhow, us Bundys are having
a barbecue tomorrow,

153
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,032
and I'm inviting you two

154
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,550
to share some of our
famous Bundyburgers.

155
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,033
Well, I suppose Aunt Tuney
would like a day

156
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:44,599
out in
the fresh air.

157
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,334
She got enough
when we rowed her

158
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,399
around the lake
yesterday.

159
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,767
Thank you, Al.
We'll be glad to come.

160
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:51,899
What can we bring?

161
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,434
Just the plates,
