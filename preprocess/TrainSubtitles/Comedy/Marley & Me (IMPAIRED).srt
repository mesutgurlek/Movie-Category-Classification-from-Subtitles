<i>- I left him for maybe an hour.</i>

Oh, look at us.

00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,438
So I'm in this cave and-
and I can feel the machine guns.

There's, like, nine of them around me.

<i>- Kalashnikov.</i>

- And then Escobar comes in and says-
- Escobar?

312
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:02,052
El Padrino-Yeah. He says,
"I read your piece on Gadhafi...

313
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,325

his narcissism perfectly."

Man, I wish you

<i>- He's adorable.</i>
- I think the "puppy instead
of a baby" idea is working.

00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,436
- Yeah, it's certainly working for me.
- Can I take him home with me?

You're so cute. Yes, you are.

you might have a shot with the big dog.

It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

342
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,090
You really shouldn't bring a dog
down to the dog beach until he's trained.

Okay, can I get the dog back?

344

Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

- All right.

<i>this crap when other people write it.</i>

think of something.

Now, see, this gives me a little
inspiration, but it's not for a column.

405
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:48,370
It's more like-

406
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,014

<i>Incorrigible? I don't believe in that word.</i>

So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

A dog can only have one master.

Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?

Come on. Let's line up again.

450
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,639
Class, it's a simple question
of having confidence...

451
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,833
in your own authority.

452
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,878

- Sorry.
- May I?

456
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,652
<i>All right, even an unruly dog...</i>

457
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,245
likes to obey his leader.

458
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,724
Marley, heel.

459
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,763

Aaah! That's it. He is out.

467
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,018
Sorry. Usually he does this with poodles.

468
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,086
That dog is a bad influence on the others.

469
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,793
<i>Now, leg humping is like a virus.</i>

470
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,860
Once it takes hold of the group- No.

It was maybe your hair.

That's why he got kicked out.

477

You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

You know, there is
something else that we could do.

[John]
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.

483

You'll see. Sex is overrated.

484
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,341
Aw, I can't tell you that,
'cause you know it's a lie.

485
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,649
Poor son of a bitch.

Okay. You wanna come up?
Yeah. That's the least I can do.

<i>- Get a little fresh air.</i>

488

Oh, gosh. It's like he's
walking the plank.

489
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,728
I mean, that's what
breaks my heart, is he's so happy.

490

- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

- Oh, no, no, no. That makes me nervous.
- He's okay.

492
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,037
He's just getting a little air.

493
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:17,038
- It's like <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

496
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,117
- [Squeaks]
- He's onto our evil plan.

497
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:29,058
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

498
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,494
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

501

- Jesus.
- I need a little help here.

502
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:45,634
Hey, get a leash.

503
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:49,670
<i>- Shut up.</i>
- He's losing his balls today. Cut him some slack.

504
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,773
- [Horns Honking]
- You got him? Careful. Careful.

505
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:01,225
This is a rough draft, 'cause I'd like
to take another pass at it.

506
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,825
You know, the beginning,
I think I might want-

507
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,595
I think we can maybe lose that,
'cause I think it gets a little bit "jokey."

508
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,438
I just reread it, and I didn't think
it really worked at all. I'm sorry.

509
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,908
- I'm gonna go back and do the zoning piece.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

Thanks.

518

Listen. You know what makes it work?

519
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,404
What makes it work is that
you put yourself into it. I like that.

00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,304
- Good.
<i>- Look, I know you're a reporter and all...</i>

let him off the leash?

590

Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

Nope.

Your little play list that you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

I could live with a few leaks.

- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

608
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,006
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak...

609
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:23,377
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility.

610
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:26,645
- That's true.
- We may want to think
about fixing a lot of things...

- before we start-
- Well, honey, we already fixed Marley.

Yeah. Oh, yes!

1474
01:26:34,503 --> 01:26:37,836
He catches it. He fends off one guy.

1475
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:41,672
He's running through.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

Stay there.

1543
01:30:56,998 --> 01:31:01,867
Why did his stomach twist? We don't
exactly know why this happens.

1544
01:31:01,936 --> 01:31:06,600
Most likely he ate or drank something
quickly and his stomach just flipped.

1545
01:31:06,674 --> 01:31:09,939

For now, he's good.

1548
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:20,145
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

<i>I'm gonna be able to do for him.</i>

1550
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:27,787
He's an older dog. I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

1551
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,729
Well, we have to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

1552
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:33,859
Well, most likely,
it is gonna happen again.

1553
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:37,996
Well, we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly.

1554
01:31:38,072 --> 01:31:41,166
- Right.
- So maybe it doesn't have to happen again.

1555
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:43,574
We'll monitor that.

1556

I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night.

1557
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:53,918
Maybe 10%% of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1559
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:00,859
- What is it based on?
- Yeah, the reason why I ask...

1560
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:03,955
is I bet that number's
based on regular dogs.

1561
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:07,900
- Regular dogs?
- Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs.

01:32:07,969 --> 01:32:10,870
<i>I know people probably say that</i>
<i>all the time, but to be honest...</i>

1563
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:13,203
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1564
01:32:13,274 --> 01:32:16,243
He once ate an answering machine.
<i>Just polished it off.

1565
01:32:16,311 --> 01:32:20,714
He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested
it. Then went and had the phone for dessert.

1566
01:32:20,782 --> 01:32:24,912
<i>Another time, my son had colic and</i>
<i>this guy sat up all night, didn't move...</i>

1567
01:32:24,986 --> 01:32:28,513
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1568
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:33,050
So I think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs.

Patrick, do you wanna say something?

[Shudders]
He knows.

1770
01:50:02,242 --> 01:50:04,904
I'd like to give him something.

This necklace.

1772
01:50:15,055 --> 01:50:17,922
It's been on quite a journey.

1773
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:27,692
Your dad gave it to me...

1774
01:50:27,768 --> 01:50:31,101
to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1775

But, you know-
