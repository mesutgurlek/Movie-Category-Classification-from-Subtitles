00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
^ BugTitleZ ^

2
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
Next!

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
Name?

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,026
Gus Gorman.

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,036
Ah, yes.
August Gorman.

6
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,538
Have you looked
For work this week?

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
Uh...yes.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,042
What kind?

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
Uh...

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
Kitchen technician.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
Dishwasher?
Any luck?

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,548
A little, but...

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,552
Mr. Gorman, you've been
Unemployed for 36 weeks.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,553
No, it's 35.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,555
Not counting this week.

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,058
You secured employment
Last June

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,559
As a messenger
And were discharged

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
After one day
For losing--

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
No, no, they said
I lost it.

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,065
I did not lose it.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
It was stolen
By a pickpocket.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
A television set?

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,571
A teensy-weensy Japanese
2-inch television set.

24
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
The only other
Employment you found

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,077
Was in a fast food
Joint which lasted...

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079
28 minutes?

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,580
That's some record.

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
Talk about fast!

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,586
They expect you
To learn stuff in one day.

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,587
Hold the lettuce!

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,588
Hold the ketchup!

32
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
Can i have some sauce?

33
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
2 buns! No buns!

34
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,593
Cheese! No cheese!

35
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,097
The city of metropolis
Is generous to a fault.

36
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
I'm not the fault!

37
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,600
36 weeks of
Chronic unemployment,

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,103
Living off the taxes of
Hard-working citizens.

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
Do you know
What you are?

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,607
I'm not a bum!

41
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,109
You are...

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,111
I was about to say,

43
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
No longer eligible.

44
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,614
No longer--

45
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,615
Next!

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,617
I need this week!

47
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
Next!

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
You mean that's it?

49
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
Finished? Like, over?

50
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
Huh!

51
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,627
Next!

52
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,628
Next.

53
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,131
Next as in "bye."

54
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
Next!

55
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
Name?

56
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,140
Excuse me, brother,
Can i have a light?

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,629
[gunshot]

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,701
Say thank you.

59
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,203
Wow!

60
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,723
Way to go, superman!

61
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,301
Computer: your drink
Is on its way.

62
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,304
Uh, sir?

63
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,306
Excuse me, but...

64
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,808
What if you want to--

65
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,310
Enjoy your drink!

66
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,313
Program 2 bilateral
Coordinates at once?

67
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,315
You can't do that.

68
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,816
But if you--

69
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,319
Computer technology
Is very advanced,

70
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,821
But it can't do that.

71
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,824
But if we can't
Do it that way...

72
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,825
Sir?

73
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,332
Good lord!

74
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,335
How did
You do that?

75
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,836
I don't know.

76
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,838
I just did it.

77
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,690
Who's this?

78
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,192
That's him,
Ross Webster,

79
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,693
Just after he
Received the award

80
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,695
For humanitarian
Of the year.

81
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,697
Oh, he is
Good-looking!

82
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,699
I gave him
F-2 at 1/50TH.

83
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,201
One thing
I don't understand

84
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,703
Was the point of the story
Lois wrote

85
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,206
Is how this Ross Webster
Got this great honour.

86
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,208
And you bring me
One picture of him

87
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,710
And 15 pictures
Of this other person.

88
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,711
Who is she?

89
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,713
Lorelei ambrosia.
She's Webster’s--

90
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,715
She's just Webster’s.
Let's leave it at that.

91
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,217
Who's this
Other woman?

92
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,719
That's his sister Vera.

93
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,221
Picture looks fuzzy.

94
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,722
The picture's fine.

95
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,224
She looks like that.

96
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,726
She's vice president
Of webscoe industries.

97
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,728
I don't understand you.

98
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,729
A boring banquet,

99
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,731
And you bring me
3,000 boring pictures.

100
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,733
Superman saves a man
From drowning

101
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,735
On 3RD avenue,

102
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,738
And you don't
Get one picture!

103
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
I didn't
Have my camera!

104
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,243
A photographer eats
With his camera,

105
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,744
Sleeps
With his camera.

106
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm glad I’m a writer.

107
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,750
Time to draw
The jingo number.

108
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,254
The prize is
A south American trip!

109
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,755
I don't know why--

110
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,257
Morning,
Everybody.

111
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
Hi, Clark.

112
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,761
Jimmy, you've got
Mustard on your lapel.

113
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,263
Mr. White, i hate
To interrupt--

114
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,266
I'm getting
A paper out!

115
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,268
Stick to
The printing press.

116
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,769
What's the number?

117
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,271
"53."

118
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,773
Mr. White?

119
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,275
53!

120
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,279
You've got to pull
3 more numbers.

121
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,781
Mr. White,
What do you think?

122
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,284
I don't know.

123
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,786
I think it would make
A terrific story.

124
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,289
What's a terrific story?

125
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
Kent's high school
Class reunion.

126
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,793
Say!

127
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,795
Could we have
The next number?

128
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,298
It's practically
An American institution.

129
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,300
Most of
My classmates

130
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,302
Are still
In high school.

131
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,307
"33."

132
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,810
I thought the story
Would be about--

133
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,312
33!

134
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,315
How much small
Towns have changed.

135
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,818
Can i go back
To middle America

136
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,821
After having become
A metropolis sophisticate?

137
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:00,326
I was looking around
In my closet last night

138
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,828
And i even found...

139
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,830
My high school sweater.

140
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,335
Uh...Smallville.

141
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,837
So should i make
My travel plans?

142
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,839
What about mine?

143
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,341
All right, Kent.

144
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,344
The prodigal son
Is coming home.

145
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
Gee, thanks, Mr. White.

146
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,351
It's hard losing one
Of my best reporters.

147
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,852
Oh, that's ok.

148
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,854
But you deserve
The vacation, Lois.

149
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
Thank you.

150
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,360
Lois, are you
Going someplace?

151
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,364
Some people get
To go to Smallville.

152
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,367
Others of us
Have to go to...

153
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,368
Bermuda.

154
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,869
Golly.

155
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,372
Bye.

156
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,374
Have a good time.

157
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,377
Mr. White,
The next number, please.

158
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,881
Well, i guess
I'd better be going, too.

159
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,384
So...I’ll be going.

160
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,888
Bye.

161
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,593
Couldn't
A computer do this?

162
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,617
Hey, what is this?

163
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,119
First paycheck?

164
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,121
First rip-off, man.

165
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,124
I'm supposed
To get 225 a week.

166
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,627
How am i supposed
To live on 143.80?

167
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,630
State tax, federal tax,
Social security.

168
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,633
You'll get money
When you're 65.

169
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,135
When I’m 65?

170
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,639
I want mine now,
While i can enjoy it.

171
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,142
I want to get down!

172
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:02,148
It's more like
$143.80 and 1/2 cent.

173
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,150
There are always
Fractions left over

174
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,651
In big corporations,

175
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,153
But they
Round it down.

176
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,155
What am i supposed
To do with 1/2 a cent?

177
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,657
You mean everybody
Loses those fractions?

178
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,659
They don't
Exactly lose them.

179
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,161
You can't lose
What you never got.

180
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,164
So the company
Gets it?

181
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,167
Not really.
They can't be bothered.

182
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,669
Then what
Happens to them?

183
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,672
They're just floating
Around out there.

184
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,674
The computers
Know where.

185
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,176
How many sugars?

186
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,678
One and a half.

187
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,687
It's quitting time.
You coming?

188
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,192
I've got some stuff
To finish up, so...

189
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,693
Working
Overtime, huh?

190
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,197
What you doing,
Looking for a raise?

191
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,201
Yeah.
Looking for a raise.

192
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,220
That's it.

193
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,572
You bet.

194
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,082
But my uncle al
Won't eat her stuffing.

195
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,084
He says it should be cooked
Outside the turkey.

196
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,087
She cooks it on
The inside of the turkey.

197
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,589
Aunt Helen,
My father's half sister--

198
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,092
I told you that,
Right?

199
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,594
Yeah. Hey,
Look at that.

200
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,097
Wow!

201
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:13,112
Turn back or pull over
Here and wait.

202
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,113
For how long?

203
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,115
I don't know.

204
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,118
That fire's spreading
Like wild...fire.

205
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,619
It's just
A building burning.

206
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,122
That's a chemical plant.

207
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,125
You know what i mean,
It's like chemicals.

208
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,626
If that goes
Up in smoke,

209
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,129
We'll be in for
A hairy time around here.

210
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,631
Ok.

211
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,133
Distract these people

212
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,136
So they don't know
What I’m doing.

213
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,637
What are you doing?

214
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,642
The chief says a photographer
Always goes after a story.

215
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,145
That could
Be dangerous.

216
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,648
Danger goes with
The territory, Mr. Kent.

217
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,693
How can i help?

218
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,694
Get this man
A helmet.

219
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,197
Oh, it's you.
Forget the helmet.

220
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,198
How bad is it?

221
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,699
It's a nightmare.

222
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,202
Everything's explosive,
Inflammable, or worse.

223
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,208
Get me a number 3
Ladder truck in here!

224
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,211
My god,
They're trapped!

225
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,714
What's he going to do,
Fly them down one at a time?

226
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,734
Let's go!
Everybody down here!

227
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,736
Hurry up!

228
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,743
Go on down.
Take it easy.

229
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,747
All right,
Everybody down.

230
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,786
You've got to
Get out of here.

231
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,288
I cannot leave.

232
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,291
I've got to
Look after those.

233
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,293
That's concentrated
Beryltric acid.

234
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,296
If it heats
Over 180 degrees,

235
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,799
This fire will
Look like a picnic.

236
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,303
If it remains
Stable, no problem.

237
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,806
If it heats up,
It'll turn volatile.

238
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,308
If that happens,
You'll get a cloud

239
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,810
That'll eat
Through anything--

240
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,812
Steel, concrete, anything.

241
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,825
Who the hell's that?

242
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,827
Get off of there!

243
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,331
I'll just get
A couple more shots.

244
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,840
Oww!

245
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,842
Ahhh!

246
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,349
Have them bring
Their hoses here! Quickly!

247
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,854
Help!

248
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,356
Help!

249
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,358
Help me!

250
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,860
Help!

251
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,862
Somebody help me!

252
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,864
Help!

253
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,866
Superman!
It's my leg.

254
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,368
Take it easy.

255
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,870
We'll go nice and easy.

256
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,873
All right?
Here we go.

257
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,880
Medics!
Over here, please!

258
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,882
That's it.
Here you go.

259
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,884
It's the left leg.

260
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,386
My camera.

261
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,387
Yeah.

262
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,391
It's a clean break
Across the fibula.

263
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,892
Ow! My camera.

264
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,894
It's all right, jimmy.

265
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,396
You'll be ok.

266
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:02,734
Get that fire out, or
You'll have an acid cloud!

267
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,740
Christ!
The pumphouse is gone!

268
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,242
The pumphouse!

269
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,743
We've lost
The water pressure!

270
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,745
We've got
To have water!

271
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,748
Lake Canoga’s
5 miles from here!

272
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,250
Where's this lake?

273
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,253
That way.

274
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,764
You told me we had
An adequate water supply.

275
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,344
That man's a miracle.

276
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,006
Carol, you got gorgeous!

277
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,008
?? Tell Tchaikovsky
The news ??

278
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,511
?? I've got a rockin'
Pneumonia ??

279
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,014
?? I need a shot
Of rhythm and blues ??

280
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,016
?? Whoo ??

281
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,517
?? I think I’ll
Call in all the writers ??

282
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,020
?? Written down
By the rhythm reviews ??

283
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
?? Roll over,
Beethoven ??

284
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,525
?? Rockin' in
Two by two ??

285
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,030
I'll never forget it.

286
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,033
Fourth quarter,
Score was tied.

287
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,036
We were back on
Our 25-yard line.

288
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,539
The coach calls for
Right flanker option.

289
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
?? Roll over, Beethoven ??

290
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,043
?? Rocking in
Two by two ??

291
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,052
You really
Have grown, Clark.

292
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,054
You look very well.

293
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,555
I can't complain.

294
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,059
I have these
Little spells,

295
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,561
But, really,
I can't complain.

296
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,563
?? Well, early
In the morning ??

297
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,065
?? I'm a-giving you
The warning ??

298
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,568
?? Don't you step on
My blue suede shoes ??

299
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,071
?? Hey, diddle-diddle,
I will play my fiddle ??

300
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,073
Excuse me.

301
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,075
There's someone
I'd like to see.

302
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,078
?? And tell Tchaikovsky
The news ??

303
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,579
Lana?

304
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,082
Lana Lang?

305
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,584
It's great
To see you.

306
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,086
You look
Wonderful.

307
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,587
You look...wow!

308
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,089
Here, let me.

309
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,591
Oh, no, no.
I can manage.

310
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,094
Uh...

311
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,597
Isn't this
Your first visit

312
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,099
Since your mom
Passed away?

313
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,101
Yeah--I’m sorry.

314
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,102
Um...

315
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,606
I heard that you
And Donald split up.

316
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,608
Did you eat yet?

317
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,609
No.

318
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,111
I beg your pardon.

319
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,613
Excuse me. Sorry.

320
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,617
That's not right.

321
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,119
You're right about
Donald and me,

322
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,122
But hold this
A second, ok?

323
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,623
Oh, sure.

324
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,126
Hi, Kent.

325
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,628
Oh, hi.
How you...doing?

326
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,630
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,632
I'm going nuts.
Thanks.

328
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,633
?? Well, early
In the morning ??

329
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,635
?? I'm a-giving you
The warning ??

330
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,137
Clark.

331
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,139
Yeah.

332
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,094
The kid needs pointers
From the champ here.

501
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,097
I won the all-country
Bowling championship.

502
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,598
I didn't
Know that.

503
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,600
Actually, i can play
Any sport.

504
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,102
Brad, you'll just
Make it worse.

505
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,604
Clark, he'll
Make it worse.

506
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,613
Watch. He'll get
A spare.

507
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,615
Come on, Ricky.

508
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,118
Hey, kid, you're
Holding it all wrong.

509
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,620
I'll show you.

510
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,122
Uh, brad...

511
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,624
I think he'll
Be better off

512
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,127
Doing it his way.

513
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,630
You got a big
Mouth, Kent.

514
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,632
Ricky doesn't need
A bowling lesson

515
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,134
In front of
The other kids.

516
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,135
He needs a man
To show him.

517
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,636
He's doing fine
On his own.

518
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,138
Excuse me.

519
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,141
Here you go.

520
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,644
Give it
Your best shot.

521
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,148
Oh! Sorry.

522
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,156
Ah-choo!

523
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,665
Gesundheit.

524
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,167
Thank you.

525
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,470
Hey, Gus.

526
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,972
The boss wants
To see you.

527
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,974
He can see me
From here.

528
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,475
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

529
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,979
Not that boss.
The boss.

530
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,981
You mean the boss?

531
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,982
Yep.

532
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,984
Wants to see me?

533
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,487
Why would
He want to see me?

534
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,989
Why would the boss

535
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,991
Want to see me?

536
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,994
There's no reason.

537
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
Oh, i know!

538
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,000
My suggestion for
The volleyball uniforms.

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,501
That's it.

540
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,514
Ross the boss.

541
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,016
Ross the boss.

542
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,018
Bossy Ross the boss.

543
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,521
Be calm, be cool,
Be collected.

544
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,524
Ok, uh...

545
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,526
Mr. Web--Mr. Webster?

546
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,529
Mr. Webster?

547
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,032
Mr. Webster, i did not...

548
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,034
Mr. August Gorman?

549
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,036
Aah! Sir!
August Gorman here.

550
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,538
I know you're
A compassionate man.

551
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,540
I don't want
To go to jail

552
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,044
Because there's
Robbers and rapists--

553
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,545
Just one question.

554
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,547
You've been
A naughty guy,

555
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,049
Haven't you?

556
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,550
Come on, admit it.

557
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,053
You've been
A little bit naughty.

558
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,054
I was--

559
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
That's all right,
I understand.

560
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,059
I can--what do
Young folks say?

561
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,062
"dig where you're
Coming from, brother."

562
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,065
You want
To be rich, right?

563
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,066
Well, i...

564
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
I was born rich.

565
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,069
Never worn
The same socks twice.

566
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,071
What do you do
With your socks?

567
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,572
They're laundered

568
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,575
And sent to some
Charitable institution.

569
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,578
Maybe they're turned
Into dust rags

570
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,580
Or something like that.

571
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,082
Or maybe socks.

572
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,085
Yes. That never
Occurred to me.

573
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,087
Gus, you know
Something?

574
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,588
You're a genius.

575
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,090
A naughty genius,

576
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,591
But nobody's
Perfect.

577
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,592
Cheers!

578
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,594
Because of the thing
With the computers.

579
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,597
Because computers
Rule the world today,

580
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,100
And the fellow
That fools computers

581
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,602
Can rule the world.

582
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,105
I've been searching
For a long time

583
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,107
For somebody to make
These machines do

584
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,609
What they're not
Supposed to do.

585
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,111
Understand?

586
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,112
Yes!

587
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,614
Webscoe, the webscoe
Industrial complex,

588
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,616
Is a family-owned
Cartel.

589
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,118
Little
Magnesium here,

590
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,120
Little zinc there.

591
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,621
You follow me?

592
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,622
I follow you.

593
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,125
You know
What i want now?

594
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,126
No.

595
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,627
I want coffee.

596
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,629
Black?
Cream or sugar?

597
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,131
You don't
Understand.

598
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,133
Under different
Company names,

599
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,135
I control the price
Of coffee beans

600
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,636
In Venezuela, brazil,
Bolivia, Jamaica,

601
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,638
And the republic of Gabon.

602
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,140
But I’ve got a problem,

603
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,142
And i think
You can help me.

604
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,644
One country
Won't play ball.

605
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,146
That can bug a guy.

606
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,647
That could bug...

607
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
What country?

608
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,151
Colombia.

609
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,652
Colombia!

610
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,654
Colombia has 2
Important exports.

611
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
One is coffee.

612
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,159
I've tried
To reason with them.

613
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,661
But this one
Miserable country

614
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,165
Thinks
It can dictate

615
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,666
The economy
Of an open market.

616
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,168
Gus...

617
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,669
Gus, my friend,

618
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,672
We're going to teach
Them a lesson,

619
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,174
Aren't we?

620
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,675
Mr. Webster...

621
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,178
Destroy the Colombian
Coffee crop

622
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,181
Right down
To the last bean.

623
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,683
The last bean?
We are?

624
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,186
But you got so much.

625
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,187
You know--

626
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,189
A wise man said--

627
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,191
I think it was
Attila the Hun--

628
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,194
"it is not enough
That i succeed.

629
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,196
Everyone else
Must fail."

630
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,697
Seems fair.

631
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,698
Gus.

632
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,699
What?

633
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,204
You are going
To do this for me.

634
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,706
How?

635
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,208
The weather.

636
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,711
You didn't tell me
Your mother was here.

637
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,713
I'm his baby sister.

638
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,217
Gus, have you ever
Heard of Vulcan?

639
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,718
Hi, miss Vulcan.

640
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,221
Vulcan is
The weather satellite

641
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,223
That's monitoring
The weather.

642
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,226
If somebody were
To reprogram it,

643
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
It could do more.

644
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,229
It could make weather.

645
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,731
Storms and floods.

646
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,233
Blizzards,
Heat waves.

647
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,734
How do you do that?

648
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,238
Like everything
In the 20TH century,

649
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
You push buttons.

650
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,241
There you go.

651
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,744
It's the first time
I've won anything.

652
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,246
You won my hand.

653
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,747
This is
The first time

654
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,249
I won anything
Valuable.

655
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,751
Get one with
The sombreros.

656
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,754
Mr. White,
You be in this.

657
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
Do i have to?

658
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,757
Why do i?

659
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,758
You're lucky
I didn't fire you.

660
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,760
I get a chance
To get exclusive pictures

661
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,762
Of the biggest chemical
Factory fire in history,

662
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,264
And he comes home
With a broken leg

663
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,766
And 12 melted
Rolls of film.

664
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,268
It was hot.

665
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,270
Smile,
Mr. White.

666
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,273
South America.
What luck!

667
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,776
If you don't want
To be traced,

668
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,280
Punch in to some
Rinky-dink outfit

669
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,782
That has
A Mickey-mouse computer.

670
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,785
Someplace you can
Sneak into, right?

671
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,289
Someplace where
Nobody knows him

672
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,791
So they can't
Connect him with us.

673
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,793
Webscoe has
112 subsidiaries.

674
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,295
They're all linked

675
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,797
Into the central
Computer system.

676
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,800
How about
Someplace...small?

677
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,803
Smallville!

678
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,305
This is Smallville.

679
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,308
We'll have
A 5-minute stop.

680
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,311
Watch your step, please.

681
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,812
Thanks, Selma.

682
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,315
Have a good day.

683
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,321
Let me
Help you, Lana.

684
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,324
Oh, I’m sorry.

685
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,828
Thanks, Clark.

686
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,330
Sit down, buster.
Good boy.

687
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,831
Come on,
Buster.

688
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,333
Sit down!

689
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,834
All set? Great.

690
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,340
Wow.

691
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,352
That's it, ok?

692
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,223
Jesus Christ!

693
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,727
[thunder]

694
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,730
Don't they have
Picnics in metropolis?

695
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,733
Not like this,
Ricky.

696
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,234
We do this a lot.

697
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,736
You do?

698
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,238
Stay close
And be careful.

699
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,740
Ok, mom.

700
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,241
Come on, buster.

701
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,744
Let's find
A rabbit.

702
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,245
This is nice
For him.

703
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:42,747
It's even nicer

704
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,749
When there's
A man around.

705
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,250
There's a lot
Of choices.

706
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,752
All the good
Ones are married.

707
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,753
That's why
Brad thinks

708
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,254
He's god's
Gift to women.

709
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,758
He won't take no
For an answer.

710
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,762
I meant there's a lot
Of choices here.

711
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,764
This is some picnic.

712
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,265
There's some of that...

713
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,268
And...mmm!
Green stuff.

714
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,771
And...hey, pat?.

715
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,276
Boy, this pat?
Is really unusual.

716
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,778
I didn't make pa--

717
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,279
Oh, Clark.

718
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,281
That's buster's
Dog food.

719
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,784
It's good.

720
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,285
Don't eat it!

721
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,787
This is nice.

722
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,788
Here.

723
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,790
It's all right, Lana.

724
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,792
Thanks.

725
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,796
Hey!
Where you going?

726
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,297
Come on! Buster!

727
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,302
How long--
I was thinking--

728
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,805
Sorry. Go ahead.

729
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,306
You.

730
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,310
Well...

731
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,815
I was thinking
Somebody like you

732
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,317
Could do well
In metropolis.

733
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,819
I have to face it.

734
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,320
I'm not going to
Find what i want

735
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,323
In Smallville
Anymore.

736
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,326
Could i make it
In metropolis?

737
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,328
What would i do?

738
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,832
Call me.

739
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,834
I wouldn't want to.

740
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,336
Wouldn't want
To call me?

741
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,339
I wouldn't want
To be a nuisance.

742
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,843
You couldn't
Be a nuisance, Lana.

743
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,847
Clark, may i
Tell you something?

744
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,352
My oil pan
Is leaking.

745
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,860
See? There's
Something dripping.

746
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,361
You need a hand?

747
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,363
No, thanks.

748
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,365
I studied up
On auto repair.

749
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,868
Look at this.

750
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,871
Oh, boy.

751
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,376
[dog whimpering]

752
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,899
Lana, I’ll go see
If Ricky’s all right.

753
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,900
You ok?

754
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,901
Yeah.

755
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,451
Gosh!
Is he all right?

756
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,960
Hi.

757
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,965
Superman?

758
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,466
That's me.

759
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,971
Mom! Mom!

760
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,474
Ricky!

761
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,477
Have him checked
By a doctor.

762
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,479
Thank you.
I'm Lana lang.

763
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,981
This is Ricky.

764
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,482
This is Clark.

765
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,986
I have to be going.
So long, Ricky.

766
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,489
We were flying!

767
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,491
What were you doing?

768
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:48,993
Looking for buster.

769
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,494
Buster!

770
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,996
I found him!

771
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,497
Buster!

772
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,000
Mr. Kent?

773
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,501
Superman was here!

774
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,502
What?

775
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,004
He really was.

776
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,639
Aren't you excited?

777
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
I'm from metropolis.

778
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,643
I see superman
Every day.

779
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,644
You do?

780
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,647
Could you get me
His autograph?

781
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:14,151
If i had a nickel
For every time...

782
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,665
[buzzer rings]

783
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,176
What do you want?

784
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,178
We're in big trouble.

785
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,179
What?

786
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,683
First of all,
They lost the invoice,

787
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,687
Then realized they were
Short on some items.

788
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,190
I rented a car because
I missed the plane.

789
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,695
Had a flat tire
On the highway.

790
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,198
Had to fix it myself
With these pinkies.

791
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,202
I figured your boss
Would be real peeved.

792
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,204
What are you
Talking about?

793
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,708
He'll hang our butts
Against the wall.

794
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,210
He wanted this order
Installed

795
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,212
No later than tomorrow.

796
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,715
I got to set up tonight.

797
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,216
Get what set up?

798
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,728
Pal, you're a real
Lifesaver.

799
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,730
I mean
A real lifesaver!

800
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,231
Where's the office?

801
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,733
Straight ahead.

802
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,734
Follow me.

803
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,235
Right behind you.

804
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,737
Oh, yeah.

805
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,238
Not bad.

806
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,740
Pretty good.

807
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,242
Do you know
What's wrong

808
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,244
With this
Singapore wing?

809
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,747
Sling.
Singapore sling.

810
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,249
What's wrong
With it?

811
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,251
There's not
Enough vodka.

812
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,754
There's no
Vodka in it!

813
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,756
What did
I tell you?

814
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,258
Put some vodka
In it.

815
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,760
What did you...

816
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,261
You know, hey...

817
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,769
There's vodka
In it now, buddy.

818
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,274
Yeah.
Yeah, perfect.

819
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,276
You never pass out,
Do you?

820
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,277
Nope.

821
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,282
Never.

822
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,285
Cowboy's down, buddy.

823
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,288
You thought
I was drunk, too,

824
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,790
Didn't you?

825
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,291
Ha ha! Fooled you.

826
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,793
Get the keys.

827
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,634
Yeowww!

828
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,143
Some...some...
Somebody's drunk.

829
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,647
I'm not drunk.

830
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,153
Hello, baby.

831
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,655
Hello, baby.

832
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,156
Ok.

833
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,158
All right.

834
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,160
Let's get down to it

835
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,162
And let's do it.

836
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,666
One, two,
Button your shoe.

837
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,672
Then put it in...

838
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,684
Both keys...

839
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,186
At the same time?

840
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,688
Ho ho!

841
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,702
Wait. Wait a minute.

842
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,705
You think you've won,
Don't you?

843
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,207
The Philly flash.

844
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,212
Vroom! Vroom!

845
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,217
Vroom! Vroom!

846
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,260
Ok...ready?

847
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,763
1...

848
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,764
2...

849
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,265
3!

850
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:05,808
Yeah. Now...

851
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,312
We'll see
What we'll see.

852
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,893
Oh!

853
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:35,398
Oh...

854
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:47,410
Oh.

855
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,252
Come on.
Please let me in.

856
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,256
There it is!

857
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:35,758
Hello. Now!

858
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:37,760
Getting down to business.

859
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:42,264
I am a genius.

860
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:46,268
I am a...

861
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,278
Um...longitude.

862
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:59,782
And the other thing...
Latitude, right?

863
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,299
Oh, look, morey.

864
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,801
A native wedding.

865
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,304
[speaking Spanish]

866
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:36,819
Iarriba!

867
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:47,830
They never told us
This was the rainy season.

868
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,368
Newscaster:
Meteorologists are baffled

869
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,371
By the tornado
And torrential rainstorms

870
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:31,373
That struck Colombia
This afternoon,

871
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,876
Threatening to destroy
The nation's coffee crop

872
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:36,378
For the next 5 years.

873
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:37,880
Gale-force winds
Up to 250 miles an hour

874
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,383
Have lashed
The countryside,

875
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:43,385
While 12 inches
Of rainfall

876
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:46,388
Have been recorded
In one day.

877
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:48,057
A spokesman from Caltech

878
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:51,560
Said this was the most
Awesome display of--

879
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,062
Turn it off!

880
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:55,064
If i laugh harder,

881
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,066
I'll split my sides.

882
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,568
...seems to defy
All laws of weather systems

883
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:01,570
Known to science.

884
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:08,077
Poor little Colombia.

885
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:11,580
Well.
Ha ha ha ha!

886
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:22,091
Ooh! I'll get you
For that,

887
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,592
You big silly!

888
00:54:23,592 --> 00:54:27,096
Bubba, do you realize
What we're on to?

889
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:31,100
Do i? Every time
A drunk sobers up,

890
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,601
He'll drink
Webster coffee.

891
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:34,103
Why stop at coffee?

892
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:37,606
Coffee gets
The world off to work.

893
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:40,609
But what keeps
The world working?

894
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:42,611
Diet soda?

895
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:44,613
Vera, you mean...

896
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:46,115
You mean--

897
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:48,617
Today, coffee...

898
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,120
Tomorrow, the oil!

899
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,121
Oil?

900
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:54,623
If Gus Gorman can push
The right buttons--

901
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:57,126
I can have it all.

902
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,629
All the oil,
All the pumps,

903
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:02,631
All the tankers.

904
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:04,133
This is some
Nifty idea, Vera.

905
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:05,134
Boss!

906
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:07,136
Just the man
I want to see.

907
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:10,139
It is not my fault.

908
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,141
What's
Not your fault?

909
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:14,643
Superman started
Doing his thing

910
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:17,146
When you started
Doing yours.

911
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:19,648
What are you
Talking about?

912
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,150
What am i--

913
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,652
It was on
Television, man.

914
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:25,654
Don't call me man.

915
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:28,657
I saw Colombia
Bite the dust.

916
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:32,161
You didn't see the man
Flying out of the sky

917
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:34,663
With his cape
Flapping in the...

918
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:42,171
His cape was
Flapping in the wind.

919
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:45,674
He was flying!
He was great! Wooshhh!

920
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,178
His cape blew
In the wind like this,

921
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:52,181
And he landed
In the middle

922
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:54,183
Of this big plantation.

923
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:58,187
He checked everything out
With his x-ray vision.

924
00:55:58,187 --> 00:56:00,689
Then he put laser beams

925
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,692
Out of his eyes
Onto everything.

926
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:05,194
Bzzzz!

927
00:56:05,194 --> 00:56:07,196
And guess what?

928
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:09,698
Dried up everything,
Just like that!

929
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:11,200
Dried it up

930
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,702
Like machines
In men's rooms,

931
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:17,206
You know, where
The hot air comes out?

932
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,208
Sometimes
They don't work.

933
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,709
But superman's worked.

934
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:23,712
And you think he took bows?

935
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:26,715
No, sir.
He flies off again!

936
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:29,218
He saw what
Caused the trouble

937
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:31,220
And flew
Into the tornado,

938
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,224
Went down to the bottom
Of the tornado,

939
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,226
And turned it
Upside down!

940
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:40,229
I thought
I'd go crazy!

941
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:43,232
I've never seen
Anything like it!

942
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:46,735
The big end was
On the bottom.

943
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:50,239
The little end
Was on the top.

944
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:52,241
Mr. Ross, it was...

945
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:56,245
Superman's bad.

946
00:56:56,245 --> 00:56:58,747
I'll say he was.

947
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:01,250
I mean, he was bad!

948
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,251
No.

949
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:03,252
No!

950
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:04,253
No!

951
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:06,255
Let me help.

952
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,258
It was a perfect plan,
Foolproof!

953
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:10,759
We were the fools.

954
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,262
It's not my fault.

955
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:14,763
I did what i was
Supposed to do.

956
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,265
He ruined it.

957
00:57:16,765 --> 00:57:19,268
The lousy do-gooder
Ruined it.

958
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:23,772
Now he'll stick his nose
Into my oil scheme

959
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:25,774
And ruin that, too.

960
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,777
I've got to
Get rid of him.

961
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,280
But how,
Shoot him?

962
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,781
Kryptonite.

963
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:33,782
What?

964
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:36,785
Or kryptonham...

965
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:38,287
Or kryptonheimer?

966
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:41,290
There's stuff that
Can hurt superman.

967
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,292
How would you know?

968
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,793
I know some things.

969
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:48,297
So i understand from
The graffiti I’ve seen.

970
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:49,798
She's right.

971
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:52,801
Kryptonite! I remember
Reading about it.

972
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:54,303
Where does
It come from?

973
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:55,804
The same planet
Superman came from--

974
00:57:55,804 --> 00:57:56,805
Krypton.

975
00:57:56,805 --> 00:58:00,309
Where is krypton?

976
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,311
It blew up in space
Many years ago.

977
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:05,814
They sent superman here
When he was a baby.
