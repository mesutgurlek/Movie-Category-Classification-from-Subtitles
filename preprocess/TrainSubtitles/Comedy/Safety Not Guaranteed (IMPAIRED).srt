I guess I remember being
happy when I was a kid.

just naturally expect
good things to happen.

and try not to
get my hopes up.

the question?

where they're from and
where they worked before.

already overqualified.

as your boss.

I'm going out of town
for a few days.

No, it's just
this work thing.

00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,356
Yeah, I think it'd be
great if you went out,
did a Iittle social stuff.

98

Get out of your funk.

to describe it.

brought a guy home.

I'm thinking. We're
budgeted for two rooms,

134
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,887
but if we share a room,

135
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,806
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.

136
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,516
What, drugs?

00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,341
Reminds me of
going back to school.

159
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,928
Yes. It's all one
Iong school year now.

160
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,722
No start, no finish.

161
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,808
Except for this guy.

162
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,311
How many years till
you graduate, Arnau?

163
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,855
Total, including doctorate
or just undergraduate?

164
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,565
Ah, forget it.

165
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,823
How're we doing
the beds?

166
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,117
We'll do me in one,
interns on the other.

167
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,702
Okay.
No.

168
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,746
Cool. Me and Darius.

169
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,830
(SCOFFS)

170
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,166
Fine. I hope
you moisturize, Arnau,
'cause I cuddle.

171
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,753
Tomorrow morning first thing,
we hit the post office.

172
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,422
Let's hope our boy checks
his P.O. Box every day.

173
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,132
There she is.

174
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
What?

175
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,141
"Wanted, someone to travel
back in time with me,

Mmm, no way.
He's too old to
be time traveling.

Come on. That's
the time traveling demo.

White beards,
spectacles, pipes.

184
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:51,966
Aww.

185
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,092
Close.

186
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,301
Wait, what about this one?

187
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,387
DARIUS: Yeah.
She wants to stop whoever

188
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,389
gave her that haircut
from being born.

(GROANS)

190
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
Yo! Yo! It's him.
It's the guy.

191
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,591
ARNAU: Him? Are you sure?

192
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,594
Yeah, I'm sure.
Box 91. Get in.

193
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,596
Wait, what are you doing?
Following him.

194
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,598
What about Jeff?
You should call him!

195
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,975
(ENGINE STARTING)

196
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,664
KENNETH: That's
pretty amazing stuff, man.

197
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,542
I'll tell you about
the cat in the box theory,
it'll blow your mind.

198
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,170
It's Iike I'm the only
one who really gets it.
You know?

199
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,047
I started this dialog
with some big shot

200
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,882
theoretical physicist online,

201
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,675
and I'm Iike,
"Do the rules of quantum

202
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,427
"mechanics allow for
alternate histories?"

203
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,970
And he just blasted me.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
You know, people are
just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,

205
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,351
but they're just,
Iike, Iooking at
this Iittle sliver of time,

206
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,435
that's all people can see.

207
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,354
It's not a fixed thing,
Shannon.

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,106
You know, it's on and on
in both directions.

209
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,690
It's Iike a "V,"
you know what I mean?

210
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,275
I gotta do
a bathroom check, brother.

211
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,111
Yeah, we're...
You know what I'm saying.

212
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,281
DARIUS: I'd Iike to
fill out a comment card

213
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,283
on one of your employees,
Kenneth.

214
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,701
What's his Iast name?

215
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,371
Sorry, ma'am,
he's a Iittle...

216
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,624
No, no,
it's a positive comment.
It's Iike complimenting him.

217
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,003
Oh. Oh, good.
Um, Kenneth Calloway.

218
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,172
Calloway.

219
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,637
Thanks.

220
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,600
JEFF: Hit the thing
that says I have
a new message.

221
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,562
"Liz confirmed you
on Facebook."

222

(SMACKS)

223
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,399
Here. No photos,
that's a drag.

224
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,402
Okay, good.
She still Iives here.
She Iives in this town.

225
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,654
Who is Liz McHollis?

226
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,739
She was a girl
I had a fling with

227
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,658
when my family used to
come here over the summers.

228
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,620
She was this really
smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blow job.

229
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,333
If there's one girl
that I still
think about, honestly.

230
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,173
Here she is. Look at you,
you went all rogue.
What did you get?

231
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,507
Got his name,
where he works.

232
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,842
Great.

233
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,469
What did you guys get?

234
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,474
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.

235
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,600
What?

236
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,478
He came here to hook up
with an old high
school girlfriend.

237
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,938
Seriously? That's
what you've been doing?

238
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,357
Well, I've been doing
other stuff too, but

239
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,651
maybe this will
change your attitude
a Iittle bit.

240
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,654
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.

241
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,739
So?

242
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,824
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.

243
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,493
I'd be weirded out
if some guy tried

244
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,119
to track me down
after 20 years.

245
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,039
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried
to track you down.

246
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,790
DARIUS: Why?
JEFF: Who would do that?

247
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,793
Tomorrow morning,
I'll go in.

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,671
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad

249
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,090
and get the scoop
on this yo-yo.

250
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,434
991 Mallory.
This is definitely it.

251
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
What a piece of shit.

252
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
AII right,
I'm goin' in.

253
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,316
How do I Iook,
Arnau? Good.

254
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,442
Good.

255
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,152
Can I go in?
No, you did
good Iast night,

256
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,780
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna
overwhelm the guy.

257
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,032
AII right?
Wish me Iuck.

258
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,876
So, uh...

259
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,714
Do you go out
a Iot back home,
Iike clubs and stuff?

260
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,258
Not really.

261
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,511
You know those
really tight Ieggings
that girls wear,

262
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,846
do you ever wear those?

263
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,139
No.

264
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,184
I think you would
Iook nice in them.

265
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,286
Hello?

266
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,841
JEFF: Kenneth?

267
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,925
(SLAMS)

268
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,222
Kenneth?
Kenneth Calloway, right?

269
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,975
Is that right?

270
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,022
My name is Jeff.

271
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,611
Look, I saw your ad
in the classifieds.

272
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,904
I wanna know if
you need a partner.

273
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,575
What's your mission?

274
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,035
What do you mean
what's my mission?

275
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,911
What's your reason
for going back?

276
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,833
Well, who wouldn't want
to go back? It's
an amazing opportunity.

277
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,793
To go back in time,
you know?

278
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,672
See gladiators
and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.

279
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,967
Have sex with a pilgrim.

280
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,762
Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.

281
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,096
Who wouldn't want
to go back, Kenneth?

282
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,890
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?

283
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,939
Well, do you need a partner?

284
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,572
Can you Iook fear
and danger in the eye?

285
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,115
That's an odd question.

286
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,535
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye

287
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,746
and said, "Yes"?

288
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,208
Sure.

289
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,376
Get off my porch.

290
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,920
Let's start over.
Come on, we could be pals.

291
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,548
Let's go back in time.

292
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,344
Man, that smile...

293
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,138
What is that smile?

294
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,974
You don't know pain.

295
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,267
I don't know pain?

296
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,352
You don't know regret.

297
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah. AII right.

298
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,480
You don't know...
Okay.

299
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
Well, it was
really nice to meet you.

300
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,578
That's what I thought.

301
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,831
(SIGHING)

302
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,667
So, what'd he say?

303
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,420
Well, he's the real deal.
That ad is no prank.

304
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,215
He's not Iike retarded,
but there's something
wrong with this guy.

305
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,759
Definitely didn't
Iike my ass,
I'll tell you that.

306
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,511
So, what,
that's it?

307
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,304
Oh, no,
this just got good.

308
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,307
What makes you think
he won't slam
the door in my face, too?

309
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,476
'Cause you gotta be
sincere and charm him,
okay?

310
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,104
He's used to assholes
Iike me coming and
making fun of him.

311
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,274
Uh, also probably
none of the other people

Um, I think that guy
is recording
our conversation.

465
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,901
Is there
somewhere else we can go?

Come on.

467
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,035
Stay close. Yeah.
Are you okay?

468
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,620
I really would have
messed that guy up

469
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,288
if I wasn't trying to
keep such a Iow profile.

I'm glad I got to see
your qualities, though.

471
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,626
I think you're ready
for the next step,
some basic training.

That's all for tonight.

I'm walking out!

By choice.

Seriously?

476
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,437
This place is a dump.
Let's get out of here.

477
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,106

00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,949
Pretty good. You might
be a one arm shooter.

480
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,993
Okay, I'll try it.
Let's just Ioosen it up.

481
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,786
You ready?
Yeah.

482
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,375
Yeah! You smoked him!

483
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,626
I smoked him.

Come on!

00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,505
I think I'm
getting better than you.

Hey, Iet's not get ahead
of yourself here, okay?

487

It's one thing to
hit a target
that's standing still,

488
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,056
but think about it
when the heat's moving in.

of this mission.

Then I have to tell you
that it's personal.

521

Darius, sometimes
I think we are progressing
in this mission,

522
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,626
and then other times,
I'm not so sure.

523

I'm going back to
stop my mother from dying

00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,436
How'd she die?

525
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,772
She was killed by some guy.

526

Just some guy
at a gas station
took her and killed her.

Oh, man.
Just some random thing?

Yeah.

Well, no, actually.

530
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,005
She was driving home.
It was really Iate,

531
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,009
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...

532
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,057
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.

533
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,061
Because I had to
have chocolate milk.

534
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,150
So Iike five minutes Iater,
she called me

535
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,404
to tell me that she
got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.

536
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,240
And her voice was Iike,

00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,203
really excited,
Iike she was really happy.

538
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:37,126
And I was,
Iike, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.

539
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,798
That was the Iast time
I talked to her.

540
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,426
That's not your fault.

541
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,806
Yeah. That's
what they tell me.

542
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,562
AII right, Darius.

543
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,651
I think you're ready.
I trust you.

544

but work's
getting crazy and...

553
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:57,582
I was sad 'cause you
got me thinking about you
on that Facebook.

554
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,169
I never thought
I'd see you again.

555
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:06,549
Oh, God, excuse me.
Would you come in?

556

00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,727
Yeah. I changed it.

561
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,021
It's just about the only
thing I've changed.

It's not that exciting.

You know what?

576
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,595
I always thought
you'd do something
special with your Iife.

577

If you knew what
it was really Iike,

578
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,723
you wouldn't say
it was special.

I made some pies.

00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
something incredible
has happened.

623
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,545
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.

624
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,046
While I would Iike
to maneuver through

625
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,423
this world with
an open heart and mind,

626
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,883
sometimes that
doesn't gain you favor.

627
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,093
So I just need to be
equipped with
the necessary skill sets,

628
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,554
guns, training,
weapons, fighting,

629
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,223
in case I encounter
any obstacles that
need to be defeated.

630
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,058
The area is clear.
DARIUS: Oh, my God!

631
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,268
Mission accomplished.

632
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
Wow! Man,
that was intense.

633
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,314

634
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,816
KENNETH: The mission
has to do with regret

635
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,153
and the mission has
to do with mistakes.

636
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,114
The mission's
also about Iove.

637
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,747

in some of this
equipment or something?

639
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,669
Can we talk
about something else?

640
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,758
So it's very important
that you and I do not
abuse the power

641
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,176
that will come
with our knowledge
of the future.

642
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,805
No matter how tempting
it will be to
gain personal fortune

643
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,058
or notoriety by say,
being the first
person to Iist

644
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,685

down, down, Ieft-right,
Ieft-right, B-A-start.

645
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,272
Or to say,
"Hey, Ieave your Star Wars
figurines in the box

646
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,858
"'cause they'll be
worth Iike hundreds more
if they are super pristine."

647
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,862
But what about if it's,
Iike, for the betterment
of future society?

648
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,825
Absolutely not.
We have to stick to the plan.

649
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,496
So when do you fill
me in on the plan?

650
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,374
Pretty soon.

651

all the other kids.

669

My parents could only
afford one prosthetic,

670
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,698
so I had to wait
until I was fully-grown.

a big deal, right?

777
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,560
It's okay.

778
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,399
It's just...

779
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,613
It's a girl.

780
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,412
My reason for
going back is a girl.

781
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,207
Who was she?

782
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,917
She's my first girlfriend.

783
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,004
Her birthday was
the exact same day

784
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,173
in April as
mine is in October.

785
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,510
We ended up working
at the same restaurant.

786
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,845
She was just so nice to me.

787
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:46,099
She would make me
special food

788
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:51,188
and after work,
while all her friends
were getting ready to go out,

789
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,108
she would just hang out
and talk with me.

790
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,361
She was really pretty.

791
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,739
What happened to her?

792
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,909
She died.

793
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,665
Some jerk,

794
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,089
some a-hole jerk
in a band got drunk

795
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,135
and crashed his car
into her Iiving room.

796
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,265
I should have
been there, you know.

797
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,147
People tell you that

798
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,442
there are other girls
out there, you know, and

799
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,611
it's not just about a girl,
it's about...

800
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,740
It's about a time
and a place.

801
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,827
Do you have a favorite song?

802
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,667
Would you tell me
what it is?

803
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,960
It's stupid.

804
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,294
What is it?

00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,340
Over the Rainbow.

806
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,427
It's a really
beautiful song.

807
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,765
It's that time and
that place and that song,

808
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,102
and you remember
what it was Iike
when you're in that place,

809
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,562
and then you
Iisten to that song,

810
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,564
and you know
you're not in that place

811
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,607
anymore and it
makes you feel hollow.

812
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,859
Mmm-hmm.

813
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,612
Can't just go find
that stuff again.

814
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,871
I Iike your reason
for going back.

815
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,420
It's really nice.

00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,478
What kind of Iasers?

a frickin' Stormtrooper.

He's over there right now

a frickin' time machine.

822
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,067
Hey, Arnau,
what are the chances

823
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,152
he can do that
with these Iasers?

824
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,570
How would I know, I'm not a...
He doesn't know.

He's not a frickin'
Stormtrooper either.

know anything about
Iasers or time travel,

Isn't this Iike
violating his privacy?

00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,323
I used to come up here

935
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,783
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was Iittle.

936
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,452
Do you know
what Star Wars is?

937
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,038
Yes.
Yeah.

938
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:14,250
So, when I was younger,
I used to bring my
Star Wars figures up here,

939
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,752
'cause I didn't
wanna Ieave 'em

940
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,211
back at the house
'cause they'd get Ionely.

941
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:21,299
And some of
the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,

942
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,551
they would throw them
in the fire and stuff...
Really?

943
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,929
This was before my
martial arts training,
of course.

944
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,972
But I found
this hiding spot

945
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,516
and sneak out here
at night,

946
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,645
and put 'em in the tin,
take them out,

947
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,022
then put them back
in the morning and...

948
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,148
Anyway...

949
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,651
I wish I could see you
when you were a Iittle kid.

950
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,320
I was not as impressive
as I am now,
I can assure you.

951
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,155
What?
Yeah.

952
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,617
Okay.

953
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,827
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.

954
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,454
Come on.

955
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,931
That was the best sex
I've ever had.
And I've had a Iot of sex.

956
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,017
That's what you said
about the roast chicken.

957
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,353
That was the best
roast chicken I ever had.

958
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,315
You don't know
how Iong I've
thought about this.

959
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,069
You've become this,
Iike, character

960
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,281
in my head that's Iike,
it feels Iike
you're from a fairy tale,

961
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:30,535
and you're Iike this purity
that's just not in my Iife.

962
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,996
Aww.

963
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,706
You are so cute.

964
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,503
Hey.
This is gonna sound crazy.

965
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,340
I want you to come
to Seattle with me.

966
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,969
What?
Yeah.

967
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,639
(CHUCKLES) It's crazy,
but I want you to come...

968
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,349
Jeff, the minute you
drive out of this place,

969
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:54,976
you are not going to
want to be with me.

970
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,146
That's just not true.
That's what I'm saying,
I mean, do you not feel this?

971
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,605
You're not in your
right mind right now.

972
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,982
I'm absolutely
in my right mind.

973
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,192
This is the clearest
I've been in a Iong time.

974
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,531
I've done this before.

975
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,241
You haven't done it with me.

976
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,993
No, I've done this
before and I'm too old.

977
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,828
We're the same damn age.

978
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
Oh.

979
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,346
That's perfect.

980
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,640
That's unbelievable.

981
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,480
Unbelievable. Okay.
Great. This is good.

982
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,940
This is perfect.
I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.

983
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,692
You're right.
You know what?

I think you're being
a Iittle crazy about this.

989
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,622
Yeah. I think you're
crazy for saying no.

990

Are you ready to have
a crazy night with me?
'Cause I'm ready.

00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,163

Well, I just kind
of set up here,

1018
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,918
the Boy Scouts don't
really come up here
after September, so

What's that?
Is that a guitar?

1028

No, it's called a zither.

Iiked music, so...

I always wished I could have
played her something,

1034
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,088
so I've been writing her
this song for when
I see her again.

1035
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,798
Will you play it?

It's...
Please?

No, it's not finished
and it's really just
not very good, so...

Well, I'll tell you

Do you just wanna
see me get embarrassed?

1090
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:21,672
No!

1091
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,758
Arnau, come here, man.
Come here.

1092
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,845
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.

1093
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:31,098
You're not gonna
get this opportunity
very much Ionger.

1094
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,185
(CHUCKLES) You're not always
gonna be 21, young man.

1095
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,479
I promise you fucking that.

1096
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:40,316
(STAMMERING) I don't know.
I don't know what to...
How do I start?

1097
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,568
First of all, take
these pedophile glasses off

1098
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,529
and don't wear these,
they make you Iook
Iike a weirdo, man.

1099
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm gonna put these on you.
Holy shit!

1100
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,992
Look at that killer.

1101
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,702
That dude right there
crushes chicks.

1102
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,622
I would take a photo
of you and show you how
good you Iooked right now,

1103
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,915
'cause you Iook fantastic.

1104
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,082
You Iook Iike a damn pilot.

1105
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,292
Okay.

1106
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,711
Like a cool pilot
who drives jets.

1107
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,047
Pop this shit. Uh-oh!

1108
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,133
Boom, boom, boom.

1109
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:07,384
Act Iike you've
been there before.

1110
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,386
You're not gonna
be your age forever.

1111
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,388
One day, you're
gonna be the old dirtbag.

1112
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,309
AII by yourself.
This is the moment
you Iive for.

1113
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,393
Okay.
Okay?

1114
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,187
Okay.

1115
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,235
Hey, Halloween,
you smoke?

1116
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,940
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1117
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,617
Yeah.

1118
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:55,826
Jeff, what the fuck?

1119
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,786
It's so early, Bridget.

1120
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,831
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what
you're doing down there?

1121
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,125
Yes. That's what I'm doing.

1122
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,296
I've been going over
the notes that
you've been sending in.

1123
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,967
This Belinda St. Sing,
the ex-girlfriend he said
died in an accident.

1124
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,677
Is that her name?

1125
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,971
Yeah, that's right.
Why?

1126
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,362
You're past curfew.

1127
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,447
Were those girls with you?

1128
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,948
100 % Arnau.
Mmm.

1129
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,825
Hey, you know that
girl your boyfriend

1130
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,661
was going back in time
to save, Belinda?

1131
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,745
Yeah?

1132
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,957
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.

1133
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,003
Uh...
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

1134
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,630
How? What do you mean?

1135
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,382
Bridget called and
set up an interview.

1136
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,218
I think
your Iittle boyfriend
is seriously nuts.

1137
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,145
Yeah, I know,
he's totally nuts.

1138
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,064
He's completely crazy.
I know.

1139
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,400
So she's alive. Okay.

1140
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,194
I wanna do the interview.

1141
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,696
That's fine.

1142
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,581
You sure
you got this, kiddo?

1143
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,543
Yeah?

1144
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,813
Darius?
Hi.

1145
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,440
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1146
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,108
Nice to meet you.

1147
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,735
Come on in.

1148
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,571
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.

1149
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,158
He worked at Anderson's,

1150
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,785
which was
the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,

1151
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,704
and he was really nice.

1152
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:08,417
Different just than
the typical guys, I guess.

1153
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,169
So how Iong were
you guys together?

1154
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,837
Uh...

1155
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,507
Well, we were never
really together, together.

1156
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,594
You never dated?

1157
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,431
I mean, I wouldn't call
it dating. He was, um...

1158
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,976
He was one of
those guys, who

1159
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,145
you kind of know
has a crush on you,

1160
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,940
but he's really nice
and so you're
really nice back.

1161
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,987
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily, um,

1162
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,992
fit into your Iife,
you know, with your
friends and everything.

1163
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,660
He was

1164
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,791
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?

1165
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,837
Yeah. Yeah,
I know what you mean.

1166
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,842
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?

1167
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,928
After that,
I started dating Rob,

1168
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:04,139
who was my Iast boyfriend
before I met my husband,

1169
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,434
and then Kenneth
quit the restaurant.

1170
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:11,063
I didn't see him for
a while after that.

1171
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,106
Then there was the accident.

1172
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,610
Accident?

1173
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,657
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.

1174
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,826
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.

1175
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:24,952
My God!

1176
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,539
So I convinced Rob
to just Iet him go
and we...

1177
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,291
We told the police
it was a hit and run.

1178
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,544
I haven't seen him
since then.

1179
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,838
But you said
you've seen him recently.

1180
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:37,881
How is he?

1181
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,553
He's good.

1182
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,363
Excuse me.
Darius?

1183
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,658
Can we have
a moment of your time?

1184
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,827
Nothing to be
alarmed about.

1185
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,079
We'd just Iike to
ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.

1186
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,499
Whoa. Guys?
We're from
Seattle Magazine.

1187
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,334
We're just here doing
a story on this guy.

1188
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,670
We're not involved
with what he's
involved with.

1189
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,838
What do you want with him?

1190
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,507
SMITH: He's been contacting
government scientists
on the Internet,

1191
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:24,011
asking questions
about our particle
accelerator in Berkeley.

1192
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,512
We've been
investigating Calloway

1193
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,598
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him
of being an agent.

1194
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,765
He can't be a spy.

1195
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
He was arrested
in Colorado for

1196
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,352
breaking into
a nuclear physics
Iaboratory.

1197
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,104
And then there was
the recent robbery

1198
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,606
at a medical
research center here.

1199
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,940
Oh, yeah?
And what did he take?

1200
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,903
Are you sure it was him
that broke into
the medical research place?

1201
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,070
You have evidence?

1202
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:43,906
We're confident.

1203
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,617
He hasn't been
back to his house
in the past 24 hours.

1204
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,118
Give us a call if
you hear from him?

1205
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Will do.

1206
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,456
Thank you.
Thank you.

1207
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,294
So, what's
your story about?

1208
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,755
Oh, the story.

1209
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,381
(CHUCKLES)

1210
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,300
I don't know anymore,
actually.

1211
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,973
You all right?

1212
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,605
You sure?

1213
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,275
Yeah.

1214
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1215
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,134
Kenneth?

1216
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,682
Kenneth? I'm coming in.

1217
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,734
KENNETH: Darius?

1218
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,403
Hey. What are
you doing here?

1219
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,282
Everything's set.

1220
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,993
We move the machine
to the Iaunch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.

1221
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,619
How'd you get in here
anyway? The spooks

1222
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,163
are all over me.
It's crazy out there.

1223
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,581
I had to sneak in
through the back.

1224
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,417
Hey, we need to talk.

1225
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,755
About Iast night. I know.

1226
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,051
Last night

1227
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,720
was a thunderbolt.

1228
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,681
But I realize

1229
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,642
our working relationship
became complicated,

1230
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:22,230
so for now, maybe
we just re-focus and
concentrate on the mission.

1231
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,565
Whose house is this?

1232
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:28,070
It's my house.
My parents Ieft it to me.

1233
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,405
Where are the Iasers?
Can you show me the Iasers?

1234
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,116
What's wrong with your voice?

1235
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,951
Where's the time machine?

1236
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,536
The time machine is
at the Iaunch site.

1237
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,163
Oh, right,
it's at the Iaunch site.

1238
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,456
Darius.

1239
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,959
What are you doing?

1240
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,129
I talked to those guys
who are following you.

1241
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,508
And they told me
that you stole
those Iasers because

1242
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,260
you're some kind
of spy or something.

1243
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,347
That's perfect.
Let them think that,

1244
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,933
it works in our favor.
It's better. Seriously.

1245
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
I also talked to Belinda.

1246
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,980
What?
Yeah.

1247
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,649
You did not talk to Belinda.

1248
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,733
Yeah, I did.

1249
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,568
I talked to Belinda.
I was just at her house.

1250
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,986
No! No!

1251
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,448
What are you doing?

1252
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,290
She's alive!
She's alive! Okay.

1253
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:24,668
This is good. Okay.

1254
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,587
This means
the mission must have

1255
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,631
been successful,
and we have saved her

1256
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,633
and we've come
back to the present...
Hey, hey...

1257
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:35,428
Hey, you can be
honest with me, okay?

1258
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,097
I really Iike you.

1259
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,348
Okay.

1260
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,267
Yes. But this is the thing.

1261
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:43,895
It's a complicated science
and cannot be
measured by our brains...

1262
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,438
You can't time travel!

1263
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,984
This is all crazy.
Okay, you Iied to me.

1264
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,360
Listen to me.

1265
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,528
What else are
you Iying about?

1266
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,738
Hey, hey, Iisten to me.

1267
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,826
You come to that
Iaunch site at 5:00 p.m.,

1268
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,789
you take my hand
and I'll show you
who can't time travel.

1269
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,670
Oh, shit!

1270
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,009
AII right?

1271
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,179
Darius! They're
right behind the house!

1272
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,014
Wait...
They're right behind me.

1273
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,640
Wait, you're with that guy?

1274
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,685
Are you...
No.

1275
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,103
Were you making fun of me?

1276
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,271
No, I would have never...

1277
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,647
Nobody was making
fun of you, Kenneth.

1278
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,066
We are writing
an honest piece about
you for a magazine.

1279
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,902
Magazine? Darius, don't...

1280
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:33,153
We're not
making fun of you.

1281
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,237
Get out of my house!

1282
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,655
JEFF: We're on your side.
We're here to help.

1283
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,073
No, I'm Ieaving tonight!

1284
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,630
So is he really building
a time machine or what?

1285
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,964
Why did you
make me do this?

1286
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,342
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.

1287
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,636
You don't care
about the story!
You don't care about him.

1288
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,512
You just came here
to hook up with
old girlfriends.

1289
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:00,680
What's going on?

1290
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,890
Hey, guys,
check this out.

1291
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,099
It's open.

1292
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,739
Watch your head.

1293
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,203
I know what they
were Iooking for.
I saw it, it was Iike a,

1294
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,080
Iike a jet engine
or something.

1295
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,926
JEFF: It's gone!

1296
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,724
Darius, have you
seen this stuff before?

1297
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,482
What the hell was
he building in here?

1298
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,486
DARIUS: I don't know.

1299
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,993
You don't think
he actually built it,
do you?

1300
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,161
Holy shit!

1301
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,006
Move!

1302
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:21,970

1305
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,585
Kenneth, I'm sorry.

1306
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:37,879
Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?

1307
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,756
No.

1308
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,050
I promise.

1309
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,595
I Iied about the story,
but everything else

1310
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,597
was real, okay?
That was really me.

1311
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:57,982
Then get on.

1312
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,407
Come with me.

1313
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,972
The mission's been updated.

1314
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,100
I'm going back for you now.

1315
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,105
AII right. You trust me?

1316
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:43,820
Come on.

1317
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:50,285
Take my hand.
I know what
I'm doing, okay?

1318
01:19:56,292 --> 01:20:00,003
Flip that switch.
Do it. Flip it down.

1319
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,359
Are you ready?

1320
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,555
Go!

KENNETH: ...to go it alone
or to go with a partner.

1323
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,632
When you choose a partner,
you have to

1324
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,634
have compromises
and sacrifices,

1325
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,885
but it's the price you pay.

1326
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:32,845
Do I wanna follow
my every whim and desire

1327
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,514
as I make my way
through time and space?

1328
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:35,598
Absolutely.

1329
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,559
But at the end
of the day, do I

1330
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:39,477
need someone when
I'm doubting myself,

1331
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,563
and I'm insecure and
my heart's failing me?

1332
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,983
Do I need someone who,
when the heat gets hot,
has my back?
