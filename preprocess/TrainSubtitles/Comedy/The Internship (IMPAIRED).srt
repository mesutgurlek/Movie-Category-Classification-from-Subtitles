00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,004
(Dramatic fanfare)

00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,153
MAN (singing along to stereo):
¶ An old man turned 98

3
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,889
¶ He won the lottery

4
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,957
¶ And he died the next day...

5
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,292
MAN 2:
What the shit is this?

6
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,094
Why is this on
the get-psyched mix?

7
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,328
'Cause I got to throw you
a curveball

8
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,763
every now and then
or you get bored,

9
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,598
and then the mix doesn't have
its intended effect.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,334
No, I want to get revved up,
and this song's not doing it.

11
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,704
Oh, really? I defy you to crush
this chorus and not get psyched.

12
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,106
Not going to happen.

13
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,708
¶ Don't you think?

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,311
¶ It's like rain

15
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,046
¶ On your wedding day

16
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,181
What is it?

17
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,817
¶ It's a free ride

18
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,019
¶ When you already paid
¶ That you already take

19
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,021
¶ It's the good advice

20
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,456
Help me out!

21
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,358
¶ That you just didn't take

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,095
¶ And who would've thought?

23
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,064
¶ You figure
¶ It figures

24
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,967
¶ Mr. Play It Safe
- Classic Alanis.

25
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,535
¶ Was afraid to fly...

26
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,703
He was afraid.

27
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,273
MAN 2: Bring it home.
MAN 1: Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,677
MAN 2:
Come on, <i>papi.</i> Yes!

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,545
(chuckling)

30
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,080
We've got our jam on now.
- Jump to it.

31
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,648
MAN 2:
<i>It's been a dry June,</i>

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,617
and I know it doesn't need
to be said out loud,

33
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,952
but we need this sale.
- I am so confident

34
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,387
that we're going
to close this thing

35
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,288
that I'm going to order
the Pappy Van Winkle.

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,890
I know it's pricey,
but I want

37
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,592
to spiritually invest
in our success.

38
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,760
I'll tell you what, if you
didn't order the Pappy,

39
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,196
I'd send your raggedy ass
back out to the car

40
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,099
to listen to the get-psyched mix
to get your mind right.

41
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,099
Let's go over the
stat sheet. Hit me.

42
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,635
We're selling Bob Williams.
Been married 16 years.

43
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,103
Wife Karen, one daughter.

44
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,304
You read the first page
of the scouting report.

45
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,772
Let me hip you to page two.

46
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,508
Daughter's name is Skyler,
big into gymnastics.

47
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,511
And to hear Bob tell it, the kid
is aces on the pommel horse.

48
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,513
He don't just tell it, old boy.
He likes to show it with
pictures.

49
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,516
Everyone's searching
for something. Am I right, Bob?

50
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,451
Love. Success.

51
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,321
But what's the one thing
that no one can get more of?

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,957
Time.
(Bob laughs)

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,493
Mmm. And you can't fight it.

54
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,896
Well, you don't have to tell me.
I mean, look at my little girl.

55
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,930
How old is Skyler
nowadays, Bob?

56
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,398
Just turned nine in May.
- Nine?

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,399
Isn't that something?
- She just turned nine.

58
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,800
Skyler's nine?
- Mmm.

59
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,702
Good Lord. How old
does that make all of us?

60
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,471
Don't answer that
question, Bob.
(laughter)

61
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's move on.
- I was about...
I was about to answer.

62
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,743
Pretty soon, she's going to be
borrowing Karen's makeup,

63
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,878
and you're going to have
two beauties on your hands.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,180
Lock the door.
It's coming, Bob.

65
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,581
Double digits.
- No way. Is Skyler

66
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,550
still giving them hell
on that pommel horse?

67
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,019
You want to see that photo?
- If it's not too much trouble.

68
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,754
Yeah, let me show you Sky, yeah.

69
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,556
Let's get those
eyes on Skyler.
- Look at her.

70
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,491
Yeah... yeah,
she's really sprouted.

71
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,193
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Skyler's
really slimming down.

72
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,028
And I'll tell you what.

73
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,496
Gorgeous.
- She's eating
really healthy.

74
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,299
Just mostly fruits and nuts.

75
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,001
Her choice.
- There is no telling
what this little girl

76
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,403
on a squirrel diet
could end up doing.

77
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,305
Could she win us the gold
and make us proud?

78
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,739
You're damn right
she could.
- You're damn right.

79
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,274
I have a feeling
she's already made you proud.

80
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,043
Am I right?
- Guilty. Guilty, my friend.

81
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,845
Oh, guys, it... it goes so fast.

82
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,881
Oh, it's like a freight train
going down the track.

83
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,516
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack.
Now she's got a boyfriend.

84
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,218
Oh.
- Guy you like,
hopefully.

85
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,221
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack,
she's married.

86
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,489
Clickety-clack,
she's putting you in a home!

87
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,958
(laughter)
Oh, my God, a home.

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,192
She would do it, too.

89
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,627
I believe that, too.
- No, no, she would.

90
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,395
Only when you don't
remember who she is.

91
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,664
I'm kidding!
(laughter)

92
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,201
Oh, it feels good
to laugh about Alzheimer's.

93
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,869
You can't control time.

94
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,304
No.

95
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,207
But... you can manage it.

96
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,344
Mmm.
- Bob...

97
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,079
the Chronoshock Aught Thirteen.

98
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,380
Carpe diem.

99
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,649
These babies will fly
off your shelf.

100
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,517
Now, I know that you've moved up
to having six stores,

101
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,885
so you're probably
going to want to have

102
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,721
a little larger order
than you did last year.

103
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,322
You're kidding, right?

104
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,227
Your... your business
has... been folded.

105
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,229
I'm sorry?
- No, no, no, no, Bob,

106
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,497
there has been some chatter.

107
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,099
The last few years
have been rough.

108
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,234
But come on,
who hasn't felt the pinch?

109
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,103
Yeah.
They didn't tell you, did they?

110
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,504
Look...

111
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,773
I thought you guys
just wanted to grab dinner

112
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,708
for old times' sake,
but, uh...
- Yeah.

113
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,011
your company is closed.

114
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,847
I hate to be the one
telling you that.

115
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,684
Honestly, I know
that I can't buy the watches

116
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,254
because your company
doesn't exist anymore,

117
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,289
but I wish I could.

118
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,658
I mean, that's
how good you guys are.

119
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,760
One round
of Pappy Van Winkle.

120
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,595
Enjoy, gentlemen.

121
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,898
BOB:
Oh... wow.

122
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,533
That is expensive stuff.

123
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,269
You know, Bob, uh...
do you mind, uh...

124
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,771
just going Dutch?
- You don't have to say
any more.

125
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,673
I got it. I'm doing this.
Let me do this.

126
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,775
I'm saying let's slice the pie
three ways, honestly.

127
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,476
If you don't mind.
- No, that-that-that's silly.

128
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,578
That's silly.
I'm doing really, really...

129
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,281
really well right now,
and you guys are not.

130
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,683
But, Bob, I can...
- At all.

131
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,817
Let me do this.

132
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,519
But let's just split it.
Let's go Dutch.

133
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,254
Okay. Okay.
- Let's be the
three Dutchmen.

134
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,555
Okay, but this Dutchman's
going to...

135
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,424
going to pay when he can
in a couple weeks.

136
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,792
I hope you understand.

137
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>What the fuck, Sammy?</i>

138
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,962
What the fuck, me?
What the fuck, you?

139
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,297
Who told you
you could barge

140
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,532
into my office
without an appointment?

141
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,700
You closed the company?

142
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,468
And then you send
us out on a sale

143
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,769
that we really needed

144
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,871
and had Bob Williams
drop that bomb on us?

145
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,908
Bob Williams has got
a big fucking mouth.

146
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,409
Yeah, he does.
- Look.

147
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,444
You weren't going to get
the sale anyway.

148
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,678
Nobody wears a watch anymore.

149
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,347
They just check
their goddamn phones.

150
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,815
Disagree.
Cite your sources.
- The kids, maybe,

151
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,483
but there's...
there's a broader market.

152
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,751
Lorraine, what time is it?

153
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,187
10:26.

154
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,024
One hip, pioneering secretary
does not a cultural trend make.

155
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,425
She's 75 years old.

156
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,327
Watches are obsolete,
and so are the two of you.

157
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,328
Hey. Obsolete?

158
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,863
What does that even mean?

159
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,232
It means everything's
computerized now.

160
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,900
It's cheaper
for a machine to tell

161
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,036
these companies what to order
than a manufacturer's rep.

162
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,804
They don't need us anymore.

163
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,341
No, people have a deep
mistrust of machines.
- That's right.

164
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,510
Have you seen <i>Terminator?</i>

165
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,480
Yep. Mm-hmm.
All of them.
- Or <i>2</i> or <i>3</i> or <i>4?</i>

166
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:25,350
People want to deal with
people, not Terminators.

167
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,185
People hate people.

168
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,353
Times have changed.

169
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,921
That's so negative.

170
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,990
Luckily, I saw this coming,
cashed out my retirement,

171
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,659
bought a condo in Miami Beach,
new tits for the wife.

172
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,661
Silicone. It's legal again.

173
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,463
- Wow.
- Saline's out?
- Yeah, me and the old lady

174
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,899
are going to be tucked away
real nice.

175
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,167
Yeah, great for you, huh?

176
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,368
Perfect.

177
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,771
So, uh, that's it, right?

178
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,340
But what about us, Sammy?
(Sammy sighs)

179
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,676
You two were great salesmen--
the best--

180
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,513
but at the end of the day,
you're grinders, foot soldiers.

181
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,281
We all know
you'll never be generals.

182
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,883
And I'm going to say
something harsh now.

183
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,684
Now you're going to say
something harsh?

184
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,554
Strap it in, boys, 'cause it
ain't pretty out there.

185
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,289
And you two are dinosaurs.

186
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,057
Face it.

187
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,761
Where you're going...
you've already been.

188
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,831
I thank you for your service.

189
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,138
(sighs)
What are we going to do?

190
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I don't know.

191
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,509
But I got to worry
about the now.

192
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,112
I don't know what the hell
I'm going to say to Megan.

193
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,487
(over stereo):
¶ It's like rain...

194
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,522
No. Let it play.

195
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,460
For the love of God,
let it play.

196
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,630
¶ It's a free ride
when you've already paid ¶

197
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,733
- Go.
¶ It's the good advice
that you... ¶

198
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,403
MAN 1:
Come on, Megan, listen to me.
Honey, let's talk about this.

199
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,405
Is this because
I'm too unselfish in bed?

200
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,507
Because I can change it around.
I'm not going to say
it's going to be easy,

201
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,008
but I can do it.
Megan, listen to me.

202
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,644
Honey, it's always darkest
before the dawn.

203
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,379
No, Billy, it's not.
It's actually darkest
in the middle of the night.

204
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,282
We have enough on the table here
without arguing about proverbs.

205
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,517
Look, I knew things
weren't great,

206
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,252
but to come home
to a foreclosure sign?

207
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,087
Can we hug it for a second?
Can I touch it?
- No. No, please.

208
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,755
Okay, listen.
That could've been avoided

209
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,557
if the Bob Williams deal
didn't go so bad on me.

210
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,559
You blew the Bob Williams deal?
- Well, it's not so much

211
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,461
that I blew the deal
as much as the company

212
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,063
just decided to shut down
and take our jobs away.

213
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,598
What?
- Come on, listen to me,
sweetheart.

214
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,466
I promise you,
I can pay for all of this.

215
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,701
It's not about
the money, Billy.

216
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,336
This is about you, okay?

217
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,739
You-you talk a big game, but you
never do anything about it.

218
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,474
It's like you say that we're
going to go to Spain,

219
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,842
but have I ever
been to Barcelona?
- "Barthelona."

220
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,011
Ugh.
- And not yet,
but we're going.

221
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,479
<i>Vaya con dios, mi amor.</i>

222
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,814
What?
- <i>Porque esta bravo</i>

223
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,849
<i>en Barthelona y fantástico.</i>

224
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,684
No, we are not going
to "Barthelona," okay?

225
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,686
We have discussed going
to Barthelona,

226
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,623
but we are never going
to go to Barthelona.

227
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,791
Not with an attitude
like that, we're not.
- Oh, God.

228
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,493
BILLY: Wait, do you
even hear yourself?

229
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,095
Yes.
- I'm glad that you got
to say some of that,

230
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,663
because we're in a
relationship, and I'm

231
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,298
just glad that we're both
committed to it.

232
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,867
No... do you know how badly
I want to believe that, Billy?

233
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,836
Because I've been with you
for a long time,

234
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,538
and nothing ever seems
to get better.

235
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,006
Honey, you were...

236
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,643
you're such a great guy,
but you always figure out

237
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,145
a way to screw things up
and let people down.

238
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,514
And, Billy, I love you,

239
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,017
but I'm really tired
of being let down.

240
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,320
(door opens and closes)

241
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,922
(cheering and applause)

242
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,925
WOMAN:
That's terrible, Nicky.

243
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,092
Are you okay?

244
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,395
I should have gone on my own
when I had the chance.

245
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,863
I was so stupid. I was...

246
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,298
Nicky, you did
the right thing.

247
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,133
Always got a paycheck,
played it smart.

248
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,534
Dad would have been proud.

249
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,069
Well, what would he
have been proud of?

250
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,238
I didn't play it smart.
I played it safe.

251
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,239
And look where I am now.

252
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,774
Proud?

253
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,642
You're at your nephew's
Little League game.

254
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,643
Now, cheer up.

255
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,111
Okay.
- Come on.

256
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,614
All right, Tate!
- All right,
here we go, Tate.

257
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,082
Put some wood on it.

258
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,584
He's a great kid.

259
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,420
I keep telling you you'd
make a terrific father.

260
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,589
Yep, you do keep
telling me that.

261
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,123
Unfortunately, it would
require you having

262
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,626
a relationship that lasted
longer than three months.

263
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,928
I'm not sure it
would require that.

264
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,164
Let me call Kevin.
- Jeanie...

265
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,832
I'm sure your boyfriend's
a great guy,

266
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,767
but I'm not ready
to work for someone

267
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,636
who spent all
of last Thanksgiving

268
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,105
explaining the meaning
of his tattoo.

269
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,506
Be reasonable, Nicky.

270
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,108
Take the job.

271
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,177
What else are you
going to do?

272
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,679
MAN:
That's it. Just take
the walk, Eagle Eye.

273
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,181
Walk's as good as a hit.
Come on.

274
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,782
What is this guy saying?
Bullshit.

275
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,584
Nick. Nick!

276
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,987
A walk's not as good as a hit.
It's not as good
- Nick!

277
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,555
as a double or a triple.

278
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,856
It's not as good
as a dinger.

279
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,224
Go on, take
a big cut, Tate.

280
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,459
Nick!
(spectators protesting)

281
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,527
Get off the field.
- What are you doing?

282
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,930
You call him Eagle Eye
to get him not to swing?

283
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,565
Come on, he's 12 years old.

284
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,734
He's got the rest
of his life to take a walk.

285
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,403
How about you take a walk,
pal, and get off my field?

286
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,971
Just stop calling him
Eagle Eye, okay?

287
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,740
Oh, I'm going to
call him Eagle Eye.

288
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,541
Oh, no, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

289
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,076
You're Eagle Eye,
you piece of...
- No, I'm not.

290
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,711
Huh?
(crowd shouting)

291
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,881
Nick!
(grunting): Get off me!

292
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,016
(grunting)

293
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,852
NICK:
Go ahead, Tate. Swing!

294
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,954
I'm okay! I'm okay.

295
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,022
Play ball!

296
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,257
Come on, Tate! Swing big!

297
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,232
Read <i>Moneyball,</i> asshole.

298
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,701
Walks <i>are</i> as good as hits.

299
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,738
(Nick sighs)

300
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,073
Just when you think your day

301
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,142
couldn't get any worse,
it got worse.

302
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,576
BILLY:
I feel like my day

303
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,546
bent me over, put a ball
in my mouth and fucked me bad.

304
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,850
Is it just me, or does life look
a lot like those hillbillies

305
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,118
from <i>Deliverance</i>
<i>right now?</i>

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,087
It's got me over
by the tree there,

307
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,322
just told me I had
a pretty mouth.

308
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,026
You over, squealing like a
pig on all fours. "Whee!"

309
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,495
I'm looking, "Wh-Where's Burt
Reynolds with the crossbow?"

310
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,097
He's not coming.

311
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,266
We're there,
it's gonna happen.

312
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,701
You're gonna get raped.

313
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,169
You know what it is?

314
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,138
I feel like life's inside of me,
just working,

315
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,441
just pushing,
just going all after it.

316
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,476
And then, all of a sudden,
life pulls out.

317
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,278
But he's gonna scurry up
the pillow.

318
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,714
Boom, just explodes
right in my fucking mouth.

319
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,783
How are you?

320
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,585
NICK:
Hey. A cute kid.

321
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,020
How old is she?

322
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,221
She's a boy.

323
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,022
Okay.

324
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,724
BILLY:
Still very attractive.

325
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,125
You know,
without pink or blue,

326
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,460
it's hard to tell,
but the features are great.

327
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,794
Maybe... maybe put him
in some modeling.

328
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,995
That's what they're going for--

329
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,297
that right-down-the-middle
thing.

330
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,232
It's like, how many
different ways

331
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,534
do we have to say,
"I give up,"

332
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,836
say "uncle," say "mercy"

333
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:20,038
before life stops
wailing away on us?

334
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,107
I mean, we are
getting pounded.

335
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,476
You know, I feel like
our whole generation are sheep

336
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,244
that's been sold
a bad bill of goods.

337
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,514
Like, we were told, you know,
go to college, get good grades.

338
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,316
Well, you didn't
go to college.

339
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,018
I'm saying,
in theory, in concept,

340
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,187
our generation was told
that you go to college,

341
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,089
you get a job, you...
you get a mortgage,

342
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,657
and, you know,
here we did everything

343
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,859
the way we
were supposed to,

344
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,127
and what do we
get for it?

345
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,294
Where's our thanks?
Nothing.

346
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,332
I think I'm going to call
Kevin about that job.

347
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,533
Kevin?

348
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,401
Thanksgiving tattoo?

349
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,670
We're not that low,
are we, Nick?

350
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,910

(sighs) Okay.

Come on.

354
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,105
Show me one little
something here.

355

(typing)

356
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,977
What are you going to do, Billy?
Come on, Billy.

357
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,287

(chuckles)
There he is.

363
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,667
Nickrophiliac!
- Hey.

364
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,202
(chuckles)

365
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,036
How you been?

366
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,872
Good. Just working away.
- Yeah.

367
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,106
Yeah. I see that.
- Yeah.

368
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,307
Don't slag off
on the corners.

369
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,709
Okay.

370
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,377
The corners are
so important.
- All right.

371
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,446
'Cause we got people tracking
shit in here all the time.

372
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,747
Okay.

373
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,617
And I mean, like,
literally dog shit.

374
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:46,918
Jesus.

375
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,253
Huh?
- Wow, I should've
worn some gloves.

376
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,988
I said I should've worn
some gloves.

377
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,256
Gloves aren't
gonna help you.

378
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,224
You don't want
protector duty?

379
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,926
'Cause I got another
place I can put you:

380
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,828
out on the curb,
twirling the big arrow.

381
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,896
Does that sound good?

382
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,230
Hot sun beating
down on you?

383
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,932
I've lost three of those
guys to skin cancer.

384
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,667
We call that curb
"the widow maker."

385
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,669
I don't want to go out
to the widow maker.
- Okay?

386
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,338
How do you think you'd fare out
there with that alabaster skin?

387
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,474
Well, I-I don't know.
- I'll tell you.

388
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,742
You'd be dead in a year.

389
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,210
It felt like you...

390
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

391
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,846
Jeggings.
- What?

392
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,614
Jeggings, 5:00.
- Where?

393
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,284
Right there.

394
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,352
I'd like to play around
in that rumpus room.

395
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,954
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

396
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,355
Have you done the back door yet?

397
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,957
Do what?
- Back door.

398
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,325
Back-door action.

399
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,060
"Knock-knock." Back door.

400
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,561
No.
- "It's me."

401
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,362
No.

402
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,364
"With my penis."
- No.

403
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,899
A life changer.

404
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,534
It is a life changer!

405
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,437
You VIP your way
into that back alley,

406
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,506
you don't even think about
the main entrance anymore.

407
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,242
You know what I mean by
"the main entrance"?

408
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,378
We're talking dick
into the vagina.

409
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,714
Kevin, this is
an awkward conversation.

410
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:50,782
Why?

411
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,984
Because you're going out
with my sister!

412
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,187
Oh, yeah. Well, don't-don't
think we didn't go through

413
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,555
a period of adjustment.

414
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,790
Adjustment?

415
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,124
Can you gentlemen help me?

416
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,226
Yes, ma'am. Nick is
one of our best.

417
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,661
In fact, his
entire family

418
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,830
knows their way
around a mattress.

419
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,334
Get it.
- What are...?

420
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,869
Get it done.
- My question is about

421
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,671
memory foam versus standard.

422
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,873
Specifically as it relates
to lumbar support.

423
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,775
(sighs)
What?

424
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,210
Lumbar support.
- I'm-- Okay, I'm sorry.

425
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,945
Hi, great choice
in mattress.
- Yeah.

426
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,414
Why don't you go ahead
and, uh, lie down there.

427
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,049
Let's try to work our way
through this conundrum,

428
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,552
uh, because what I think
you're asking is...
- Oh, man.

429
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,988
Uh, Billy, I'm with
a customer, thank you.
- Sure.

430
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,990
Pardon me, ma'am, yeah,
just maybe start off on this.

431
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,192
Yeah. Just lay it down.
- Yeah, come here
for a second.

432
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,927
(whispering): Hey, what
are you doing here?

433
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,428
Listen, I got it.

434
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,730
I've seen the future,
and it's beautiful for us.

435
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,431
Okay, I don't know
what you got,

436
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,533
but I got a job here,
and I don't want to lose it.

437
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,701
Now, can we talk
about this later?

438
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,169
No, we can't talk
about it later.

439
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,671
The future doesn't know later.

440
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,605
What are you...?

441
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,173
All the future is,
is later.

442
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,775
That's literally
what the future is.

443
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,609
It's later.

444
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,944
What are you talking about?

445
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,312
Google.

446
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,214
Google?
- Yeah.

447
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,448
The place is amazing.

448
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,384
They got nap pods,
they got massage rooms,

449
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,451
they got a volleyball court.

450
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,919
They got the whole nine.

451
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,288
It's ranked as the greatest
place to work at in America.

452
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,823
Yeah, I know.
It's a technology company--

453
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,592
a field we know
jack squat about.

454
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,227
Look-it, Google needs us.

455
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,828
And Google wants us.

456
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,929
They do?

457
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,464
You sweet son of a bitch.

458
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,166
You got us a job at Google?

459
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,434
Well, it's not actually a job.

460
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,869
What do you mean,
not an actual job?

461
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,937
Well, it's an interview
for an internship that has

462
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,607
a better-than-not chance
of materializing into a job.

463
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,376
Billy, now you're
making me very angry.

464
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,279
You want me to leave my job
to go for an interview,

465
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,581
not for a job
but for an internship

466
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,283
that may or may not
lead to a job?

467
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,253
Nick, aren't you tired of asking
for just enough to get by?

468
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,387
Yes.

469
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,123
I want to do something
that matters.

470
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,293
I want to have a life that I'm
excited about and that's great.

471
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,629
Nick, I want us
to go to California.

472
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,098
And I want us to get
these jobs at Google.

473
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,167
I'm going to speak
to a manager.

474
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,636
Terrific. I think he's right
over there in the corner.

475
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,905
Let's roll it on over
onto the stomach.

476
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,706
He'll be very helpful.
- Okay, what we're
gonna do here

477
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,775
is get a little support
for the hips.

478
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,710
So here comes... Imagine a
pillow, right like there, okay?

479
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,945
Oh. Uh-huh.

480
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,380
And what we're gonna do
is separate the feet,

481
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,382
create a little heat dispersion.

482
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,783
Excuse me!
- Now, so we have...

483
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,820
Is there something
I can help you with, ma'am?!

484
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,721
What?!

485
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,390
I'm trying to buy a mattress.

486
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,791
Unbelievable!

487
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,760
Listen, our interview
is in one hour.

488
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,229
Now, Nick, this might be
the last chance that we got.

489
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,699
How's it going, Gossip Girls?
CW just called; you're canceled.

490
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,600
Excuse me?

491
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,968
Look, I know you're peddling him

492
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,537
a bunch of crap,
just like the crap merchandise

493
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,638
you two used to shill.

494
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,574
So, listen up, Marfan Syndrome.

495
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,175
Excuse me?
- Marfansism.

496
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,310
Big man's disease.

497
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,478
The Giant Killer.

498
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,246
You.
- Me and you
are the same height.

499
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,548
We're not the same height.
We're not the same height.

500
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,350
I'm handsome tall.

501
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,886
You're the type of tall where
you walk through the airport,

502
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,155
people stop what they're eating
and look at you.

503
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,690
You're like a freak.

504
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,425
Now, Nick,
you have a customer waiting.

505
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,728
Nick... we have
our future waiting.

506
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,096
Nick, you know what that says?

507
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,731
No, I don't read Sanskrit.

508
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,167
"Make reasonable choices."

509
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,370
That's an odd thing
to get tattooed on your neck.

510
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,707
Just get back to work!

511
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,876
God! I'm sorry
you had to see that, ma'am.

512
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,777
Now, let's get
back to you

513
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,112
and talk pelvic
ventilation.

514
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,113
Kevin!

515
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,082
What?

516
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,350
You know, you've been saying

517
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,951
some insulting things
to me all day.

518
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,153
What are you doing?

519
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,587
I'm taking the shirt off.

520
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,655
Because I don't know

521
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,956
what happens
to a dream deferred.

522
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,059
Does it dry up like
a raisin in the sun?

523
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,061
Or does it explode?

524
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,997
I don't want to find out.

525
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,634
You just made the worst mistake
of your life, my friend.

526
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,702
Hey, hey-hey-hey-hey,
yeah, hey!

527
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,871
You take the shirt off,
it doesn't go back on, okay?

528
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,973
There's not a
second chance!

529
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,544
See you in hell!

530
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,647
So we're meeting our
interviewer in here?

531
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,248
No, not in here.
We're meeting him in here.

532
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,383
It's a Hangout.

533
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,817
This is how people
do it now, Nicky--

534
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,519
they have their interviews
on the Internet.
- Oh.

535
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,820
I like it.

536
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,490
Now, it says here
that the internship

537
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,392
is only for college
students, so...

538
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,027
Guess who's way ahead of you.

539
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,829
That's why I enrolled us
at the University of Phoenix.

540
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,498
That proud online institution.

541
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,732
Go, Fighting Phoenixes.

542
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,767
Nice.

543
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,036
Wait, you put my major
down as physics?

544
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,671
Why-why would you put
my major down as...

545
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,705
I don't know shit
about physics.

546
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,240
Look...
- Physics scares me.

547
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,542
These guys paint the corner
of the plate with their pitches.

548
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,377
They're not gonna come
straight down the middle

549
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,279
and ask you about physics;
it's too obvious.

550
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,547
I took it off the table.

551
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,982
Good. Hide in plain sight.

552
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,617
Yes.
(clears throat)

553
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,786
But you put you down for
sales? As your major?

554
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:22,887
Well, 'cause I'm a talker.

555
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,522
I figure I should
probably dazzle.

556
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,090
I want you to-- you know,
I've thought about this.

557
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,925
I just figure, like, hide
your vacancy and let me dazzle.

558
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,193
Okay, dazzle.
GIRL: Are you done yet?

559
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,561
There's a 15-minute limit.

560
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,063
I'm sorry, you know what?

561
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,698
The big boys are gonna need
the computer a little longer,

562
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,066
but maybe we can make this
a win-win for you.

563
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,367
Get yourself a soda pop.

564
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,602
Give her some money, yeah.
Here you go.

565
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,203
Yeah, just go put
some sugar in your body.

566
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,605
Enjoy it.
- What a cute kid.

567
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,273
I'm no child, but, Billy...
- Okay, here they are.

568
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,908
Now, when I hit this, they'll be
able to see us, so come on in,

569
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,476
get in there close so we
can be seen on the Webcam.

570
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,944
See how small the Webcam is?
- They can see us...

571
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,879
No, get cheek to cheek.
Nick, come here, cheek to cheek.

572
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,615
Okay, but don't crowd me.
You're crowding me right now.

573
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,350
Nick, get cheek to cheek.
Will you get your cheek...

574
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,418
Buddy, they can't see us.
- I understand that.
Here we go.

575
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,220
Go cheek to cheek.
Just go like I tell you.
- Okay. Don't yell in my...

576
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,588
Put your fucking cheek
next to mine.
- Yes, yes, I get it.

577
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,756
We can see you guys.

578
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,291
Okay, great!
- Good! You got us?

579
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,559
(shouting):
Hi! My name is Billy!

580
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,427
Uh, we can hear you
fine as well.

581
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,462
Oh, great. Um...
- Good.

582
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,463
Billy McMahon.

583
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,497
Nick Campbell.

584
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,132
I'm Benjamin.
- Allison.

585
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,333
We're thirsty, too.

586
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,568
Okay, slow it down
there, camper.

587
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,569
I'm not an ATM.

588
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,737
I got a job interview here.

589
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,105
Thank you.
- We'll be back.

590
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,173
(chuckling): Okay, easy.
- Are you in a library?

591
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,775
You know, we're in
a program here called...
- We are.

592
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,876
There's some beautiful
little kids here.

593
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,344
Yeah, kids.
Helping kids program--

594
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,179
one of the things we're
involved in-- where we take

595
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,715
suburban kids and we teach them
what it's like to be homeless.

596
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,484
Oh, what's it called?
- Oh, it's-it's called, uh...

597
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,219
Attitude Adjustment.
- Attitude Adjustment.

598
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,987
And that's where we are today.
We're helping the kids.

599
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,689
And-and to be honest with you,
we did the interview here

600
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,090
because we wanted
to help out,

601
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,092
and also we don't have Webcams
for our computer.

602
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,827
If you don't have
a Webcam on your computer,

603
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,863
what type of computer do you
use for your coding ability?

604
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,198
Coding ability?
- Uh, yeah.

605
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,401
Uh, under computer skills,
you put "C-plus-plus."

606
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,702
That's actually a C-plus.

607
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,137
What's that?
- Well, the second plus is

608
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,406
to reflect my attitude
of how I felt about the C-plus.

609
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,540
But it's a C-plus.

610
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,541
It was a typing class.

611
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,776
You know, same principle,

612
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,444
just not the engine
inside the baby there.

613
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,712
But it was more like
"quick brown fox."

614
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:55,713
You know, put your hands
in the basin,

615
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,881
and crushing it like that.

616
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,749
But that h-helped me out
a lot when I,

617
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,251
as I started my journey
into computers

618
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,186
because I already knew
where to put my hands, clearly.

619
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,022
Okay, if we could focus on
this now-- you are currently

620
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,058
enrolled at the University
of Phoenix online?

621
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,592
Indeed, yes, we are.
- Damn right we are.

622
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,860
Damn right we are.
- It's, uh, the oldest

623
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,529
institution of its
kind, and as such,

624
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,999
many people refer to it as the
Harvard of Internet colleges.

625
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,200
Oh! I hadn't
heard that actually.

626
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,468
I... No.

627
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,836
That-that has not
made it out here,

628
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,837
that reputation.
- Well, we're Phoenix proud.

629
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,838
We're Phoenix proud.

630
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,106
Well, that's fine.

631
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,808
Um, we're gonna ask you
a few questions

632
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,676
that some of our candidates
find a little bit odd.

633
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,677
Let's get weird!

634
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,279
No judgment. Shoot.

635
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,481
You're shrunken down
to the size of nickels

636
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,249
and dropped to the
bottom of a blender.

637
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,517
What do you do?

638
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,553
I-Is there anything
else in the blender?

639
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,787
Uh, I don't know.

640
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,855
Well, that's gonna
make a difference.

641
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,989
Are there ice cubes
to climb on?

642
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,324
Are we working with
a daiquiri here?

643
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,826
Are we throwing
a little rum in?

644
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,361
Are we making a smoothie?
- It's been a long week.

645
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,329
Maybe we want to let these
little guys live a little.

646
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,997
Okay, for the sake of the
argument, let's say it's empty.

647
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,199
Sure.
- Well, in that case,
it's easy, then.

648
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,333
Why?
- I'm sorry?

649
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,768
If we're shrunk down
to the size

650
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,902
of a nickel and there's
no liquid in the blender,

651
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,170
we go ahead
and put it on our backs.

652
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,939
So you take her flat
on your back like this.

653
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,907
Right, right, right. You just
lay back, enjoy that breeze.

654
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,109
Lay stiff as a board,
light as a feather.
- Pretend it's a fan.

655
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,477
Okay, once is...
- And let those blades

656
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,544
just whip all around
you like this.

657
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,513
(both making blender noises)

658
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,215
It's like getting an MRI.
- (whispers):
Dazzle, dazzle.

659
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,583
Once this blender's on,
it's on forever.

660
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,784
It's on. Forever.

661
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,352
Respectfully,
I got to disagree.

662
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,955
We sold blenders, and even
the best model in the world

663
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,523
is only gonna run nonstop
for, what, Billy?

664
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,657
Even the Germans,
the Germans could never...

665
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,426
Yeah. Even the
German model.

666
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,361
Even one of those Braun ones,
they're only gonna run nonstop

667
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,563
maybe ten or 11 hours.
So we're getting out,

668
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,198
and when we do,
we're better off for it,

669
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,633
because whatever doesn't
kill you makes you stronger.

670
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,901
But let's just go ahead

671
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,503
and big-picture this
for a second, if I can.

672
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,171
Just like the
founders of Google.

673
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,339
Big-picture Googling.

674
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,975
It's not so much
getting out of the blender;

675
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,643
it's what happens next.

676
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,211
That's the question.

677
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,747
You've got two nickel-sized
men free in the world.

678
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,249
Think of the possibilities.
- I mean, I-I--

679
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,050
off the top of my head,
and I'm just spitballing here.

680
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,819
My head's swimming.
- Sunglass repair?

681
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,454
Yeah, yeah...
- We'd be hell on
those little screws.

682
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,623
Or maybe you stick us in
those submarines that they put

683
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,091
in people's bodies
to fight diseases.

684
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,859
That's cutting-edge
right there.

685
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,394
Okay, you-- That's-that's
not a real thing,

686
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,395
the submarines.
- No.

687
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,563
Wait a minute.

688
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,731
I thought we were
stuck in a blender.

689
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,899
Now we're saving lives?
What?!

690
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,434
Uh, what?
- What?

691
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,668
- What?!
- What?!
- What?

692
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,903
Let me just recap this
for you real quick.

693
00:23:58,905 --> 00:23:59,904
We started off
in a blend...
- Yeah.

694
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,105
Now we're saving lives!

695
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,173
- What?!
- What?!

696
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,008
- What? What?
- What?
- Wait a minute!

697
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,810
We were stuck
in a blender...
- What a journey!

698
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,044
...and now we saving lives?!

699
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,446
What?!
- You guys led us to this.

700
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,747
Thank you.

701
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,248
I think we've gotten
a little far afield.

702
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,750
Just a little off topic.

703
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,885
Ally, I'll get inside you
and I'll fight for you.

704
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,287
Uh, thank you.
I-I appreciate that, but...

705
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,655
Which one of you...
which one of you is physics?

706
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,223
ALLISON:
Mr. Campbell?

707
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,693
You could maybe expound
on this from a physics aspect.

708
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,828
Physics.
(sighs)

709
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,129
Here, here...

710
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,132
Listen, the--
I-I could bend your ear

711
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,701
about physics and various
physical phenomenon,

712
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,170
but the truth is,
we were in a blender.

713
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,273
We lost our jobs,
we'd given up.

714
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,476
So I think we already
answered the question

715
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,777
when we took
this interview.

716
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,413
We got ourselves out,
and here we are.

717
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:45,149
If you guys really want to know
what happens when you take

718
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,652
two guys out of a blender--
I'm sorry, Allison, is it?

719
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,321
ALLISON:
Yes.

720
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,689
Then give us a shot.

721
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,124
And I think you'd be
happy that you did.

722
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,895
So, who is our next applicant?

723
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,664
Ah, our two daiquiri men.

724
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,067
So, what are we
thinking... Dana?

725
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,369
You're kidding, right?

726
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,570
No.

727
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,872
Eleanor?

728
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,307
Mmm, they seem like
really nice guys,

729
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,343
but I-I don't
think so.
- Okay. Moving on.

730
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,344
Oh, can I say something?

731
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,678
You can. You will.

732
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,247
We will resent you
for wasting our time,

733
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:17,848
but please don't let that
stop you.

734
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,317
It's just, diversity is
in our DNA, right?

735
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,852
I thought the goal here

736
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,221
was to find people with a
different way of thinking.

737
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,856
There's plenty of people with
a different way of thinking.

738
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,157
It doesn't mean
that we have to hire them.

739
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,226
Very good point, Dana.
Moving on.

740
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,794
I'm sorry, but you read
their résumés, right?

741
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,863
They have more years

742
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,231
of sales and life experience

743
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,267
than the age
of most of our interns.

744
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,968
Not to mention,
our final judgment

745
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,004
is always based on
the Layover Test, right?

746
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,438
Who would you rather
be stuck next to

747
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,908
at an airport bar
for a six-hour delay?

748
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,809
The ten millionth kid
who knows that if you shrink,

749
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,977
your strength-to-weight ratio

750
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,713
allows you to jump
way higher? Duh.

751
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,215
Or the out-of-the-box thinkers

752
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,250
who turned being
stuck in a blender

753
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,219
into an advantage?

754
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,857
¶ Tell me how you feel

755
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,225
¶ What's your fantasy, oh?

756
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,028
¶ I see us on a beach
down in Mexico ¶

757
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,897
¶ You can put your feet up,
be my señorita ¶

758
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,733
¶ We ain't got to rush,
just take it slow ¶

759
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,269
¶ You'll be in the high life,
soaking up the sunlight ¶

760
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,205
¶ Anything you want,
it's yours ¶

761
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,242
¶ I'll have you living life
like you should ¶

762
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,945
¶ You say you never
had it so good... ¶

763
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,447
So it begins.

764
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,582
Here we go.

765
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,683
Place is incredible.

766
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,984
Where do we check in?

767
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,385
Let's ask somebody here.

768
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,887
Oh, excuse me!

769
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,589
I'm sorry, excuse me, do you...

770
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,561
Billy?

771
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,930
It's scary because it's new.

772
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,231
Let's go check in.

773
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,567
Head towards those
big, big letters there.

774
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,035
What's up, family?

775
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,371
¶ Girl, tell me how you feel

776
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,973
¶ What's your fantasy, oh?
(bicycle bell dinging)

777
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,442
¶ I see us on a beach
down in Mexico ¶

778
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,312
¶ You can put your feet up,
be my señorita ¶

779
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,514
¶ We ain't got to rush,
just take it slow ¶

780
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,117
¶ You'll be in the high life,
soaking up the sunlight ¶

781
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,086
¶ Anything you want,
it's yours ¶

782
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,854
¶ I'll have you living life

783
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,155
- What's your last name?
¶ Like you should

784
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,892
¶ You say you never
had it so good ¶

785
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,128
¶ <i>Na na-na na-na na-na</i> ¶

786
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,098
¶ <i>Na na na</i> ¶
¶ You never had it so good

787
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,266
¶ <i>Na na-na na-na na-na</i> ¶

788
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:20,337
¶ <i>Na na-na na</i> ¶
¶ You never had it so good...

789
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,640
Picture the greatest
amusement park

790
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,274
you've ever been to as a kid.

791
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,777
Now imagine a place
nothing like it

792
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,113
and a million times better.

793
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,181
That's where we are.

794
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,716
I'm gonna grab us a coffee.

795
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,817
You check us in.

796
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,686
Yeah.

797
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,722
(chuckles)

798
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,059
Morning.

799
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,827
Hi.
- What's the damage here?

800
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,830
Nothing.

801
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,098
For the-- for these?

802
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,067
Free.
- These are complimentary?

803
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,402
Complimentary. Free.

804
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:52,836
Whatever you want.

805
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,204
What you're just saying
is if I--

806
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,572
whatever I walk away
with here...

807
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,573
It's free.

808
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,775
...doesn't-- yeah.

809
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,343
You can have bananas.

810
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,345
I probably should, only because
it's a great way to st--

811
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,913
This is the most important
meal of the day.

812
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,314
Take two. They're free.

813
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,083
No, I know, but for
my day, I need it.
- Yeah.

814
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,918
What about these--
the bagels and all that?

815
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,119
Yeah, it's free.
Anything you want.

816
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,354
If you're insisting,
twist my arm.

817
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,689
I'll have a couple of them.
- Sure.

818
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,890
Like four-four of them.
- Four?

819
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,058
Well, just whatever it is.
- Yeah.

820
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,526
What about five of them?
- Free, too.

821
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,428
Well, why don't you go ahead
and make it seven, then?

822
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,063
If you want to whip up
some of the other drinks.

823
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,531
Do you have a to-go cup,
like, a Guzzler?
- Sure.

824
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,066
Do you have, like,
a Rednek Guzzler with a straw?

825
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,467
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Yes?

826
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,603
Do you know what, uh,
launch this was from?

827
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,272
Sorry. Uh, I have a meeting.

828
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,740
Oh, no, no,
I don't want to hold you.

829
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,008
I was just...

830
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,010
I-I was just curious.

831
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:35,079
Was this thing
actually in space?

832
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:38,015
If only there were
some Web page you could go to.

833
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,249
Right?
Where you could just

834
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,752
type things in
and search for answers.

835
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,088
Ah. Yes, that
would be nice.

836
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,590
Nick Campbell.

837
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,958
Uh, oops. Intern.

838
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,861
Dana Simms. Late.

839
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:51,862
Yep, and I'm late, too.

840
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:52,996
I got to rush off.

841
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,531
And it's <i>SpaceShipOne.</i>

842
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,667
First private
manned spaceflight.

843
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,669
Winner of the X Prize.

844
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,109
(makes explosion noise)

845
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,145
Oh, my God,
are those your dads?

846
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,714
Seriously, same-sex partners
make excellent parents.

847
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,516
I so wish my parents were gay.

848
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,951
When did 20 start
to look like 12?

849
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,385
Oh, man.

850
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,987
MAN: Yes, of course
I'll work my hardest.

851
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,522
Mom, how can I work
harder than my hardest?

852
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,190
That's physically
impossible...

853
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,992
Okay, okay, I-I will.

854
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:24,461
Yes, I love you... Mom.

855
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,863
Billy McMahon, Billy McMahon.
- Nice to meet you.

856
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,231
How are you?

857
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,665
Oh, I'm gonna grab
some food over here.

858
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,067
You okay?
- Get something.
I'm good.

859
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,635
You all right if I leave you?
- Yeah.

860
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,439
This stuff looks good, huh?

861
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,807
Little pick-me-up.
- Excuse me. Sir.

862
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,308
Graham Hawtrey.
- Oh.

863
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
Billy McMahon.
- I'm so thrilled
to be here.

864
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:40,878
Oh, me, too.

865
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,513
Feels kind of like
the first day

866
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,414
of spring training
for Little League here.

867
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,416
(both laugh)

868
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:49,052
I got to tell you, I feel like
I got a few more clicks

869
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,587
on the old odometer
than most of you kids here.

870
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,222
Well, honestly,
that's why I came over here.

871
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,690
I said to myself,
"Graham, there's a man

872
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:54,858
"with some life experience.

873
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,160
Probably teach you
a thing or two."

874
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:57,628
Oh, you got to meet
my friend, Nicky.

875
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,428
You'll love him. Nicky!

876
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,763
Nickelodeon!
Come over here!

877
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,764
Come over.

878
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,232
Come meet this guy, Graham.

879
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,333
He's in the internship
program with me and you.

880
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,334
Hey. How you doing?
- Good.

881
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,036
You're interns?
- Yes.

882
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,838
Shut up!
- Deal with it.

883
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,706
Shut the fuck up.
- Deal with it.

884
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,008
But you're so old, though.

885
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,476
Whoa. Excuse me?

886
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,545
Oh, my God, I feel terrible!
I feel so stupid.

887
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,246
No, don't be. We're excited.
- No, it's fine.

888
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,215
- No, I feel terrible.
I feel terrible.
- No. For what?

889
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,117
I just, you know, um...
I thought you were important.

890
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,518
Oh, shit.

891
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,554
I've got to find some people
who actually matter,

892
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:24,822
but good luck!

893
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,257
Wh-Why did you bring me over
to introduce me to this guy?

894
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,725
It's like he was
your best friend.

895
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,127
You introduced me
to Hitler.

896
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,262
Well, he seemed like
he was sweet at first.

897
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,797
My name is Roger Chetty.

898
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,667
And I am head
of the Google Intern Program.

899
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,269
Welcome to Google.

900
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,839
This will not be
your average internship.

901
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,640
Oh, no.

902
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,509
You will do what we do.

903
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,679
And we will watch
how well you do it.

904
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,381
Now, you represent
the finest schools.

905
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,284
Your intelligence,
your achievement is well noted,

906
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,153
but to excel at this internship,

907
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,022
you're going to need
far more than brainpower.

908
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,759
What you're going to need
is Googliness.

909
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,494
(laughter)

910
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,629
Nothing funny.

911
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,864
Googliness.

912
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:11,802
The intangible stuff
that made a search engine

913
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,971
into an engine for change.

914
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:17,407
Now, you will be
divided into teams,

915
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,976
and by the end of the summer,

916
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:23,046
only one team will be guaranteed
a full-time position.

917
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:28,352
The other 95 % of you will not.

918
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,220
Now, you've been split up
into several seminars

919
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,357
to acquaint you
with our campus and culture.

920
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,726
Seminar descriptions have been
e-mailed to each of you.

921
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,196
I would wish you luck,
but it's not luck that you need.

922
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,365
Get to work!

923
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,699
Well, this ain't
gonna be about

924
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,701
getting coffee
and running errands for people.

925
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,936
No, no.

926
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,804
We're looking at some sort
of mental Hunger Games

927
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,307
against a bunch of genius kids
for just a handful of jobs.

928
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,475
That's why we got
to nail this thing.

929
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,676
This is our
opening statement.

930
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:53,744
If it please the court.

931
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,379
Oh, it pleases
the court, counselor.

932
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,747
BILLY:
<i>Okay, Workplace Seminar.</i>

933
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:57,881
<i>Still a few seats left.</i>

934
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,050
First impression time, baby.

935
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,218
Bingo!

936
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,152
Okay, we can do
good in this.

937
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,487
We have to do...
- Shazam!

938
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,188
So close yet so far, boys.

939
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,957
Whoa! Graham, Graham,
we were here first.

940
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,958
You know what?

941
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,159
You're right.

942
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,227
You guys could use
the advantage.

943
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,328
Go ahead.

944
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,763
What's that
supposed to mean?

945
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,265
It means that in a world
of excellence,

946
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,101
old and unexceptional
qualifies as diversity.

947
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,703
So you know what?
Go ahead.

948
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:20,704
What's that saying?

949
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,706
"Age before beauty"?

950
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,508
Thank you.

951
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,510
You're welcome, William.

952
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,245
You know, there's always
some joker

953
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,347
who likes to play fuck-around.

954
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,649
I guess that's
gonna be you, Graham.

955
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,052
All right, at least we know.
Game on.

956
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,820
Good luck, boys.

957
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,323
Now, I recognize that Google
is not a conventional workplace.

958
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:42,392
Having said that,
we have rules.

959
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,128
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

960
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,530
You are going to raise
the green paddle

961
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:49,299
to indicate "yes"
and the red paddle

962
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,135
to indicate "no."

963
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,937
So, let's begin.

964
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,606
"Having a beer
with your boss."

965
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,545
Some of you are under 21.

966
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,113
Some of us
aren't under 21, so...

967
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,514
if you want to grab
a cold one with me,

968
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,882
I'm happy to do that with you.

969
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,285
I will not be grabbing
a cold one with you.

970
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,419
You get high?

971
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,054
I don't get high.
- Okay.

972
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,656
I'm not judging;
I'm just saying,

973
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,457
people do it.

974
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,791
That being said,
if you want

975
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,693
something cold to drink,
we'll hook you up.

976
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,761
I'm okay.

977
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,363
Thank you; just
stop talking to me.

978
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,698
I'm your Bill Holden
in <i>Stalag 17.</i>

979
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,900
I don't even... I really
don't get that reference.

980
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,970
Google it.
- Got it.

981
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:30,807
"Dating a fellow intern."

982
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,944
This is Google,
not Match.com.

983
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,380
Chetty, excuse me.
What about a full-time employee?

984
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,582
Say, management level,
but not a direct supervisor.

985
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:43,286
Great eyes,
and a severity to her look

986
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,456
that is surprisingly sexy.

987
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,558
What's the policy
on that?

988
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,260
No? That's frowned upon also?

989
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,395
So we'll say no to love?

990
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,496
We'll say no to love, yes.

991
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:53,764
That's gonna be a no.
- Now,

992
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:56,867
"taking food home
from the office."

993
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,901
BILLY:
Boom.

994
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,169
Yes.

995
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,203
Are you having
difficulty with this,

996
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,638
Mr. McMahon?
- I'm sorry.

997
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,773
Just to drill down on this,
what if it's,

998
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,374
like, a perishable?
Like, say there was

999
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,809
a pudding or something
that was left out.

1000
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,644
You'd like to take home
a pudding, would you?

1001
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,312
I wouldn't mind taking home
a pudding; I don't...

1002
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,814
I don't know
who wouldn't.
- Oh, yeah.

1003
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,649
But that being said,
I'm just saying if it's gonna

1004
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,284
go bad, is that okay
to take-take it home?
- Mm-hmm.

1005
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,752
Mm-hmm. Anything else
you'd like to take home?

1006
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,354
Only if there was, let's say,
salsa or chips.

1007
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,555
You know,
something that's not wrapped.

1008
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,923
Salsa, chips and pudding.

1009
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:20,724
Or sushi.

1010
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,259
Salsa, chips, pudding and sushi.

1011
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,627
Anything else?
- Ice cream.

1012
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,629
Salsa, chips, pudding,
sushi and ice cream.

1013
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,497
Pizza.
- Salsa, chips, pudding,

1014
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,799
sushi, ice cream and pizza.

1015
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,167
I wouldn't take home
a frozen pizza,

1016
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,301
but if there was a nice pie

1017
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,636
that was out...
- Oh, boy.

1018
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,473
I am truly impressed,
Mr. McMahon.

1019
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,909
Thank you.
- At the both of you.

1020
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:42,012
At how quickly you have
confirmed my doubts about you.

1021
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,781
Now, let's try this

1022
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:45,882
one more time.

1023
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,955
"Taking food home
from the office."

1024
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,591
Very good.

1025
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,931
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is all.

1026
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,274
Well, I'm not
gonna dress it up.

1027
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,276
Today didn't go well.

1028
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,611
Yeah.

1029
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,813
It certainly wasn't
the first impression

1030
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,115
we were looking for.

1031
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,219
But here's the deal.

1032
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,521
Tomorrow is
the pick teams day, right?

1033
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,890
Which makes it
all the more important

1034
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,159
for us to fall in
with a strong team.

1035
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:30,894
If we can surround ourselves

1036
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,596
with the right group
of these little geniuses,

1037
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:35,165
we still got a shot here.

1038
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,167
Nicky,

1039
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,902
we can coattail this bitch.

1040
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,538
You're right, and by the way,
there's no shame in that.

1041
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,973
No.
- There's no shame

1042
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,342
in being the 12th man
at the end of the bench

1043
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,643
who's never getting
in the game,

1044
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,811
but he's got a lot
of enthusiasm.

1045
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,513
Right.
- He's waving the towel,

1046
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:50,814
he's doling out high fives
during time-outs.

1047
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,915
Exactly.

1048
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,717
Because I'll tell you
about that guy.

1049
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,986
When the team wins
the championship,

1050
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,454
he still gets a ring.

1051
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:58,922
Damn right he does.

1052
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,324
So we got to be
that awkward seven-footer

1053
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,325
from Lithuania.

1054
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,593
I love your spirit.

1055
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,228
Look, I love you like a brother,

1056
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,730
but I can't have
those cold clams

1057
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,765
brushing up against me
in the bed here at night.

1058
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,700
Keep me up all night.
- Okay, suit yourself.

1059
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,569
I'm gonna give you the bed;
I'll take her tomorrow.

1060
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:16,006
<i>Can you hit that light,</i>
<i>Pocahontas?</i>

1061
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,341
<i>Tomorrow's a new day.</i>

1062
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,044
MAN:
<i>Welcome to day two. I am Sid,</i>

1063
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,345
eighth-year Googler.

1064
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,015
You guys are new Googlers;

1065
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,483
thus you're... Nooglers.

1066
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,618
(laughter)
- Okay.

1067
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,421
Now, this place is all about
community and collaboration.

1068
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,823
So you'll be
working in teams

1069
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,225
from here on out. All right.

1070
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,493
You have five minutes.

1071
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,494
Pick your teams.

1072
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,162
You, on me.

1073
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,330
Oh, now, be picky, okay?

1074
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,598
Play hard to get.

1075
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,033
Don't be desperate;
just be cool, okay?

1076
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,267
This is everything.

1077
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,835
Are you still looking
for someone?

1078
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,704
I could be
your teammate.
- College, major, S.A.T. score?

1079
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,706
Um, Harvard,
computer science, 2390.

1080
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,107
Fine. On me, Fatface.

1081
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,175
Uh, my name's Zach, not...

1082
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,276
You?
- University of...

1083
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,344
No.

1084
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,645
My name's
not Fat...

1085
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,914
Hello, Stanford.
You're coming with me.

1086
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,849
NICK: The University
of Phoenix online.

1087
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,384
Sort of considered
the Harvard of the West.

1088
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,586
BILLY: Why don't we
all be a team?

1089
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,387
Why don't we all be a team?

1090
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,789
(quietly): Why don't we
all be a team?

1091
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,390
Can I just get...
Oh, please don't touch me.

1092
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,525
Please,
you-you're touching me.

1093
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,826
Blondie, you're coming with me

1094
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,561
on account
of your physical appearance.

1095
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,130
Does anyone want to...
want to be on a team with me?

1096
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,665
Super fun.

1097
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,834
Really smart, but also very fun.

1098
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,537
I was voted "most likely to
succeed" in my chess club.

1099
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,139
(exhales)

1100
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,112
Um, Mr. Chetty?

1101
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,615
I don't have a group.

1102
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,617
You'll mentor
the leftovers.

1103
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,485
Which, it would seem,
would include

1104
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,320
your two charity cases.

1105
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,989
Nice.
- Off you go.

1106
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:40,924
(quietly):
Go.

1107
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,495
Yo, Billy and Nick?

1108
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,364
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Nice, there they are.

1109
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,632
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lyle,

1110
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,634
one of the team
managers. Pound me.

1111
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,569
Oh, normally,
just putting the-the fist out

1112
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,504
without the words
is all that's necessary.

1113
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,606
Come on, bro, fist me;
get up in there.

1114
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,742
Yeah,
that's definitely not right.

1115
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,443
I-I'm sorry,
you said you were a-a manager?

1116
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,544
How old are you?

1117
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,813
I'm 23, but no worries, fellas.

1118
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,448
I'm an old soul.
- Yeah, that's great.

1119
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,417
Um, yeah, well,
the thing about it is, pal,

1120
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,853
is that, um, we don't have a...
well, we have two-- me and...

1121
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,888
me and Nick-- but we don't have
the rest of our team.

1122
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,356
We didn't...
- But we figured...

1123
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,325
Correction:
you didn't have a team,

1124
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,060
but you got one now, son.

1125
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:18,495
'Cause I got a
few outliers.

1126
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,997
Buh-bam, ker-plash, zshaw!

1127
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,066
And we about to get it all good
up in this hood, right?

1128
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,734
Outliers?

1129
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,003
Outliers, 'cause I just dropped
a little G-well on you.

1130
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,472
'Cause Malcolm's my dog,
Malcolm's my dog.

1131
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,441
What you say...
Malcolm's my dog.

1132
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,276
(chuckles)
<i>Outliers,</i> you know,
from 10,000 hours?

1133
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,845
Look, let's get
a team meeting going, everybody!

1134
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,113
Come on, team meet time.

1135
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,816
Nick?
- Wonder Twin
powers activate!

1136
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,018
What other options do we have?
LYLE: Let's go, everybody!

1137
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,687
Come on, you're with me!
You're with me.

1138
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,188
Uh... (exhales)
- My team, corner pocket.

1139
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,091
All right, let's get some
meet and greet going

1140
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,592
up in this heezy.

1141
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,428
I'm Lyle,
and it's pretty much WYSIWYG--

1142
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,796
"what you see is what you get."

1143
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,864
I've been here at the Goog
for four years,

1144
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,233
working on seven projies

1145
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,501
<i>en este momento.</i>

1146
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,503
Wow, seven projects?

1147
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,905
Hey, they ask, and I do's it.

1148
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,673
What can I say,
I'm a people pleaser,

1149
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,708
especially the ladies.

1150
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,076
My Mercedes.

1151
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,877
So it's all good
in Lyle's hood, you heard?

1152
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,679
MAN:
Uh, yeah, is Lyle always

1153
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,481
gonna be referring to himself
in the third person?

1154
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,650
'Cause if he is, I might want
to punch Lyle in the face.

1155
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:14,651
LYLE:
Okay, tough but fair.

1156
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,019
Good note.

1157
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,687
Lyle's still a little nervous.
Shh...

1158
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,689
Uh, first-time manager;
Lyle's a first-time...

1159
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,424
I'm gonna stop doing that.
I'm gonna cut it out.

1160
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,193
Keep it to first
and second person.

1161
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,595
Who's next?

1162
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,598
My name is Yo-Yo Santos.

1163
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,733
Yo-Yo, how about a high five?

1164
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:30,867
Whoa.
- Whoa.

1165
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,936
Yo-Yo, easy, buddy.
I come in peace.

1166
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,437
NICK:
Geez, Yo-Yo,
did you get

1167
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,705
beat up a lot in school?

1168
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,574
I was homeschooled by my mom.

1169
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:38,775
BILLY:
Did you get beat up

1170
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,176
a lot in homeschool?

1171
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,345
Discipline is a very
important part of growth.

1172
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,346
But my mother
was actually

1173
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,581
a very nurturing person.

1174
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,982
For example, she
provided me selflessly

1175
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,650
with the milk
of her bosom

1176
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,285
until I was
seven years old.

1177
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,787
So it's like, uh,

1178
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,555
you're tying your shoe,
you're climbing trees,

1179
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,624
you're blowing up fireworks,
and then you're right on Mom.

1180
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,825
You got mouth on Mom.

1181
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,694
Breast-feeding leads
to a higher IQ.

1182
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,862
Okay.
NICK: Actually,
the science

1183
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,197
isn't quite definitive on that.

1184
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,565
I was bottle-fed.

1185
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,633
It never slowed me down.

1186
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:04,968
Vitamins are vitamins,

1187
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,138
whether they come
from a teat or a baba.

1188
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,672
Wrong.

1189
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,974
Sorry, what was that?

1190
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,108
Wrong.

1191
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,777
The teat or baba thing,
it's wrong.

1192
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,412
I just Googled it,
so you're wrong.

1193
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,114
Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart.

1194
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,649
NICK:
Well, it's a pleasure

1195
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,917
to meet you, Stu.
You know, you can't trust

1196
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,519
everything you read
on the...

1197
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,587
The <i>Journal of the American</i>
<i>Medical Association?</i>

1198
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,688
Sounds pretty trustworthy.

1199
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,790
It says that breast milk

1200
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,857
has more nutrients

1201
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,926
and that those nutrients

1202
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,728
are more easily
digested and absorbed.

1203
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,896
Your confusion
is understandable, though.

1204
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:33,997
You were bottle-fed.

1205
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,231
He's right. That's right.

1206
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,599
Whoa, guys,

1207
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,301
where's all this hostility
coming from?

1208
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,370
Where do you think
it's coming from, you big tree?

1209
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,771
Two fifths
of our team are

1210
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,073
made up of two old guys
who don't know shit.

1211
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,008
Wow.

1212
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,243
Okay, guys, I, for one,

1213
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,012
am very happy to have

1214
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:52,148
two strapping, mature
gentlemen on the team.

1215
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,149
Thank you.

1216
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,217
Oh, uh,

1217
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,952
I'm Neha Patel,
and oh, my God,

1218
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,787
you guys would make
the best Luke and Han.

1219
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,822
Excuse me?

1220
00:40:58,824 --> 00:40:59,956
Oh, <i>Star Wars</i> cosplay.

1221
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,724
Cosplay?
- Costume play.

1222
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:02,992
You know, where people dress up

1223
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,694
as their favorite anime
or movie character?

1224
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,095
I'd be slave girl Leia.

1225
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,532
Yeah, metal bikini top,
metal G-string panty,

1226
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,767
high-heel leather boots.

1227
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,802
Of course,
I'm chained at the neck.

1228
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,870
Not too constricted,

1229
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:17,006
but just enough
to make things interesting.

1230
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,241
The neck constriction's
interesting?

1231
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,342
Yeah, a few of us

1232
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,643
get together and...

1233
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,011
whatever happens, happens.

1234
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:22,946
Oh, uh,

1235
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,414
but work-wise, yeah, um,

1236
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,316
your skills
aren't really relevant here

1237
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,985
or really in this millennium,
so stay out of our way.

1238
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,887
We're gonna do this shit
on our own.

1239
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,455
NICK: Well, I'm
loving this friction.

1240
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,058
You know why? Because that's
how you get a fire started.

1241
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,759
I'm Nick;
this is my pal, Billy,

1242
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,994
and despite
what you may think,

1243
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,696
uh, we're here
like the rest of you,

1244
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,064
just running down a dream.

1245
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,199
All right.

1246
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,901
Team Lyle!

1247
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,302
No, okay, we'll workshop that.

1248
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,403
It's in beta.

1249
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,771
Okeydoke.

1250
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,107
Our Translate lecture
is in 15 minutes.

1251
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,844
Translate is about giving
everyone access

1252
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,212
to every word ever written,

1253
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,148
no matter what language
it was written in,

1254
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,218
because when the entire
world can see, read

1255
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,655
and find the rest of
the world's cool stuff,

1256
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:06,890
good things start happening.
BILLY: Lyle,

1257
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,691
you laying-in-the-weeds
son of a bitch.

1258
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,393
You're hot for
teacher, my man.

1259
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,230
I took her dance class
here once,

1260
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,766
but she doesn't even know
I exist.

1261
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,800
What are you
talking about?

1262
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,369
"Doesn't know you exist"?

1263
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,571
Come on, you're communicating
with her right here.

1264
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,805
What's this thing?

1265
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,974
Oh, no, this is just
the company intranet.

1266
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,911
It's got info
on every Google employee

1267
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:31,347
like birthdays, trivia,
meeting calendars, everything.

1268
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,316
Really?

1269
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,884
Hmm.

1270
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,198
Oh, hey, fancy seeing you here.

1271
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,433
Is it?

1272
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:52,702
Or maybe you calendar-stalked me
and you knew exactly

1273
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,103
where I was gonna be right now.

1274
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,239
Now, am I detecting
a bit of an accent?

1275
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,140
You are.

1276
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,142
Uh-huh,
I have a very good ear.

1277
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:01,177
English, right? 'Ello, guvna.

1278
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,646
<i>Oliver Twist,</i>
<i>"more bread, please, sir."</i>

1279
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,214
Australian, actually.

1280
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,417
Really?
Similar flags, though.

1281
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,885
Hey, Dana.
- Kiwi.

1282
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,219
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> country.

1283
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,688
Okay, the stain
on this one's better,

1284
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,222
but the white one
may be a goner.

1285
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,390
Okay, thanks.

1286
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,625
I eat very fast.

1287
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:16,659
Bangers and mash.

1288
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:17,660
That's also British.

1289
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,028
Vegemite sandwich, then,

1290
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,763
which I'm sure you
gobble down very quickly

1291
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,432
so you can get
back to the grind.

1292
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,901
I mean, it is impressive
staying at work till midnight

1293
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:27,236
every day--
also on the calendar.

1294
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:28,304
Look, Nick,

1295
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,307
I'm sure you're very popular

1296
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,343
with the 19-year-olds
at the University of Phoenix,

1297
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:36,980
with your Southern drawl,
and the blond hair,

1298
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,948
and this whole thing
you got going on,

1299
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,551
but I got to tell you,
this is just never gonna happen.

1300
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:43,920
"This"? What?

1301
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:44,921
I mean, it's...

1302
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,155
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1303
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,824
This is me reaching out
as an intern.

1304
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:48,925
They've encouraged us

1305
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,193
to approach experienced Googlers

1306
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,527
and just pick their brains.

1307
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,663
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1308
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:54,764
(chuckles)
Of course.

1309
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,199
You thought I was just...

1310
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,201
"Oh, who's this wanker
just steaming in?"

1311
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,870
You just want to learn.
You want to learn.

1312
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,305
Well, look, Sid here,
he's incredible.

1313
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,841
He's about to give a talk
on HTML5.

1314
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:05,842
Okay.
- Nick is desperate
to learn.

1315
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:06,976
He'd love to come along.

1316
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:07,977
Yeah.
- Let's make it happen.

1317
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,178
Yeah, sure.

1318
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,446
Okay, well...
- Come on down, brother.

1319
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,382
Sometimes we go
all day, all night.

1320
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,750
Well, I can't start any sooner
than right now.

1321
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:15,451
Let's do it.

1322
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,086
Cool, let's rock.
- Come on, everybody;
here we go.

1323
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,154
Now, wait, where are you going?

1324
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,822
Oh, I have a meeting.

1325
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,524
But you know that.

1326
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,659
Cheerio.

1327
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,860
(quietly):
Cheerio.

1328
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,194
SID:
Let's go.

1329
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,664
Come on, don't be shy.

1330
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,670
You have a crush on her,
my friend.

1331
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,204
CHETTY:
<i>Good morning, interns.</i>

1332
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,473
<i>Today marks the first</i>
<i>of several challenges</i>

1333
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,942
through which your team
will show their merits.

1334
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,744
While internally dogfooding
a new product,

1335
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:42,945
a number of Googlers reported

1336
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,814
a bug that disabled their audio.

1337
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,849
All two million lines

1338
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,652
of that code
are in the source files.

1339
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,854
Your job: find the bug.

1340
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,322
Okay, we should check
the user reports.

1341
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:54,791
YO-YO: Scan the logs
for any red flags.

1342
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:56,125
STUART:
See what exceptions
were thrown.

1343
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,560
LYLE: I always start
by drawing up strategies

1344
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:58,861
to sift through the code.

1345
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,530
Code, right?
Code, right? Codes.
- Right?

1346
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,198
Uh...
- So at the end of the
day, we're looking

1347
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,866
to kind of break the
password here, right?

1348
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,334
Maybe the answer's
in the question.

1349
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,969
Maybe it's
something with bug.
- Eureka.

1350
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:07,970
Bug like fly.
<i>The Fly.</i>

1351
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:08,971
Is Chetty a cinephile?

1352
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,307
Goldblum.
- Goldblum!

1353
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,942
Boggles my mind
that no one has a notebook out.

1354
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,711
You guys are focused
on writing this gibberish.

1355
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,179
Maybe that's helpful,
maybe it's not,

1356
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,147
but I guarantee you
what we're saying is helpful.

1357
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:21,451
Guys, we're looking for
a bug, not a password.
They're different things.

1358
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,019
Keep going
with that human connection.

1359
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,487
Oh, geez, you know what?
- You had it.

1360
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,156
(overlapping encouragement)

1361
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,891
We'll go on fly,
'cause that's where we're at,

1362
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,526
and we're flying it;
we're right there.
- Fly, fly.

1363
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:31,728
I know we're
buzzing around it.
- I like that.

1364
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,229
Zzz, Y-L-F.

1365
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,231
And it's a word scramble,
and it's life.

1366
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,999
For some reason, I can't
get "fly" out of my mind,

1367
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,434
and now I'm going Lopez,
Jennifer Lopez.

1368
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,103
Is it a fly girl?
- "Superfly."

1369
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,338
Pop fly? Uh, excavation.

1370
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,507
Earthquakes, California.
- That's it! Write that down!

1371
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,008
Where? Where?
- Do it, do it, write
it down, type it in.

1372
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,577
What am I doing?
- Would you please stop?

1373
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,213
No, we're working.
- No, <i>we're</i> working.

1374
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:54,350
Yeah, and that's a Sharpie,
by the way, genius.

1375
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,952
That's my fault.

1376
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:58,187
Go ahead and wash that.
(exhales)

1377
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,723
Look, guys, I'm sorry,
but you're not helping.

1378
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,191
You're just saying
a lot of words really fast

1379
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,493
that mean nothing.

1380
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,695
To find the bug, we need
to scan the user logs

1381
00:46:05,697 --> 00:46:07,764
and review the code until we
find the programmer's mistake.

1382
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,065
It's the only way.

1383
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,700
Except what if it's not
the only way?

1384
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,668
Go.
- Okay, you said
that someone programmed it.

1385
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,103
That means some person

1386
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,739
in this building
wrote that code.
- A human being.

1387
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,941
Let's just give him a name
and call him Tony.

1388
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,244
Tony.
- Let's say Tony likes kayaking.

1389
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,012
Kayak.
- All of a sudden,
me and Nick become friends

1390
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:24,580
with Tony; we're throwing
a few beers back.

1391
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,416
We're doing a little kayaking
with my main man, Tony.

1392
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,552
Tony's bombed on
the open water.

1393
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:30,520
Next thing you know,

1394
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:32,522
we start gabbing
about audio bugs.

1395
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:34,524
Yeah, I actually think
it's a great idea.

1396
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:35,858
Good, great!
- Finally!

1397
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,226
Dark and stormy, feeling us.

1398
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,895
Yeah, no,
feeling you big-time, buddy.

1399
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,663
Terrific.
- You know what, in fact,
why don't the two

1400
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,865
of you guys right now
go and find the programmer.

1401
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,267
NICK:
Great. Great idea.

1402
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,468
Yo-Yo, who's our man?

1403
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,538
His name is Charles Xavier.

1404
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,606
Charles Xavier.
- Perfect. Nick, write this
down.

1405
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,875
Steel trap.
- Uh, he's a professor.

1406
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,277
At Stanford.

1407
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,445
Yeah, just a few
minutes away, really.

1408
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,147
Guys...
- And he's in a wheelchair.

1409
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,382
Got it, Stanford, wheelchair.

1410
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:00,983
What else?
- Uh, oh, he's bald.

1411
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,186
Might be with his best friend
who wears a metal helmet.

1412
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,054
Wears a fitted suit.
- He looks like a geneticist.

1413
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,823
More, more, more, more.
Go on, hit us, hit us.

1414
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,158
Has a British accent.
- British? With my ear,
we're done.

1415
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,860
Okay, keep searching;
think fly, think bug.

1416
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,295
I promise you, somehow,

1417
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,696
this intersects with Goldblum.
- Billy!

1418
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,097
Let's get a move on.
- Goldblum, of course.

1419
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,599
NEHA: All right,
back to work, guys.

1420
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,205
MAN:
Hey, Professor, what up!

1421
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,777
Professor Charles Xavier?

1422
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,045
Very funny.

1423
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,746
British.
Listen, Professor Xavier,

1424
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:33,115
sorry to bother you. If we could
just talk to you for...

1425
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:34,250
Gentlemen,
I don't have time for his.

1426
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,284
BILLY:
Okay, Professor Xavier,

1427
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,586
we know that it's you,

1428
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,287
and listen,
we really need your help.

1429
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,956
All right, you-you found me out.

1430
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,390
I am Charles Xavier,

1431
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,060
and that's Cyclops,

1432
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,795
and Rogue.

1433
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:46,863
We're all here.

1434
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:48,197
Now, come closer.

1435
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,365
I want to share some

1436
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,467
of my telekinetic wisdom
with you.

1437
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,069
Well, I want you to share
with me,

1438
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,203
'cause I want to know
about these bugs.

1439
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,073
(groaning)

1440
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,808
Assholes!

1441
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,143
Oh, you maniacal monster!

1442
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:03,846
Professor Xavier
is a total dick!

1443
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:05,748
LYLE:
<i>Yo to the yo.</i>

1444
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,583
Where are we at on ensuring
it wasn't a networking issue?

1445
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,218
Confirmed there
was no packet lost.

1446
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,453
Almost done checking
on whether the encryption

1447
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:11,654
had the wrong certificate.

1448
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:13,089
I'm sorry, "almost"?

1449
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,223
Uh, you're either done
or you're not.

1450
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,291
You can't be almost pregnant.

1451
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,893
Yeah, hey,
she would know, guys.

1452
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,761
You know what, why don't you
Google "asshole," asshole?

1453
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:20,663
YO-YO: She's right.
It's not good enough.

1454
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,098
Get it together, Yo-Yo.

1455
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,966
What the fuck was that?

1456
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,469
I was punishing myself
for my inferior performance.

1457
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,004
STUART:
Well, that's good.

1458
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,372
That's great.
We got crazy over here

1459
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,474
and crazy horny over here.
- Oh, let me guess.

1460
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,509
Big dick 'cause...
little dick?
- Did your mind

1461
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,111
just immediately go
to a penis joke?

1462
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,279
Is that, like, all you...
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1463
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:37,380
Was that not witty enough
for you?

1464
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,714
Because I'm too busy working.

1465
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:40,483
No, yeah, that's fine.
I just want you

1466
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,884
to acknowledge the fact that
I'm winning the quip-off.

1467
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,586
That's what you're worried
about right now?

1468
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,121
Yes, that's really
what I'm worried about.

1469
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,255
So you're more concerned
with snarky banter

1470
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,523
than actually winning?
- Yeah.

1471
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,496
WOMAN: The deadline's at
the end of the week, so...

1472
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:55,164
Hey, hey.

1473
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,999
You guys find Professor Xavier?

1474
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,134
Yeah, we found him.

1475
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:59,335
Yeah, thanks
so much for that.

1476
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,503
That's, uh...

1477
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,138
really great
team spirit.

1478
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,639
Mind sliding over here?

1479
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,409
YO-YO:
I'm sorry.

1480
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,811
It really doesn't look like
there's enough room for you.

1481
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,615
Have a great lunch.

1482
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:13,716
Yeah, enjoy it.

1483
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,852
BILLY (sighing):
Okay, let's see here.

1484
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,790
(sighs)
Let's see.

1485
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,825
See anything?
- Oh, there's an opening.

1486
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:25,761
Is that taken? Okay.
WOMAN: It's taken.

1487
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,500
Let's go over here.

1488
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,304
Hi, Headphones.
You mind if we sit here?

1489
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,840
NICK:
I think we can take that

1490
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,308
as a "yes."
- All right.

1491
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,777
We're gonna have to
at this point.

1492
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,646
How you doing, bud?

1493
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,548
He doesn't even
know we exist.

1494
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,717
He's like some kind
of a superhero on this computer.

1495
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,752
Look at him;
he's just crushing his thing

1496
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:51,087
and kicking ass.

1497
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,455
Do you remember
what it felt like

1498
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:54,657
to be that good at something?

1499
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,859
Look at this!

1500
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:57,994
William.

1501
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,328
Nicholas.

1502
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,731
Person I don't know.

1503
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,599
Figured I'd find you
at the cool kids' table.

1504
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,936
It's like a confederacy
of outcasts out here.

1505
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,738
Heard you had
a day trip to, uh,

1506
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,139
Palo Alto?

1507
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:13,776
Home of Silicon Valley and
also the X-Men, apparently.

1508
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,478
Where are you going
with this, Graham?

1509
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,947
Oh, I just wanted
to let you guys know,

1510
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,348
we won the bug challenge.

1511
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,083
What are you gonna do
about it, boys?

1512
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,985
I wouldn't worry if I was you
about what we're gonna do

1513
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,820
or what we're not gonna do;
we're gonna be just fine.

1514
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,489
You're gonna be fine?
All right.

1515
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,790
Keep telling yourself that.

1516
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,992
See you all-stars
at the intramural fields

1517
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,327
for the next challenge
I'll win.

1518
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,596
Sports. Something
we know about, baby.

1519
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,164
Something we know
a lot about, baby.

1520
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,932
Come on, now.
- Look at me.

1521
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,167
For real.

1522
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:40,202
¶

1523
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,371
(cheering, whistling)

1524
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,113
¶

1525
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,125
All right, teams,
welcome to the Quidditch pitch.

1526
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:05,795
Let's have a good,
clean match, Nooglers.
(whistle blows)

1527
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,396
(crowd cheering)

1528
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,036
Fatty, don't touch the ball.

1529
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,038
Okay, rules. The Beaters toss
the Bludgers at the Chasers

1530
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,007
before they can get the Quaffle
through the three rings.

1531
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,809
No blagging, no blatching,
no bumphing, no haversacking.

1532
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:21,677
I don't want to see
any Quaffle-pocking.

1533
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,913
No Imperius curses,
no Confundus charms.

1534
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,015
In the unlikely event
of a Dementor attack,

1535
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:27,616
use a Patronus charm.

1536
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,852
I recommend the stag,
but that's a personal decision.

1537
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:31,554
Lyle, Lyle, Lyle,
these beautiful idiots

1538
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:32,588
have no idea
what you're talking about.

1539
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,923
Use your Muggle words.
Come on.

1540
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,391
Come on, Lyle,
you're making me feel

1541
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,026
like I'm back in
math class, okay?

1542
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:40,096
You got a couple savants here
with eye-hand coordination.

1543
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,431
Just say "game on"
and let us play.

1544
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,033
Fair enough; version 2.0.

1545
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,134
Peg them with the kick balls

1546
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,435
before they throw the volleyball

1547
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,570
through the hoop.

1548
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:48,904
Brooms in, people.

1549

Hufflepuff!

1552
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:54,110
Yeah, son!

Yeah, let's get it.

1554
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,079
All right, game time.

1556

Billy, Billy,

1571
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,258
What do I do?
- What are we doing?

1572
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,592
How do I do it?
- It's chaos!

1573
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,895
WOMAN:
Come on, you got it.

1574

Billy, I'm lost.

1575

What the hell was that?

1579

Why don't you try looking up
and giving a shit, man?

1580
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,843

- Come on!

1581

I can't take this! What am I
supposed... Come get me.

Who do I hit?

1583
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:04,680
LYLE: No, no!
- Come get hit.

1584
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,748
Who wants to fight?
(whistle blows)

1585
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,982
I want somebody
to hit!

1586
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,317
Get the broom
between the legs, folks.

1587
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,652
My bad. Let's go, let's go.

1588

Lesson learned, lesson learned,
lesson learned.

1589

What the fuck does this have
to do with computers?

1590

- Stop.

Don't move, fatty.

Come on, let's huddle up.

1604

Good work, everybody.

1605
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,417
Everybody except for you, Zach.

1606
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,385
It's over.
- Yeah, our team's a joke.

1607
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,587
Well, I ain't laughing.

1608
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:45,788
What about you, Billy?

1609
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,889
Hell, no.

1610
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,991
Listen, we need to
get our minds right

1611
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,359
and start believing.

1612
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:51,427
BILLY:
This reminds me
of a little girl

1613
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,461
who had to get
her head right

1614
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:53,495
and start believing,

1615
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:54,763
a little girl from a steel town

1616
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,098
who had the
dream to dance.

1617
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,866
No one believed
in that little welder girl,

1618
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,501
but thank God she believed
in herself.

1619
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,502
Are you talking
about <i>Flashdance?</i>

1620
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:01,570
The movie from the '80s?

1621
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,871
Yeah, you're
damn right I am.

1622
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:03,872
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

1623
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,574
Got it.
- The deck was stacked

1624
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,710
against Alex, and you know
how she overcame those odds?

1625
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,278
By believing in
herself and trying.

1626
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,014
She literally had
to become a maniac.

1627
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:14,049
Have any of you ever
been called a maniac?

1628
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,084
Maybe because you were

1629
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,085
a little bit different?

1630
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,453
My mom calls me a maniac

1631
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,654
every night when I tell her
I love her.

1632
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:19,922
Of course she does, Yo-Yo.

1633
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,258
You are a little bit,
in a good way.

1634
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,292
Well, guess what.

1635
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:24,727
That old Bill Gates,

1636
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,729
they called him
a maniac, too.
- No question.

1637
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,131
Yeah, I don't think anyone
ever called him a maniac.

1638
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,966
I just called
him a maniac.
- Okay, damn it, guys.

1639
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,468
You guys are getting
off the point here.
- You're right.

1640
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,769
She had to strip
down to nothing.

1641
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,638
She had to sit in that chair
and arch her back,

1642
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,772
and she pulled
a chain to nowhere,

1643
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,940
and doused herself with water.

1644
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,475
Yeah, where did that
water come from?

1645
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:41,176
Who knows?
- It came from her belief

1646
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,611
that it was there.

1647
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,713
She believed so hard she
found herself with an audition

1648
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,615
in front of those stuffed shirts
at the dance school,

1649
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,085
and she spun...
oh, and she spun and she spun

1650
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:51,787
and she spun
and she spun

1651
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,856
and she spun herself into
that dance school.

1652
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:56,125
And she spun herself
into our hearts.

1653
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,526
Now,

1654
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,861
in the second half

1655
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:00,896
of whatever the hell
you guys call this game,

1656
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,332
can't we all be
that little welder girl

1657
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,900
who wants to be
something more?

1658
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,435
Now, look, I know you
guys aren't excited

1659
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,737
that we're on your team,
but we're here.

1660
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,939
Guys, we're in
this thing together.

1661
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:13,075
So I'm asking you,
believe in yourselves,

1662
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,209
believe in each other.

1663
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,279
Let's put on our
leg warmers,

1664
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,348
and let's dance our asses off.

1665
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,750
Come here, you little
lovable maniacs. Get in here.

1666
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,019
All right, now, I got an idea
that I think would make

1667
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,521
Bear Bryant smile.
NEHA: No idea

Who the fuck is this now?

1710
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,143
Zach, get over here.

1711
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,879
All right, Fatface, I think
it's time to fake an injury.

1712
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:58,781
I don't know how
to fake an injury.

1713
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,282
(punch lands)
(yells in pain)

1714
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,317
Man down.
(Zach sobbing)

1715
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,685
¶

1716
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,220
Get the tennis ball and we win!

1717
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,789
(cackling)

1718
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,494
¶

1719
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,497
NEHA:
Run, you big tree!

1720
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:17,232
NICK: Aah!
NEHA: Go!

1721
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:20,469
Come on, ref,
you gonna call that?!

1722
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,576
(distorted whoosh,
gasping, grunting)

1723
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:28,544
(blows whistle)

1724
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,114
(roaring)

1725
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,449
(shouting)

1726
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,883
Yeah! Yeah!

1727
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,390
¶

1728
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:44,626
(triumphant roaring)

1729
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,562
BILLY: You can't be serious.
That bitch just snaked me.

1730
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:47,963
That's got to be illegal.

1731
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,065
Sorry, if I didn't see it,
I can't call it.

1732
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,334
NICK:
You okay there, Golden Boy?

1733
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:53,402
Yeah, the Snitch is fine.

1734
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:54,870
G.D. it!

1735
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,338
Don't start that, Yo-Yo.

1736
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,573
You did your best

1737
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,808
out there today.
That's the first time

1738
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,743
we all came together as a team.

1739
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,679
NICK:
Goddamn it, Billy's right.

1740
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,414
Let's keep it rolling.

1741
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:06,982
Just keep it rolling.

1742
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,951
Come on, let's
get a frosty.

1743
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:11,887
(panting): Nick?
- Yeah?

1744
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,223
Would I be wrong
to call you my brother?

1745
00:58:14,225 --> 00:58:15,958
Of course not.
I'd do anything

1746
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,392
for my little show pony.

1747
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,961
Look at me. Anything.

1748
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,196
I'm gonna need you
to ice my balls for me.

1749
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,869
Brother!

1750
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,510
NICK (sighing):
Oh, boy.

1751
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,446
Time to shut the engines down
for a little bit and...

1752
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,448
take a load off, Nicky.

1753
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,149
Oh, boy. What would I do

1754
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:44,686
without these babies?
- This is a "shh" zone.

1755
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,522
(whispering):
Hi. Hey.

1756
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,023
Sorry.

1757
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,525
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1758
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:52,761
By the way, thank you
for sending me to that seminar.

1759
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,663
It was actually
pretty interesting.

1760
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:55,731
Really?

1761
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:56,999
Absolutely.

1762
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,600
(chuckles)
What have you been up to?

1763
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,269
I'm gonna go.

1764
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:01,770
No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1765
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,605
You were here first;
I'll leave.

1766
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:04,907
Sorry.

1767
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,708
Uh, one thing before I go;
quick question.

1768
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,210
If I was to invite someone out

1769
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,579
to a really nice dinner
around here, where would I go?

1770
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,581
Um...

1771
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,216
I wouldn't know, actually.

1772
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,852
I spend most of my time
on campus.

1773
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:19,154
What?! That's criminal!

1774
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,189
Has it occurred to you that
I work hard for a reason?

1775
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,891
Hmm? This may
sound silly

1776
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,394
to you, but I actually
believe that what we do here

1777
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,296
helps make people's lives
a little bit better.

1778
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,164
No, no, no. I-I'm not
saying that sounds silly.

1779
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,566
I think it's
admirable. I agree.

1780
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:31,767
I'm just saying
that sometimes

1781
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,835
with all the work,
that you can...

1782
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,572
forget about the person
that matters the most.

1783
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,074
Is this a nap pod
or a convo pod?

1784
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,376
Oh, that's right--
it's a nap pod.

1785
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,412
Shh!
- Yikes.

1786
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:45,080
(whispers): I know
where you're going with this.

1787
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,214
Where?
- You think I'm some

1788
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,649
30-year-old exec who's devoted

1789
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,184
her entire life to her career.

1790
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,954
Right? And one day
I'm gonna wake up wanting more.

1791
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:54,056
Stop me if I'm off base here.

1792
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:55,390
No?
- Well, no...

1793
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,925
What else does your
intuition tell you?

1794
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,393
That, um, I can't go
on Facebook anymore

1795
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,128
because it's nothing but
happy couples gloating

1796
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,064
about their perfect little
babies in those tiny socks

1797
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:03,565
that look like
goddamn sneakers?

1798
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,968
(laughing): Oh, yeah, yeah,
the little Chuck Taylors.

1799
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,169
Only I'm ten years
too late, right?

1800
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,470
Because while I've been working

1801
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,339
so hard, I missed out
on all the bad dates

1802
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:12,941
and the assholes,
and now I'm running out of time.

1803
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,377
No one told me
it was a game of musical chairs.

1804
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,112
And by the time
I figured it out,

1805
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,448
you know, you can forget it,
it's too late.

1806
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,983
Yeah.

1807
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,219
Anyway...

1808
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:28,123
anyway... is that kind of
what you were gonna say to me?

1809
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,525
Well, no, I was gonna suggest
that you work harder,

1810
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:31,827
that you roll up
your sleeves,

1811
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,495
that you buckle down
and you get to work.

1812
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:35,964
You can't change the world
when you're laying in a nap pod.

1813
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,933
No, but honestly,

1814
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,701
if any of what
you were just saying

1815
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:42,004
applies even slightly
to yourself, you might want

1816
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,438
to think about doing
something about it.

1817
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,940
And that's not me

1818
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,675
preaching at you;
that's coming from someone who,

1819
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:49,378
when they wake up, the first
thing on their calendar

1820
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,879
is regret.

1821
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,148
Now, that's not
a good feeling.

1822
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,884
(sighs)

1823
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:57,486
Anyway, I should go.

1824
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:59,021
MAN:
Thank you!

1825
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:01,857
But before I go...
- Ah, geez!

1826
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,992
Just bear with me.
I want to throw down

1827
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,394
a challenge for you

1828
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,562
to go out to dinner
before I leave town.

1829
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,432
I'll let you know
if a window opens up.
- Great.

1830
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,000
And if it does,
don't minimize it.

1831
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,869
Don't click
that little red "X"

1832
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:14,870
in the corner.

1833
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:16,271
See? I'm getting it.

1834
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,673
(whispering):
I get it.

1835
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,641
(laughs softly)
Okay.

1836
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,777
Shh. Go back to sleep.

1837
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,481
¶

1838
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,351
Hey, Chetty.

1839
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:32,320
Pretty good effort on the, uh,
Quidditch field yesterday,

1840
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:33,522
huh?

1841
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:37,159
It was a game throwing balls,
and you lost.

1842
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,227
Yeah, but we really rallied
the second half, I think.

1843
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,096
Uh, kind of a spiritual
victory for us.

1844
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,565
Well, perhaps you'll land
a spiritual job.

1845
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:46,301
You know, Mr. McMahon,
the admissions committee

1846
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:48,704
was split on you;
you made it by one vote.

1847
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:51,073
That deciding member
thought you showed promise.

1848
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,974
It's clear now

1849
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,077
that... he was wrong.

1850
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,480
Sometimes the long shots
pay off the biggest.

1851
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,016
Enjoy your pudding.

1852
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,719
I will.

1853
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,353
Oh, and, Chetty?

1854
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,788
Not for nothing,

1855
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,057
can't get me not to like you.

1856
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,667
BILLY: All right, guys,
let's take this new team spirit,

1857
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:21,269
and let's apply it to this next
app challenge. We got this.

1858
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,338
STUART: Yo, it'd help
if we had an idea for an app.

1859
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,541
NICK: You bet your sweet ass
it would, Stewie.
STUART: No.

1860
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,944
Never Stewie.
- Okay, you don't like "Stewie."

1861
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:30,712
Perimeter breach
acknowledged, Stuart.

1862
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:33,215
It'll feel good when
this one warms up to me.

1863
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:34,683
You know it's gonna
happen, right?

1864
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:35,884
I'll break you down like
a two-by-four, bronco.

1865
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:36,885
Watch me do it.

1866
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:37,953
Okay, come on, guys,

1867
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,254
let's brainstorm this puppy.

1868
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,822
We're gonna put
the coffee in the pot,

1869
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,224
and we're gonna let it
percolate. Let's go!

1870
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:43,658
I think it'll be
helpful to explore

1871
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,060
what apps have been
most popular in the past.

1872
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,561
Go.
- Go backwards to go forwards.

1873
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,296
Oh, and we can bin it,
you know?
- Fall out.

1874
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,765
Uh, categorize needle-movers
by type of user.

1875
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,133
You're gonna do what?
LYLE: There you go, Neha.

1876
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,634
Hit it both by function
and by user.

1877
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:54,636
The old two-prong. You're
on the forest moon of Endor,

1878
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,404
taking out the shield generator,
and you're launching

1879
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,606
an offensive
with Admiral Ackbar.

1880
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,341
It's not a trap.

1881
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:01,443
All right, guys, I don't want to
kill the momentum, or the mojo

1882
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,712
that you have cooking,
but to be fair with you,

1883
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:06,114
needles and categories,
they don't use apps.

1884
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,149
People use apps.

1885
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,416
So I have an idea--

1886
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,051
nowadays, people are
taking pictures, right?

1887
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,553
They have their phones now;
they're out.

1888
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,388
Something catches their eye,
they want to take it.

1889
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,590
But then the photo's just
sitting there-- what if they

1890
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:17,392
take that photo
and instantaneously

1891
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,894
put it out there on the line

1892
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:20,228
and they share it
with their friends?

1893
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,097
That's Instagram.
It already exists.

1894
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,266
It's one of the most
popular apps in the world.

1895
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:27,803
Facebook bought 'em
for, like, a billion dollars.
That's "billion" with a "B."

1896
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:29,504
Oh, no, no. Mine is
very different than that.

1897
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:29,504
How is yours something
"very different" than that?

1898
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,774
Because, in mine, you're taking
the photo instantaneously,

1899
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:34,142
you're putting the photo
out there on the line.

1900
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:34,142
It's online.
- Yeah, I'm putting my photos
out

1901
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,511
on the line
and I'm creating an exchange.

1902
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,280
Yeah, that's Instagram.
- But mine's more

1903
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,915
of a social sharing
on the line that's happening.

1904
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,383
Online.
STUART: Quick interjection.

1905
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,685
When you keep saying "on
the line," you do mean "online"?

1906
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:46,688
Stuart, don't do that.
You don't do that to a man.

1907
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,423
He's got a million-dollar idea
right here.

1908
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,058
Billion-dollar idea.
- Even better. Let him flow.

1909
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,726
Nick, I appreciate it.
You can't bring me down.

1910
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,595
I'm too positive. Come here,
let me share something with you.

1911
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,997
(scoffs) No.
- Please, come.
I'm gonna explain this

1912
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,399
to you in a way
that's visual.

1913
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,900
YO-YO: He's bigger
than you. Be careful.

1914
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:01,203
So, now you're out there,
take a photo. (clicking)

1915
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,871
Just a pretend one.
Go ahead.

1916
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,639
(clicking)

1917
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,942
BILLY: Now you take that photo,
you put it on the line,

1918
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:09,711
Online.
- ...put it on Twitter,
you put it on whatever you want.

1919
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,146
That is Instagram.

1920
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:12,681
That's Instagram.
- Hundred percent.

1921
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,850
I get it. We're hip.
- We're not dummies.

1922
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,586
Point taken. Now let's
go with my concept.

1923
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:20,889
Now you've taken a
photo instantaneously,

1924
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,357
or not instantaneously,

1925
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,060
and then you take those
and you send those out

1926
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:26,528
on the line.

1927
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,197
Online.
- You don't have to say shit.

1928
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,199
You don't. You just say,

1929
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,068
"I like that photo,"
and you share that photo

1930
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,436
instantaneously
on the line

1931
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:35,904
- Online.
- with your friends.

1932
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:37,205
Now everyone's exchanging ideas.

1933
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,740
Everyone's exchanging photos!

1934
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,208
And that's
why the photos

1935
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,944
that are being shared
on the line...
- Online.

1936
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,346
will be known as
"Exchangeagram."

1937
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,047
Nice!
- Holy shitballs, Billy!

1938
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,482
We don't have
time for this.

1939
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:49,184
Hello, fellow interns!
Graham Hawtrey here.

1940
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:50,552
I've taken the liberty

1941
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,355
of attaching a link
to our app, which has

1942
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:56,224
already been downloaded
230 times. Booyah!

1943
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,093
(horn plays fanfare)
NEHA: Great.

1944
01:04:58,095 --> 01:04:59,461
We're gonna lose
yet another challenge,

1945
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:00,896
we're not gonna
get these jobs,

1946
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,497
and our lives
are basically ruined.

1947
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,233
BILLY: Okay, hold on a sec.
Your life isn't ruined.

1948
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,434
You guys are 21 years old.

1949
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:08,370
You have your whole life
in front of you.

1950
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,338
Do you even know what it's
like to be 21 right now?

1951
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,773
I mean, a quarter
of the kids

1952
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,375
coming out of college
can't even get jobs.

1953
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:14,643
That's a correct statistic.
Mother says

1954
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:16,611
you can work hard and go
to the right school,

1955
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,213
but nothing
is guaranteed anymore.

1956
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:20,849
That's life. Sorry.

1957
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:22,384
NEHA:
These guys are right.

1958
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:25,120
The whole American Dream thing
that you guys grew up on,

1959
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,555
that's all it is
nowadays-- a dream.

1960
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,224
You're too young
to be this cynical.

1961
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,092
Do you really see
the world this way?

1962
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,594
STUART:
That's not how we see it.

1963
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:35,597
It's just...
the way things are now.

1964
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,198
BILLY:
All right,
that's it.

1965
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,733
Everybody up.
Here we go.

1966
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:41,002
Let's do it.
Breath-of-fresh-air time.

1967
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:42,203
Why? we have
work to do.

1968
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,238
NICK: No, no, no.
- Uh-huh. Ah-ah!

1969
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,572
Time to hit
the reset button.

1970
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,241
Yeah.
- We're taking it
to the street.

1971
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:47,943
We're gonna get our heads
right, 'cause we need

1972
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:49,611
to come together as a team,
'cause that's not happening.

1973
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,179
What about the app?
- This is bigger than an app.

1974
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,847
Okay, and by the way,
we do have something

1975
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,582
pretty terrific in our back
pocket with that Exchangeagram.

1976
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:56,184
Just let it marinate.
- Oh, we're holding four aces.

1977
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:57,619
Stop saying no before
you give it a chance.

1978
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,154
Oh, yeah, that's a winner.
NICK: Here we go.

1979
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:00,422
Time to light it up forever

1980
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:02,357
and never go to sleep.
- Let's go.

1981
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:05,427
LYLE: Can we talk about this
"online, on the line" thing?

1982
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:07,595
Please?
STUART:
We're gonna follow the morons?

1983
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:09,931
¶ Lookin' at, lookin' at,

01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,513
(raucous laughter)

1989
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,748
Eh...

1990
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,287
(speaks Chinese)

1991
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:33,722
Oh, <i>xièxie!</i>

1992
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:36,624
(laughs)
My friend here says there's

1993
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,727
a dance club down the street
that's supposed to be great.

1994
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:40,328
You're shitting me.
- No, I shit you not.

1995
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,663
Come on, let's hit it.

1996
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,832
¶ Driving my car
to a foreign place ¶

1998
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,136
¶ We want it all now,
we got it all ¶

1999
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:50,705
¶ Yes, look at that,

2000
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:53,074
¶ Look at how they lookin' at,
look at how they lookin' at... ¶

2001
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:56,411

(lively chatter, whistling)

2002
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,780
¶ Roll that

2003
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,982

Are you sure
he said "dance club"?

2011
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:21,569
You know, I was
rocking Mandarin,

2012
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,772
he was rocking Cantonese--
something clearly got confused

2013
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:26,207
in the middle, but I say,
boom goes the dynamite.

2014
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,143
Happy accident, right?

2015
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,414
Show you to your table?

2016
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,253
Great big world
out there, my friend.

2017
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:41,523
Just three inches up,
I beg you.

2018
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:43,224
Yeah.

2019
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,559
Any questions?

2020
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,595
(shuddering):
Oh... wow.

2021
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,130
Holy...

2022
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,799
shit, that's deep.

2023
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,737
BILLY: All right, I think
that's our cue. Here we go.

2024
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,238
- Okay.
- Great. Deal with it.
- Yes.

2025
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,007
Come on! Whoo!
- This is... this is good.

2026
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:00,075
I mean,
it's totally cool.

2027
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,543
It's great.

2028
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:03,278
You okay there,
firecracker?

2029
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,746
What? Yeah. Totally.
- All right.

2030
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,714
What? This...
this is my jam.

2031
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,349
I mean, this...
this here is my shit.
- No, look, I know

2032
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:09,684
this is your shit,
but look, if you don't

2033
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,319
want to be here,
I'll go grab those guys

2034
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:12,420
by their little boners,
and we'll drag them,

2035
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,189
we'll all go back on the bus.

2036
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:17,025
Yeah, we can...
- No, no, no, don't
do that, don't do that.

2037
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:18,393
It's just, um...

2038
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:21,129
I've only read
about this stuff, okay?

2039
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:25,467
Craigslist casual encounters.
<i>Twilight</i> fan fiction. Hentai.

2040
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:26,768
What's Hentai?

2041
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,437
Japanese comic books
where the women

2042
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,306
get penetrated
by octopus tentacles.

2043
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,142
Oh. Ah.
- Look,

2044
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:35,176
it's just...

2045
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,178
I have imagined... everything.

2046
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,014
It's just I've...
I've never done... anything.

2047
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,282
BILLY:
Hey, listen,

2048
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,684
your secret's safe with us.

2049

NICK:
And for what
it's worth,

2050
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:47,088
your imagination is so wild,

2051
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,325
reality's gonna be a breeze,
if not a letdown.

2052
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:52,060
(laughs) Thanks.

2053
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:54,062
Show you to your
table, cutie?

BILLY: It's about time

2060
01:09:15,552 --> 01:09:18,786
this group had a night.
NICK: Let the good times roll!

2061

BILLY: Bingo...!

2063
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:24,759
I-I can't.

2064
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,494
What?
You're 21, right?

2065
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,697
Yeah, but my mom says alcohol
numbs the brain.

2066
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,833
Look, I'm not saying
a shot of tequila's

2067
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,002
the first step on the
journey to self-respect,

2068
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:37,772
but goddamn, maybe it's a
step in the right direction.

2069
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,073
Maybe?

2070
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,408
NICK:
Your call.

2071
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,943
One shot.

2072
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:43,144

STUART: That-a-boy!

Yeah!

Yeah!

01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,285
Exchangeagram moment, bitches!

2083
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,457
Ready for your first
lap dance, professor?

2084
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:30,892
Are you kidding?
Yo-Yo stays ready.

2085
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,293
That way,
he doesn't have

2086
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,529
to get ready.
- This is Tapioca.

2087
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,931
She's studying
to be a dental assistant.

2088
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,199
Enjoy!

2089
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:48,710
(hand dryer whirring)
- It happens all the time.

2090
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:51,212
Some would say
it's the point.

2092

It's all good.

Trifecta.

BILLY: Is that your dance
teacher from back at Google?

2111
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:50,905
Go talk to her.

2112

LYLE (chuckles):
Y-Yeah, for shizzle, you know,

2113
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,876
I just go up and I'm, like,

2114
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,778
"Y-Yo, you want to join
the Lyle-High Club?"

2115
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,680
You know, Lyle, sometimes
the most radical move

2116
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,148
is just to be yourself.

2117
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,651
And I really like the real Lyle.

2118
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:06,387
Yeah?
- Yeah.

2119
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:09,257
Go on, you're
burning daylight.

2121
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,294
Let's do this.

2122
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,270
Uh, hi.
- Okay, good.

2123
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:25,073
Hi.
- Hi.

2124

Hi.

Hi.

2127
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:29,777
You were really good up there.

2128
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,446
I mean, that was
amaz... I...

2129
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,414
Not in... not in,
like, a sexual way.

2130
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:34,549
Well, kind of in
a sexual way.

2131
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:36,284
It was... you're very talented.

2132
01:12:36,286 --> 01:12:37,752
Everything you do is special,

2133
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,087
is what I'm saying.

2134
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:40,988
I'm-I'm just...
I'm so embarrassed.

2135
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,457
What? You're embar...
Are you kidding?

2136
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:43,858
Now we're even,
because dancing

2137
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,027
in your class at Google
was one of the most

2138
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,297
embarrassing moments
of m'life.

2139
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:52,734
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I don't remember
anything specifically awful.

2140
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:56,104
Oh, poop. You don't
remem... you don't...

2141
01:12:56,106 --> 01:12:59,374
Well, then that means
we're not even, and...

2142
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:01,976
there's only one very
unfortunate way to fix that.

2143
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:03,378
Oh.

2144
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,247
(grunting rhythmically)

2145
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,649
(laughs)
Okay, yes, all right,

2146
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:10,718
that is burned in my memory.
You can stop now.

2147
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,453
How about I stop...

2148
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:14,188
if and only if...
- Yes?

2149
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,757
I can buy you a drink?

2150
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:19,293
I would love that.

2151
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:20,328
Yeah?
- Yeah.

2152
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,362
Shots?

2153
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:23,431
Yes. Shots.

you were a wild one ¶

2161
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,234
¶ Wild one, wild one, ooh

¶ Oh, I-I like crazy,
foolish, stupid ¶

01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,576
but it's only part-time,
and it doesn't cover

2166
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:09,844
my tuition,
so I augment.

2167
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,379
No, don't augment;
you look perfect

2168
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,847
the way you are.
- Aw.

2169
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,882
Thanks.
- Could I get a dance?

2170
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,584
Not now.
- Look, bitch,
I don't know

2171
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:17,985
who you think
this geek is,

2172
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:20,521
but I spend a shitload
of <i>diner</i>in this place

2173
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:22,323
and I expect to nut.

2174
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:24,759
Yeah, I know, I'm totally
a geek, Biff Tannen. Huh?

2175
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,427
Who's Biff Tannen?

2176
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,430
You're, um, Biff from
<i>Back to the Future,</i> right?

2177
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,833
You want to take this outside?
- No, I think I'd rather

2178
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:33,401
stay here and talk
to the pretty girl.

2179
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:35,203
Yeah, well,
let's rock, not talk.
- Hey, man...

2180
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:37,305
Stop it.
- Hey, is there
a problem here?

2181
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,874
It looks like somebody needs
their two way older brothers

2182
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:41,609
to fight for them, huh?

2183
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:44,779
Oh, and it's the
United Colors of Nerd.

2184
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:46,414
Do all you guys
work together?

2185
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,749
I'm gonna out on a limb
and say it's a tech company.

2186
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,284
Free cereal
and ugly people?

2187
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:51,619
Oh, whoa! Hey!

2188

NICK:
Come on,
take it easy.

2189
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:54,722
Is this the Jets and the Sharks?

2190
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:56,290
So why don't you guys
head that way,

2191
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,392
we'll head this way,
and never the twain shall meet.

2192
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,961
Have a great night.

2193
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:02,830
That's a good idea.

excited chatter)

My mother hits harder than you!

Yeah! Down goes
Frazier! Whoo!

What's up! Oh, shit!

2203
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,224
See you again!
I'll kill you!

2204
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,026
Hide your kids!
Hide your wife!

We're too hot to party--

2208
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:40,535
that's why they
got to kick us out.

2209
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,136
'Cause they're gonna
call the fire department.

2210
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:43,838
Why don't you bring it
outside to party?

2211
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,973
NICK:
No more fun.
Come on.

2212
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,876
NICK:
Look at that view.

2213
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,745
Come on, you're
not gonna see that

2214
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:52,113
on your little
four-inch screen.

2215
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:55,016
You got to look up.
STUART (chuckles): Yeah.

2216
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:58,052
Okay, buddy, you were
an animal out there tonight.

2217
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,054
Right.
(laughing):
No, you were.

2218
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,789
Did you have a good time?

2219
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,425
Yeah, it was all right.
- "It was all right."

2220
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,693
Why do you do that?

2221
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:07,395
What do you mean?
Do what?

2222
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:08,829
Lowball me like that.

2223
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,932
Come on, I'm not
gonna take away your

2224
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:13,000
"cool guy" card if you
admit you give a shit

2225
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:16,337
about something or, God forbid,
you had a great time.

2226
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,507
(clears throat) Um...

2227
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:21,609
all right, it was fun.

2228
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:23,377
Stewie...

2229
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,246
What?
- Come on.

2230
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,781
All right, what?
What do you want me to say,

2231
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:27,982
it was the best
night of my life?

2232
01:16:27,984 --> 01:16:30,017
Only if it's true.
(groans)

2233
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,890
All right, it was the
best night of my life.

2234
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:37,725
My Noogler!

2235
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,328
Come here!
- My Noogler.

2236
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,663
Wow, I don't believe there
hasn't been one boyfriend

2237
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,565
along the way.
- Nope.

2238
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,233
That's embarrassing.

2239
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,235
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed of.

2240
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,938
You got plenty
of time for that.

2241
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,974
I mean, you're
the whole package.

2242
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,142
You're beautiful,

2243
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:56,744
you're smart,
you got great teeth.

2244
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,079
You do.

2245
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,681
Unbelievable chompers on
the old girl, I mean it.

2246
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,850
For sure. And, uh...

2247
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:04,719
terrific shoes--
I'm always excited

2248
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:07,054
to see what kind of getup
you're gonna throw together.

2249
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,756
That part's true.
- Well, it is true.

2250
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,157
A lot of great
things going.

2251
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,959
Some guy's gonna find
himself very lucky

2252
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,427
to be next to you.

2253
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,062
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

2254
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:18,566
Well, I am. And I've been
around a little bit.

2255
01:17:18,568 --> 01:17:20,568
I'm positive.

01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,916
Looks like you hit it off
with Saffron tonight.

2261
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:37,251
I'm texting her
that I love her,

2262
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:39,153
and I'm sending her
this picture I just took

2263
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,055
of little Lyle when
he made pee in the bushes.

2264
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:43,190
Look, he's winking.
NICK: No, Lyle,
Lyle, Lyle,

2265
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,026
that's a horrible idea.

2266
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:47,662
Please don't do that.
You're drunk off your ass.

2267
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,130
I appreciate your concern,

2268
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:51,332
but I'm flying, baby.
(high-pitched chuckle)

Okay, Lyle,
you're not flying.

2270
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,368
What's 17 squared?

2271
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,404
289. Why?

2272
01:17:56,406 --> 01:17:58,139
Give me a harder
question than that.

2273
01:17:58,141 --> 01:17:59,807
You know where I'm
driving with this.

2274
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,542
Try, uh, maybe square root
of 17.

2275
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:02,943
Like, 4.23, maybe?

2276
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:04,412
That's the app.

2277
01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:06,981
That's the app
we should do right there.

2278
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:08,582
What?
- Some quiz question
you got to answer

2279
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:12,820
before you can send a drunk text
or a drunk e-mail or phone call,

2280
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:14,789
something to protect you
from yourself.

2281
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,223
That's good.
Can we do that?

2282
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:18,559
Hells, yeah, we could do that.
- Are you shitting me?

2283
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:21,095
I could program the shit
out of that bitch

2284
01:18:21,097 --> 01:18:23,664
on the bus ride home.
BILLY: Well,
I'll take that

2285
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,100

Come on!

received ten times
more downloads

2300

than any other team's.

2301
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,644
It appears
that you have won

2302

01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:47,314
¶ She's coming home to me

2319
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:48,916
¶ Because I said

2320
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:50,985
¶ "I'm lonely,
darling, please" ¶

2321
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,653
¶ But instead of waiting...

2322
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:54,355
You got it, you
got it, you got it,

2323
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:55,523
you got it, you got it.

2324
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:57,558
Keep going. Come on.
Come on, Neha.

2325
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,993
You got it, you got it.

2326
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:02,530
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶

2327
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:03,864
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh...</i> ¶

2328
01:20:03,866 --> 01:20:06,167
(cheering and whooping)

2329
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:09,470
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶

2330
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:13,507
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh...</i> ¶

2331
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,379
(over TV):
Logan, I'd have Jean...

2332
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:20,581
Our Professor X was
way meaner than this guy.

2333
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,782
(laughing)
- You're not kidding.

2334
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,250
It wasn't funny at the time.

2335
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:24,718
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh</i> ¶

2336
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,954
¶ <i>Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶

2337
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:31,759
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh...</i> ¶

2338
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:33,027
So, you see, what I'm
doing right now

2339
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:36,030
is I'm supercharging
my CSS and HTML skills,

2340
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:37,832
'cause you can do them
both simultaneously.

2341
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,633
HTML5, right?

2342
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:43,571
That's one step beyond the HTML5
that they mentioned
the other day

2343
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:46,207
with the CSS3,
remember?
- No.

2344
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:47,641
Guys, when it comes
to writing code,

2345
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:49,643
you've got your choice
of a number of editors.

2346
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:52,246
Editors such as Emacs,
nano and vi...

2347
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:53,447
What? What does that mean?

2348
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:54,882
...have features
like syntax highlighting

2349
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,884
and syntax specific
autocomplete.

2350
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:57,885
Any questions?

2351
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,324
It occurred to me, why not
use Emacs rather than vi

2352
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,626
as the default editor
for Ubuntu?

2353
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:09,730
That's actually...
a very good thought, Nick.

2354
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:10,998
Thank you.

2355
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,067
DANA: Vi versus Emacs
is a constant debate.

2356
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,102
Moving on...

2357
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:19,073
Let's talk integrated
personal development.

2358
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:22,877
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶
¶ Oh, I love you

2359
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:26,513
¶ <i>Whoa, oh-oh,</i>
<i>oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i> ¶
¶ Oh, I love you.

2360
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:29,683
(phone ringing)

2361
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:31,452
Sammy.

2362
01:21:31,454 --> 01:21:33,487
What, did you forget an insult?

2363
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,990
Billy, you magnificent
son of a bitch.

2364
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:37,324
How's unemployment?
Listen.

2365
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,293
I want you two
to come work for me.

2366
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,961
Sammy, my boy,
I thought you retired.

2367
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:43,497
I did, Nicky, I did,
but I have stumbled

2368
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:46,000
onto King Solomon's Mines,
my friends.

2369
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,068
Two words:
motorized scooters.

2370
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,336
Head down to Modesto.

2371
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:50,638
Start checking out
the old-age homes.

2372
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,373
Ah, Sammy, we already
have the gig here.

2373
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,108
Whoa, whoa, we-we-we...
we got a new gig.

2374
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,242
Yeah, we're interns
at Google.

2375
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,343
Interns at Google?

2376
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:57,711
Who are you kidding?

2377
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:58,712
You're salesmen.

2378
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:00,214
This is a sales gig.

2379
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:02,149
It's a job.
- Sammy, we've had
lots of jobs.

2380
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,684
We're trying to build
a future here.

2381
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:05,486
And I'm trying
to get hard on my own,

2382
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:06,987
but the Cialis
is a guarantee.

2383
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:08,956
You finish up
with this "internship,"

2384
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,391
who knows what's
going to happen?

2385
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:11,859
Exactly. Who knows
what's going to happen?

2386
01:22:11,861 --> 01:22:13,761
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you repeating

2387
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,796
what I'm saying?
- Shh. Time for baby
to go night-night.

2388
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:18,632
No. What? You're...
Billy, you're cutting out.
- Shh...

2389
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:19,800
That felt great.

2390
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:22,069
(both laugh)

2391
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,273
You know what? I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

2392
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,574
All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

2393
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,011
NICK: You know, if this
is being a workaholic,

2394
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:32,513
maybe I should get a glass.

2395
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,082
I have 15 minutes
until my next meeting.

2396
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:36,550
Okay, well, here's the thing.

2397
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,519
You know how we were talking
about regret and...

2398
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:40,454
I remember you talking
about regret.

2399
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,022
Well, I don't want to add

2400
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:43,657
"not asking you out"
to that list,

2401
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,893
because that credit card
is maxed out.

2402
01:22:45,895 --> 01:22:47,528
Okay, so can we establish

2403
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,830
you are, in fact,
asking me out on a date?

2404
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:52,399
Yes. And I figure that I'm such
a mountain of mistakes

2405
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,102
that going out with me
just once this evening

2406
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,704
will be like
packing ten years

2407
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:59,907
of bad experiences into,
you know, one night.

2408
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:00,941
Okay. Fine.

2409
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:03,210
Yes?
- I'm saying yes.

2410
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:04,812
Great. Great. Okay.
- I'm in.

2411
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:07,181
All right. Yeah.
- Well, I'll leave
you to it.

2412
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:08,816
Okay. Tonight. Yes.
- Good. Okay.

2413
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,990
Hello, William.

2414
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:17,224
I've been watching you.

2415
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,425
You should choose your words

2416
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,094
a little more carefully
in a bathhouse.

2417
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:22,162
In the words of Nelly...

2418
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,264
"It's getting hot in herre."

2419
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:26,433
It's getting hot out there, too.

2420
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,135
You definitely
got my attention.

2421
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:31,271
All right... I'm feeling like
I want to go put my robe on now.

2422
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,007
Enough to do
a little research on you.

2423
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,341
What did we find out?

2424
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,076
Let's see.

2425
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:38,379
Your, uh... your company
was shut down.

2426
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,347
Your home was foreclosed upon.

2427
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,716
Your credit score
is actually negative.

2428
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:44,485
That's kind of
amazing, Billy.

2429
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,053
That's hard to do.

2430
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:47,955
You try hard, McMahon.

2431
01:23:47,957 --> 01:23:50,457
I'll give you that.

2432
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:53,494
But things never quite
work out for you, do they?

2433
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:56,697
So, I could waste my energy
trying to beat you,

2434
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:02,102
but it seems, given enough time,
you always find a way to fail.

2435
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:04,271
I just need to get
out of your way.

2436
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,407
So this is me going.

2437
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,180
Only two challenges remain,

2438
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:15,249
after which
a mere handful of you

2439
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:18,152
will be offered
full-time employment.

2440
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:21,789
Now, the next challenge
is manning the Google helpline.

2441
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:25,192
This is one of the most
difficult jobs we have--

2442
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:27,394
combining both
customer relations

2443
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,463
and product fluency.

2444
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:32,566
You will be judged on both.

2445
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:37,671
This is a very tight race
right now.

2446
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,109
I suggest you study up.

2447
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,548
All right.
Let's drill it and kill it.

2448
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,716
Authorization failure
with Google Drive. Neha.

2449
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,518
Permission's probably changed.

2450
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,253
Request document access.
- Bam!

2451
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,122
Chrome connectivity issue.
Nick.

2452
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:56,723
Unselect proxy server
for your LAN.

2453
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:58,092
Nice.

2454
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,194
Billy, I'm locked out
of my Google Wallet account.

2455
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:01,261
Is that under Gmail
or Wallet Help?

2456
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,863
"Uh, I don't know, sir.

2457
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,865
That's kind of what
I called you for."
- Right.

2458
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:06,900
Here's the deal. I'm pretty
terrific on the phones.

2459
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:09,436
I could sell prosciutto
to a rabbi, and I have.

2460
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,971
Except you're not here
to sell anything.

2461
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:12,406
STUART: Yeah, Billy,
you're not going to be able

2462
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:13,941
to bullshit your way
through this one.

2463
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,843
I mean, the only way to nail
this challenge is to study.

2464
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:17,478
You just... you just
got to do it, man.

2465
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,946
Well, great. Then study up
is what I'm going to do.

2466
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,681
I'm going to study up.

2467
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:23,317
Let me ask you, is there,
like, as a general rule,

2468
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:24,651
like, a blanket statement

2469
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:25,652
I could say
that could apply

2470
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:26,954
to literally anything?

2471
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,755
And then I'm either
going to shove

2472
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:30,657
product down their face, right,

2473
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,459
or I'm going to give them
another hotline?

2474
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,727
What you are exactly
is tech support.

2475
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:35,129
So, if you referred
them to another

2476
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,396
phone number,
what would happen

2477
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:38,132
is that your phone
would ring again,

2478
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,900
'cause you'd be the number
that they were referring to.

2479
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,802
What I'm suggesting
is give me the blanket thing

2480
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:43,604
where I'm not necessarily wrong,
I'm not necessarily right,

2481
01:25:43,606 --> 01:25:45,172
and then I'll either hit them
with another helpline,

2482
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:47,708
a real helpline, or I'll push
some product on them.

2483
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,243
You want me to shove some
product down their throat?

2484
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:50,677
'Cause I'll do it.
- Full disclosure:

2485
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:52,579
I think you're working
harder than you have to.

2486
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:55,282
All you have to do is click
the button and read.

2487
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:56,884
- I got it.
(button clicks)

2488
01:25:56,886 --> 01:25:58,318
Bam. Done. Read it.

2489
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,220
I got it. I'll do it.

2490
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,588
That's my man, Bill.
All right.

2491
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:03,023
It's going to be fine.
- You'll get it.

2492
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:04,558
LYLE:
How's everybody
else doing?

2493
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,059
STUART: Yeah, I'm good.
LYLE: Okay.

2494
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,430
NICK (mouth full):
Is it just me,

2495
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,266
or is this food
incredible, right?

2496
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:13,834
You're a liar.

2497
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:14,902
What do you mean?

2498
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:16,837
You were supposed
to be an asshole.

2499
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,639
Come on.

2500
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:20,908
You were supposed to
pack a decade worth

2501
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:24,077
of jerks and bad dates
into one night.

2502
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:25,078
Yeah.
- Remember?

2503
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,313
All right, now I remember. Yes.

2504
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:27,381
But so far,

2505
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,950
you've been... totally fine.

2506
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:31,185
Totally fine?

2507
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:32,586
Yeah.
- Wha-wha.

2508
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:33,921
No, I have dropped the ball.

2509
01:26:33,923 --> 01:26:35,889
I did promise that,
and I haven't delivered.

2510
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,926
You know what?
Can we get the check, please?

2511
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,627
May we get the check when you
get a chance, Jennifer?

2512
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:41,962
How'd you know my...?

2513
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:44,631
Well, it says right here
on this little necklace.

2514
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,633
And now that I got the name,
how about the number?

2515
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,701
Ah... I'm just kidding.

2516
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,504
Or maybe
I'm not kidding.

2517
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:51,905
You're so cute.

2518
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,407
So beautiful. Wow.

2519
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:55,876
Did you just
hit on the waitress?

2520
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:57,778
I did. Yes, yes.

2521
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,346
The lady asked for a jerk,

2522
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:01,415
and I am trying to live up
to my promise.

2523
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,584
I said ten years of assholes,

2524
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:05,819
so, you know, you got
some ground to cover.

2525
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:08,422
You know what? I think
you've had enough dessert.

2526
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:10,324
I've been watching you
eat all night.

2527
01:27:10,326 --> 01:27:12,392
Okay, let me take care of this,

2528
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,760
because you've got
to watch your figure.

2529
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,062
And you're right on
the borderline.

2530
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:16,230
You know what they say:

2531
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:18,532
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips," right?

2532
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:20,400
Mmm, this is divine.

2533
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,636
Oh, you do not know
what you are missing.

2534
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:24,238
It's incredible.
- That's nice. That's nice.

2535
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,473
But here's something you
aren't missing-- this check.

2536
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:29,042
Because I got the cab,
so there you go.

2537
01:27:29,044 --> 01:27:32,045
(both laughing)

2538
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:33,580
Oh.

2539
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,048
Jennifer.

2540
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,416
Bullshit!
- Right?

2541
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,252
Wow, a little heart
and everything.

2542
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:40,821
(laughs)
- Huh. Now, why don't you
take care of that?

2543
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:42,122
Because the night
is still young.

2544
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:43,423
I'm taking you
to see some dogfighting.

2545
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,858
Yes, I am.

2546
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,527
Rock and roll.
I think we're up to five years.

2547
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:48,829
(laughing):
Yeah.

2548
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:49,696
All right.

2549
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:50,998
Oh... yeah,
let me get this.

2550
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,201
Oh, that's a... that's amazing.

2551
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:56,737
(both laughing)

2552
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,039
BILLY:
<i>Okay...</i>

2553
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:03,310
"In Gmail, a 'bad request'
message shows if..."

2554
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:05,379
Shows if...

2555
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:07,381
"Your Internet is down."

2556
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,684
Son of a bitch.

2557
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:12,219
It shows...
- Jesus Christ!

2558
01:28:12,221 --> 01:28:14,221
You scared the shit out of me!

2559
01:28:14,223 --> 01:28:18,325
...if your browser
has a bad or outdated cookie.

2560
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,395
Wait, you could... with...?
- Hmm?

2561
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:22,929
Yes.

2562
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:24,665
I... I can hear everything.

2563
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:27,367
I'm... I'm not actually
listening to anything.

2564
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:29,536
This allows me
to be with myself.

2565
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:32,806
I'm not very good
with other humans.

2566
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:38,445
Well, I'm not very good
with Gmail Support.

2567
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:39,780
No, actually,

2568
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,248
you're quite horrible.

2569
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,649
(chuckling)

2570
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,117
You can do this.

2571
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:46,119
This can be learned.

2572
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:47,788
But those kids,

2573
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:52,125
the way that they look at you--
you have a way with people.

2574
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:53,460
(inhales deeply)

2575
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:56,330
(blowing loudly)

2576
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,532
That's a lost art.

2577
01:28:58,534 --> 01:29:01,201
Go again. Go again.

2578
01:29:01,203 --> 01:29:02,669
(taps keys)

2579
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,238
"In Chrome..."

2580
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,873
For you, this is like

2581
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,109
teaching a little kid
the alphabet, right?

2582
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:12,446
No, actually, it's like
teaching a kid a letter.

2583
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,948
Just one letter.
- Yeah.

2584
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,750
Yeah, you're not...
you're not... your strong point

2585
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:18,318
would not be
communicating to humans.

2586
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,987
I know.

2587
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:25,926
(both laughing)

2588
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:28,095
All right, that was my guy.
All right.

2589
01:29:28,097 --> 01:29:29,930
Give it to me straight.
I like it.

2590
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,565
No chaser.
- We're having fun.

2591
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:33,300
I am.
I hope you are.

2592
01:29:33,302 --> 01:29:35,402
(both laughing)

2593
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,414
¶

2594
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,325
Well, thank you.

2595
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:00,660
That was, uh, really awful.

2596
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:02,262
Oh, you're welcome.

2597
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:03,463
I aim to please.

2598
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:04,731
I told you I was
going to deliver

2599
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,566
on ten years of assholes,

2600
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,802
and I think I did
a pretty good job.

2601
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,337
It was almost a little bit
too convincing at times.

2602
01:30:10,339 --> 01:30:11,571
Was it?

2603
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:12,639
Mm-hmm.
- That doesn't surprise me.

2604
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:14,007
When you've been out there

2605
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:15,809
running and gunning
for as long as I have,

2606
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:17,611
you learn to
play the game.

2607
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:19,780
Oh. I'd be out there
laying my rap.

2608
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:21,348
I'd have girls
literally thinking

2609
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,649
I was an astronomer.

2610
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:24,785
I'd be pointing out
constellations

2611
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:27,487
and harvest moons.

2612
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:28,688
"Oh, there's Pluto
over there."

2613
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,956
And then they'd start

2614
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,591
to fact-check you
with the Internet.

2615
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:32,759
Oh.

2616
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,428
You know, Google
has singlehandedly

2617
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,396
cut into my ability
to bullshit.

2618
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:38,832
Cramping your style?
- Big-time.

2619
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:40,634
Making you a better person?

2620
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:41,768
Yeah.

2621
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,538
True. 90 % Google...

2622
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,273
ten percent you.

2623
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:49,176
Just ten percent? Really?

2624
01:30:49,178 --> 01:30:50,277
Let's call it 20 %.

2625
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:51,778
Come on.

2626
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,947
(both laughing)

2627
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,084
You know, I, um...

2628
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:04,357
I really didn't expect
to like you.

2629
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,261
I didn't think
you'd like me, either.

2630
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:17,838
DANA:
Thank you.

2631
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:26,513
That was my ride home.

2632
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:29,850
I know.

2633
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,527
CHETTY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

2634
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:42,362
Welcome to the Google helpline.

2635
01:31:42,364 --> 01:31:44,564
You will man the phones
for exactly one hour.

2636
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:45,699
Now, before you begin...

2637
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,033
I'm so ready
for this thing.

2638
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:48,802
I was up all last
night studying.

2639
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:51,838
This is where Team Lyle
takes the lead.

2640
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,107
CHETTY: ...icon,
accessing your account

2641
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:57,644
so that we can review
your work later.

2642
01:31:57,646 --> 01:32:00,914
The helpline... is open now.

2643
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,482
Google helpline.
My name's Billy.

2644
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:04,451
How can I help you?
- Google helpline.
This is Nick.

2645
01:32:04,453 --> 01:32:05,986
Great, so you're saying that
you're locked out of your Gmail.

2646
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:07,354
NICK:
Hello to you.

2647
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,122
Well, the good news
is Uncle Bill here

2648
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:10,891
happens to keep a key
under the mat.

2649
01:32:10,893 --> 01:32:12,459
But I'm going to play
a hunch here.

2650
01:32:12,461 --> 01:32:14,160
Delete all your cookies.

2651
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:15,395
Did that work?

2652
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:16,796
Great. Glad I could help.

2653
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:18,665
Yeah, what it is,
is you probably just have

2654
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:20,133
too many Gmails open
at the same time.

2655
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:21,935
You want to try to go ahead
and close a couple

2656
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:23,270
of those down
and see if that does the...?

2657
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:24,971
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

2658
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:26,406
Call with anything else.
- This is Neha.

2659
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:28,375
How can I help you?
It's not a problem.

2660
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:30,110
You're going to click
on the gear icon,

2661
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:31,545
then settings,
then advanced settings.

2662
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:33,713
Yeah, you can actually have
the same tabs open

2663
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:34,981
across all your devices.
- Yeah.

2664
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,583
So the browser windows
keep on opening,

2665
01:32:36,585 --> 01:32:39,252
and then you're telling me
that that's from Amazon?

2666
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:41,187
Your computer's got malware.
Use an antivirus software.

2667
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:42,889
But here's what I want to do.
I want to help you clear that up

2668
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,524
before the wife gets home.
Am I making sense?

2669
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:45,926
Okay, you're going to want
to sign in to Google Wallet.

2670
01:32:45,928 --> 01:32:47,427
Update your credit card
expiration date.

2671
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:49,129
That's the problem.
BILLY: Well, the calendar

2672
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:51,064
sync issue pops up
when you switch time zones.

2673
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:52,465
Are you on vacation?

2674
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:53,967
Miami. Very nice.

2675
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:55,702
Well, let's get your
browser cache cleared up,

2676
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,103
and then I'm going to talk you

2677
01:32:57,105 --> 01:32:58,572
through the best Cuban spots
in town there.

2678
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,473
Google helpline. This is Graham.
How can I help you?

2679
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,076
Okay, your device probably isn't
compatible with Google Play.

2680
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,645
And I want to have you out there
salsa-ing, sweating and grinding

2681
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:08,048
up against a complete stranger
that you don't even know,

2682
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:09,783
having a pretty good time
doing some wrong things.

2683
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:11,251
Are we on the same page?

2684
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,119
Okay, see that box
at the bottom of your window?

2685
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,955
Click that twice for me.

2686
01:33:14,957 --> 01:33:17,023
¶ Come on, baby, let me
hear you do that conga ¶

2687
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:18,658
¶ You know you can't
control any longer ¶

2688
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,260
(Billy scatting)

2689
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,461
Time's up.

2690
01:33:21,463 --> 01:33:22,829
So soon? Man, I was just

2691
01:33:22,831 --> 01:33:24,230
getting warmed up here.

2692
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:25,966
Good going here.
- Is smoke coming
off this thing?

2693
01:33:25,968 --> 01:33:27,834
Come on, Ladybug.

2694
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,202
Nice.

2695
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:31,004
Please submit your log files
so that I may review

2696
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:32,205
your work later.
BILLY: All right.

2697
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:34,808
Happily.
Just click the blue button.

2698
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,042
BILLY:
Where's that at?

2699
01:33:36,044 --> 01:33:37,310
Click the blue button,
upper left.

2700
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:39,145
Mine's not blue.
Mine's gray.

2701
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:41,047
Up in the corner.
It's not... I can't click it.

2702
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,449
What?
No, no, the blue one.

2703
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:43,750
Mine wasn't clicking.
Mine's gray.

2704
01:33:43,752 --> 01:33:44,951
Is anyone else's gray?

2705
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,920
Did you not hear
my opening remarks?

2706
01:33:46,922 --> 01:33:49,122
Yeah, no, I heard most
of your opening remarks.

2707
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,257
It's just, I was...
I was getting in the zone.

2708
01:33:51,259 --> 01:33:52,959
I was pre-gaming it.
- I was very clear

2709
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,694
that you had to log
into your account

2710
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:56,630
so that I could review
your work later.

2711
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:58,765
Well, the good news

2712
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,100
is that you
reviewed my work now.

2713
01:34:00,102 --> 01:34:01,468
You-you don't need
the instant replay

2714
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,436
because you saw
the touchdown live, in person.

2715
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:05,705
I don't really understand
that analogy,

2716
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:08,975
but I do know
that attention to detail

2717
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,944
is of paramount importance here

2718
01:34:10,946 --> 01:34:13,213
and my instructions
were explicit.

2719
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:15,248
Now, if there's
no recording,

2720
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:18,184
then it's as if you
didn't even show up today.

2721
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,087
Except I did show up.

2722
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:23,289
I'm-I'm sitting right here,
Chetty.

2723
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:26,926
Well, according to your log,
you're not.

2724
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:29,996
And since every intern
must complete the challenge

2725
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,699
in order for your team
to be scored...

2726
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,368
...your team

2727
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:39,272
will unfortunately receive
a score of zero.

2728
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,375
NICK:
Zero?

2729
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,745
Well done, Mr. McMahon.

2730
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:47,747
Perhaps more studying,
less pudding.

2731
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:49,215
Hmm?
- Chetty, come on.

2732
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:51,584
You're not going to trip us
with a technicality.

2733
01:34:51,586 --> 01:34:53,319
He's right here.

2734
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:56,089
GRAHAM: Oh, Billy, Billy,
Billy, what have you done?

2735
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,391
It's you lot I feel bad for.

2736
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:00,393
It's really hard
to get here.

2737
01:35:00,395 --> 01:35:02,462
Some of you are probably
pretty intelligent.

2738
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:04,330
You deserve better.

2739
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:06,399
I'm sorry.

2740
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,869
(sighs)
It's all right, El Niño.

2741
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,638
We'll get 'em.

2742
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:17,677
I studied for the test.
I studied for...

2743
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:23,083
STUART:
Well, that's great.

2744
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:24,384
That's another win
for Team Graham.

2745
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:26,119
YO-YO:
There's only one challenge left.

2746
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:27,687
Even if we're perfect,
it won't be enough.

2747
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:28,922
NEHA:
We had 'em, too.

2748
01:35:28,924 --> 01:35:30,423
NICK: We did, but,
you know, it's just

2749
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:32,692
a little hiccup,
a little adversity, all right?

2750
01:35:32,694 --> 01:35:33,927
STUART:
No, Nick, come on.

2751
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:35,695
Face it.
Look, Billy's a great guy

2752
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:38,398
and everything, but he kind of
blew it for us today.

2753
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,500
Yeah, I know...
BILLY: The kids
are right, Nick.

2754
01:35:40,502 --> 01:35:41,768
I just wanted to...

2755
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,169
come by and let you guys know

2756
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:44,504
that I...
I did study last night.

2757
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:45,672
I tried my best.

2758
01:35:45,674 --> 01:35:47,774
It's just, uh, you know,
today on the phones,

2759
01:35:47,776 --> 01:35:49,909
I just... it's my fault.

2760
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:52,312
And, uh...

2761
01:35:52,314 --> 01:35:54,414
He was right when he said
that you guys deserve better.

2762
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,783
I'm really sorry
that I cost you.

2763
01:36:01,021 --> 01:36:02,555
(clears throat)

2764
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,461
Damn.

2765
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,399
Billy, would you stop?

2766
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:15,301
Let me go, Nick.
I'm not helping anybody here.

2767
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:17,003
What do you mean,
you're not helping anybody?

2768
01:36:17,005 --> 01:36:18,204
You're helping those kids.

2769
01:36:18,206 --> 01:36:19,205
What are you doing?

2770
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,540
Where are you going?

2771
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,809
What, you're going to go
radio silence on me?

2772
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:24,210
Come on,
I'm not going to let you

2773
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:25,678
ride away from
the Garden of Eden.

2774
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,147
I let down the team, Nick.

2775
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:29,215
You didn't let
down the team.

2776
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:31,251
And who cares if
you made a mistake?

2777
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:33,319
Nick, I'm not taking everyone
down with me.

2778
01:36:33,321 --> 01:36:35,088
Billy, let me turn
these high beams on you.

2779
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,790
Give me a chance to turn you
with a sports metaphor.

2780
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,091
Damn it, Nick,

2781
01:36:38,093 --> 01:36:39,626
it's the best thing
for everybody!

2782
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:42,729
Stop dragging me down
with all your horseshit, man.

2783
01:36:42,731 --> 01:36:44,497
You're doing great here, okay?

2784
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:47,233
I'm not. I got it.

2785
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:49,169
Just get off my back.

2786
01:36:49,171 --> 01:36:52,672
How dare you.
How dare you.

2787
01:36:52,674 --> 01:36:54,007
Shame on you!

2788
01:36:54,009 --> 01:36:55,542
Put this badge back on!

2789
01:36:55,544 --> 01:36:57,510
If you're going to quit, quit,

2790
01:36:57,512 --> 01:37:00,713
but don't give me this crap
about it's better for the team.

2791
01:37:00,715 --> 01:37:03,483
Come on, Billy.

2792
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,624
(sighs)

2793
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:23,336
(power tools whirring)

2794
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,139
BILLY:
Randy?

2795
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:28,508
So, I-I'm, uh, Billy McMahon.

2796
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,844
Sammy sent me down here.
I'm the new salesman.

2797
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,380
Well, no shit.

2798
01:37:34,382 --> 01:37:36,449
My new partner.
(laughs)

2799
01:37:36,451 --> 01:37:39,052
CHETTY:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it has been</i>

2800
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:40,854
an impressive summer.

2801
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:44,357
And one final challenge remains.

2802
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:46,492
Sales.

2803
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:49,662
Over a million companies
advertise with Google.

2804
01:37:49,664 --> 01:37:51,497
Find one that doesn't.

2805
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:52,298
Convince them.

2806
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,800
The bigger the sale,

2807
01:37:53,802 --> 01:37:56,769
the more chance you have
of taking this competition.

2808
01:37:56,771 --> 01:37:58,171
The winner will
be announced

2809
01:37:58,173 --> 01:38:00,506
at our final meeting
this afternoon.

2810
01:38:00,508 --> 01:38:01,641
Good luck.

2811
01:38:01,643 --> 01:38:02,909
Happy hunting!

2812
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,277
On me.

2813
01:38:09,783 --> 01:38:11,684
Sales, son!

2814
01:38:11,686 --> 01:38:14,754
Man, those other bitches
are going down!

2815
01:38:14,756 --> 01:38:16,389
Wait, where's Billy?

2816
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:17,223
He left.

2817
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,391
What?
- You heard him.

2818
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,093
He thought he was
holding us back,

2819
01:38:20,095 --> 01:38:23,196
and he didn't want to talk
about it, that's for sure.

2820
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,998
We got to get him back.

2821
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,300
She's right, we're all a team--
that's what you guys taught us.

2822
01:38:27,302 --> 01:38:28,801
STUART: I mean,
it might have been buried

2823
01:38:28,803 --> 01:38:31,104
under, like, a mountain
of obscure '80s references

2824
01:38:31,106 --> 01:38:32,939
and just,
you know, a ton

2825
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:35,475
of other super inappropriate
bullshit

2826
01:38:35,477 --> 01:38:37,510
that I guess was intended
as life lessons,

2827
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:39,045
but, I mean,
you did teach us

2828
01:38:39,047 --> 01:38:40,079
how to come together, Nick.

2829
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,080
You taught us that.

2830
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,949
The problem is, when he makes up

2831
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:46,686
his mind on something,
ol' Billy has a tendency

2832
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,021
to really dig in.

2833
01:38:48,023 --> 01:38:49,088
We might have
to get ready

2834
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,356
to do this one without him.

2835
01:38:50,358 --> 01:38:53,493
Yeah, but, Nick,
we wouldn't want to.

2836
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:54,928
Right, guys?

2837
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,302
Hey, Tony!

2838
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:04,871
Slow it down, man.

2839
01:39:04,873 --> 01:39:05,872
I'm just kidding.

2840
01:39:05,874 --> 01:39:07,173
(laughs)

2841
01:39:07,175 --> 01:39:08,775
How long you been
working this territory?

2842
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:10,143
Three years.

2843
01:39:10,145 --> 01:39:11,577
It's great, though,
you know.

2844
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:14,414
You get to build a relationship
with the customer.

2845
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:15,581
And then they die.
(laughs)

2846
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,150
Suddenly you're reselling

2847
01:39:17,152 --> 01:39:20,386
scooters with 25,
35 miles on them, tops.

2848
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,255
Everybody wins.

2849
01:39:22,257 --> 01:39:23,756
Hey, hey!

2850
01:39:23,758 --> 01:39:24,991
Look who's back!

2851
01:39:24,993 --> 01:39:26,793
Hey, Randy!
- Randy! How are you?

2852
01:39:26,795 --> 01:39:27,827
(Randy sighs)

2853
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:30,697
How's it going, old-timer?

2854
01:39:30,699 --> 01:39:32,332
Hey, Randy.

2855
01:39:32,334 --> 01:39:34,267
What do you want?

2856
01:39:34,269 --> 01:39:35,935
Treat them like shit.

2857
01:39:35,937 --> 01:39:38,104
Only makes them want you more.

2858
01:39:38,106 --> 01:39:40,273
Hey, everybody!
Listen up!

2859
01:39:40,275 --> 01:39:42,308
This is my new
tail gunner, Billy.
- Hi.

2860
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,310
Billy, why don't you
tell them about that, uh,

2861
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,012
sweet ride you just
pulled up on?

2862
01:39:46,014 --> 01:39:48,448
Oh, you mean
the, uh, brand-new X-70.

2863
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,483
It's got an eight-hour motor.

2864
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:52,185
And it's got a rear-mounted
stainless sleeve

2865
01:39:52,187 --> 01:39:53,720
for your oxy tank.

2866
01:39:53,722 --> 01:39:55,755
You have no idea
how much boning

2867
01:39:55,757 --> 01:39:56,856
goes on in this place.

2868
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:58,124
It's amazing.

2869
01:39:58,126 --> 01:39:59,225
Check this one out.

2870
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:01,027
Ethel. That's her name.

2871
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:03,396
She calls my junk
"the cocoon."

2872
01:40:03,398 --> 01:40:04,697
Says it makes her
feel younger.

2873
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:06,099
Actually lowered
her blood pressure.

2874
01:40:06,101 --> 01:40:07,266
(scoffs)
I'm not fighting it.

2875
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:09,035
I'm a life-giver
and a lovemaker.

2876
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:11,237
Ethel! Ethel!

2877
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:13,072
(gasps)
- What's up, girl?!

2878
01:40:13,074 --> 01:40:14,240
Look who's back!

2879
01:40:14,242 --> 01:40:15,241
(laughs)

2880
01:40:15,243 --> 01:40:16,576
Come here, boo.
- Oh...

2881
01:40:16,578 --> 01:40:17,844
Who's your friend?
Well, hello there.

2882
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:19,445
Billy!

2883
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:21,247
What the hell are
you doing here?

2884
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:23,116
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?

2885
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:24,183
Billy.

2886
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,385
Hi.

2887
01:40:25,387 --> 01:40:26,719
Ethel and, uh, Doris here

2888
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:28,955
tell me they're up for
a little group play.

2889
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:30,523
Can I count you in?

2890
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:34,327
What the shit?

2891
01:40:34,329 --> 01:40:36,162
Uh, I'm sorry, Randy.
This is my old partner.

2892
01:40:36,164 --> 01:40:37,363
This is Nick.

2893
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,865
Nick, this is...
this is my new partner.

2894
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:40,266
This is Randy.

2895
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:42,969
Welcome to the jungle, <i>ese.</i>

2896
01:40:42,971 --> 01:40:43,970
What do you say, Billy?

2897
01:40:43,972 --> 01:40:45,238
Can I count you in?

2898
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,040
Mind giving me
just a second here?

2899
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:48,041
No problem.

2900
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,042
What the hell are you doing?

2901
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:50,376
New partner, huh?

2902
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,045
I'm a salesman, Nick;
I sell things.

2903
01:40:52,047 --> 01:40:54,614
Yeah, I remember another guy
who was selling some things,

2904
01:40:54,616 --> 01:40:57,550
plying the mattress trade,
when in walks this behemoth--

2905
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:59,952
big guy, big mouth,
big dream--

2906
01:40:59,954 --> 01:41:02,555
and he made this old
son of a gun remember

2907
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:04,057
there's still some dreams
floating around out there.

2908
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:05,391
It's not too late.

2909
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:06,726
You just got to reach
out and grab them.

2910
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:08,327
Damn it, Nick,
I reached for my dreams.

2911
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:09,362
Why don't you just
leave it alone?

2912
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:10,530
I messed it up for everybody.

2913
01:41:10,532 --> 01:41:11,597
You forgot to
click a button!

2914
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:13,833
You're not a
computer wizard.

2915
01:41:13,835 --> 01:41:14,634
All right?

2916
01:41:14,636 --> 01:41:16,202
You're also not a pussy.

2917
01:41:16,204 --> 01:41:17,770
You're tough.
You grew up in the '70s.

2918
01:41:17,772 --> 01:41:19,305
Remember what
that was like?

2919
01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:20,673
There weren't
any computers.

2920
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:22,075
Just like we didn't
have bike helmets

2921
01:41:22,077 --> 01:41:23,509
or sunscreens
or seat belts.

2922
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:25,044
Did you wear a seat belt?

2923
01:41:25,046 --> 01:41:26,112
No.

2924
01:41:26,114 --> 01:41:27,980
What was your
seat belt?

2925
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:29,449
My mom would go like this.

2926
01:41:29,451 --> 01:41:31,184
Yeah. It was your mom
going like that.

2927
01:41:31,186 --> 01:41:32,518
And how'd that work out?

2928
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,853
You know;
I went through the windshield.

2929
01:41:33,855 --> 01:41:34,821
89 stitches.

2930
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:36,289
Made you look like
a little bad-ass

2931
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:37,790
all of third grade.

2932
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:40,860
And were you afraid to get back
in that station wagon?

2933
01:41:40,862 --> 01:41:42,795
Nah. Five years later,

2934
01:41:42,797 --> 01:41:46,432
you took out that very same car
without permission from nobody.

2935
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,601
Not your parents,
not Old Man Law.

2936
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:52,872
It was just you and Sally Moran
parked at the point,

2937
01:41:52,874 --> 01:41:54,540
finger-blasting away.

2938
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:56,542
Didn't even know if you
were doing it right.

2939
01:41:56,544 --> 01:41:58,945
Nick, wh-where you going
with this thing?

2940
01:41:58,947 --> 01:42:01,414
I'm saying life
is that station wagon.

2941
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:02,548
All right?

2942
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:03,850
And yeah, sometimes it's gonna

2943
01:42:03,852 --> 01:42:05,651
throw you
through the windshield,

2944
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:08,955
crack your skull wide open,
maybe even break your heart.

2945
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:10,490
But every once in a while,

2946
01:42:10,492 --> 01:42:12,692
it's gonna drop a Sally Moran
in your backseat.

2947
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:14,827
Now, we came to Google
for a reason, right?

2948
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:16,696
I can't promise
we're gonna win,

2949
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:18,431
but we're going
back there,

2950
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:21,701
and we're gonna see those kids,
and we're gonna see it through.

2951
01:42:21,703 --> 01:42:23,503
You get your ass
back in that car,

2952
01:42:23,505 --> 01:42:24,704
and you ride.

2953
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:27,306
You hear me,
Billy Bojangles McMahon?

2954
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,509
Ride.

Thought we'd stop by.

That's really creepy.

2977
01:43:26,968 --> 01:43:28,167
Is that all?

2978
01:43:28,169 --> 01:43:29,669
It is all, actually.

2979
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:31,237
We just closed a sale

01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:32,772
at a coffee shop
down the street.

2981

Your chances of
catching up to us

just went from
zero to piss-all.

so profoundly deserving.

Zach?

2987
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:47,587
Eyes off the pizza, mate.

2988
01:43:47,589 --> 01:43:50,990
God made you lactose-intolerant
for a reason, yeah?

2989
01:43:50,992 --> 01:43:52,892
You're so fat.

2990
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:56,195
You're so fat.

2991
01:43:56,197 --> 01:43:58,064
Let's go!

2992
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,232
All right, on me!

2993
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,907
What a douche!

2994
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,042
(car horn honks)

01:44:10,044 --> 01:44:11,244
Guys.

2996
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:21,320
Welcome back, Billy boy.

2997
01:44:21,322 --> 01:44:22,455
Good to be with you.

2998
01:44:22,457 --> 01:44:23,856
What happened there?

2999
01:44:23,858 --> 01:44:26,158
Uh, well, he didn't bite,
so it did not go well.

3000
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,294
You know who else it
didn't go well for?

3001
01:44:28,296 --> 01:44:29,695
Lay it on us, big daddy.

3002
01:44:29,697 --> 01:44:30,730
That's right,

3003
01:44:30,732 --> 01:44:32,098
the little steel town girl Alex.

3004
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,033
When she finally got
her shot in front of

3005
01:44:34,035 --> 01:44:36,435
all those stuffed shirts,
she took a tumble and fell.

3006
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:38,271
You want to hear something
totally nuts?

3007
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:40,940
She picked herself back up,
she tightened that little ass,

3008
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:43,309
and she pumped her legs,
and she danced herself

3009
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:44,610
right back into their hearts

3010
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:46,579
and into a slot
at that dance school.

3011
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:49,749
And that's what
we're gonna do.

3012
01:44:49,751 --> 01:44:52,551
Tighten your asses.
Let's go.

3013
01:44:52,553 --> 01:44:55,121
Get her done, boys.

3014
01:44:55,123 --> 01:44:58,524
Listen, guys, we've always
done things the same way:

3015
01:44:58,526 --> 01:45:00,626
Yellow Pages, flyers,
<i>San Jose Mercury News.</i>

3016
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:01,894
BILLY:
Now, look, we're all

3017
01:45:01,896 --> 01:45:03,329
creatures of habit,
am I right, Sal?

3018
01:45:03,331 --> 01:45:04,463
I mean, we all like
what we know.

3019
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,032
There's no
question about it.

3020
01:45:06,034 --> 01:45:08,200
But you know what the
scariest thing in life is?

3021
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:09,435
Mmm.
- The thing in life

3022
01:45:09,437 --> 01:45:10,770
that frightens
us the most?

3023
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:12,605
Change.

3024
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:14,140
Yeah.
NICK: And by
the way, I think

3025
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:15,908
most people are guilty
of getting set in their ways.

3026
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,677
I know I need change
to come along

3027
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,179
and give me a little kick
in the ass to get me moving.

3028
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:22,815
All right, listen, guys,
I know where you're going.

3029
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:24,417
But I'm not gonna
change anything.

3030
01:45:24,419 --> 01:45:28,821
Like I already told your
friends, we're getting by okay.

3031
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:30,356
Sal, with all due respect, if
you fight for your limitations,

3032
01:45:30,358 --> 01:45:31,857
you get to keep them.

3033
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,159
Do you hear yourself?
You're getting by okay.

3034
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:34,794
"Okay"? I mean, Jesus!
- "Okay" isn't good.

3035
01:45:34,796 --> 01:45:36,162
I mean, "okay" isn't great.

3036
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:37,463
I'm starting to think
this guy's selfish.

3037
01:45:37,465 --> 01:45:38,898
"Okay" isn't fantastic!

3038
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,633
NICK: Look, I don't want
to get sideways with you.

3039
01:45:40,635 --> 01:45:41,701
You're as big as a barn.

3040
01:45:41,703 --> 01:45:42,902
He looks like
he was carved out

3041
01:45:42,904 --> 01:45:44,236
of a damn mountain,
for God's sakes.

3042
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:45,404
But you're an artist, okay?

3043
01:45:45,406 --> 01:45:46,472
This is great pizza!

3044
01:45:46,474 --> 01:45:47,907
Picasso with pepperoni!

3045
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:49,375
BILLY: And, hey,
stop it, do not even

3046
01:45:49,377 --> 01:45:50,443
get me started on the sauce.

3047
01:45:50,445 --> 01:45:51,444
I mean, is there
nutmeg in there?

3048
01:45:51,446 --> 01:45:53,145
Something.
- So look-it, I can

3049
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:54,814
respect the fact that you
don't want to divulge,

3050
01:45:54,816 --> 01:45:56,182
but if I'm right,
don't say anything.

3051
01:45:57,818 --> 01:45:59,652
Exactly!
- There's your answer!

3052
01:45:59,654 --> 01:46:02,154
There's your answer!
(chuckling): Sal, come on.

3053
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:04,824
All I'm saying is, why should
Papa John's make all the dough,

3054
01:46:04,826 --> 01:46:06,792
when Papa Sal's got
the better sauce?

3055
01:46:06,794 --> 01:46:08,227
SAL:
You know what?

3056
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:09,862
Now you're starting
to sound like him.

3057
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,931
He wants to open up
a Sal's in Los Gatos.

3058
01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:13,466
FRANKIE: The bigger
chains are killing us.

3059
01:46:13,468 --> 01:46:14,834
We're barely staying afloat.

3060
01:46:14,836 --> 01:46:16,736
When you franchise,
you lose quality.

3061
01:46:16,738 --> 01:46:19,205
You lose the taste
that people trust.

3062
01:46:19,207 --> 01:46:20,439
You want to know why
my sauce is better?

3063
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:22,074
I'll tell you why.

3064
01:46:22,076 --> 01:46:23,843
'Cause I go down to the
farmers' market every day,

3065
01:46:23,845 --> 01:46:25,444
I buy them
tomatoes myself.

3066
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:28,280
I walk down the street,
I get the basil, the oregano.

3067
01:46:28,282 --> 01:46:30,683
Look, guys, I know these people.

3068
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:33,953
I'm part of the fabric
of this neighborhood.

3069
01:46:33,955 --> 01:46:35,621
That's good enough for me.

3070
01:46:35,623 --> 01:46:37,423
Sal, that's better
than good enough.

3071
01:46:37,425 --> 01:46:38,657
That's the best.

3072
01:46:38,659 --> 01:46:39,892
And we're not
suggesting

3073
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:41,293
that you abandon the
neighborhood here.

3074
01:46:41,295 --> 01:46:43,696
All we're saying is,

3075
01:46:43,698 --> 01:46:45,698
what if your neighborhood
got a little bit bigger?

3076
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:47,032
Take a look at this, Sal.

3077
01:46:47,034 --> 01:46:50,102
These are all just people
that love your pizza.

3078
01:46:50,104 --> 01:46:52,171
Talk about word of mouth, huh?
- Yeah, they're talking

3079
01:46:52,173 --> 01:46:53,773
about you, Sal; don't you
want to talk back to them?

3080
01:46:53,775 --> 01:46:55,040
Did you know there are

3081
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:56,642
almost as many people
from Los Gatos

3082
01:46:56,644 --> 01:46:58,644
searching for Sal's
as there are from Palo Alto?

3083
01:46:58,646 --> 01:46:59,879
NEHA:
Yeah, and they pop in

3084
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:01,480
when they're in town,
but if there was

3085
01:47:01,482 --> 01:47:03,582
a location closer to them,
they'd be regulars, right?

3086
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:05,284
Boom. Check it
out right here.

3087
01:47:05,286 --> 01:47:07,686
I found a great commercial spot
right on Los Gatos Boulevard.

3088
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:09,388
Just hit the market.
- That's 0.3 miles away

3089
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,756
from the nearest
farmers' market.

3090
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,658
You can smell them tomatoes
from your front door.

3091
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,726
Farm to table.

3092
01:47:13,728 --> 01:47:15,161
F to T, baby!
- Baby.

3093
01:47:15,163 --> 01:47:16,228
Come on.
- F to T!

3094
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,164
F to T is exactly
right, Gomer Lyle!

3095
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:19,999
We're not asking you
to abandon the artistry.

3096
01:47:20,001 --> 01:47:22,201
We're just telling you
expand the reach a little bit.

3097
01:47:22,203 --> 01:47:23,769
But look-it, Sal,
at the end of the day,

3098
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:25,471
the kids, they got
their computers,

3099
01:47:25,473 --> 01:47:26,906
they got their information.

3100
01:47:26,908 --> 01:47:28,140
It's all accurate.

3101
01:47:28,142 --> 01:47:30,342
I get it, and I
know you do, too.

3102
01:47:30,344 --> 01:47:32,144
I tell you, Sal,

3103
01:47:32,146 --> 01:47:34,346
I can't blame you
for being a little afraid.

3104
01:47:34,348 --> 01:47:37,116
Hell, we were scared
for a long time out there,

3105
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:38,784
grinding it out
with our heads down.

3106
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:40,186
And Lord knows
I've fallen

3107
01:47:40,188 --> 01:47:42,388
on my ass more than
a time or two.

3108
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:44,757
But I promise you something.

3109
01:47:44,759 --> 01:47:46,258
You lift your head up...

3110
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,426
(inhales deeply)

3111
01:47:47,428 --> 01:47:49,462
...and take a breath,

3112
01:47:49,464 --> 01:47:51,630
there's a lot of great
possibilities out there.

3113
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:53,299
NICK:
New customers,

3114
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:57,002
new franchise-- and that's just
the tip of the iceberg, Sal.

3115
01:47:57,004 --> 01:47:59,438
It's all waiting
at the click of a button.

3116
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,309
Everybody's searching
for something, Sal.

3117
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:04,777
NICK:
They're searching
for you.

3118
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:08,013
We just want to help them
find you.

3119
01:48:11,785 --> 01:48:14,653
(crowd chattering)

3120
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,755
TGIF, Nooglers!

3121
01:48:16,757 --> 01:48:17,756
(crowd cheering)

3122
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:18,791
All right!

3123
01:48:18,793 --> 01:48:20,159
(Sid laughs)

3124
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:21,660
Easy, easy.

3125
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:24,063
It's okay, it's okay.

3126
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:26,332
Now, today marks not only
the end of the week,

3127
01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:28,567
but the end of
the summer's internships.

3128
01:48:28,569 --> 01:48:29,935
(crowd groans)
- I know.

3129
01:48:29,937 --> 01:48:32,538
As you can see
through these images behind me,

3130
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:34,306
it's been quite a journey.

3131
01:48:34,308 --> 01:48:35,674
Lot of memories,

3132
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:36,942
lot of bonds were made.

3133
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,143
Kind of reminds me
of the first time

3134
01:48:38,145 --> 01:48:39,745
I owned a personal...
All right.

3135
01:48:39,747 --> 01:48:45,417
Today, we reveal the intern team
that will be awarded jobs here.

3136
01:48:45,419 --> 01:48:47,219
Sadly, one team

3137
01:48:47,221 --> 01:48:49,121
has not returned
from their final challenge,

3138
01:48:49,123 --> 01:48:50,923
so, therefore, I'm forced
to calculate the results

3139
01:48:50,925 --> 01:48:53,225
with their score

3140
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:56,462
as an incomplete.

3141
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:02,401
We have a victor.

3142
01:49:02,403 --> 01:49:04,303
(crowd murmuring)

3143
01:49:04,305 --> 01:49:05,104
Congratulations...

3144
01:49:05,106 --> 01:49:07,640
(static humming, crackling)

3145
01:49:07,642 --> 01:49:10,109
(crowd murmuring)

3146
01:49:10,111 --> 01:49:12,278
("Flashdance... What a Feeling"
playing over speaker)

3147
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,079
(crowd cheering)

3148
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:16,515
No way!
(Dana laughs)

3149
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:17,883
What's that?

3150
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,589
(crowd cheering)

3151
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:24,623
What's going on?

3152
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:27,593
¶ What a feeling

3153
01:49:27,595 --> 01:49:28,994
¶ <i>I am music now</i> ¶

3154
01:49:28,996 --> 01:49:31,697
¶ Being's believing

3155
01:49:31,699 --> 01:49:33,966
Okay, calm down. Come on.

3156
01:49:33,968 --> 01:49:35,734
¶ Pictures come alive

3157
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:38,370
¶ You can dance
right through your life ¶

3158
01:49:38,372 --> 01:49:41,006
(crowd cheering)

3159
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:43,576
¶ Take your passion

3160
01:49:43,578 --> 01:49:47,813
¶ And make it happen

3161
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:50,149
¶ Pictures come alive

3162
01:49:50,151 --> 01:49:54,353
¶ You can dance
right through your life ¶

3163
01:49:54,355 --> 01:49:57,756
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!

3164
01:49:57,758 --> 01:50:00,059
¶ What a feeling
- Nice!

3165
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:06,865
¶ What a feeling

3166
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:08,634
(grunts)

3167
01:50:08,636 --> 01:50:11,103
Come on!

3168
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:13,639
¶ Pictures come alive

3169
01:50:13,641 --> 01:50:15,107
¶ You can dance...

3170
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:17,843
Extra toppings
on this one, boss.

3171
01:50:17,845 --> 01:50:19,511
I see that.

3172
01:50:19,513 --> 01:50:20,946
¶ What a feeling

3173
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:24,049
¶ <i>I can really have it all</i> ¶

3174
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:25,618
¶ What a feeling...

3175
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,986
Yeah!

3176
01:50:26,988 --> 01:50:28,120
(crowd cheering)

3177
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:29,922
CHETTY:
That's enough!

3178
01:50:29,924 --> 01:50:31,991
That's enough!

3179
01:50:31,993 --> 01:50:33,492
(music fades)

3180
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:35,928
GRAHAM:
Yes, lovely theatrics,

3181
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:37,062
but the jig is up.

3182
01:50:37,064 --> 01:50:38,230
It's too late.

3183
01:50:38,232 --> 01:50:39,798
Rules are rules, right, Chetty?

3184
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,667
Yes. Rules are rules.

3185
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:45,371
And the rules state
that every team has the right

3186
01:50:45,373 --> 01:50:48,207
until the announcement is made
to turn in their sales.

3187
01:50:48,209 --> 01:50:50,809
So, in spite of
STUART: Yes!

3188
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:53,045
your lack of punctuality,
which is astounding,

3189
01:50:53,047 --> 01:50:55,347
I have no choice...

3190
01:50:55,349 --> 01:50:59,585
but to accept this submission
and to recalculate.

3191
01:50:59,587 --> 01:51:00,953
GRAHAM:
Go ahead.

3192
01:51:00,955 --> 01:51:02,521
Recalculate.

3193
01:51:02,523 --> 01:51:04,857
One sale to a small
family pizza joint's

3194
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:06,258
not gonna make
a difference anyway.

3195
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:09,895
It does seem that Mr. Hawtrey
is correct once again.

3196
01:51:09,897 --> 01:51:11,030
Boom.

3197
01:51:11,032 --> 01:51:13,265
Oh.
- The sales
from one shop

3198
01:51:13,267 --> 01:51:17,002
on the last challenge are not
enough to put you in the lead.

3199
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:18,437
I'm sorry, bud.

3200
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:22,741
CHETTY:
But...

3201
01:51:22,743 --> 01:51:25,844
this is not one shop.

3202
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:27,112
You see,

3203
01:51:27,114 --> 01:51:30,382
this... is
a blossoming franchise

3204
01:51:30,384 --> 01:51:33,886
with endless possibilities,
thanks to you.

3205
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,721
And what you have done as a team

3206
01:51:35,723 --> 01:51:38,223
is connect to people

3207
01:51:38,225 --> 01:51:40,826
and connect those people
to information.

3208
01:51:40,828 --> 01:51:43,762
Which is what we do.

3209
01:51:43,764 --> 01:51:45,030
And more than that,

3210
01:51:45,032 --> 01:51:46,832
you had the courage to dream.

3211
01:51:46,834 --> 01:51:49,268
In spite of your obvious

3212
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:52,738
and astonishing limitations,

3213
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,473
you never gave up on that dream.

3214
01:51:54,475 --> 01:51:55,474
No.

3215
01:51:55,476 --> 01:51:57,309
So...

3216
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:58,410
gentlemen...

3217
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:00,546
...and lady...

3218
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:02,414
GRAHAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

3219
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:05,684
Chetty, no offense,
you're a glorified babysitter.

3220
01:52:05,686 --> 01:52:09,021
Let's get somebody down here
who actually means something.

3221
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:10,889
MAN:
I'm right here.

3222
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:12,024
Terrific.

3223
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:14,860
(crowd murmuring)

3224
01:52:14,862 --> 01:52:17,996
Graham, please meet
Mr. Anderson.

3225
01:52:17,998 --> 01:52:19,565
BILLY:
You know this guy?

3226
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:21,100
I should think I do.

3227
01:52:21,102 --> 01:52:23,268
Andrew here is
the head of Search--

3228
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:26,171
a rather important position
here at Google.

3229
01:52:26,173 --> 01:52:28,040
Honest, it's an honor.

3230
01:52:28,042 --> 01:52:29,174
Look at you, Headphones.

3231
01:52:29,176 --> 01:52:30,743
A little mystery
behind the boy.

3232
01:52:30,745 --> 01:52:32,277
What? How-how do you know him?

3233
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:34,346
We were encouraged to reach out
to experienced Googlers.

3234
01:52:34,348 --> 01:52:36,215
Pretty simple.
Not a big mystery.

3235
01:52:36,217 --> 01:52:40,319
To reach out to other Googlers,
not just kiss their asses.

3236
01:52:40,321 --> 01:52:42,788
You see, these interns are

3237
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:46,792
smart, collaborative, pretty...

3238
01:52:46,794 --> 01:52:48,060
(whispering):
Thank you.

3239
01:52:48,062 --> 01:52:49,928
...and just weird enough

3240
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,930
to make them
interesting.

3241
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:55,934
Also, they came together
as a team

3242
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:58,003
to do something here.

3243
01:52:58,005 --> 01:53:01,473
Their Googliness
is truly off the charts.

3244
01:53:01,475 --> 01:53:03,709
Oh, my God, can you stop
with the "Googliness"?

3245
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:05,511
Like, what does that
even mean?

3246
01:53:05,513 --> 01:53:08,347
The fact that you don't know
what it means

3247
01:53:08,349 --> 01:53:10,382
is why you will never work here.

3248
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:16,221
(quietly): Also, you just
made me use a bunch of words

3249
01:53:16,223 --> 01:53:18,090
in front of a
ton of people.

3250
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:19,358
Look at me.

3251
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,592
You're a real dick
for doing that.

3252
01:53:20,594 --> 01:53:21,827
Look at me again.

3253
01:53:21,829 --> 01:53:24,763
And I know your accent
is bullshit.

3254
01:53:24,765 --> 01:53:26,598
What?

3255
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,235
So...

3256
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:35,340
...welcome to Google.

3257
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:37,576
(crowd cheering)

3258
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:40,479
Yes! Yes!

3259
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:44,683
Yes!

3260
01:53:49,722 --> 01:53:51,323
(laughing)

3261
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:52,257
Boom!

3262
01:53:52,259 --> 01:53:55,861
I have a job!
I have a job!

3263
01:53:55,863 --> 01:53:57,396
GRAHAM:
Hey, why are you getting up?

3264
01:53:57,398 --> 01:54:00,299
I should be the winner.
I should be the winner!

3265
01:54:00,301 --> 01:54:01,900
Well, I hope
you're all happy.

3266
01:54:01,902 --> 01:54:03,502
What were you thinking?

3267
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:06,038
Maybe if I had a team of equals
who contributed once in a while,

3268
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,606
this never would
have happened.

3269
01:54:07,608 --> 01:54:09,942
What about you? What do you
have to say for yourself, eh?

3270
01:54:09,944 --> 01:54:11,276
Huh?

3271
01:54:11,278 --> 01:54:13,178
I think it's time
to fake an injury.

3272
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:14,313
What are you talking about,
you fat...

3273
01:54:14,315 --> 01:54:16,415
(grunts)
(crowd gasps)

3274
01:54:16,417 --> 01:54:17,816
Man down!

3275
01:54:19,419 --> 01:54:22,154
Chetty, I appreciate
what you said back there.

3276
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:24,556
I know you had us figured wrong
from the beginning.

3277
01:54:24,558 --> 01:54:26,658
He voted for you
from the beginning.

3278
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:27,926
(chuckling):
What?

3279
01:54:27,928 --> 01:54:30,696
Mr. Chetty was the deciding vote
on the intern committee.

3280
01:54:30,698 --> 01:54:31,964
CHETTY: I didn't have
a fancy education

3281
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:33,298
like most of
the people here.

3282
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,368
I had to work hard
to get to where I am.

3283
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:37,836
And I recognized
a similar tenacity

3284
01:54:37,838 --> 01:54:40,472
in you two gentlemen,
so I took a chance on you.

3285
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:44,943
You did test my faith
a few times.

3286
01:54:44,945 --> 01:54:46,345
Basically, the entire time.

3287
01:54:46,347 --> 01:54:49,181
But I'm glad you
proved me right.

3288
01:54:49,183 --> 01:54:52,351
Chetty, thanks
for betting on us.

3289
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:56,355
Good to see you.

3290
01:54:56,357 --> 01:54:57,456
Hey.

3291
01:54:57,458 --> 01:54:59,057
So it looks like
you're gonna be seeing

3292
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:00,859
a lot more of me
around here.

3293
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:02,060
So it does.

3294
01:55:02,062 --> 01:55:03,128
Congratulations.

3295
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:04,796
Thank you.

3296
01:55:04,798 --> 01:55:06,031
Look, the
other night...

3297
01:55:06,033 --> 01:55:07,866
It was fun.

3298
01:55:07,868 --> 01:55:08,901
Yeah, it was fun.

3299
01:55:08,903 --> 01:55:09,902
Right?

3300
01:55:09,904 --> 01:55:12,571
Yeah.

3301
01:55:14,507 --> 01:55:16,441
No regrets.

3302
01:55:16,443 --> 01:55:18,777
No.

3303
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:30,355
(both laugh)

3304
01:55:30,357 --> 01:55:33,325
All right, let's get
to that warm, fuzzy part.

3305
01:55:33,327 --> 01:55:35,794
Um, that's not
going to happen.

3306
01:55:35,796 --> 01:55:37,629
(microphone feedback hums)
- God, I love him even more.

3307
01:55:37,631 --> 01:55:39,831
He leaves it cold like that.
You know what I mean?

3308
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:41,300
You keep playing hard to get,

3309
01:55:41,302 --> 01:55:43,201
you're gonna find yourself
all alone.

3310
01:55:43,203 --> 01:55:44,536
CHETTY: We're not gonna
have a beer together.

3311
01:55:44,538 --> 01:55:46,271
We're gonna have
about five of them.

3312
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:47,272
We're equals now,
my friend.
- No, we're not.

3313
01:55:47,274 --> 01:55:48,573
Yes, we are.

3314
01:55:48,575 --> 01:55:50,042
No, we're not.
- Let's go pick out

3315
01:55:50,044 --> 01:55:51,810
some other interns and shape
some diamonds in the rough.

3316
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:53,478
Please stop following me.
Please stop talking to me.

3317
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,646
We're gonna get drunk.

3318
01:56:02,488 --> 01:56:04,256
Have a great senior year, guys.

3319
01:56:04,258 --> 01:56:05,791
We'll keep your desk chairs
warm for you.

3320
01:56:05,793 --> 01:56:06,858
Team Lyle.

3321
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:08,093
Team Lyle!
(all cheering)

3322
01:56:08,095 --> 01:56:09,895
That's the spirit.
(laughter)

3323
01:56:09,897 --> 01:56:12,397
Yo-Yo! Come. Now.

3324
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:13,765
Mom, I need a minute.

3325
01:56:13,767 --> 01:56:15,567
Yo-Yo, I not go. We need to...
- Mom.

3326
01:56:15,569 --> 01:56:17,102
I'm saying good-bye
to my friends.

3327
01:56:17,104 --> 01:56:20,005
I'm taking a minute.

3328
01:56:20,007 --> 01:56:22,441
Okay?

3329
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,381
Look who grew
an eyebrow, Yo-Yo!

3330
01:56:29,383 --> 01:56:31,116
Come on!
(laughter)

3331
01:56:31,118 --> 01:56:33,018
All right, you riffraff,
get out of here.

3332
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:34,252
See you down the road.
- See you guys.

3333
01:56:34,254 --> 01:56:35,787
See you, bud.
- Thank you, Captain.

3334
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:38,290
Thank you, Big B.

3335
01:56:38,292 --> 01:56:39,658
Bye, guys.

3336
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,126
My Khaleesi.
- My sun and stars.

3337
01:56:41,128 --> 01:56:42,728
(Lyle chuckles)

3338
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:45,297
What do you say? You want
to go get weird in a nap pod?

3339
01:56:45,299 --> 01:56:47,032
So, um, don't be a stranger.

3340
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:48,900
Shoot me a text sometime.

3341
01:56:48,902 --> 01:56:50,035
Forget that.

3342
01:56:50,037 --> 01:56:52,304
I'm gonna come
see you in person.

3343
01:56:52,306 --> 01:56:53,772
(chuckles)

3344
01:56:53,774 --> 01:56:55,574
Yeah, I'd like that.

3345
01:56:55,576 --> 01:56:56,608
Hey, guys, I grew
a pair of balls.

3346
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:58,443
Did you see them?
- You did!

3347
01:56:58,445 --> 01:57:00,112
You grew a big pair
of balls, my man.
- It was amazing.

3348
01:57:00,114 --> 01:57:01,413
They're touching
my ankles.
- Okay.

3349
01:57:01,415 --> 01:57:02,748
Well, that...
we don't need that.

3350
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:05,684
Hey, congratulations, guys.

3351
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:07,619
Thank you, boss.
- Thank you, boss.

3352
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:09,855
You know, I did get you
a little something.

3353
01:57:09,857 --> 01:57:10,655
Aw.

3354
01:57:10,657 --> 01:57:12,190
Not to get
too sentimental...

3355
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:14,092
Whoa! Whoa!

3356
01:57:14,094 --> 01:57:15,927
(laughs)
- Look at this
high roller.

3357
01:57:15,929 --> 01:57:17,329
Busting out the
Pappy on me.

3358
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:18,797
I figured
we earned a swig.

3359
01:57:18,799 --> 01:57:20,198
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

3360
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,466
Hell of a summer, bud.

3361
01:57:21,468 --> 01:57:23,802
Hell of a summer.

3362
01:57:23,804 --> 01:57:25,771
¶

3363
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,017
¶

3364
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:43,121
¶ Doo wacko

3365
01:57:52,498 --> 01:57:53,732
¶ Here's to you, honey

3366
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:57,803
¶ But I'm out of your league

3367
01:57:57,805 --> 01:57:59,871
¶ You're never gonna pass me

3368
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,507
¶ 'Cause I'm out
of your league ¶

3369
01:58:02,509 --> 01:58:04,509
¶ Your league, your league

3370
01:58:04,511 --> 01:58:06,011
¶ Lookie here, baby

3371
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:08,547
¶ You're coming my way

3372
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:12,918
¶ But I move like a landslide

3373
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,754
¶ So get out of my way
and stay away ¶

3374
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:19,057
¶ Up from the floor
on the count of ten ¶

3375
01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:23,395
¶ Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again ¶

3376
01:58:23,397 --> 01:58:25,197
¶ Up and down
and around again... ¶

3377
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:26,198
British.

3378
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,199
Listen, Professor...

3379
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:29,167
(grunting)

3380
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:32,938
¶ All right

3381
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,474
¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh

3382
01:58:38,277 --> 01:58:40,412
¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh, ow!

3383
01:58:40,414 --> 01:58:42,447
¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh

3384
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:46,685
¶ Time to learn a lesson

3385
01:58:46,687 --> 01:58:50,088
¶ Like Pavlov's dog

3386
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:53,024
¶ If same-ing isn't working

3387
01:58:53,026 --> 01:58:56,561
¶ Why don't you different
instead, instead, instead? ¶

3388
01:58:56,563 --> 01:58:59,431
¶ Like Samson and Delilah

3389
01:58:59,433 --> 01:59:01,466
¶ Attila and the Huns...

3390
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:02,634
Buddy, they can't
see us, okay?
- I understand that,

3391
01:59:02,636 --> 01:59:04,136
but here we go.
- Go cheek to cheek.

3392
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,670
Just go like I tell you.
- Okay, don't interrupt me.

3393
01:59:05,672 --> 01:59:07,038
Put your (bleep)
cheek next to mine.
- Yes.

3394
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,740
Yeah, I get it. You got us?
- Hi, my name is Billy.

3395
01:59:08,742 --> 01:59:09,941
Yeah, Nick Campbell.
- Oh, good.

3396
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:10,976
You can hear me.

3397
01:59:10,978 --> 01:59:13,044
¶ Oh, you get up

3398
01:59:13,046 --> 01:59:15,480
¶ You get down
and you try it again ¶

3399
01:59:15,482 --> 01:59:17,782
¶ Up and down and around again

3400
01:59:17,784 --> 01:59:21,419
¶ Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again ¶

3401
01:59:21,421 --> 01:59:23,889
¶ Round for round

3402
01:59:23,891 --> 01:59:27,459
¶ Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again ¶

3403
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:30,128
¶ Hit the ground

3404
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:33,031
¶ Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again ¶

3405
01:59:33,033 --> 01:59:36,134
¶ Oh, you get up, you
get down and you try it again ¶

3406
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:39,104
¶ Oh, you get up, you get down
and you try it again ¶

3407
01:59:39,106 --> 01:59:42,741
¶ Oh, you get up, you
get down and you try it again. ¶

3408
01:59:45,211 --> 01:59:47,345
Guys, hi.

3409
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:49,447
Hey.
So, what do you think?

3410
01:59:49,449 --> 01:59:52,017
Cosplay.
What can you say?
- I knew you'd love it.

3411
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:53,285
Stuart totally
loves it, too, now.

3412
01:59:53,287 --> 01:59:55,120
You guys have fun.
BILLY:
Okay, great.

3413
01:59:55,122 --> 01:59:57,088
Don't worry about us.
We're having a great time.

3414
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:58,190
Don't worry about us.
We're having fun.
(muffled yelling)

3415
01:59:58,192 --> 02:00:00,492
Uh-oh. Here we go.
- Oh, hit it.

3416
02:00:00,494 --> 02:00:02,727
Classic <i>Star Wars</i> villain.
- Looking on with Boba Fett.
We're just observers.

3417
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:04,896
We're just here
to observe.
- It's me!

3418
02:00:04,898 --> 02:00:06,698
- Kevin.
- What the shit?
- Shit.

3419
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,567
Guys. Yeah.
- Kevin!

3420
02:00:08,569 --> 02:00:09,968
What the hell
are you doing here?

3421
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:12,637
Cosby. It's your
first time at Cosby?

3422
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:14,673
Excuse me?
- It's my new journey.

3423
02:00:14,675 --> 02:00:15,840
And I have you to thank.

3424
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:17,576
You really pointed
some things out.

3425
02:00:17,578 --> 02:00:18,944
I was being a
jerk to people.

3426
02:00:18,946 --> 02:00:20,412
'Cause I was hurting inside.

3427
02:00:20,414 --> 02:00:22,314
Well, it takes a big man
to admit he's wrong, Kevin.

3428
02:00:22,316 --> 02:00:24,816
Good for you.
- Anyway, I'm going to
dive back into the fun.

3429
02:00:24,818 --> 02:00:26,718
Ooh, check out
this hot little number.

3430
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:30,121
I don't know if it's a...
Ewok or a space squirrel.

3431
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:32,257
I can't wait to rip into that.

3432
02:00:32,259 --> 02:00:33,658
How do you know
who's underneath the mask?

3433
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:35,260
Look, I don't know what's
underneath the hood,

3434
02:00:35,262 --> 02:00:36,828
and I don't give a shit.

3435
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:38,196
I'm insatiable.

3436
02:00:38,198 --> 02:00:40,365
Now, if you excuse me,
old Boba Fett's

3437
02:00:40,367 --> 02:00:43,034
going to give this squirrel
a couple nuts to hide.

3438
02:00:43,036 --> 02:00:44,970
You know Boba Fett--
he always fucked

3439
02:00:44,972 --> 02:00:47,038
the space squirrel
at the end of the movie.

3440
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,974
Audience knew
it was coming.

3441
02:00:48,976 --> 02:00:50,475
Audience wanted it.

3442
02:00:50,477 --> 02:00:51,943
Audience got it.

3443
02:00:51,945 --> 02:00:55,614
