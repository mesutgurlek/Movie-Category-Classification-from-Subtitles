Hey, hey, hey! If you're
coming in for the morning grind,

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,313
it's another brutal Monday
out there traffic-wise.

you're probably already

Now, if your boss gives you
a hard time about it,

you have him come down here

who are chasing their dream
of becoming their own bosses.

Back in 90.
Could've work a jacket,
I guess,

but I think casual's
probably better.

Jesus Christ. Dale,
you got to stop sweating, pal.

Hey. Hey.
Oh, wow. You are wet.

How do I stop sweating?

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,053
I mean, guys,
this is a big deal.

32
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,254
I mean, we got everything
riding on this,

all right?
We've quit our jobs.

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,591
I have three children
to think about now.

35
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,859
How about that, all right?
Okay, well,
think about this, okay?

36
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,294
You do a good job
right now,

your little boys very proud.

Hmm?

so what? You can't even
tell at that age.

my kids potatoes, okay?

I feel like you guys
should go on without me.

Can you guys
go on without me?
Well, I'm glad you said it.

43

Why don't you wait in the car,
buddy? That's a lot of sweat.

44
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,642
Oh, come on, calm down, okay?
You're making him more nervous.

Look, Dale, it's gonna be
real easy, okay?

you and Stacy having triplets.

Oh, let's not be ourselves.
Ourselves is a dumpster fire.

Let's be
<i>better</i> than ourselves.

a little bit.

Pleasure to be here.
Now, um, before we get
into the product,

67
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,658
can you tell us what is it
that inspired three regular Joes

68
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,793
to go into business
for yourselves?

69

Yeah, well, we were...
we were all working

70

at pretty terrible jobs
for some awful bosses.

71
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,765
And we just thought,
well, if we ever got a chance

72
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,967
to be our own bosses
that we'd do things differently.

73
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,469
And this might be our shot.
Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,037
Yeah, so, we didn't think
we'd ever get the chance,

75
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,472
but then our buddy Dale here
had an amazing idea.

76
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,207
Don't go to Dale.
Uh, yeah.

77
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,042
And, uh, you know, we just
started, uh, meeting together

78
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,477
to talk
about the invention

79
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,012
instead of complaining
about our jobs.

Hey, I think that's exciting.

Well done.
Dale, you know,
I just want to know,

82
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,984
where did
the idea come from

83
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,654
for a new shower... Head?
I have<i> three</i> kids!

84
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,023
Nick: Uh,
let me answer the question.

85
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,658
Um, Dale, uh,
had just gotten back

86
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,992
from one of those
self-service car washes, right,

87
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,494
with the wand
with the soap and the wax?

88
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,296
Oh, yeah, it's got everything
in the one thing.

89
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,864
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
He simply thought,

90
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,332
"why don't they make
one of these for your body?"

91
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,967
Yeah. Yeah,
and after we had a few beers,

92
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,502
we came up with the,
uh, shower buddy.

93
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,803
The "shower buddy"?

94
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,205
I-I'm sorry.
That name's not official yet.

95
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,639
No, he's wrong.
It is official.

96
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,374
I wanted
"the shower daddy."

97
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,810
"Shower daddy" is worse on
pretty much every level, so...

98
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,178
Yeah.
I have to agree with Nick.

99
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
It's better than having
some strange dude

100
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,815
in the shower with you.
It's<i> not</i> some strange dude,
Dale,

101
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,750
as I've said many, many times.
It's your buddy!

102
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,986
Well, why would your buddy
be in the shower with you?!

103
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,387
Why would your dad?!
Uh-oh!

and get in there,

111
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,734
and he's gonna
turn on the shower.

112
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,603
You're gonna see
the water come out.

113
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,038
After a little bit of time, the
shampoo's gonna automatically

114
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,607
be triggered out
of the showerhead,
mix with the water...

No water pressure.

No, there's no water
pressure.

You know what,
there's a pump on the back.

118
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,212
I could
pump it up manually.
Great.

You got it? You do?

Nick: The water comes out,
and the shampoo

123
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,420
then automatically mixes
with the water.

124
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,422
Then shortly thereafter that,
conditioner then comes in.

125
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,625
And then you shower in half
the time with the shower buddy.

126
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,260
Effectively, yeah.

it's... it's better.

stick my finger in it,

00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,598
Dale!

595
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,603
Boom! Marker drop.

596
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,670
"Kidnaping."

597
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,038
That's "kidnapping."

598
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,107
With one more "p" it is.
That's "kid-nape-ing."

599
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,542
Well,
however the fuck you spell it.
You know what I'm talking about.

600
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,510
I'm talking about kidnapping.
Come on.

601
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,379
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Dude,
that's a fucking great idea!

602
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,549
Think about it. Okay, first
of all, we kidnap Rex. Right?

603
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,752
Right, yeah.
Yeah, the ransom money.
We get money from Bert.
We save the business.

604
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,054
What do you know
about executing a kidnapping?

605
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,856
What do you mean?
You just...

606
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,725
You get zip... zip...
zip ties.

607
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,927
You don't know shit
about kidnapping.

608
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,062
Okay, we don't know a ton.
We don't know a ton, all right?

609
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,530
But I bet
we know someone that does.

610
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,367
Who?
Motherfucker Jones.

611
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,535
Oh, Jesus.
Come on, look.
It'd be great to see him.

612
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,037
Wouldn't it be good to see him?
Come on. Please. Please.
Please. Come on.

613
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,605
We're not gonna go see
motherfucker Jones,

614
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,241
because we're not gonna
"kid-nape" anyone.

615
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,077
Come on, this guy's
a master business prick.

616
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,081
He's at the top of his game.
We need to figure out...

617
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,483
[ Clicks tongue ]

618
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,486
Boy, look what we got.

619
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,087
Is that a sharpie?
Well, hang on.

620
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,256
What was a sharpie doing
on there in the first place?

621
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,058
You put it on there.
I did put it on there.

622
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,459
Permanently on the board now.

623
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,762
This illustrates my point,
idiots.

624
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,464
We need to find somebody
who's legitimate.

625
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,035
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

626
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,451
Hello, Nick.

627
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,186
Guy who saved my life.

628
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,155
Guy who
fucked my wife.

629
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,990
Ah, it was a blow job.
It was a blow job, only.

630
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,258
Didn't fuck her.

631
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,693
You got my e-mail?

632
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,695
I did.

633
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,862
And I was very amused by it.

634
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,597
I know Bert hanson.

635
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,000
I like the cut of his jib.
And I do admire

636
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,602
the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel

637
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,204
and showed you the 50 states.

638
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,873
Ah. See? Told you
it was a saying.
Wow.

639
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,310
Now, Nick, just...
just tell me something.

640
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,513
Why would you start production

641
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,517
without at least a guarantee
of 35% down

642
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,686
to cover manufacturing costs?

643
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,023
[ Laughing ]
I mean, why would you do that?

644
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,691
Is he telling a joke?
Is something funny?

645
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,363
Uh, we assumed that
we were dealing with
somebody who was ethical...

646
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,064
harken:
No, that's the wrong answer.

647
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,067
The right answer is because...

648
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,971
You're all fucking morons!

649
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,006
Boy, he shined a light
on that, didn't he?

650
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,175
Yeah. I think...
that's true. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

651
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,811
You thought I was such
a bad boss. But, I don't know,

652
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,514
I think maybe running your
own company into the ground

653
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,750
and ruining the livelihood
of your employees

654
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,085
is maybe a bit worse.
What do you think, Nick?

655
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,321
I think that's fair.
Should I be on the phone
if I'm taking notes?

656
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,490
No, we got it. We got it here.
I mean, I'm not getting
any of what he's saying.

657
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,191
It's all right.
It's just a lot of,
you know, rhetorical questions.

658
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,493
Okay, I'll just
try to get his reactions.

659
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,261
So, what do you want
from me, Nick?

660
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,197
With all due respect, you know
what makes a guy like that tick.

661
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,433
So if you could give us
some advice

662
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,269
on how to get our money back,
I will play real nice

663
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,105
at your next parole hearing.
How does that sound?

664
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,610
You would do that for me?
Yes, I would.

665
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,846
Okay.
I think I can help you.

666
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,182
He's helping.
He's gonna help?
Okay, I got a notepad.

667
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,518
I got a notepad!
From a legal standpoint...

668
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,786
"Legal standpoint."
"Legal standpoint."

669
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,521
...your options are...

670
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,456
"Options are."
"Legal options."

00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,891
...Jack...

672
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,693
Fucking... Shit.

673
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,629
I heard "Jack leibowitz."
Is that an attorney?
Got to be.

674
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,697
I'm gonna write that down.
"Jack leibowitz."

675
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,399
Can we get his
contact info, please?
Do you have his contact info?

676
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,402
Even if you had the money
to fight him in the courts,

677
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,572
his lawyers are just gonna
file motions and continuances

678
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:05,576
long after you three
piss-ant little fuck-ups

679
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,545
have blown your tiny,
little brains out.

680
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,480
Are you saying
nothing can be done?

681
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,749
No, I didn't say that. I said
there's nothing<i> you</i> can do.

682
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,586
There's plenty that could be
done, but<i> you</i> won't do it.

683
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,555
And do<i> you</i> want to know why?

684
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,591
No, not really.
Because you have no balls!

685
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,625
I see.
Okay.

686
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,627
And your fathers had no balls!

687
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,330
You are all the product
of generations of ball-less men

688
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,466
who were either too weak
or too frightened

689
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,434
to stand up
and take what was theirs.

690
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:35,439
And one day, you will pass on
your empty, shriveled sacs

691
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,142
to your own pitiful offspring!

692
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,677
[ Sighs ]
I can't hear a goddamn thing.

693
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,779
What is he talking about?
Our... our nut sacs, mostly.

694
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,415
Well, how did that come up?
Why don't you pitch
him the kidnapping?

695
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,750
No, let the kidnapping go,
all right?
Pitch him the kidnapping.

696
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,319
Grow some balls,
all right?

697
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,954
You want to see
some balls, Kurt?
Yeah.

698
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,589
Then kidnap someone.
You'll end up in here.

699
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:52,990
You'll see plenty of balls
on your forehead.

700
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,758
Mm.
Why are they
on my forehead?

701
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,627
Was the dick
on top of my head?
That makes no sense.

702
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,262
Oh, I'm upside down.
[ Knock on window ]

703
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,030

Your face is getting fucked.

So, y'all planning to use the
ransom to save your business?

712
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,821
Exactly, yeah. That's it.
Yeah, that's what we're hoping.

713
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,323
You tell these idiots
how stupid that is, please?

714
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,659

I appreciate the fact
that you're doing

whatever you need to do
to keep your business going.

718
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,966
Yes.
I had a dream for a long time
to get my own business.

719
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,737
Yeah.
I wanted to open
my own... Pinkberry.

What the fuck
is the chuckles about?

721
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,741
Oh, I thought
you were joking.

722
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,175
You ain't seen how many crackers
line up outside to get that

723
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,545
captain-crunch-covered
freezing-ass shit?

724
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,213
I probably eat it three times
a week. I love pinkberry.
That's a great dream!

725
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,015
Hey, man. That's awesome.
I didn't know that about you.

726
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,683
All I know, if somebody
were to take my pinkberry,

727
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,351
I wouldn't take that
sitting down.

728
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,553
Mm-hmm.
You would fight
for that pinkberry.

729
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,421
I would cut a motherfucker
in half.

730
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,723
Tell you what you<i> wouldn't</i> do.
You wouldn't kidnap someone...

Yes, you would.
...'Cause you can't
successfully pull it off.

That's not true!
Name me a kidnapping movie

where the kidnappers weren't
dead or incarcerated at the end.

Name me<i> two</i> movies, then.

00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,602
You said name one.
Well, that's a comedy.

00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,070
You said name one. Bam.
I nailed one right on you.

738
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,438
"Nine to five"
was this movie...

I know what the fuck
"nine to five" is.

740
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,275
It's about the white bitch
with the big-ass titties.

That's the one, yeah.
She got old.
The titties stayed young.

someone based on "nine to five."

Can I pose a question
to you colonizers?

a long time ago.

Okay, how do you...
I can give you the answers.

We can't.

You should not run a pinkberry.
I'm sorry.

I mean, that's just
the weirdest negotiating style.
We don't have any money.

You know, we're here 'cause we
have zero dollars. We're broke.
That's true.

Nope.

I'm not giving him this.
It's a fucking tag heuer.

And this is a wrist
without a watch.

Come on, Nick. Give him...
it's just material things.

Can't take it with you,
right?

767
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,092
You can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan.

768
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,601

Give me
the watch back.

You sneak into his crib
late at night.

773
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,445
You find out whatever
his beverage of choice is

774
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,848
before he goes to bed. You slip
the Mickey in the beverage,

knock him out nice and easy,

776

and you keep that bitch sedated
until daddy pays up.

Wait a second.
That could work.

00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,990
That's great.
That makes total sense.

779

We're ghosts.
No, we don't even exist.

When you're saying "Mickey,"
you're talking about...

Where do<i> I</i> get them?!
Uh, yeah.

784

You think just because of
the hue of my skin

785
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,970
that I know where to get
date rape drugs?

Why are your eyes saying

what did she use
to knock you out, laughing gas?

Why are we...
oh, right.

00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,861
That'll work.
That's pretty interesting.

799
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,396
Yeah. Do you still have keys
to the, uh, office?

800

No, but I know the code,
probably.

Yes!
Okay. You did it again.

Look, for the record,

Well, then,
I would marry Peter,

Okay. I did great.

more careful this time around.

the scary letters, you know,

doesn't come home all night?!

1338
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,691
Shut that down, okay?
You're not a dad yet.

1339
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,226
Because if the worst thing
that happens

1340
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,861
from this whole clusterfuck
is your domestic problems,

1341
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,196
then we can consider
ourselves lucky.

1342
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,597
We just dodged a huge bullet
back there.

1343
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,067
We almost made the worst
decision of our lives.

1344
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,669
No, that's true.
You know why?

1345
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,437
'Cause if he opens
that closet door and sees us,

1346
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,273
we're...
we're in prison right now.
That's... that's right.

1347
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,275
You know?
So we're very, very lucky.

1348
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,076
What the fuck
is the matter with us?

1349
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,378
You know what?
I tell you what.

1350
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,779
If a couple tiny things
went our way,

1351
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,180
we could have
pulled that off.
No.

1352
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,049
Just saying.
We're not criminals!

1353
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,517
We suck at crime!
We're, like, nice, normal guys.
I know.

1354
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,287
I like baseball.
I wear pants.
Yeah. Yep.

1355
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,688
Back to being cogs
in the machine.
Cogs!

1356
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,056
No shame in that.
Cogs, dude.

1357
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,258
No, cogs are good.
It's a relief, you know?

1358
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,127
It's like a weight...
a weight lifted off your...

1359
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,628
what is that... shoulders?
That's right.
No, this is good.

1360
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,930
This is good.
It's a fresh start

1361
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,097
where everything's
gonna be like...

1362
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,399
Nick:
I'll call you guys later.

1363
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:57,700
[ Muffled ]
Please don't kill me!

1364
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:00,102
Fuck!
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1365
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,537
What the fuck is that?!
What the fuck is that?!

1366
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,972
What did we do?

1367
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,141
We fucking kidnap him
while we're high on nitrous?

1368
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,776
And then what? Just went
back into the closet

1369
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,377
and went to sleep?
Why would we do that?

1370
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,578
Shh, shh, shh.
What?

1371
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,282
[ Muffled laughter ]
Is he crying?

1372
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,554
[ Laughter continues ]

1373
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,822
The best!

1374
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,292
[ Laughing ]
That was so good.

1375
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,493
Help me out.

1376
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,928
[ Laughs ]

1377
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,130
The look on your...

1378
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,333
[ Laughing ]

1379
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:31,934
[ Chuckles ]

1380
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,903
Yeah. All right.

1381
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:36,105
I really couldn't...

1382
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,274
Your fucking face!

1383
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,910
Oh, my god.
Hey, man. Yeah.

1384
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:43,245
Whoo-wee.
Ah.

1385
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,647
You had us.

1386
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,848
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh! Oh! Oh!

1387
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,684
[ Laughter ]

1388
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,686
What's happening?
I don't know.

1389
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,322
What's happening?
Oh, boy.

1390
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,324
[ Laughing ]

1391
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,159
Oh, my god!
You guys!

1392
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,794
I completely
underestimated you.

1393
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,997
You fuckers
have some low-hanging balls!

1394
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,698
I mean it.
I'm impressed.

1395
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
Hmm.
I mean, I wake up,

1396
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,935
I find you three
in my closet,

1397
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,337
along with a ransom note,
a big ol' bottle of nitrous.

1398
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,772
I'm like, "holy shit!

1399
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,607
These fuckers
were gonna gas me!"

1400
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,610
I'm about to call the cops
when I think, "hold up a sec.

1401
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:17,780
These guys
may be onto something."

1402
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,216
I want to partner up
on this thing.

1403
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,550
Part... what are you
talking about?

1404
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,952
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1405
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:24,153
I'm not sure what you mean.
Mm. The thing?

1406
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:26,155
This thing. My kidnapping.
Oh.

1407
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,791
Truth be told,
pop and I,

1408
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,626
we've hit
a rough patch lately.

1409
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,461
He's refusing to cover
some of my expenses.

1410
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,963
Blah, blah, blah.
Long story.

1411
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,364
Anyway, your timing
could not have been better.

1412
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,233
Is this
a fucking marlin?

1413
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,667
Rex, this is, uh,
cool and all,

1414
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,669
but we decided,
like, we're out.

1415
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,304
You know,
we're not doing crime.
Yeah. Not our thing.

1416
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,706
Yeah, no, he's right.
No.

1417
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,708
The kidnapping is off,
actually.
Okay?

1418
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,376
Huh?
No. No, no, it's on.

1419
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,011
No, it's off.
No, it's totally on!

1420
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,813
I sent the ransom note
to my dad!

1421
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,314
You what?
You did what?
Yeah.

1422
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,649
I was a little insulted

1423
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,051
you only asked for $500,000
for me.

1424
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,252
I mean,
is that all I'm worth?

1425
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,353
Hmm? No sweat.

1426
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,255
I tacked on
another zero.

1427
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,489
$500 million?!

1428
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,558
Wow. That's a ton.
No.

1429
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,527
$5 million, guys.
$5 million.

1430
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,262
$5 million. $5 million.
5? Right, right,
right, right.

1431
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:07,530
Yeah. $5 million.

1432
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,533
$1 million for you guys.
4 for me.

1433
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,401
Why don't we find a pay phone
and make that ransom call?

1434
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,603
Yeah, Rex, let's...
let's not, ok...

1435
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,072
we appreciate
the generous offer,

1436
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,907
and thank you very much
for not calling the cops.

1437
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,508
Yes.
But we're gonna pass.

1438
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,943
No.
Yeah.

1439
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,045
Guys. Guys, how's this
anything but great news?

1440
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,681
All I'm asking you to do
is finish your own plan,

1441
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,917
but for double the money.

1442
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,552
And, plus, it just got
1,000 times easier

1443
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,187
because now
I'm your inside man.

1444
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,922
I can make sure
dad pays up.

1445
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,924
And then, you know,
when you "set me free,"

1446
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,559
I can tell the cops
it was three other morons.

1447
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,893
"They went thataway."

1448
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,428
Oh. Well, wow.

1449
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,397
I mean, that's not the worst
idea I've ever heard.

1450
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,032
I mean, it's better
than our original idea.
A lot better.

1451
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,901
G-give us one second?
Fucking what?!

1452
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,604
We can't trust this guy.
You can trust me.

1453
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,039
No, you're right.
What are we talking about?

1454
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,874
Yeah. Of course.
They burned us once already.

1455
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,075
We're not gonna get
burned again.
Nice try.

1456
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,810
Uh, thanks,
but, no, thanks.

1457
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,645
That's a niggerda...
Nick-Kurt-Dale no from us.

1458
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,080
Nick, Kurt, and Dale.
Yeah.

1459
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,217
So thank you,
but adiós.

1460
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,618
Okay.
You need a ride?

1461
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,054
No. I think
I'll hang out here.

1462
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,056
You know...
escape from your clutches.

1463
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,592
And call the police.

1464
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:10,993
And tell them what?
Go ahead. Call them. Yeah.

1465
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,928
We never kidnapped you.
Yeah, you did.

1466
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,930
We didn't.
Yeah, you abducted me.

1467
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,765
We did not.
Yeah, you brought me
back here.

1468
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,400
There was a struggle.

1469
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,802
Oh, shit!
Come on, man!

1470
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,271
Things got broken.

1471
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,573
What the...

1472
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,642
And then
you assaulted me.

1473
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,310
Oh, shit! What?!

1474
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,945
This guy's fucking nuts.
What are you doing?

1475
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,814
Hey, Rex.
It's off, pal.

1476
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,649
Oh,
and then you beat me.

1477
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,451
Mercilessly.

1478
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,653
Dale: Oh, wow!
Kurt: Holy shit!

1479
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,754
He's "fight-clubbing"
himself!

1480
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,156
We got
a "fight-clubber"!

1481
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,358
And then I found my way
up here.

1482
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,994
Then I found this phone.
Then I picked up the receiver.

1483
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,296
Oh, no.
And I dialed 9...

1484
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,698
don't, don't, don't call.
Come on, man. Joke's over.

1485
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,834
...1...
don't you hit
the second "1."

1486
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,117
don't hit it.
Come on, man. don't do it!
don't do it! Stop!

1487
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,839
I don't know

Oh, my god, do you know
what this looks like?
What?

2838
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,937

what we're doing.

[ Both laugh ]

Where do you think
she learned it?

01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:47,260
Maybe from
the first movie.

2848
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,497
Get that chair ready.
I'm gonna take a quick
tinkle, all right?
