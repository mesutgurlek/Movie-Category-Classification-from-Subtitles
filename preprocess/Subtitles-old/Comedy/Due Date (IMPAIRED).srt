It's Friday.

3
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,169
We're at the hospital.

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:49,798
But it's not a hospital,
it's a forest of sorts.

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:56,555
And I know that because
right next to you there's a bear.

6
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,685
A grizzly, cooling his feet in a stream.

7
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:06,190
And all of a sudden,
you begin to deliver...

8
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,526
...and I can't get to you.

9
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,487
But the bear can.

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,907
And next thing I know...

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,162
...he is holding our beautiful baby boy.

12
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,290
And here's where it gets odd. Uh....

He chews the cord.

14

18

Tyler and probably mostly Skylar...

almost all of our money on drugs?

-I don't think in those terms.
-What terms do you think in?

-Your stage name. What is your real name?
-Ethan Chase.

495

-It doesn't sound like an actor's name.
-Ethan Chase does.

Yeah, I made it up.

-No, I can't accept this either.
-Why?
