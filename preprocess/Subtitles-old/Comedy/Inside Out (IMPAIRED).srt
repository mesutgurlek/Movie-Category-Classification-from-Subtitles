to envy the dead mouse.

-It's the worst.

I've ever been in my entire life.

175

Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

176
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,161
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

-Where did you read that?
-It doesn't matter.

Well, guess what?

189
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,388

-You're kidding.
-Mmm-hmm.

You said it would be here yesterday!

I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

Maybe we could try that?

but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

959
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,603
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

960
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,105
JOY: Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

961
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,233
The station is right
through here. After you.

962
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,610
-Joy.
-What?

963
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,403
I read about this place

964
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,113
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

965
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,199
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

966
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,368
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

967
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,535
What are you talking about?

968
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,413
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

969
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,209
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

970
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,213
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

971
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,215
because I'm taking the shortcut.

972
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,550
Let's go around. This way.

973
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,219
BING BONG: Almost there!

974
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,681
If you want to walk the long way, go for it.

975
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,724
But Riley needs to be happy.

976
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,267
I'm not missing that train.

977
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,644
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

978
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,771
JOY: He's part dolphin.
They're very smart.

979

00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,085
Okay, what abstract concept

983
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,420
are we trying to comprehend today?

984
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,213
Um... Loneliness.

985
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,424
Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.

986
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,717
I'm going to turn it on for a minute

987
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,926
and burn out the gunk.

988
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,721

You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

989
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,013

990
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,181
BING BONG: Say,
would you look at that?

991
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,517
Whoa! What's happening?

992
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,935
Oh, no, they turned it on.

993
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,062

-What is going on?
-We're abstracting!

997
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,197
There are four stages. This is the first:

999

All right. Do not panic.

we all stay together. Oh!

that was a shortcut.

I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.
