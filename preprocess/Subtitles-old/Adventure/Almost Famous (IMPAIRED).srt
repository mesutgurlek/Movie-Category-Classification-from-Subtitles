All right, let's go!</i>

[Chattering]

1047
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:10,564
Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

1048
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,607
Just leave me behind!

1049
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:16,269
I'm only
the fucking lead singer!

1050
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,973
Hey!

1051
01:10:19,047 --> 01:10:21,208
<i>So, Ed Vallencourt...</i>

1052
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,342
what do you love
about music?

1053
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:38,900
Okay. Okay.

1054
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:41,993
<i>[Elaine] You told me you would tell me
where you were every minute.</i>

1055
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,039
- You told me you would call me twice a day.
- I know!

1056
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,803
- You told me you wouldn't miss even one test.
- I'll be home for graduation.

1057
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,844
- Mom...
- Where are you?

1058
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,904
Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

1059
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:56,439
What about graduation?
We had an agreement, William.

1060
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,452
I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

1061
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,545
I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand why...

1062
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:02,590
I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

1063
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,593
By all practical rules,
don't I get you for another three years?

1064
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,598
- Was I not fun?
- Yes.

1065
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,464
William!
This is Beth from Denver.

1066
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,698
She's one of the legendary,
original Band Aids.

1067
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,900
- She's clairvoyant!
- Oh, I can't read your mind or anything.

1068
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,967
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.

1069
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,277
Estrella says hi.
She says I can stay in your room.

1070
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:31,080
- Sure.
- [Beth] Great!

1071
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,519
I've got some hydroponic pot!

1072
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,389
- Wow, your aura is really fantastic!
- [Elaine] Hey, hey!

1073
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,326
- It's this beautiful purple color.
- [Elaine] I love you.

1074
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:42,329
I missed the last thing
you said.

1075
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:44,331
- Mom?
- [Beth] Your aura is purple!

1076
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,333
- I love you.
- What?

1077
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:49,063
- Purple, it's purple.
- [William] Mom, what?

1078
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:53,335
- Your aura is purple.
- I miss you and I love you!

1079
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:56,309
I love you.

1080

[Exhales]
All right.

1083
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,400
Fire away. I'm ready.

1084
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,912
Do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

1085
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,914
Do you have to be in love
to write a love song?

1086
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,383
Is the song better
if it really happened to you?

1087
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:42,185
Like "Love Thing." Where did you
write that, and who is it about?

1088
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,727
When did you get
so professional?

1089
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:51,722
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

1090
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,792
<i>[Band Members]
Yeah! Yea-a-ah!</i>

<i>[Sighing]</i>

1094
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,556
It's the record company's
mistake, and they will pay.

1095
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:21,295
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

1096
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,791
Can we just skip the vibe and go straight
to us laughing about this?

1097
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:31,396
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- Because I can see by your face you want to get into it.</i>

1098
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:34,636
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

1099
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,645
[Clicks Tongue]
Here.

1100
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:42,776
<i>Take it.
Let's take a good look at it, all right?</i>

1101
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:45,285
See, you love this T-shirt.

1102
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:47,480
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

1103
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:53,461
- Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
- It's a T-shirt.

1104
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,497
Do you give a shit
about a T-shirt?

1105
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:00,331
I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out
and find some barbecue or somethin'.

1106
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,929
- I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
- Are you doing coke again?

1107
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:06,496
Oh, yeah!
All the time!

1108

<i>This is big stuff, man.</i>

1109
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,169
<i>From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...</i>

1110
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,909
and you're
the guitarist with mystique.

1111
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,008
That's the dynamic
we agreed on.

<i>Page, Plant.
Mick, Keith.</i>

Blackmore, Gillan.

<i>But somehow it's all
turning around.</i>

1115
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,120
We have got to control
what's happening!

1116
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:31,495
<i>- There's a responsibility here.
- [Russell] Excuse me...</i>

1117
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:35,161
<i>but didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?</i>

1118
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,171
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

1119
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,640
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You can
trust him. Say what you want.</i>

1120
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,643
<i>He won't write it.</i>

1121
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:47,307
Look, I work as hard,
or harder, than anybody on that stage.

1122
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:51,079
<i>You know what I do?
I connect.</i>

1123
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,121
I get people off!

1124

<i>I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...</i>

<i>and I make him get off.</i>

1126

<i>Actually, that you can print!</i>

1127
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,688
And yet, why do I
always end up feeling...

1128
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,734
like I'm a joke to you?

1129
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,260
<i>Look, you want to pretend
this isn't gonna be a very big band?</i>

1130
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:13,967
<i>Well, it is!
You call yourself a leader of this band...</i>

1131
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,738
<i>but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...</i>

1132
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,007
when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

1133
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,311
<i>'Cause he's your friend!</i>

1134
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,148
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

1135
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,417
All right, is it my turn now?
Because I think we should, for once...

1136
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,823
<i>- say what we really mean.
- Oh, this is the part where you quit!</i>

1137
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:35,488
- Right. I'm so predictable.
- Deal with it.

1138
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,260
- And let me just say what nobody else wants to say...
- [Screaming] What?

1139
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,427
Your looks have
become a problem.

1140
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,903
<i>- [Dick] All right, okay. Enough!
- [Scoffs]</i>

1141

Yeah. William. Sorry.

Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1145
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,922
Let's go find
something real.

1146
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:12,430
From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real... real people, real feelings.

1147
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,765
That's it. That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

1148
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,572
You're real.

1149

Thanks.

1150

You know, you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

1151
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,874
Tell me,
what's your family like?

1152
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,088
My dad died
of a heart attack...

1153
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:40,651
and my sister believes that my mom is so
intense that she had to escape our family.

1154
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,629
They can't seem to find a way
to get through it.

1155
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:44,665
I mean, they don't even
speak to each other anymore.

1156
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:49,966
<i>Plus, she gave me all her albums,

really good.

01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,780
Aha.

1160
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:08,584

You wanna go to a party

1191
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:19,246
There's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

1192
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,414
Uh, that's mine.

1193
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:26,623
Topeka.
Check it out!

1194
01:19:26,694 --> 01:19:31,154
Please don't give him
any more acid. Thank you.

1195
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,174
<i>Dick. Dick, I got him.</i>

1196
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:46,441
He's okay.
He is on acid, though.

1197
01:19:46,514 --> 01:19:49,506
I can't really tell.

1198
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,484
How do you know
when it's kicked in?

1199
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,351
I am a golden god!

- [Cheering]
- Yes, you are!

1201
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:01,328
<i>I am a golden god!</i>

1202
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:04,456
<i>Hey, Russell, don't jump!</i>

1203
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,535
<i>And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...</i>

1204
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:12,004
<i>that my last words...</i>

1205
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,803
were...

1206
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:21,746
- I'm on drugs.
- [Cheering]

1207
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:32,550
<i>Russell, I think we should
work on those last words.</i>

1208
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,993
Okay. Oh, I got it.
I got it. I got it.

1209
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,998
I got it. I got it.
This is better.

1210
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:41,194
<i>Last words...</i>

1211
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,534
I dig music.

1212
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,166
- Yeah.
- [Groaning]

1213
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,437
I'm on drugs!

1214
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:57,642
Look, just come on down,
and we'll go back to the hotel.

1215
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,950
- Okay.
- Jump!

1216

[Cheering, Shouting, Whistling]

1217
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:13,730
[Cheering, Shouting Stop]

1218
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,266
<i>- Uh, he's not comin' up.
- Something's wrong.</i>

1219
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:21,035
<i>[Young Woman]
I'll save you, Russell!</i>

1220
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:30,810
<i>[Dick] They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.</i>

1221
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:33,854
<i>Oh, the band's over.
This is my family now.</i>

1222
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,516
Yeah, that's right, man.

1223
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,889
<i>- Definitely. It's over.
- [Young Woman] He's staying with us.</i>

1224
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,224
Let's just ride
on down to Greenville...

1225
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:45,062
we'll listen to some great music,
we'll finish the tour...

1226
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:48,227
and we'll leave those
ungrateful fools behind.

1227
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,204
Then we'll come back here
where you'll live.

1228
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:53,331
- Yeah, and he can stay in our basement.
- Yeah.

1229
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,538
- I see what you're doing, and I like it.
- Okay, good.

1230
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:00,945
- Come on.
- I got it, man.

1231
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:03,108
- [Groaning] Yeah.
- I got it.

1232
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,880
That felt kind of good, though.

1233
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,888
Excuse me, kids.

1234
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:11,448
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

1235
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,154
How do we know
you're not a cop? Huh?

1236
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:17,630
- The Enemy! Stop fuckin' looking at me!
- Easy!

1237
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,633
<i>He's your guardian angel,
all right?</i>

1238
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:23,467
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.

1239
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,597
Which half?

1240
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:28,642
Dick, just help me get my interview.
I have to go home, Dick.

1241
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,144
Dick, I have to go home.

1242
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,239
Look, you saved the tour, and that's
good enough for now. All right?

1243
01:22:35,316 --> 01:22:38,752
- Come on, big fella. Let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

1244
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,414
Did you, man?
Did you hurt the flower? That's nice.

1245
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,423
Come on. On the bus.

1246
