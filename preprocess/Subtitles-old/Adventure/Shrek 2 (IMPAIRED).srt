Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

Shrek is the one who rescued me.

No, that's all right.

- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

366
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,057
l told you coming here was a bad idea.

367
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,792
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

l don't think l was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what l wanted?

371
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,908
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

Here's a news flash for you!

That's not about to change.

378
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:15,036
l've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

That's real smooth, Shrek.

[Lillian] You should.
You started it.

384
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:54,338
l can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

385
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,884
l think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

386
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,319
This is Fiona's choice.

387
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:03,482
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

388
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,789
l mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

389
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,799
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

390
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:16,495
l don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

391

Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

392
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:22,071
Don't you remember when
we were young?

393
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,145
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

394
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,444
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

395
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,916
lt's not the same!

396
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:34,012
l don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

397
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,421
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

398
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,391
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

La, di, da, di, da!
lsn't it all wonderful!

how it could get any worse!

- Hello, Harold.
- [gasps]

402

- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

403
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,127
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

404
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,194
[chuckles]

405
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,935
l'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

406
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,103
You better get in.
We need to talk.

407

Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

409

So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

410
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,952
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

411
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,221
So, what's new?

412
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:18,027
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

413
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,557
ls that you? My gosh!
lt's been years.

414
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,797
When did you get back?

415
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:26,864
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

416
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,469
After l endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

417
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,571
l climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

418
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:36,048
Mommy can handle this.

419

He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

420
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:44,281
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

421
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,485
And what does he find?

422
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,291
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

423
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,264
is already married.

424
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,801
lt wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

425
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:55,563
Stop the car!

428
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:04,468
You force me to do something
l really don't want to do.

429
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,514
[gasps] Where are we?

May l take your order?

- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,363
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

435
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,160
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, l'm fine.

Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

There you are, dear.

438
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,608
We made a deal, Harold, and l assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

439
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,874
[sighs deeply] lndeed not.

440
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:43,611
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

441
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,177
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. lt's what's best.

442
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:49,780
Not only for your daughter...

but for your Kingdom.

00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,826
What am l supposed to do about it?

Hello, handsome.

- Princess!
- Donkey?

951
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,047
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

952
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,383
What potion?

953
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,653
Shrek and l took some magic potion.
And well...

954
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,956
Now, we're sexy!

For you, baby... l could be.

958
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:13,568
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

959
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:15,970
He went inside looking for you.

960
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:18,833

961
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:22,407

00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,511
You want to dance, pretty boy?

963
00:58:29,322 --> 00:58:33,019
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

964
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,349
Fiona?

965
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,024
Shrek?

966
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,931
Aye, Fiona. lt is me.

967
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,696
What happened to your voice?

968
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,900
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

969
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:50,602
But not the way l feel about you.

970
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:52,144
Fiona?

971
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:55,913
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

972
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:59,816
[laughs] Dad. l was so hoping
you'd approve.

973
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:03,515
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

974
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:07,026
l know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

975
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,594
but, well, what do you think?

976
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,529
[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!

977
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:19,865
Fiona!

978
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:23,932
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

979
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:27,537
Oh, shoot! l don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

980
00:59:27,614 --> 00:59:29,138
[sighs deeply]

981
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,550
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

982
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:36,480
l just wanted her to be happy.

983
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:38,888
And now she can be.

984
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,949
Oh, sweetheart.

985
00:59:41,027 --> 00:59:44,895
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

986
00:59:44,964 --> 00:59:49,025
But look at me.
Look what l've done for her.

987
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:52,401
lt's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

988
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:56,636
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

989
00:59:56,709 --> 01:00:00,736
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

990
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,986
But...

991
01:00:10,089 --> 01:00:11,579
l love her.

992
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:14,491
lf you really love her...

993
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,619
you'll let her go.

01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:23,727
Señor.

998
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,795
What's going on?
Where are you going?

999
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:37,449
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

1000
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:45,716
# People just ain't no good

1001
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:51,895
# I think that's well understood

1002
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:53,625
There you go, boys.

1003
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,668
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

1004
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,135
Hey. Why the long face?

1005
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:01,733
lt was all just a stupid mistake.

1006
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:06,509
l never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

1007
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:10,615
l hate Mondays.

1008
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:14,346
l can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

1009
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,012
What choice do l have?

1010
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,547
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

1011
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,718
Come on. ls he really
that good-looking?

1012
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,285
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

1013
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,561
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

1014
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,227
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

1015
01:01:30,303 --> 01:01:33,670
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

1016
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:40,435
Look, guys.
lt's for the best.

1017
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:41,912
Mom and Dad approve,

1018
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:45,348
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

1019
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:47,283
Everybody wins.

1020
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,583
Except for you.

1021
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:52,954
l don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

1022
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:54,390
Aye.

1023
01:01:55,395 --> 01:01:57,955
And that's why
l have to let her go.

1024
01:01:58,765 --> 01:02:01,825
Excuse me, is she here?

1025
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:04,062
She's, uh... in the back.

1026
01:02:05,338 --> 01:02:07,135
Oh, hello again.

1027
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,504
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

1028
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:17,913
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

1029
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:23,786
Well, l'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

1030
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:27,383
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

1031
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:29,324
l mean,
how charming can l be

1032
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,795
when l have to pretend
l'm that dreadful ogre?

1033
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:33,923
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

1034
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,367
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

1035
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:41,771
- [both] What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

1036
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,038
l beg to differ.
l do it all the time!

1037
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:49,548
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

1038
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:51,583
which will be Charming.

1039
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,677
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

1040
01:02:55,755 --> 01:02:58,155
l can't. l won't do it.

1041
01:02:58,224 --> 01:02:59,816
Oh, yes, you will.

1042
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:03,487
lf you remember, l helped you
with your happily ever after.

1043
01:03:03,563 --> 01:03:07,124
And l can take it away
just as easily.

1044
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,431
ls that what you want? ls it?

1045
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,895
- No.
- Good boy.

1046
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,702
Now, we have to go.

1047
01:03:15,775 --> 01:03:18,039
l need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

1048
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,374
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

1049
01:03:20,446 --> 01:03:23,279
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

1050
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:25,010
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

Royal Ball blowout!

The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

1058
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:50,204
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

1059
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:52,244
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

1060
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,836
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

1061
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,940
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

Look! Hansel and Gretel!

1063
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,082
What the heck are the crumbs for?

1064
01:04:02,154 --> 01:04:05,214
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,164
Tired old thing.

1068
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,800
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

1069
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:20,032
Oh. lt's the one, it's the only...

1070
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,700
lt's the Fairy Godmother!

1071

1073

May all your endings be happy and...

1074
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:37,247
Well, you know the rest!

1075
01:04:37,323 --> 01:04:40,315
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

1076
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:42,293
after these messages.

1077
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:43,988
l hate these ball shows.

1078
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,224
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

1079
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,929
l'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until l see Shrek and Fiona.

1080
01:04:51,003 --> 01:04:53,665
Whizzes on you guys.

1081
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:55,866
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

1082
01:04:55,942 --> 01:04:58,172
No, to your left. Your left!

1083
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:04,410
- Tonight on ''Knights''...
- Now here's a good show!

1084
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,919
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

1085
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,080
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

1086
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,886
their ''devil may mare'' attitudes
just won't fly.

1087
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:18,024
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

1088
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,256
l have to talk to Princess Fiona!

1089
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,393
- We warned you!
