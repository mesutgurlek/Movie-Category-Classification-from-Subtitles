they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

Today, we acknowledge...

1746
02:17:54,141 --> 02:17:56,883
...a really terrible loss.

1747
02:17:59,021 --> 02:18:01,763
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1748
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:04,272
...exceptionally hard-working...

1749
02:18:05,235 --> 02:18:07,521
...infinitely fair-minded...

1750
02:18:08,113 --> 02:18:10,399
...and, most importantly...

1751
02:18:10,699 --> 02:18:15,284
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1752
02:18:16,413 --> 02:18:20,782
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1753
02:18:23,837 --> 02:18:25,373
You see...

1754
02:18:26,215 --> 02:18:28,297
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1755
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:31,209
...by Lord Voldemort!

1756
02:18:33,096 --> 02:18:36,680
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1757
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:41,018
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1758
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:44,851
Now, the pain...

...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1760
02:18:48,862 --> 02:18:50,193
...and reminds us...

1761
02:18:50,364 --> 02:18:54,073
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1762
02:18:54,243 --> 02:18:57,656
...our hearts beat as one.

1763
02:18:58,163 --> 02:19:00,199
In light of recent events...

1764
02:19:00,541 --> 02:19:05,456
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1765
02:19:06,338 --> 02:19:11,674
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1766
02:19:12,094 --> 02:19:14,255
You remember that...

02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:17,884

...kind and honest...

sort of connected.
