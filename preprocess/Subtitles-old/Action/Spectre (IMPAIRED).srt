how one of our agents decided to
potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:26,199
Three days. In Rome.

167
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,469
If you think M's signing
off on that, you're insane.

168

He won't let you out of his sight.

169
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:33,306
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

170

Listen.

171
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:38,310
Could you do a little quiet digging for me?

172
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:41,415
I heard a name in Mexico. "The Pale King."

173
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,719
You want me to be your mole.

174
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:48,521
Yes.

175
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:53,660
And what makes you think you can trust me?

176
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,598

177
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:01,362
TANNER: Poor old girl. Rigged
for demolition in a week.

178
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:05,531
Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild.

179
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,933
Still.

180
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,270
Time waits for no man and all that.

181
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:14,106
Anyway, all the money's been spent on this,

182
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:17,278
the New Centre for National Security.

183
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:20,946
BOND: So that's C's new digs.

184
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,514
You've met him, have you?

185
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:24,750
Yesterday. What do we know about him?

186
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,985
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

187
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,221
Wrote a dossier last year

188
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,289
on how the double-0 program was obsolete,

189
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,625
how drones could do all
our dirty work abroad.

190
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,228
Went to school with the Home Secretary.

191
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,796
Of course, he did.

192
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:39,132
This merger's just the start of it.

193
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,568
In three days, there's a
security conference in Tokyo

194
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:43,903
to decide the New World Order.

195
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:46,172
If C gets his way, he'll
have unlimited access

196
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,974
to the combined the intelligence
streams of nine countries.

197
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:50,277
Including us.

198
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,945
Quite.

199
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:03,154
Well, a lot's happened while you were away.

200
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:07,393
A train bombing in Hamburg and an
industrial explosion in Tunisia.

201
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:09,162
It's not great timing for us.

202
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,764
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

203
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:16,135
M, well, let's say he's
feeling the pressure.

204
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,503
Yeah, I've noticed.

205
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,372
Now, this way, 007.

206
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:22,376
Be careful. It's a trifle slippery.

207

at home in Whitehall,

208
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,347
what with the new merger,

209
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:32,452
so he set up shop here, away
from prying eyes, as it were.

210
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:35,354
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.

211

216
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:58,744

little tricks up her sleeve.

Last month, I found
thallium in my cell phone.

494
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:42,314
It's done its job. I have
a few weeks. Maybe less.

495
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:47,652
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

496
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:51,121
two dead men enjoying the evening.

497
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:52,724
What did you do?

498
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:54,659
I disobeyed him.

499
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,862
I followed him as far as I could.

500
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:00,498
He changed.

501
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,532
Oh, I see.

502
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:04,668
You grew a conscience.

503
00:57:04,669 --> 00:57:08,639
Our game is our game. But this?

504
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,476
Women, children...

505
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:12,842
Well, the thallium would suggest

506
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:14,978
that he doesn't like you very much anymore.

507
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:16,947
And clearly the feeling is mutual.

508
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:19,217
So why don't you tell
me how to find him again?

509
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,719
Oh, come on.

510
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:22,853
Tell me where he is.

511
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:24,922
He's everywhere.

512
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:26,322
Everywhere!

513
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:28,293
He's sitting at your desk,

514
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:31,997
he's kissing your lover, he's
eating supper with your family!

515
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:38,303
(SIGHS)

516
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:41,506
You're protecting someone.

517
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:43,306
Your wife.

518
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,843
(LAUGHING)

519
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:49,146
She left long ago.

520
00:57:49,147 --> 00:57:50,982
Your son?

521
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,788
Your daughter.

522
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:00,291
You won't find her.

523
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,826
She's clever.

524
00:58:01,827 --> 00:58:05,430
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

525
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:09,333
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.

526
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:11,701
(CHUCKLES)

527
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:13,438
I can keep her alive.

528
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:15,140
Yeah.

529
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:18,876
You have my word.

530
00:58:18,877 --> 00:58:21,077
Your word?

531
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:23,448
The word of an assassin!

532
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,495
That's my word.

533
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,892
<i>L'Americain.</i>

534
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:09,293
You save her,

535
00:59:09,294 --> 00:59:12,464
she can lead you to <i>L'Americain.</i>
She knows <i>L'Americain.</i>

536
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:15,767
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

537
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:27,044
You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

538
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:30,947
So long.

539
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:32,450
(GUNSHOT)

540
01:00:24,169 --> 01:00:27,471
M: I can't deny I'm impressed you
got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

541
01:00:27,472 --> 01:00:30,007
C: Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

542
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:33,277
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

543
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:34,378
When it goes online,

544
01:00:34,379 --> 01:00:36,246
this building will be
the most sophisticated

545
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,315
data gathering system in history.

546
01:00:38,316 --> 01:00:41,384
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

547
01:00:41,385 --> 01:00:43,119
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

548
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,755
I'm glad you like it.

549
01:00:44,756 --> 01:00:47,692
My commiserations on
losing the Nine Eyes vote.

550
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:48,860
Must have been a blow.

551
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,128
Not really. Only a matter of time

552
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:52,429
before the South Africans see the light.

553
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,731
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

554
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:56,800
Day and a half maybe.

555
01:00:56,801 --> 01:01:00,472
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.

556
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:04,241
It's how you use the
information that concerns me,

557
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:05,775
and who is using it.

558
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:08,779
This is what we need to
do to keep the people safe.

559
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,949
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

560
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,451
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field

561
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:16,253
can compete with all of this,

562
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:19,457
running around out there
with his license to kill.

563
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:22,727
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

564
01:01:23,861 --> 01:01:25,628
Have you?

565
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:28,166
To pull that trigger, you have to be sure.

566
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:32,404
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

567
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,606
And then you have to look him in the eye.

568
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,641
And you make the call.

569
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,911
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

570
01:01:41,912 --> 01:01:43,980
all the surveillance in the world

571
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:46,884
can't tell you what to do next.

572
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:50,487
A license to kill

573
01:01:50,488 --> 01:01:54,158
is also a license not to kill.

574
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:59,128
I didn't want to have to do this,

575
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:02,600
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.

576
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:05,568
MONEYPENNY: (ON RECORDING)
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

<i>Looks like you've had dealings
with him before. Quantum.</i>

BOND: <i>Run another name, will you?</i>

582
01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:19,217
C: So maybe there's something to be said

583
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:21,653
for total surveillance after all.

584
01:02:24,388 --> 01:02:26,925
You watch MI6 agents?

585
01:02:27,959 --> 01:02:30,127
We watch everyone.

588
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:39,663
I'll be with you in just a moment.

589
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:42,200
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

590
01:03:55,446 --> 01:03:58,349
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

591
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:02,719
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

592
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,621
Our job today is to analyze your needs,

593
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:07,291
both psychological and physical.

594
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,427
Hmm, sounds pretty straightforward.

595
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:12,663
I hope you don't mind. The
view can be distracting.

596
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:14,799
I hadn't noticed.

597
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:23,806
I see you filled out most of the paperwork.

598
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:28,212
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.

599
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:30,213
Do you exercise?

600
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:32,116
When I have to.

601
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:35,653
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?

602
01:04:36,187 --> 01:04:37,820
Sometimes.

603
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:39,790
How much alcohol do you consume?

604
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:41,959
Too much.

605
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,996
Some broader questions.

606
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:48,599
As a child, would you say you
were close to your parents?

607
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,902
My parents died when I was young.

608
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:54,070
Really? How old?

609
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:55,905
Old enough to remember.

610
01:04:55,906 --> 01:04:57,375
How, if I may ask?

611
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:59,610
It was a climbing accident.

612
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:00,777
So who brought you up?

613
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:03,012
Someone else.

614
01:05:03,013 --> 01:05:05,248
Humor me.

615
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:09,085
How does one train at Oxford and
the Sorbonne become a consultant,

616
01:05:09,086 --> 01:05:12,190
spend two years with
<i>Medecins Sans Frontieres</i>

617
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,292
and end up here?

618
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,360
Forgive me, but anyone might think

619
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:19,530
you were hiding from something.

620
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,367
You're paying a lot of
money to be here, Mr. Bond.

621
01:05:23,368 --> 01:05:25,869
Who's asking the questions, you or me?

622
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,406
Of course. Carry on.

623
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:35,012
I see you left this final question blank.

624
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:36,480
What is your occupation?

625
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:40,483
Well, that's not the sort of
thing that looks good on a form.

626
01:05:40,484 --> 01:05:41,652
And why is that?

627
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:43,154
I kill people.

628
01:05:45,823 --> 01:05:47,524
Small world?

629
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,061
Where is he?

630
01:05:51,062 --> 01:05:52,996
Your father's dead.

631
01:05:52,997 --> 01:05:54,565
Two days ago.

632
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:56,199
(SHUDDERING) How do you know?

633
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,335
Because I was there.

634
01:05:58,336 --> 01:05:59,503
Did you kill him?

635
01:05:59,504 --> 01:06:01,338
I didn't have to.

636
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:03,739
He did it himself.

637
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:07,376
And you came all the
way just to tell me this?

638
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,179
That my father's dead?

639
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:13,150
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

640
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:17,288
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.

641
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,956
You're lying.

642
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:21,358
Why would he trust you?

643
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,795
Because he knew that I
needed something in return.

644
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:26,762
And what was that?

645
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,700
To find <i>L'Americain.</i>

646
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:30,967
This interview is over.

647
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,436
Dr. Swann...

648
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:37,008
You have 10 minutes to leave the
building. Then I'm calling security.

649
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:42,414
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

651
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:05,768
Can I get you something, sir?

652
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,338
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

653
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:11,440
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

654
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:13,677
I'm really starting to love this place.

655
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:16,346
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

If you've come for the car,

658

I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

Well, not to worry, 007. It was
only a £3,000,000 prototype.

Why are you here, Q?

Oh, I just fancied a break, to be honest.

662
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,527
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.

balls for Christmas decorations.

665

- Get to the point.
- The point, 007,

666
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:37,934
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

667
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,503
Dead and buried.

668
01:07:39,504 --> 01:07:40,905
And unless you come back with me right now,

669
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:43,907
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

breaking loose out there and...

673

He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

Yes. I know that.

He's not someone I'll ever forget.

678

My whole career is on the line here.

682

this through proper channels,

01:26:30,301 --> 01:26:31,766
Shortest meeting I can remember.

820
01:26:31,767 --> 01:26:33,301
South Africans on board, I take it?

821
01:26:33,302 --> 01:26:35,637
Yeah, well, who can blame them?

822
01:26:35,638 --> 01:26:37,873
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

823
01:26:37,874 --> 01:26:40,510
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

824
01:26:40,511 --> 01:26:42,545
It's a major step forward.

cooperation changes everything.

826

827
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:49,952
Look.

828
01:26:49,953 --> 01:26:52,188
They've asked me to head the new committee.

829
01:26:52,189 --> 01:26:54,122
Yes? And?

830
01:26:54,123 --> 01:26:57,926
And I should tell you I've
spoken with the Home Secretary.

831
01:26:57,927 --> 01:27:00,662
And in light of the new
information I've given him,

832
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:04,166
he's decided to close down the
double-0 program with immediate effect.

833
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,434
You don't know what you're doing.

834
01:27:05,435 --> 01:27:07,436
It's not personal.

835
01:27:07,437 --> 01:27:09,438
It's the future.

836
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:11,173
And...

837
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:14,243
You're not.

838
01:27:14,244 --> 01:27:16,244

840
01:27:18,347 --> 01:27:20,216
I'll take that as a compliment.

841
01:27:20,217 --> 01:27:22,085
I wouldn't.

842
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:24,820
This isn't over yet.

843
01:27:42,338 --> 01:27:46,109
- Would you press this for me? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:06,629

I promised him I'd protect you.

The first thing to do is to
teach you how to protect yourself.

848
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:17,105
What if I shoot you by mistake?

849
01:28:17,106 --> 01:28:19,609
Wouldn't be the first time.

850

01:28:20,909 --> 01:28:23,346

860
01:29:16,665 --> 01:29:20,402
A man once came to our
house to kill my father.

861
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:23,639
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

862
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,042
Or that Papa kept a
Beretta Nine-millimeter

Sorry to interrupt your

868
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,242
Q: Evening, sir.

869
01:30:00,243 --> 01:30:02,778
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond

870
01:30:02,779 --> 01:30:05,815
to a point here in North Africa.

871
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,318
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

872
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:13,488
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.

873
01:30:13,489 --> 01:30:15,324
We can't help him.

874
01:30:16,226 --> 01:30:18,161
But, sir, we know where he's heading.

875
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:21,631
C is watching everything we do.

876
01:30:21,632 --> 01:30:24,734
We're only handing them more information.

877
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,938
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

878
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:32,041
We have to. We only make him weaker.

879
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:33,743
But, sir, we know exactly where he is.

880
01:30:33,744 --> 01:30:37,180
Yes, I know, but if we can
track him, so can others.

881
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:39,581
Delete all the Smart Blood files.

882

Everything.

883
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:44,721
He's on his own.

884
01:31:10,614 --> 01:31:11,980
You shouldn't stare.

885
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:14,383
Well, you shouldn't look like that.

886
01:31:18,087 --> 01:31:19,921
May I get you an <i>aperitif?</i>

I'm not sure.

888
01:31:21,324 --> 01:31:24,493
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

889
01:31:24,494 --> 01:31:26,394
Well, we can't have that.

890
01:31:26,395 --> 01:31:30,233

Well, what's that?

895
01:31:38,374 --> 01:31:41,609
Why, given every other possible option,

896
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:44,179
does a man choose the
life of a paid assassin?

01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:56,158

I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

(CHUCKLES) Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.

985
01:44:03,319 --> 01:44:06,688
So, James, why did you come?

986
01:44:06,689 --> 01:44:08,857
I came here to kill you.

987
01:44:09,391 --> 01:44:12,060
And I thought you came here to die.

988
01:44:12,061 --> 01:44:14,597
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

989
01:44:15,698 --> 01:44:18,100
Speaking of perspective.

990
01:44:35,418 --> 01:44:39,221

That's touching, don't you think?

Well, James,

1001
01:45:13,623 --> 01:45:15,957
it looks like you're all alone.

01:45:19,628 --> 01:45:21,962
Too scared to join in.

(CHUCKLING) I don't think
you quite understand.

Oh, I think I do.

1006
01:45:25,133 --> 01:45:27,969
You set cities on fire and
watch innocent people burn,

1007
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:30,238
so you can convince governments to join

1008
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:32,974
an intelligence network you've paid for.

1009

Not that complicated.

I'm guessing our little friend,
C, he's one of your disciples.

You could say that.

1012
01:45:42,685 --> 01:45:45,252
And what does he get out of it?

1013
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:47,087
Nothing.

1014
01:45:47,088 --> 01:45:48,989
He's a visionary, like me.

1015
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:51,426

1016
01:45:51,427 --> 01:45:53,427
Psychiatric wards are full of them.

1017

Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

1018

You came across me so many
times and yet you never saw me.

You interfered in my
world, I destroyed yours.

1024
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:14,649
Or did you think it was coincidence

1025
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:17,720
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?

1026
01:46:18,687 --> 01:46:21,257
Vesper Lynd, for example.

1027
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:26,128
She was the big one. Has
he told you about her?

And then, of course, your beloved M.

You're a brave woman, my dear.

Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

1035
01:47:04,232 --> 01:47:07,167
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.

1036
01:47:07,168 --> 01:47:09,569
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

comprehend the crucial fact,

1069

A man can watch himself being disemboweled

and derive great horror
from the experience,

It isn't taking place where he is.

As you know all too well, dear
Madeleine, a man lives inside his head.

1074

That's where the seat of his soul is.

Now, James and I were both present recently

when a man was deprived of his eyes.

1077

And the most astonishing thing happened.

1078
01:50:01,709 --> 01:50:03,377
Didn't you notice?

1079

He wasn't there anymore.

He'd gone even though he was still alive.

So in this brief moment
between life and death,

there was nobody inside his skull.

Over the course of two winters

he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.
