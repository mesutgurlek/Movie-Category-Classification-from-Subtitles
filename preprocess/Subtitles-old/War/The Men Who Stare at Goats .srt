1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,200
- Boone?
- Yes, General?

2
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm going into the next office.

3
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,160
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,800
Damn it!

5
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,120
My name is Bob Wilton.
I'm a journalist.

6
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,720
Part of my job is finding
where the story begins.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,920
If you were looking at my story,
you might think it began

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,800
when I got a job at the
Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,880
Or you might think it began...

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
...when I married
my college sweetheart Debora.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
But you'd be wrong.

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,960
Because the real story of my life
began a few years back,

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
when my editor sent me
to interview a local guy,

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,000
he'd heard on the talk radio show.

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,840
The guy claimed to have
some kind of psychic powers.

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,880
That he could travel with just his mind
anywhere he wanted.

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,720
He called it "Remote Viewing".

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,480
The man's name was Gus Lacey.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,000
What have you seen lately?

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Lately, I've been watching
the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,560
Thanks, Mom.
Uh, and it turns...

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,640
I got it. I got it.
Mom, I got it.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Thank you.

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
It turns out...

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,240
It's the ghost of a dinosaur.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay. Wow.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,880
So, when did this all
start for you, Gus?

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,120
It started when I was a kid.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
Gus told me that
back in the eighties,

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,880
he was part of a top-secret unit
that got their training in the army.

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
In a program sanctioned
by the highest levels of government.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,040
When I asked him what's the purpose
of this unit was, he said:

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,440
We were Psychic Spies, mainly.
That was our initial tasking.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
Once they realized
what they were sitting on...

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,840
We were trained to kill animals.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,560
- What? With...
- With our minds. That is correct.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
Just by staring at them.

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,080
What kind of animals?

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
One of our unit's
stopped the heart of a goat.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
Power... they unleashed in us.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,920
Last week I killed my hamster.

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
You wanna see?

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,200
There! Look!

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,240
You ever seen a hamster
do that before?

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,680
- I've never owned a hamster, Gus, so...
- Just look! Look!

46
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,080
See the way it's glaring
at its wheel.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah, I guess our hamster-owning
readers will know what's...

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
aberrant behavior and what...
what's...

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
- Oh, shit! Shit! He's down!
- Yeah, he's down.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,880
At this point I'd been staring at him
for about three hours.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Bizarre, right?

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,200
What is that?

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,080
It didn't die.
You said, you killed it?

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah, well...

55
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
Mom said no.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
She said:
"Don't show the hamster dying"

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,760
"Show the tape where
the hamster acts bizarre instead. "

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
You should have seen
the Skipper at work.

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,120
- Who's the Skipper?
- Lyn Cassady.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,080
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,960
He was like an occultic force.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,240
I think he runs a dance studio now.

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,760
The little man inside me
dismissed Lacey as a nut.

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,320
You know, the little man.

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,320
He's the one who says:
"Keep your head down. "

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,240
"Stay in your little town,
your little job. "

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,680
"You're a lucky guy,
your wife loves you. "

68
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,920
"You have everything you want. "

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,640
"You're not looking for
some great adventure. "

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,480
"But then, one day...

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
...when you least expect it,

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,640
"The great adventure finds you!"

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,960
Ron's sudden death
was the catalyst for everything.

74
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
Deborah told me later that
it had been like a wake-up call for her.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
What people used to call:
"The memento mori".

76
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,760
Ron's massive coronary
had reminded her that

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,440
...life was just too short to
waste any chance of true happiness.

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,640
And his death that helped her
to put everything in perspective.

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,000
A week after the funeral...

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,280
...she left me for my editor.

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,880
It seemed like such a tragedy
at the time.

82
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,480
We couldn't see beyond
our little lives...

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,040
...to the great events of history
unfolding out there in the world.

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,480
I was like a child or a Hobbit,
safe in the Shire.

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,320
Or a blond farm boy
in a distant, desert planet,

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,160
...unaware that he was already
taking the first steps on the path...

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,080
...that would lead him relentlessly
towards the heart of a conflict...

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
...between the forces of
Good and Evil.

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,680
Americans are a resolute people,

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
...who have risen
to every test of our time.

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Adversity has revealed
the character of our country,

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,440
...to the world.

93
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,960
Had I known where that path
would lead,

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,920
...had a soft wind from my future
brought me the name of Bill Django,

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
...I might never have gone.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,160
But as it was,

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,640
I did what so many men
have done throughout history

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,080
...when a woman has broken
their heart...

99
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
I went to war.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,320
- So, have you seen any combat?
- Yeah, no it's, uh...

102
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Well, I won't lie to you Debora,
it's been pretty damn hairy.

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
Yeah. We've been
watching it on Fox.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,920
Yeah, it's not, uh...

105
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,480
I've seen things that
you shouldn't, you know...

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,560
Well, I don't even know
why you're there.

107
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,520
Well, I think it's important,
people get an accurate picture of what's

108
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
- What?
- Ready to go?

109
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,760
- what's happening, so...
- Yeah.

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,480
- So, what is that... is that Dave?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,280
He says "Hi. "

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,880
Oh, that's, huh...

113
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,120
Is he gonna get his stuff
out of here?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,520
That's...

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,080
I... I gotta go.

116
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,360
We're moving out, riding up
north to cover the fighting there

117
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,040
Wait, Bob, I'm just...

118
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
So, what's a useful phrase?

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,120
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

120
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,120
- La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.
- Right.

121
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
- What's that mean?
- Don't shoot. I'm a reporter.

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,360
Okay, that I'll mind.

123
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,080
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,920
I've been waiting for months for
permission to cross the border into Iraq.

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
All that time, I'd seen
the embedded war correspondents

126
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,680
...coming back,
swapping stories.

127
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
They all ignored me.

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
I had to get into Iraq somehow.

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,920
Or I would never again
be able to face myself.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,720
My wife, or that
one-armed fuckhead Dave.

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,680
DeWitt Resources, uh,
out of Arkansas.

132
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,160
That's right.
We make trash cans.

133
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,800
You're here for the conference, right?
Looking for a contract?

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
- I guess.
- What's your pitch?

135
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,280
Well... we're real cheap.

136
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,440
- Bob Wilton.
- Skip.

137
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,960
- Do you mind if I...?
- No.

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,520
- So you're from Arkansas?
- No.

139
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,040
- Been here long?
- No.

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,040
Be careful what you wish for.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
I wanted to prove myself.

142
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
And for my sins...

143
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,240
Faith taught me a lesson.

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,520
Lyn Cassady?

145
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Lyn Cassady.

146
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,160
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

147
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,840
Do you know a Gus Lacey?

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
Skip?

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,440
Hello?

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Lyn?
I've your hat.

151
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,960
Skip?

152
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
- You work for Hooper?
- Hooper? No.

153
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,480
I work for the Ann
Arbor Daily Telegram.

154
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
How do you know about Lacey?

155
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,200
I interviewed him a few months ago
for my paper.

156
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Prick.

157
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,920
Follow me.

158
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
Let me ask you something.

159
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,480
What color were the chairs
in the hotel bar?

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,080
You were in there for hours.
What color were the chairs?

161
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
- Green.
- Beige.

162
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,360
How many lights are there
in this room?

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
A Super Soldier wouldn't have to look.
He would just know.

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,360
- A Super Soldier?
- A Jedi Warrior.

165
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,480
He would know
where all the lights were.

166
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,040
He could walk through a room
and he could tell you...

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,720
...how many power outlets
there were.

168
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,200
People are walking around
with their eyes closed.

169
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,960
At Level One, we were trained to
instantly absorb all details.

170
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,880
- What's, uh, what's a Jedi Warrior?
- You're looking at one.

171
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,360
- You're a Jedi Warrior?
- That's correct.

172
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't...

173
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
I don't know what that means.

174
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady,
Special Forces, retired.

175
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,520
In the eighties,
I was trained at Fort Bragg

176
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,080
...under a secret initiative
codenamed "Project Jedi. "

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,960
The objective of the project
was to create Super Soldiers.

178
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Soldiers with super powers.

179
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
We were the first generation
of the New Earth Army.

180
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,040
- You’ve got super powers?
- That's correct.

181
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,720
Wait a minute.

182
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,040
What you saying is that you...

183
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,520
...were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey?

184
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,400
We prefer the term "Remote Viewer. "

185
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
- How does that work?
- Well, every Jedi had different techniques.

186
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,520
Mel Landau used to visualize packing
all his troubles into a little suitcase,

187
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,680
...to clear his mind.

188
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,520
Steve Cuttle recite Bible verse
which was...

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
What about you?

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,920
I find... I find drinking helps.
And...

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
And if I'm listening to
classic rock...

192
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,320
- Oh, yeah? Like who?
- I like Boston. Boston usually works.

193
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
What other powers did you practice?

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Invisibility.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
- Invisibility?
- Yeah. That was Level Three.

196
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,400
- Like... actual invisibility?
- Well, yeah, that was the goal.

197
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Eventually, we adapted it to just
finding a way of not being seen.

198
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,600
But once you understand,

199
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,920
the linkage between observation
and reality,

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
...then you begin to
dance with invisibility.

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Like camouflage?

202
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,000
No. It's not like camouflage.

203
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,440
We also practiced Phasing.

204
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Crossing from particle to wave,
from the physical to energy.

205
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,520
Solid objects seem to pass
right through you.

206
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,760
That starts with a breathing exercise.

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,160
Then you think black.
That's the nothingness. Got it?

208
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,160
I don't know what the...

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Can I be honest with you, Lyn?

210
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,920
I don't know what to make of this.

211
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,680
I don't know what to say.
This is amazing stuff.

212
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,480
I wanna...

213
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,480
- Could I write a story about this?
- Not gonna happen.

214
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Because, I've been looking
for a story, Lyn.

215
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,920
And I was gonna write
about the re-build contracts...

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,360
...but this is much better.
This is much better.

217
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,720
- Not gonna happen.
- All I'm saying is we could meet tomorrow

218
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

219
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
- What? You're going home?
- Going to Iraq.

220
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,440
I've been thinking about partnering
with a factory in Al Qaim.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,920
- I could come.
- What?

222
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
- I could come, maybe...
- Look, I don't want to be a story.

223
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,160
- I don't need the attention.
- Look, we could change names, stuff...

224
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,520
Look! There's a war over there, Bob!
Do you understand that?

225
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,560
War!

226
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
Now, I don't have to be
looking out for you.

227
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,480
You... you wouldn't have...
I'll look after myself.

228
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,840
I've been in some pretty hairy situations.

229
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,840
I'm a journalist, Lyn.
You understand?

230
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,360
A journalist.
I go where the story is.

231
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
What is this?

232
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,000
Nothing. I was just doodling.

233
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
What's the matter?

234
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Nothing.

235
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,080
The U.S Army doesn't really have
any serious alternative...

236
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,080
...than to be wonderful!

237
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,480
This does not represent
the official position...

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,240
...of the United States Army
at this time.

239
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,520
Bill Django.

240
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,760
Who's Bill Django?

241
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
The man who wrote that book.

242
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,800
He said it all started when he
fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.

243
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,080
Move out!
Go! Go! Go!

244
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,440
Go! Go!

245
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,440
Move!
Move it! Move it!

246
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,880
Fuck you motherfucker!

247
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,600
- Hey, knock it off!
- Hold your fire!

248
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,200
Chris! Knock it off!

249
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,440
Will you knock it off?

250
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
Jesus!

251
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,640
- Medic!
- You'll be alright.

252
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
Alright!

253
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
What are you waiting for?

254
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,520
What the fuck!
Why isn't anyone firing?

255
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
Fire!

256
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,040
Every single one of Bill's men
fired high.

257
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
They instinctively hadn't wanted
to shoot another person.

258
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,720
Later Bill would come across a study,
which revealed that...

259
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,480
...only 15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill.

260
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,640
The rest aimed high,
didn't fire at all,

261
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
...or pretended to be
busy doing something else.

262
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,120
I got you, sir.
Stay with me, alright?

263
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
I got you.

264
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
Hang in there.

265
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Their gentleness...

266
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,960
...is their strength.

267
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
While recovering in the hospital,

268
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Bill wrote to the
Vice Chief of Staff for the Army,

269
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,000
explaining that he wanted to go on
a fact-finding mission...

270
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
...to explore
alternative combat tactics.

271
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,800
The Pentagon agreed to pay
his salary and expenses.

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon

273
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,720
...was that he was really looking for
the answer to his vision.

274
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,600
How could his men's gentleness,

275
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,760
...their general lack of interest
in killing people,

276
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,720
...be turned into a strength?

277
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
How could love and peace
help win wars?

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,520
Bill knew where to go
to find out.

279
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Bill disappeared into the
New Age Movement for six years.

280
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,400
Like all Shaman before him,
he had traversed the wilderness.

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,600
Now he was returning to his people,
a changed man.

282
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,680
He brought with him his
confidential report

283
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
...which he called:

284
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
"The New Earth Army manual. "

285
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,400
The New Earth Army is a banner under
which the forces of good can gather.

286
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,040
The courage and nobility
of the Warrior,

287
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,600
...blended with the
spirituality of the Monk.

288
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,360
The Jedi Warrior will follow
in the footsteps...

289
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,960
...of the great imagineers
of the past:

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,920
Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung,
Walt Disney...

291
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,960
The role of The New Earth Army is
to resolve conflict world-wide.

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,160
Jedi's will parachute into war zones,
utilizing sparkly eyes technique,

293
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
...carrying symbolic
flowers and animals,

294
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,760
...playing indigenous music
and words of peace...

295
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,360
What's... What's the
sparkly eyes technique?

296
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
Are you ready?
Right.

297
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,040
- Got it?
- Okay.

298
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,280
- You see it? You got it?
- I think, I got it.

299
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,480
As Lyn drove on, I wondered
what the hell I was doing.

300
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,680
I wanted to go back.
This wasn't me, this was crazy.

301
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,400
And so was Lyn.

302
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,480
But, by then, it was too late.
We'd already crossed the border.

303
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,720
What? Does that direct
your powers?

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,840
What?

305
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,520
The cone. Does it direct your
psychic powers or something?

306
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,720
No.

307
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
It cooks supper.
It's solar.

308
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,840
Utilizing the power of the universe.

309
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,240
No pollution,
totally renewable.

310
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,000
That's New Earth Army technology.

311
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,560
Pretty mind blowing, isn't it?

312
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,000
First time I saw that,
I was like...

313
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,360
- What the fuck?
- Yeah. But, well it's...

314
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
But what?

315
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,120
It's just hard to believe
the Pentagon paid for this.

316
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,080
There's nothing in here,
actually about fighting?

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,160
The New Earth Army was
tasked with preventing conflict.

318
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,600
We're a force of peace,
not war.

319
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,280
Bill understood
if you want to change the world,

320
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
...you've got to start
by changing the armies.

321
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,040
He was the guy that started
the research in the non-lethals.

322
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,960
- Non-lethals?
- Check this out.

323
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
- The Predator.
- The Predator?

324
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
Lyn, that's just a plastic...

325
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,840
You're mine now.

326
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,040
The predator is 100% biodegradable.

327
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,320
It's friendly to the earth
and it can hurt you in a hundred ways.

328
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,400
Fuck!

329
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,000
It has warrior capacities.
And it looks a little bit funny.

330
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,960
Jesus! Stop it!

331
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
- I bought it online.
- Fuck!

332
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,280
The funny thing is, you could see
this just lying on the ground...

333
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,160
...and you'd never know
that it has such lethality.

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Eyeballs.

335
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Goddammit!

336
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
Well, I guess it's officially night now.

337
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,000
Piece's a shit.

338
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,000
I've got Crohn's.
The steroids help.

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,880
Sometimes there's a need, Bob.

340
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,920
Sometimes people are calling
out for something,

341
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,160
...they don't even know
it themselves.

342
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,600
And then a man like Bill
appears out of nowhere,

343
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,040
...because he heard the call.

344
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,360
We are a hollow army, gentlemen.

345
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,480
Vietnam has crushed our soul.

346
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,360
We have to dream a new America.

347
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,600
An America that no longer has an
exploitative view of natural resources.

348
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,440
No longer promotes
consumption at all costs.

349
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,360
But to achieve this dream...

350
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,880
We must become the first Superpower
to develop super powers.

351
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,680
We must create Warrior Monks.

352
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,640
Men and women
who can fall in love with everyone,

353
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,360
...sense plant auras,
pass through walls,

354
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,680
...stop saying mindless cliches
and see into the future.

355
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,520
I want you to
join me in this vision.

356
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,280
Be all you can be.

357
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,840
Amongst Bill’s audience that day
was a Brigadier General...

358
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,640
...from the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

359
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,360
Dean Hopgood.

360
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,480
For some time, the General
had been concerned with...

361
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,040
...Soviet research
into psychic powers.

362
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
According to some stories,

363
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,800
...the Soviets had designed
"psychotronic generators. "

364
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,640
Machines capable of bombarding
the President with negative energy.

365
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,040
They were also conducting
sadistic experiments...

366
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,680
...to see whether animals
had psychic powers.

367
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,560
Could they, for instance,

368
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,880
...telepathically detect that their
babies were distressed?

369
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,320
Sick bastards.

370
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,840
But when did the Soviets begin
this type of research?

371
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Well, sir...

372
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
It looks like they found out
about our attempt to...

373
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,360
...telepathically communicate with
one of our nuclear subs.

374
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,720
The Nautilus, while it was
under the Polar cap.

375
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,680
- What attempt?
- There was no attempt.

376
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,040
It seems the story
was a French hoax.

377
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,800
But the Russians think
the story about the story...

378
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,840
...being a French hoax
is just a story, sir.

379
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,520
So, they've started psi research...

380
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
...because they thought
we were doing psi research,

381
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,840
when in fact we
weren't doing psi research?

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,080
Yes, sir. But now that
they're doing psi research,

383
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,640
...we're gonna have to
do psi research, sir.

384
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,080
We can't afford to have the Russians
leading the field in the paranormal.

385
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,560
Two weeks later, the Army adopted
the slogan: "Be all you can be. "

386
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,760
And appointed Bill, Commander of the
first New Earth Army battalion.

387
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,240
Lyn?

388
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
Lyn!?

389
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,960
Lyn? Lyn!

390
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,240
What?

391
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,040
Nothing, I...

392
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,800
- What? What are you doing?
- Salute to the sun.

393
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,520
Alright. We're Oscar Mike.

394
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,040
- That's "On the Move", soldier.
- Right.

395
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
What are you doing?

396
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,280
Cloud bursting.
Keeps me in shape.

397
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,760
- Really? Which one?
- That one.

398
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
- What? This one?
- No. That one. The big one.

399
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Isn't that too far away?

400
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,680
They're all far away.

401
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,840
And it's gone.

402
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Jesus, you had like
the whole desert to drive in, Lyn.

403
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm sorry about that Bob.

404
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,760
Must have got a little
bi-locational there.

405
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,440
Don't worry it though.
Somebody will come along soon.

406
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,440
- Heads.
- Right.

407
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,880
- Head.
- Right.

408
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,000
- What's your record at this?
- Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.

409
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,400
Right. Well, that's pretty...

410
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Thank you, Jesus.
Good Jesus!

411
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,880
Please! Please!
Please!

412
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,280
Can you help us?
Can you help?

413
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,560
Can you help?
We drove into a rock.

414
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,760
And I wonder, if you could
take us to some...

415
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,840
...like a town or someplace?

416
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,120
Can we... we get in?
Thank you.

417
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
He says fattore.
Fattore, he says.

418
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
We can get in.
Come on.

419
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,520
Thank you. Thank you for, uh,
picking us up.

420
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
No car's came by.

421
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
How... How far is...

422
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,280
Lyn?

423
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
- Is this...
- Yeah.

424
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
We're gonna die.

425
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,160
We're gonna be killed by Al Qaeda.

426
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,800
- I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
- What the hell do you know?

427
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,400
You don't know.

428
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,040
You don't know!
You don't know anything!

429
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,120
This is all your fault!

430
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,200
Bob, there's something
I have to tell you.

431
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,360
When I said that I was retired
from the unit, that was a lie.

432
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm on a mission.

433
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,840
DeWitts was just my cover.
I've been reactivated.

434
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,680
I couldn't tell you
because this is a Black Op.

435
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,480
But I think you have a role to play.
I think that's why you're here.

436
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,680
You're an idiot.

437
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,240
You know why I'm here?

438
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,960
I just wanted to get into Iraq
so I could prove to my wife...

439
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,040
...that I wasn't a...

440
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,080
And now I'm gonna die.

441
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,360
I'm gonna die.
And she's right. I'm such a...

442
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,880
...fuckhead!

443
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,640
Bob, have you ever heard of
"Optimum Trajectory"?

444
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,960
What?

445
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,040
"Optimum trajectory. "

446
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,840
Your life is like a river.

447
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,800
That you're aiming for a goal
that isn't your destiny,

448
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,040
...you'll always gonna be swimming
against the current.

449
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,240
Young Gandhi wants to be
a stock-car racer?

450
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,520
It's not gonna happen.

451
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,200
Little Anne Frank wants to
be a High School teacher.

452
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,280
Tough titty Anne.
That's not your destiny.

453
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,480
But you will go on to move
the hearts and minds of millions.

454
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,120
Find out what your destiny is
and the river will carry you.

455
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,680
Now, sometimes events in life...

456
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,200
...give an individual clues
as to where their destiny lies.

457
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,880
Like those little doodles
you just happened to draw?

458
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,440
It's the Ajna chakra,
the third eye.

459
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
The symbol of the Jedi.

460
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,720
When I saw that
you're drawing it, well...

461
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
...the Universe gives you clues
like that, you don't ignore it.

462
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,480
You're meant to be here with me, Bob.

463
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,000
It's the Jedi in you
that sensed it.

464
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,640
Now, I don't think these guys
are FRL's or Mahdi Army...

465
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,440
...I think we're talking
standard criminals here.

466
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,840
Which means they're gonna try
to sell us to another group.

467
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,320
- We can't let that happen.
- How are we gonna stop them?

468
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,680
There's three of them!
And they've got guns!

469
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,880
We're Jedi, Bob.

470
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,480
We don't fight with guns.
We fight with our minds.

471
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,160
What do you mean?

472
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,080
Okay, let's say that we have no choice
but to fight with these guys.

473
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,800
We will use visual aesthetics
to instill psychically...

474
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,360
...in the enemy
a disincentive to attack.

475
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
What do you mean?

476
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,200
Okay, you pick one of them out,
you lock eyes with him,

477
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
...and you go into this monotone
and you're gonna go...

478
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,600
"I'm not going to attack you. "

479
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,760
You relax your body and your voice.

480
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,680
And you just rip out
one of his eyes.

481
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
Or you get a pen
and you stab him in the neck,

482
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,680
you create this...
a fountain of blood,

483
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,360
I mean a real fountain, get it
squirting all over his buddies.

484
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,240
That is a psychic disincentive,
right there.

485
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,200
We haven't got a pen.

486
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,240
You're missing the point.

487
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Come here.
Stand up. Come.

488
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,200
Let me show you something.
Alright.

489
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,440
- Choke me.
- I don't want to, Lyn.

490
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,680
Choke me.
What am I gonna do?

491
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,160
I don't know...
there's too many sharp edges.

492
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,520
It's okay.
You can "attack me. "

493
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,600
What's with the quotation fingers?

494
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,200
It's like saying, I'm only capable
of ironic attacking or something.

495
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
Choke me!

496
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,240
Well, if I choose to choke you,
what are you gonna do?

497
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm gonna interrupt your
thought pattern.

498
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,000
See? I barely moved.

499
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,440
Physics wise,
not much going on here.

500
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,440
It's the psychic energy that's
important. You okay?

501
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,440
- Sharp edges.
- Yeah.

502
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
- You felt fear though in the beginning?
- Yes.

503
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,840
Would you say that level of fear
was abnormal?

504
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,200
I don't know. I was pretty
terrified anyway...

505
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,120
...but the fear I felt on the run-up
to the choking was, you know, unusual.

506
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,400
You know why?

507
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,680
Because it wasn't you.
It was me.

508
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,400
I was inside your head.
Fighting with the mind.

509
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,880
- Now, you must always...
- Okay. We'll go.

510
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm sorry I freaked out
back there, Lyn.

511
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,320
You learned a lesson.

512
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
"Whatever you fear most
has no power over you,

513
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,800
...it's the fear
that has the power. "

514
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,520
- Bill?
- Oprah.

515
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,920
You really don't work
for DeWitts?

516
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,960
Just my cover.

517
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
Gus Lacey said
you ran a dance studio.

518
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
That was just cover too, right?

519
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
No. I do run a dance studio.

520
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,720
I love dancing.

521
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,960
And you're out here
on a mission, right?

522
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,720
In time, Bob.

523
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,880
Did you mean what you said back there
when you said I had some...

524
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,000
...I had some Jedi in me?

525
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,120
We learn to recognize our own kind.

526
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,000
Haven't you always felt like
you were different?

527
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes. Yes, I have.

528
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,640
That's the way it is for us.

529
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,240
We're the ones who don't fit in,
when we were kids.

530
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,240
Have you always had powers?

531
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,560
Kind of.

532
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
Foxtrot-117 has launched.
Tracking now.

533
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,760
Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667...

534
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,840
Did you crash those computers?

535
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,600
Yes, sir.

536
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,240
Far fucking out!

537
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,880
How would you feel
about a transfer, son?

538
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,160
I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django.

539
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,960
If you pass this course...

540
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,120
...you'll be a psychic weapon.

541
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,280
An angel of death,
our enemies worst nightmare!

542
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Until that time, you’re nothing!

543
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,800
Less than nothing!

544
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,120
- Do you understand?
- Sir! Yes, sir!

545
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm just kidding about this shit.

546
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Okay, what shall we do now, uh?

547
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,960
Let's dance.

548
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

549
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,680
Give it everything you've got.

550
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,200
That's it.

551
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,080
- What's your first name, Cassady?
- Lyn, sir.

552
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,440
You've gotta free your feet
before you can free your mind, Lyn.

553
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm not really much of a dancer, sir.

554
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,640
That's not true, is it?

555
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
You can dance.

556
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,320
It's just someone told you not to.

557
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,960
Stop acting so fucking queer!

558
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,680
Well, I'm your commanding officer,
and I'm ordering you to...

559
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,920
...let the dance out!

560
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Come on, dance!
Goddammit!

561
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,520
Let it go!

562
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,080
Let it go!

563
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
That's it!

564
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Welcome to the Heroes Journey, Lyn.

565
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,520
Okay everyone, remember,
we officially do not exist as a unit.

566
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,200
And remember,
no solid food for the first week.

567
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,160
Belgian waffle, ginseng
and amphetamines.

568
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,040
Not to be abused,
but very fucking handy.

569
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,040
There's the opening.
Feel the bend now. You feel it?

570
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,000
That's it! Yeah!

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,640
- Think cold!
- Bravo Zulu! Yeah!

572
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,280
Mother Earth, my life support
system as a soldier,

573
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,640
I must drink your blue water,
live inside your read clay,

574
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,760
...and eat your green skin.

575
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,080
Carry my body through
space and time.

576
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,760
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

577
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm yours and you are mine.
I salute you.

578
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,280
After years of feeling
like an oddball...

579
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,560
...Lyn had finally found a home.

580
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,880
At last he was with men who prided
themselves on being different.

581
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
Left shoulder, that's it.

582
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,440
These were Golden Days for Lyn.

583
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,480
There was something so noble
and pure in Bill's vision...

584
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,080
...that the Jedi's felt inspired
to be more than soldiers.

585
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,880
In a world torn apart by
greed and hate...

586
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,280
they would be a force for good,
for peace.

587
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,960
For the first time in his life
Lyn felt truly happy.

588
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,960
Then into the garden
a serpent did come.

589
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,160
Let me finish this.
Let me finish this.

590
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,400
Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
writer from Colorado,

591
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,720
...recruited to the Jedi
after General Hopgood...

592
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,080
...met him at a
spoon-bending party.

593
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,840
Jesus!

594
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,920
You did this?

595
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,440
You son of a...!

596
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,200
Right from the start...

597
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,120
...he had made himself unpopular
with the rest of the unit.

598
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,080
Congratulations, Scotty. I'm sorry
it doesn't work out between you two.

599
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,440
Larry made it quite clear that
he despised most of the other Jedi's.

600
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Hey, man! How'd you like it
if somebody did that to you?

601
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,560
But Lyn...
Lyn was different.

602
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,680
Fuck off!

603
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,760
He really hated him.

604
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,600
K-9. Scotty?

605
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,080
It's...

606
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,560
- It's something cylindrical? It's a pencil?
- Okay. Larry?

607
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,720
This is Larry's spirit guide, Maud.

608
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I'm looking into the cupboard now.

609
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,160
And I see...

610
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,120
I see...

611
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,480
...a tin mug?

612
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,080
Lyn?

613
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,200
It's a man sitting on a chair.

614
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,120
No, wait a minute.
You said A, not K!

615
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,840
- He said A.
- Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.

616
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,800
After a year's training,
Lyn was given his first tasking.

617
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,880
A senior NATO General had been kidnapped
by Red Brigade members in Italy.

618
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,360
Bill was unofficially asked
if his unit would be able to...

619
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,920
...help find him
before it was too late.

620
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,840
We're north of Verona.

621
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,800
It's a small town near a lake.

622
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
I can see a cinema.

623
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,760
Across the street from the cinema,
there's a shop.

624
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,360
Or it's a... it's a cafe.

625
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,160
He's in the apartment above the cafe.

626
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,560
The name of the town is...

627
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,760
...it's something sweet.

628
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,400
Dolce.

629
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,280
The name of the town is Dolce.

630
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Bill had never encountered anyone
with such psychic capabilities.

631
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,080
And from that moment on,
Lyn's reputation soared.

632
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,480
Rank, medals... these things
mean little to the Jedi.

633
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,920
But growth in spirit, in wisdom,
in psychic power,

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
...these are things
that earn our respect.

635
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,080
Native Americans believed that
when one received the Eagle feather,

636
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,080
...it was the mark of love,
of gratitude...

637
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,360
...and ultimate respect.

638
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,240
Only true human beings
may carry the Eagle feather.

639
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,160
- Way to go, Lyn!
- That's great!

640
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,880
The word soon got out in the
intelligence community...

641
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,600
...that there was a sergeant
at Fort Bragg...

642
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,120
...who could find whatever
you needed found.

643
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,240
It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world...

644
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,040
...without leaving his room.

645
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,400
As Bill said:

646
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,720
the Force truly was strong
with this one.

647
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,600
Lyn?

648
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Don't worry, Bob.
We're not gonna get in that truck.

649
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,520
You don't want us.

650
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,360
You don't want us!

651
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,520
Put your weapon away.

652
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,120
Put your weapon away.

653
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,720
Bob, don't move.

654
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,120
Put your weapon away.
Bob, don't move.

655
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Bob, stay put!
Bob, stop!

656
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,160
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

657
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,320
Hold it right there.

658
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Now at the time I thought
Lyn was having some kind of fit here.

659
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,240
Later I discovered
what he was actually doing...

660
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,240
...was performing
the Echmeyer technique.

661
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,680
Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
with sixty-three confirmed kills.

662
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,240
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do.

663
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,240
It's been said he could have
a tug of war with a dozen men...

664
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,000
...and not move an inch.

665
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,800
He was also able to lift bags
of sand on hooks...

666
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,800
...hung through his scrotum.

667
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,120
He was one of the Jedi teachers
at Fort Bragg.

668
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,600
Sir, what is the practical
application of this?

669
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,160
Ben caused quite a stir
by advocating his controversial...

670
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,400
..."shock and awe"
knife attack method.

671
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,920
The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary

672
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,400
but criticized by others who believed
that the leaping and spinning...

673
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,400
...might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself.

674
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,040
Lyn Cassady, however,
became a firm convert to the style.

675
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,960
Of course, Lyn didn't actually have
a knife with him at this particular time.

676
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,640
So, I still think that
what he did was kind of...

677
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,920
...reckless.

678
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,800
Throw your hands up!

679
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,640
You idiot.

680
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,360
Shit! Shit!
They are not coming!

681
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,520
We're okay. We're okay.
They're not coming! We'll be alright.

682
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,720
Oh, shit!

683
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,040
There he is.

684
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,880
Sir, it's okay!
We're Americans.

685
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
We're here to help you!

686
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,160
Sir!?

687
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,480
Sir, will you...

688
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,840
Oh, crap!

689
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,080
- What happened? What happened?
- I think I just ran him over.

690
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,480
Sir?

691
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,160
Are you alright, sir?

692
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,520
Bob, give me a hand.

693
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,560
Come on! Help him up!
Get him up here!

694
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,880
Bring him up!
Bring him up!

695
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,080
Shit! Shit!
Who is that?

696
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,960
Don't move!

697
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,440
Let's see your hands!
Now!

698
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,880
Todd Nixon,
Army small business office.

699
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,880
Mahmud Daash.

700
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,360
Ask me what business I'm in,
Muhammad.

701
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,320
Mahmud.
What business are you in, sir?

702
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,520
Right now, I'm in the
quality of life business.

703
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,320
We've got over 25 million Iraqis out
here who wanna be independent,

704
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,120
...wanna make something
for themselves.

705
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,680
More than anything else
they wanna buy stuff.

706
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,080
Cell phones, digital cameras,
leisure suits... you name it.

707
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,840
If it sells in Boston,
we can damn well sell it in Baghdad.

708
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,120
Am I right, Muhammad?

709
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,000
He knows what I'm talking about.

710
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,880
We've got Halliburton, Parsons,
Perini... just in the primes.

711
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,360
We're gonna have McDonald's,
we're gonna have Starbucks...

712
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,480
No corporate tax.
It's gonna be a gold rush.

713
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,560
Oh, and by the way, fuck the French!
Did you hear that shit?

714
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,920
Chirac wants to bring
French contractors in?

715
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,920
Hey, Phil, what's the most common
French expression?

716
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,520
"I give up. "

717
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,480
That's fucking funny.
Year zero, guys. Year zero.

718
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,360
Okay, we're in Indian country now.
Check your six.

719
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,520
We've got a line of cars
at the gas station here.

720
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,680
You guys wanna wait?

721
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,800
Negative.
We're too exposed.

722
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,760
We're taking the station.
Go in fangs out!

723
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,320
Secure the perimeter!

724
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,000
- Give her the go-juice, Eddy!
- I filled her up last time.

725
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,560
- That's bullshit.
- He did fill her up last time, Gary.

726
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,880
With all due respect, sir,
bull-fucking-shit. I tanked her last time.

727
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,880
- Bullshit!
- Every time!

728
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,440
Can we figure out
some kind of fucking system!?

729
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,320
Contact! Contact!
We've got contact!

730
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,560
Where is the shooter?

731
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,320
And what became known
as the Battle of Ramadi,

732
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,200
twelve people were injured.
Mostly locals.

733
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,840
Both security companies claimed...

734
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,600
...they had been fired upon
first by Iraqis.

735
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,920
Of course, it was later
revealed that...

736
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,280
...they had actually
fired upon each other.

737
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,840
One down!

738
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,440
My house is not far.
We could walk from here.

739
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,800
- Sounds good, Muhammad.
- Mahmud.

740
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,320
As we ran for cover,
I thought this was what I wanted.

741
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,120
I was on a mission,

742
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
...even if I didn't know
what kind of mission it was.

743
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,920
But I could hear
the little man inside me again.

744
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,400
He was screaming
like a little girl.

745
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,920
Krom One! Krom One!
This is Freedom Frontier.

746
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,840
We are under attack.

747
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,840
This is fucking fubar!

748
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,880
Muhammad led us
to his home...

749
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,840
...which as it turned out
had been robbed in his absence.

750
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,440
And also, accidentally
shot up in a fire fight.

751
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,040
Neighbors told him that
his wife had left,

752
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
...they weren't sure
where she had gone.

753
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,600
I'm very sorry
for running you over, sir.

754
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,200
It was an accident.

755
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,520
And I apologize for that
security detachment.

756
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't want you to think that
all Americans are like that.

757
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,200
I apologize for the kidnappers.

758
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,720
Not your fault, sir.

759
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,720
I mean, we've
kidnappers in America and...

760
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,040
There's always... bad apples.

761
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,960
Lyn? Are you awake?

762
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,640
I was just...
thinking about Mahmud.

763
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,640
They're just trying to do
something with their lives.

764
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,360
Something... lasting, good.

765
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,840
But there's always somebody
who wants to smash it up.

766
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,320
What Lyn was really thinking
about was Larry Hooper.

767
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,880
And the part he had played in the
destruction of the New Earth Army.

768
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,480
But, in fairness,
the Jedi's own eccentricities...

769
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,040
...hadn't exactly won
them many allies.

770
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,320
For example,
there was Tim Kootz,

771
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,600
who, on being asked to ascertain
the whereabouts of...

772
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,800
...General Manuel
Noriega, had replied,

773
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,320
- Ask Angela Lansbury.
- Say again, Tim?

774
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,080
Ask Angela Lansbury.

775
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,640
Excellent. Excellent.

776
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,560
We asked Angela Lansbury.

777
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,480
And?

778
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,960
She said she didn't know
where General Noriega was.

779
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Or there was the time Major
General Gilling was visiting the base.

780
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
And saw Jedi trainee
Clifford Hickox...

781
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,960
...practicing the ancient Sun
Dance of the Sioux Nation.

782
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,200
The Jedi's survived
such minor scandals,

783
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,560
...protected, it was rumored,
by President Reagan.

784
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,480
Who was a fan of both
the Star Wars films...

785
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,720
...and the paranormal himself.

786
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,360
But then, one summer,
a young, likable Lieutenant...

787
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,920
...named Norman Pendleton was
recruited to the New Earth Army.

788
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,280
Desperate to compete with Lyn,

789
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:11,320
Larry had been doing research into
the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments

790
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,880
...which he believed could enhance
his own psychic powers.

791
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,560
All he needed was a lab rat
to try them out on.

792
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,520
To check if they were safe.

793
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,680
It turned out they weren't.

794
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,520
Run! Run!

795
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,440
Bullshit!

796
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,240
Norm?

797
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,480
Norm.

798
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,800
Give me the gun.

799
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,720
Norm’s father,
who had turned out...

800
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,880
...was pretty high up in the
Pentagon, wanted blood.

801
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,800
Although the Jedi's were pretty
sure Larry was responsible,

802
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,280
...nothing could be proved.

803
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,520
And when he was called to
testify at the disciplinary hearing,

804
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,280
...Larry made sure to smear Bill
with everything he could.

805
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,440
Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds
from the project's black budget...

806
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,280
- to procure prostitutes...
- That's a lie!

807
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,520
...and to get drugs for himself
and his men.

808
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,080
That...

809
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,720
Well, the hooker thing is
definitely a lie.

810
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,160
Brigadier General Hopgood resigned
and died some years later.

811
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,120
Bill received a dishonorable discharge.

812
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,480
Continue the work, Lyn.

813
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
The World needs the Jedi's, now,
more than ever.

814
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,160
After Bill left,

815
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,960
Major Holtz of Special Forces
took command of the Jedi's.

816
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
He didn't think much of Bill's
unconventional training techniques...

817
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,160
...and he's about to
make some changes.

818
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,600
Nothing was ever the same again.

819
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,640
I really appreciate this, sir.

820
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,400
Jesus!
We could have bought a map.

821
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,520
Bedouins have been navigating
this desert for centuries...

822
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,960
...without a map.

823
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,280
You can use a wristwatch in
conjunction with the sun.

824
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,480
Well?

825
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,960
- Well, what?
- Well, use your wristwatch.

826
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,480
I haven't got a wristwatch.

827
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh, for the love of...

828
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,880
Here.

829
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,480
What?

830
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,400
- It's digital.
- So?

831
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,120
You need a watch with hands.

832
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,760
How am I supposed to know?
You're the navigation expert.

833
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,280
You're the one who said
you could...

834
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,440
...find a way.

835
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,600
- I'll, if you'd just be quiet...
- Turns out you haven't even got a watch!

836
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,600
- I don't need a watch.
- How the hell we'll get of here?

837
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,160
I'm using Level Two.

838
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,400
- What is that?
- Level Two. Intuition.

839
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,160
We were trained to make
correct decisions.

840
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,320
Somebody runs up to you...

841
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,400
...and they say
"There's a fork in the road. "

842
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,520
Do we go left or do we go right?
And you go...

843
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,320
"We go right!"

844
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,400
- What? Just instant?
- Instant. Just like that.

845
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,080
We've been sitting here for half an hour.
How's that "instant?"

846
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,080
- Oh, it's this way?
- Yeah.

847
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,800
Oh, now you know.

848
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,880
Hang on.

849
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,000
What happened?

850
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,080
- IED.
- What?

851
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,000
- Improvised Explosive Device.
- Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

852
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,120
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

853
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
I can't believe it.

854
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,000
Great fucking intuition, Lyn.

855
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,800
I can't... put me down.
I can walk.

856
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,040
Oh, Jesus!

857
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,680
I think I may be
bleeding to death.

858
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,080
You're not bleeding to death.
You're in shock.

859
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,440
It's a shock.

860
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,360
It's hot.
I'm so hot.

861
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,400
- Aren't you hot?
- Bob?

862
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,760
It's really important
you keep your mouth closed.

863
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,280
You can lose a lot of water
through an open mouth.

864
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,800
If we'd only stayed with the car
then...

865
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,880
...we would be alright now.

866
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,400
- Now we've no water, no...
- You're gonna be okay.

867
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,120
Would you stop saying that?
I've been...

868
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,960
I've been got blown up!
I'm in the middle of a desert!

869
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,960
- I'm not gonna be okay.
- Bob, you're in shock.

870
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,560
If you panic,
your heart's gonna stop.

871
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,680
Is that supposed to calm me down?

872
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,520
Wait a minute.

873
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,400
This is west.

874
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,960
Al Qaim is the other way.
We're going the wrong way.

875
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,520
Al Qaim isn't the mission.
We're going near Al Qaim.

876
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,160
Where?

877
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,160
- I don't know.
- What?

878
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Is that a joke?
This is a joke, right?

879
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,520
We've come 600 miles and
you don't know where we're going?

880
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
If the exact whereabouts of the
target was known...

881
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,320
...it wouldn't take a Jedi
to find them, would it?

882
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
Who gave you the mission, Lyn?

883
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,680
- Bill did it.
- What?

884
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,080
Bill... He appeared in my
trailer two months ago.

885
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,120
A psychic projection.

886
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,800
- He called out my name.
- Oh, Jesus!

887
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,920
Lyn, there is no mission.

888
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,760
We're in the middle of the fucking desert
because you heard voices?

889
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,240
There's no one here!
There's no one fucking here!

890
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,480
When the dust of Bill's discharge
has settled...

891
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,040
...it revealed a surprising victor.

892
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,520
What you've for me, sergeant?

893
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,880
This is a scientific report
I've done...

894
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,800
...on possible offensive
psi application, sir.

895
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,720
I showed it to Lieutenant Colonel Django,
but he didn't seem interested.

896
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,000
No, I bet he wasn't.

897
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,400
We have men who can do this?

898
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,480
I can think of one, sir.

899
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,160
But we don't have the resources.

900
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,320
Well, sir...

901
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
...there is the goat lab.

902
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,040
Just 80 yards from Major Holtz's
office was an abandoned hospital.

903
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,400
Most of the soldiers
who lived and worked in Fort Bragg

904
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,960
...had no idea about the
actual function of this building.

905
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,080
Because,
although it was abandoned,

906
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,400
...the hospital was not empty.

907
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,800
The goats have been secretly flown in
from Central America to avoid customs.

908
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,040
Special forces weren't worried about
regular soldiers hearing the goats...

909
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,160
...because they'd been de-bleated.

910
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,280
Goat Lab was originally created
as a secret laboratory,

911
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,440
...to provide in-the-field surgical
training for Special Forces soldiers.

912
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,040
The goats would get shot
in the leg with a bolt gun...

913
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,360
...and then a trainee would have
to dress the wound successfully.

914
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,120
Goat lab actually used to be
called Dog Lab.

915
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,920
But it turned out most soldiers didn't
feel good shooting dogs in the leg.

916
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,840
The army, though, had long felt
fine about doing stuff to goats.

917
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,640
Even testing atomic weapons
on them.

918
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,480
It's gone, Bob.

919
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,480
What?

920
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,200
I can't find him.

921
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,480
I've lost my powers.

922
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,600
It's a curse.

923
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,800
What curse?

924
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,120
They took this, beautiful thing
that we've been building...

925
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,680
...and they destroyed the
New Earth Army.

926
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,480
Who destroyed it?

927
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,560
I did.

928
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,400
Hooper and Holtz wanted me
to do an experiment.

929
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,560
They wanted me to
stop the heart of a goat.

930
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,160
What had the goat ever done to me?

931
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,080
It was completely against
the way of the Jedi.

932
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,520
I was just gonna pretend to try...

933
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,320
...so that they can see it wouldn't work
and they can forget about it.

934
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,000
Then, as I sat there...

935
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,040
I felt this... pulse

936
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,640
...inside me.
I couldn't stop it.

937
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,280
Maybe deep down inside...

938
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,320
...some dark part of me
wanted to see if I could do it?

939
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,480
Holy shit!

940
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,800
That was it.
I'd used my powers for evil and...

941
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,640
...as if I brought a curse
on us all.

942
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,320
It's like that poem where...

943
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,560
...the guy kills the seagull and they
make him wear it round his neck.

944
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,520
Every night I'd dream of that goat.

945
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,480
It's mouth opening and closing
without making a sound.

946
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,040
The silence of the goats.

947
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,320
I finished my tour and I quit.
I walked out.

948
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,520
I never went back.

949
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,040
But before he could leave,

950
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,840
Larry arranged one last parting gift.

951
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,880
What do you...?

952
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,000
It was the Dim Mak.

953
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,160
- The Dim Mak?
- The Dim Mak.

954
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,760
The Quivering Palm.

955
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,960
The Death Touch.

956
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,160
It's forbidden in the New Earth Army.

957
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,280
What does the Death Touch do?

958
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,360
It kills you, Bob.

959
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,920
- With one touch.
- Jesus!

960
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,720
There's a story that Wong Wifu,
the great Chinese martial artist,

961
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,280
...had a fight with a guy
and beat him.

962
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,880
Then the guy gave him
this light tap.

963
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,040
Wong looked at him
and the guy just nodded.

964
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,680
That was it.

965
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,080
He had given him the death touch.

966
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,120
Wong died.

967
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,240
Then and there?

968
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,960
No.

969
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,080
About eighteen years later.

970
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,560
That's the thing about Dim Mak...

971
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,920
...you never know
when it's gonna take effect.

972
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,440
In a funny kind of way
I admired Lyn then.

973
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,960
He believed in something
so much...

974
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,320
...he thought he could
really die from it.

975
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,760
That's what I've been looking
for all along.

976
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,560
Something to believe in.

977
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,160
Something to give meaning
to my life.

978
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,600
So I had fallen for
Lyn's crazy stories.

979
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,560
So I'd followed him
out into the desert.

980
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,040
Look! Look!

981
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,400
Come on! Come on!

982
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,400
These are friendly competitions
held between members of the camp.

983
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,200
When you think this sorta things for kids,
you better think again.

984
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,280
Lyn?

985
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,360
Lyn? Where are you going?

986
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,320
Lyn?

987
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,080
Hello, Bill.

988
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,120
Hello, Lyn.

989
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,520
This is Bob.

990
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,640
Hello, Bob.

991
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,040
Hello.

992
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,400
Oh, good.

993
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,560
The gang's all here.

994
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,840
This is primarily a Psyops base.

995
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,880
- Psy for psychic, right?
- Psy for psychological.

996
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,800
The irony isn't wasted on me.

997
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,320
Radio broadcasts, leaflets,
things like that.

998
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,320
Oh, here's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
they dropped on us.

999
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,520
"American soldier...

1000
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,600
...your wives are back at home...

1001
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,640
...having sex with Bart Simpson
and Bert Reynolds. "

1002
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,400
Yeah, didn't exactly done their
homework there.

1003
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,160
How did you find us, Lyn?

1004
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,480
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

1005
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,920
If this is Psyops base,
what are you doing here?

1006
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,560
I said it was primarily Psyops.

1007
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,880
There are individuals in the
current administration...

1008
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,760
...who're looking for creative solutions
to the war on terror.

1009
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,280
They're far more open minded
than their predecessors,

1010
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,720
...and they've outsourced
experimental research to my company.

1011
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,360
"Sick?"

1012
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,160
It's pronounced psi-ike.

1013
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:35,000
Psychic Systems International Corp.
"PSIC".

1014
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,840
It turns out certain people had
heard about the New Earth Army.

1015
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,240
They were very interested in some
of the work we were doing back then.

1016
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,800
They got a hold on me,
I got a hold on Bill.

1017
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,840
Bill works for you?

1018
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,160
Bill's looking into
subliminal messaging.

1019
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,480
This is the one we've designed...

1020
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,880
...to play to our own troops
before going into combat.

1021
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,480
Push "play" on that.

1022
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,000
There's a subliminal message in this?

1023
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,120
This one's called...

1024
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,040
"Don't get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns. "

1025
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,680
We've got all sorts of new ideas
and development.

1026
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,080
Give them one of our new ideas.

1027
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,800
- Air bag mine?
- Air bag mine.

1028
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,120
Non-lethal.

1029
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,680
Catapults the fucker right into the air.
Gimme another one.

1030
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,240
Blast target with pheromones and
then release attack bees.

1031
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,200
Excellent. Attack bees.
The forces of nature!

1032
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,800
- Another.
- Project Achilles.

1033
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,320
- We mutilate enemy corpses...
- We're not doing that anymore! You idiot!

1034
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,200
The point is... we've got a budget,
we've got supporters.

1035
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,840
I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army.

1036
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,680
Only this time without
all that hippie crap.

1037
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,440
- How you're doing there, Bill?
- Gonna get some ice-cream.

1038
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,600
You get the occasional flash of
what he used to be but...

1039
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,000
...he's pretty burnt out
on the booze.

1040
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Still, he's the best.
Oh, twizzlers.

1041
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,640
- You want one?
- No.

1042
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,320
God, I love these things.

1043
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,160
What? What is it?

1044
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,800
It's the Dark Side.

1045
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,520
Lyn, what you're gonna do?

1046
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,760
It's too late...

1047
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,360
- I'm dying, Bob.
- No, you're not gonna die.

1048
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,480
I don't believe
you can be killed by...

1049
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,000
- by mail order, Dim Sum, or...
- Dim Mak.

1050
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,280
Dim Mak. Whatever.
You can't just be tapped in the shoulder

1051
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,960
It's cancer.

1052
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,360
What?

1053
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,760
All I know it's the Dim Mak
that caused it.

1054
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,240
It's cancer.

1055
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,600
At least that's what the doctors said.

1056
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,760
It's different ways
of looking at...

1057
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,360
Different names for a reality.

1058
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,200
Give that to Bill.

1059
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,880
I don't deserve it.

1060
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,280
Take it.

1061
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,440
It wasn't the Dim Mak
that was killing Lyn.

1062
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,440
And it wasn't the cancer.

1063
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,880
He was dying of a broken heart.

1064
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,480
And maybe, the cancer as well.

1065
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,600
His mission had failed.

1066
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,640
And failure was something
I knew too much about.

1067
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,640
Bill?

1068
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,360
Lyn told me he didn't deserve
this eagle feather.

1069
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,640
He wanted me to
give it back to you.

1070
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,240
- It's fake.
- What?

1071
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,720
Twenty thousand dollar fine
for taking an eagle feather.

1072
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,880
This one's off a turkey.

1073
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,520
You just die the tip black.

1074
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,400
Don't tell Lyn.

1075
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,760
It isn't real.

1076
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,240
None of it was real.

1077
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,640
Lyn told me about the curse.

1078
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,520
That by killing the goat,
he put a curse on all of you.

1079
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,480
What's Larry gonna do
with these goats?

1080
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,880
Do you believe in redemption, Bill?

1081
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,720
Sorry.
Didn’t mean to wake you.

1082
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,320
How did you find it?

1083
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,200
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

1084
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,200
Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?

1085
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,440
Yeah, he did.

1086
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,320
We told Scotty
we were coming over here,

1087
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,280
...asked him
if he wanted some work.

1088
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,280
I haven't seen Scotty.

1089
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,960
That's funny, because he told me
he'd run into you and mentioned that

1090
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,560
...there might be some jobs
going over with.

1091
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,600
Isn't that why you came,
really, Lyn?

1092
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,440
You want back in, don't you?

1093
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,560
It can happen.

1094
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,640
You've only got to say the word.

1095
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,280
This could be the new Golden Age
for psi research.

1096
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,600
You, me and Bill,
back together again.

1097
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,600
Like the old days.

1098
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,000
You don't have to make a
decision now.

1099
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,920
Tell me in the morning.

1100
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,600
Mother Earth,
you're my life support system.

1101
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,520
As a soldier
I must drink your blue water,

1102
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,920
...live inside your red clay
and eat your green skin.

1103
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,040
Help me to balance myself.

1104
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,400
As you hold in balance,
the Earth, the sea,

1105
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,520
...and the space environments.

1106
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,640
Help me to open my heart...

1107
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,360
...knowing that
the Universe will feed me.

1108
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,800
I pray my boots
will always kiss your face...

1109
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,800
...and my footsteps match
your heartbeat.

1110
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,240
Carry my body through
space and time.

1111
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,600
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

1112
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,200
I'm yours and you are mine.

1113
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,440
I salute you.

1114
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,680
I salute you.

1115
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:23,960
Bill?

1116
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,840
Bill! Bill?

1117
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,720
Bill? Are you okay?

1118
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,360
I just saw Timothy Leary.

1119
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,400
Timothy Leary is dead.

1120
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,000
I know.

1121
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,720
He'd got an idea.

1122
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,280
Good evening, gentlemen.

1123
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,760
Gonna get some ice-cream.

1124
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,840
Don't eat the eggs.

1125
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
- What?
- Don't eat the eggs.

1126
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,280
What's going on?

1127
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,840
We put LSD in the eggs.

1128
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,920
Bill showed me where Larry
had some bottles of LSD and...

1129
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,360
We put some in the
powdered eggs last night.

1130
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,280
And in the water.

1131
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,640
What?

1132
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,240
I put it in the main water tank
as well.

1133
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,320
But we drank the water.

1134
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,040
Yeah.

1135
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,400
Right. Hold on.

1136
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,040
The weather today is gonna be...

1137
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,960
...hot.

1138
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,920
I mean, yeah,
I'm guessing that.

1139
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,640
I really didn't looked
at the thing but...

1140
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,320
...I'd say it's gonna be
fucking hot out here!

1141
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,200
Yeah. What else?

1142
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,960
I mean, it's a fucking shocker, right?
It's gonna be hot again.

1143
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,360
It would have been a good idea
if we hadn't drunk the fucking water?

1144
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,280
Well, that might have aroused suspicion.

1145
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,760
But don't worry.
Over the years,

1146
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,200
I've built up a massive tolerance
to all narcotics.

1147
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:47,000
You're going to hit the gates!
You're going to hit the gates!

1148
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,640
That's cool!
You missed it!

1149
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,880
In the name of the New Earth Army
and loving people everywhere,

1150
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,320
...I'm liberating you!

1151
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,640
I'm liberating this base!

1152
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,160
Come on!
Go! Go!

1153
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,720
Come on! Move!
Move on! Come on!

1154
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,040
Put the gun down, Larry.

1155
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,520
No!

1156
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,960
Wow, I'm really hungry.

1157
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,760
- Come on!
- Let's go! Come on!

1158
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,880
Come with me!

1159
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,840
Don't worry about this guards.

1160
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,080
Be free!

1161
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,360
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me!

1162
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,280
Where are you going?
What about the mission?

1163
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,200
You are the mission, Bob!

1164
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,240
Tell them what happened.
Tell everybody what happened.

1165
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,840
It's your job now.

1166
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,920
At the time I was hurt that
Lyn hadn't taken me with him.

1167
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,960
But now I know,

1168
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,400
...it was because he and Bill
had already seen what was to come.

1169
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,640
Nobody exactly knows
what happened.

1170
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,160
The official story is that
their helicopter must have crashed,

1171
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,440
...either because they were hit
by an RPG or because...

1172
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,400
Well, that's what happens...

1173
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,560
...when you fly a helicopter
while you're tripping on acid.

1174
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,920
All I know is that
they've never been seen since.

1175
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Like all Shaman,
they returned to the sky.

1176
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,800
When I got back,
I wrote the story up.

1177
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,120
Everything.

1178
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,120
Lyn had handed a mission on
to me and I'd see through it.

1179
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,720
I would tell everyone
what happened.

1180
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,760
I understood now that...

1181
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,560
...Debora and I weren’t
meant to be together and...

1182
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,400
...I was at peace with that.

1183
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,920
It wasn't in my destiny to return
to the life I had before.

1184
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,520
The Universe has other plans for me.

1185
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,360
I sent the story to the newspapers
and TV stations.

1186
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,040
I didn't care what the authorities
did to me.

1187
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,520
I was ready to go to prison
as long as the truth came out.

1188
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,040
But they didn't put me in prison.

1189
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,760
They did something much worse.

1190
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,560
...unusual tool to break
the resistance of Iraqi POWs

1191
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,640
...and trust me,
a lot of parents would agree!

1192
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,480
Some prisoners are being forced
to listen to Barney...

1193
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,600
...the Purple Dinosaur
sing the "I Love You song",

1194
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,360
...for twenty four straight hours.

1195
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,600
And that was it.

1196
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,560
That was the only bit of my story
that ran anywhere.

1197
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,680
And it was a joke.

1198
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,160
And if I ever needed proof
of how the Dark Side have...

1199
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,600
...taken the beautiful dream
of what a nation could be...

1200
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,760
...and had twisted it,
destroyed it.

1201
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,440
Well, that was it.

1202
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,320
But I won't stop.
I won't give up.

1203
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,720
Because when I look at what is
happening in the world,

1204
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,360
I know that now,

1205
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,440
more than ever,

1206
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,600
...we need to be
all that we can be.

1207
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,760
Bob?

1208
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,000
Now, more than ever,

1209
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,600
...we need the Jedi.

1210
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,560
