00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,440
[Man] Welcome to the
oven, aka Camp Carolina:

2
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,320
our home away from home
in this godforsaken country.

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,960
What I can't convey,
via this video journal

4
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,440
is the incredible heat
and the local smells.

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
Oh, my God, it stinks.
[chuckles]

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Yo, Mustangs!
Yo!

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
On 3, give me a smile!

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
1, 2, 3!

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,480
[shutter clicks]

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,840
But let me introduce myself.
My name is Angel Salazar.

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Private Salazar.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm that poor Latino filmmaker

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
that did not get into USC.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Hey! Papi Chulo, what's
goin' on over here, man?

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>Ai! Qué chulo!
Enter McCoy.</i>

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>Hace calor!</i>

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm tryin' to make a video.
Oh, yeah? Tryin' to make--

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,200
You know what just happened
to your video? Yeah?

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
Just got a whole hell of a
lot sexier, baby. [laughs]

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, it did. Sexy is here.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
Making a video of me
making a video of you.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Yeah, yeah. You're making a
video of me making a video of you.

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Uh-huh. Why is that?
Getting it all down

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,440
because this might be the last
video that either of us makes.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,920
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's make a deal, then.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,840
You and me. Seriously.
All right.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,000
If I die in this war, I want you
to get all my videos, all right?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Okay. And if you die in this war,

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,520
I'll get your videos,
your camera,

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
and your girlfriend's
phone number.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
My girlfriend's number?

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Yeah, your girlfriend's
phone number.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
What's Mrs. McCoy going
to be saying about that?

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
This is my brother.
Come on, man.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
All right, that's a deal.
Who do you think I am?

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
That's a deal. You know
what I like about you, Sally?

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
Yeah?
Besides absolutely nothing?

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Absolutely nothing. And your
sweet and sunny disposition.

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,320
No, no, no. It's not about
sunny disposition, McCoy.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
It's about
telling it how it is.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Oh, is that what it's about?

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
It's about telling it
how it is.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
You want to hear telling it--
Hey, hey! Hey!

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Over here, over here.
Please.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Focus on what's beautiful.
Thank you.

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Do you want to hear me
telling it how it is?

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,880
Y'all want to hear
telling it how it is?

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
What do you all think's
gonna be the first casualty

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
of this entire conflict, huh?
[Man] You.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,480
That's right!

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
It's not going to be
Rush or Flake

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,040
or "Don't ask, don't tell"
over here.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,400
You know what it's gonna be?
[Men] What?

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,880
Do you know what it's
going to be? Talk to me!

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
You know what it's gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
It's gonna be the truth.
[groaning]

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Come on, now. Just
tellin' it like it is.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
You suck! What are you talking about?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Ah, here endeth the lesson.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,000
[laughs] That was some sad,
depressing stuff right there.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
All right, let me finish.
Let me finish.

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,440
All right. So I joined up
to get the money for college,

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
and a better chance
at film school. Yeah.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,240
I mean, I'm going to be a combat
vet, for chrissakes, right?

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,520
And with this awesome war film
in hand, they got to take me.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Oh, yeah.
So while I'm over here,

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm gonna be shootin'
whatev-- [squeaks]

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
...whatever the fuck goes on.
[laughing]

70
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
Which so far-- Get--

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,600
Which so far
is basically nothing.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Now, our squad mans
a checkpoint outside Samarra.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,160
It's all day long
in the boiling hot sun,

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
wearing 120 pounds of gear,

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
checking out cars for
weapons and bombs and shit?

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,480
This deployment is
unspeakably underwhelming.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
The only insurgent
we found so far

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,520
is one big fuckin' rat we
chased out of here last night.

79
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, that rat died.
So, get-- Get off.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
'Cause I fucked it
to death.

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,840
So don't be expecting
any Hollywood action flick.

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
It's not going
to be smash cuts,

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,240
no adrenaline-pumping
soundtrack,

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,680
no logical narrative to
help you make sense of it.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Basically, here,
shit happens.

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,560
[Woman speaking French]

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,000
[Boy]
You want soda?

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
No. No.

89
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I scored some
for one M.R.E.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,520
Just go.

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Go on. Get out
of here. Go on.

92

He doesn't let up.

[Woman narrating]

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
[American soldier] As you
see, we set up road signs.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
They're vividly colored,
highly visible,

97
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
and impossible to miss.

98
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,240
They're written
in English and Arabic,

99
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,920
and they inform
every single driver

100
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,680
that they're entering
a checkpoint.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,960
[Woman, in French]

102

Get out of the car.

Come up over here.

Quickly.
Let's go, people.

Go, quick!

Get in line here.

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
Right there.
That's it, that's it.

Arms down. Tell him
to open the trunk.

112
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
Open the trunk.
[Arabic]

Come on.

Come on, move.
[Arabic]

115

Don't go in. It's open, it's
open. Take your hands out of there.

Afraid of the dog?

118

Who gives a fuck?
Fuck him.

119

All right, Blix.

Good. Come here.

Come back, come back here.
In there. In there.

In. In. In, in, in.
In. In, in, in, boy.

All right, come here.

[Angel] It's all clear. All right.

[Angel] That's Gabe
Blix. He's from Virginia.

137
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,840
He doesn't talk a lot 'cause he's
got his nose in a book all the time.

138
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,720
Yo, Gabe, what you
readin' over there?

139
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm reading a book,
Salazar.

140
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,240
All right.
What's it about?

141
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,160
It's about-- Dude, no,
seriously. What are you doing?

142
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,520
What are you doing right
now? Who are you? I'm--

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
I want to get your opinion.
Okay, if you have that camera,

144
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,080
then you're part of the media,
and we're under strict orders

145
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,440
not to speak with you, yeah?
Don't call me media, asshole!

146
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Come on, just tell me what
you're reading. Tell me about it.

like commie rendition of our mission--

Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
This is about the truth, bro.

149
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
This is about what's going
down. This is the truth 24/7.

150
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,760
This camera, it never
lies. Yeah, the--

151
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,680
Dude, that is bullshit.
Okay?

152
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
'Cause that's all
that camera ever does.

153
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Just show me
the title of the book.

154

"Appoin--" Really?
All right. So, you know,

155
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,160
what's it got to say
about Samarra? Nothing.

156
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
Nothing.
No, nothing.

157
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,040
It's about this, like, guy,
he's this country club guy,

158
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,280
and he gets really drunk
on Christmas Eve,

159
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,160
and he throws his drink
in his boss' face.

160
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,120
And everybody in the whole
city that he lives in,

161
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
like right outside
of Philadelphia--

162
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,160
Okay, but what's it
got to do with Samarra?

163
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,280
It-- Nothing. The opening
makes reference to Samarra,

164
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,360
but besides that, you know, it's
just like, classic cover situation

165
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
What? Don't judge a book by its cover.

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Right.
Basically.

167
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,240
All right. So, uh--
Whoa, when's the appointment?

168
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
You don't want to know.
I do want to know!

169
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
Dude, you don't-- This is about books!
I don't have anything about books.

170
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
This is literary.
This is good.

171
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,440
The appointment, uh-- Do you want
me to just read you the introduction?

172
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,280
Perfect. Perfect.
Give me something good.

173
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,640
Okay, let me find it.

174
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,280
The introduction's
actually not by John O'Hara.

175
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,240
It's by W. Somerset Maugham.
Perfect.

176
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
And-- You have no idea
who that is, do you?

177
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Not at all.
Didn't think so. Okay.

178
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,800
<i>It's called Death Speaks.
Oh, wait, it's spooky?</i>

179
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
All right. Read that
right into the camera. Go.

180
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,640
All right."There was
a merchant in Baghdad,

181

to market to buy--"

182
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,080
All right, Gabe, wait.
Before you start reading that,

183
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,880
once you get into it, think
about what you're gonna say,

184
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,000
and then put some like,
you know, some heart behind it.

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Go!

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,280

Yeah, this is a little bit
boring, bro. This is like--

had to serve time here or stateside?

Yeah.

Fuckin' Roger that, man.

Oh, but the truth be told?
Truth be told, Flake.

308
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,720
Truth be told. Truth is, it wasn't
everything it's cracked up to be.

309
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
I mean, I thought my first
kill shot would blow my mind,

310
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,560
[imitates shot]
but--

311
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,080
It was nothing.
It was like guttin' catfish.

312
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
Yo. Sarge, you waved
that guy to stop, right,

313
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
<i>that hajji retard?</i>

314
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,960
Oh, yeah. This guy, uh--

315
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,280
Yeah, but the problem is that
most of these fuckin' people,

316
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,360
you know, when you put
your hand up?

317
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,000
They don't know that
that means to stop.

318
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,920
You know, most of these Iraqis
think that you're wavin' hello.

319
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,760
[Rush] But they fuckin' know what
it means now. All I know is...

320
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
these cats screamed
their heads off,

321
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760

lady lungs out,

you screamed your beaucoup
brains off-- Ha ha.

323

And that car just kept comin',
right across that trigger line.

324
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,960
What the fuck else am I
supposed to do but light 'em up?

325
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,240
Light 'em the fuck up.
You did your job.

326
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,320
All right.
But, you know, Flake,

327
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,120

many hearts and minds

Come on. Salazar.

330
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,080

Get all teary-eyed and say I'm sorry?

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,160
[Sally] So Flake--
It's the next fuckin' shipment.

342
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Flake, there's no remorse, now
that you know that she's pregnant?

343
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,600
Now that you know that she had
a child in her womb over there?

344
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,680
Nothin'?

345
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,240
You really have
no remorse.

346
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,960
I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to--

347
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,680
How am I supposed to--
You have no second thoughts.

348
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
I have second thoughts.
Let me tell you something:

349
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,920
you have a kid, you have
a wife that's pregnant--

350
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,600
Hold up. Hold up. No, no, no, hold
up. You'll have second thoughts.

351
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,320
You can't afford remorse, okay?

352
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,960
You get remorse, you get weak. I'm
not saying you didn't do a good job.

353
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
You get weak, you die.

354
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
As simple as that.
He did his fuckin' job.

355
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
What are you saying?
You have a kid,

356
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,200
you have a pregnant wife, you
become more of a human being.

357
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,280
If you have a kid, you're gonna be
even more on your fuckin' plan then.

358
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,760
Because you can't afford-- I'm
not saying you're not on your plan.

359
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,560
...not to go home
without diapers.

360
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,400
What the hell
is wrong with you?

361
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
How do we know that
her-- the fuckin'... Hey!

How do we know if the bun
in her fuckin' oven... Hey!

363
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,920
At ease the shit, all right? Look,
point in fact, he did his job.

364
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
Rules of engagement states

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Hey! Get the fuck
away from him!

368
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,920
Sarge, how the fuck am I
supposed to see in there? How?

369
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Have a fucking heart.

370
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
Get in your fucking rack!
Enough.

371

Everybody go to bed,
all right?

372
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
Does anybody have
a fucking problem with that?

373
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
Enough.
Shut the fucking camera off!

374
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,240
[Cameraman]
All right, all right.

375

Ten-hut!

376
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,560
Okay, guys. You've all
done a tremendous job,

377
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,120
and I wanna personally thank
each and every one of you.

378
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
Colonel Ford, permission
to speak, sir?

379
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,560
Go ahead.
Thank you.

380
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
We just wanted to thank you
for your kind words, and, also,

381
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,480
there have been some rumors circulating
about a possible follow-up mission.

382
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,920
No, no, no. I haven't heard
anything about that.

383
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,840
But it does look like we have to keep
up the work here just a little longer.

384
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,800
Longer, sir?
How much longer?

385
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,520
As long as it takes, Private!
That's what you're here for!

386
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,360
Now buck the fuck up!
Yes, sir!

387
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,680
I just got orders.

388
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Second Battalion of 727
is pinned down in Baghdad.

389
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,280
They can't replace us
till someone replaces them.

390
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,200
So half a company will have to
temporarily remain here in Samarra

391
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,760
to man the checkpoints and
keep a lid on insurgent traffic.

393
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,760
You know, where the guy
has to work on his day off,

394
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,440
and all kinds
of crazy shit happens,

395
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,880
and all he keeps thinking is,

396
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh, man, I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

397
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
None of us are supposed
to be here. Fuck, man!

398
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
We're just asking
to get waxed.

399
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Dude, all I'm saying is,
they just keep saying,

400
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,640
"All right.
You're going home tomorrow."

401
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,600
And the next day,
it's the same shit.

402
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,800
You're going home tomorrow.

403
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,440
Fuckin' on and on,
week after week.

404
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,600
"You're going home tomorrow."
And we're still here, man.

405
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,680
We're like sitting ducks.

406
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,080
Take care of this,
Sergeant.

407
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,040
Fuckin' Sally, get
that camera out of my face!

408
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,880
What the fuck is your problem?
What are you bitching about?

409
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
What, because they
extended our deployment?

go home! We can't.

413

So stand the fuck up
and be a fucking man about it!

414
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240

to that appointment.

417
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520

I said, every fucking day here

You know what I think?

Hey, Flake, get over here.
Stand right here.

I can't help but think
that Rush ain't gonna make it.

475

Fuck off, Sally. ...as I
educate your boots on the ground.

Yes, Sergeant.

here yesterday?

No, Sergeant.

490

491
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,280

yesterday.

492

That's exactly my point.
So stay the fuck away from it!

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,280
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here.

605
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,280
Arms up. Arms up.
That's it.

606
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,280
Arms-- Arms up.
Arms up. Up. Arms.

607
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,080
Arms.

608
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,600
Arms!

609
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,520
Mmm.

616
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
<i>it's the first episode
of Drug Poker, baby.</i>

617
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,600
I got an idea. Why don't you
turn off the fucking camera?

618
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,800
Do you guys know how big
high-stakes poker is on TV? So what?

619
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,840
When I sell my show and you guys
become stars, you can all thank me then.

620
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,520
How about that?
Okay, yeah, we'll do that.

621
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,880
Why don't you play the
game right now? I'm playing.

622
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,800
[Rush]
You can't afford us.

623
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,360
There's no way.

624
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,120
Sally? Come on, shithead.
Are you in or out?

625
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,160
All right, all right, all right.
Don't fuck around.

I...am...

627
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,000
Wow. I'm out.
You are so out.

628
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,960
Out again.
What do you know?

629
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,480
I was out.
Show me them. Show me them.

630
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,800
I got two cards. And she's doing
the Pledge of Allegiance, I think.

631

[laughing, chattering]

632
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,480
What you got there, Reno?

633
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,680
What's you say?

634
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,000
"She's doing The Pledge
of Allegiance!"

635
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,520
Reno's doing-- doing
all right. All right.

636
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,400
Mr. Blix?
Um, she's my favorite.

637
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,320
I like her.
Oh, that is a solid choice.

638
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,440
She looks like a nice girl.
Not bad for Mrs. Blix.

639
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Mr. Mactastic? Um, is it wrong to
fall in love with the king of clubs?

If you don't ask
and you don't tell.

642
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,800
There you go.

643
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,320
All right,
out of the cards.

644
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,280
All right.
What's happening right now?

645
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
Blix, what do you need?
Blix needs, uh...

646
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,640
Blix needs three, although it's very
hard to say good-bye to the 8 of clubs.

647
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,120
Oh, yes, I'm sure it is.
No, check her out.

648
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,480
Freakie boy.

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,000
One.

650
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
Are the cards thirsty or
something? I want four.

651
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,200
Ooh.
I'm thirsty.

652
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
[laughing]
What?

653
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,840
Did you just say you need four?
Yeah. What's the big fucking deal?

654
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,640
No, it's just--
it's perfect Rush strategy.

655
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,400
Do you even have
an ace, dude?

656
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,160
I have an ace,
and I boned her.

[laughter]

658
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,160
We gotta go back
to that house.

659
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,840
What are you talking about?
What house?

660
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,600
That house we raided last week.

661
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,320
I didn't see any orders
about that.

662
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,480
Dude, we're going to Farah's.

663
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,800
Farah's house. That's right. [grunting]

664
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,200
What are you guys talking about?
That's not... We just...

665
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,240
There's nothing
in that house.

666
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,240
How can you say that
that tasty skank is nothing?

667
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,760
Come on, dude. We're gonna take
some initiative and go to that house.

668
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,360
She's a spoil of war.
That's right.

669
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,040
Oh, I forgot.
That's exactly right.

670
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Okay, you guys
are fucking crazy.

671
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,240
Come on. They're drunk.
Dude, we're all drunk.

672
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,600
Turn that fucking thing
off.

673
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
No, keep that
fucking thing on.

674
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,000
Fuck off! This is off the record,
so turn the fucking camera off!

675
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Back off. All right,
all right. Keep it on!

676
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,680
Fuck off!
Guys, relax.

677
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Let's just play the game. You guys are
really drunk, as I was saying before.

678
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
So I actually think maybe... I'm
seeing things clearer than you.

679
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,640
No, you're not seeing
anything clearer, Flake.

680
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,680
Flake, you haven't seen anything
clear in, like, four months.

681
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,200
Stop it!
Who doesn't see clear?

682
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
How the fuck am I
supposed to see clearly?

683
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,840
[chuckles]

684
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,840
I mean,
what are we doing here?

685
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,200
"What are we doing here?" Yeah,
what the fuck are we doing here?

686
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,640
You know
what we're doing here.

687
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,120
We're helping the new
Iraqi government survive.

688
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,600
Knuckleheads.

689
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,960
And what the fuck
do you think

690
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
is so important about that?

691
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
I think there's a lot
important about that.

692
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Enlighten me.
We're, you know-- We're--

693
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,960
What?
We're just doing our job.

694
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,120
We're not-- We're not
supposed to think about it.

695
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,840
We're supposed to follow
orders. We're soldiers. Amen.

696
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,200
Yeah.
Welcome to the fucking Army.

697
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,120
But these people
don't want us here.

698
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,640
Yes, they do. No, they don't.
They want us dead and gone.

699
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,680
And when those fucking beltway clerks
finally find that out, we're gonna be both.

700
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,680
So, in the meantime,
Rush and me

701
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,160
and...Gabriel... I have
to say shut the fuck up.

702
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,880
Get away from me,
because I'm not doing...

703
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
You're such a pussy! I'm not a pussy because
I don't wanna break through the door...

704
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,880
Oh, no, the door's
already broken down.

705
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,160
The door's already broken down.
The father's locked up.

706
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,320
What's the problem? Nothing
to worry about. Let's do it.

707
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,000
Sounds like the perfect
cap on the evening. I agree.

708
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah, perfect cap on the evening.
I'm gonna go wake up Sarge.

709
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,600
I'm gonna ask him what the SOP is on
a gang rape. You're not gonna say shit!

710
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,480
Don't wake up Sarge for this.
I'm not gonna say shit?

711
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,720
No, you're not gonna say shit. You
know why Sarge is finding out shit?

712
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,560
Why?
Because nothing's gonna happen,

713
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,720
because you guys couldn't even get
outside the wire if you wanted to.

714
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,160
Get your fucking hands off me!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out. Cut it out.

715
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,920
That's bullshit!
Sit down, sit down.

716
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,560
If you can find your chair.
Got it.

717
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,360
All right. Can we
play the fucking game?

718
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,520
Jesus Christ, Gabe!
What do you think, Sally?

719
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,440
I-- I think I'm gonna be going for
this little-- this little jaunt.

720
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Yeah, you are, baby!

721
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,720

Sally's got a set of balls.

723
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,160
What about you, McCoy?
Are you serious?

724
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,840
Come on, dude. Come with.
Get your fucking hand off me.

725
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,000
No, fuck him.
Pussy boy doesn't want to go.

726
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,760
Dude, let me
tell you something.

727
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,520
First of all, y'all
are drunk. Thank you.

728
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,440
Probably high doing all
sorts of fucking drugs

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,360
or whatever the hell
you're doing.

730
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,040
You're fucked-up.
But?

731
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,720
If I go, it's to make sure you don't get
your asses killed. That's right. When we go.

732
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
We are not
gonna get killed!

900
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,840
Ooh, did you like that?

901
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,240
Did you miss me, huh?

902
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,360
[Rush laughing, groaning]

903
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,120
Oh, it's go time for you.
You ready?

904
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,560
Huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

905
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,440
So, you ready?
Here you go, here you go.

906
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,640
Come here, Salazar. Come
here. Take her fucking hand.

907
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,120
Take her fucking hand!
Rush. Rush.

908
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,640
[pleading in Arabic]
Rush, hold on!

909
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
Wait. Wait for Flake. Hold
on, Rush. Wait for Flake.

910
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,600
This is his idea. He gets
the cherry. Come on, wait up.

911
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,680
What? You got a problem
with sloppy seconds?

912

Holy shit!
[laughs]

914
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,240
He tried to use
this on me.

915
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,960
Motherfuck.
[laughs]

916
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,000
Those motherfuckers! What
the fuck do you think I did?

917
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,160
I fuckin' killed them all.
I killed them all.

918
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,240
[Rush laughs hysterically]
Every fuckin' one of them.

919
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,120
They're fuckin'
all gone, baby.

920
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,960
They're all fuckin' gone.
[laughing]

921
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,680
All right.
Sally, come on over here, baby.

922
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,080
It's showtime. Take the
fuckin' hand. Here we go.

923

[Arabic]
[laughing]

924
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh. You ready? You ready for
the ride of your life, bitch?

925

[screaming]

926
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,840
Shut the fuck up! Don't
you fuckin' make a sound!

927
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,920
Give it to her!
[Rush hooting, laughing]

928
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,280
Aah!
[Flake grunts]

929
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,000
God!
What happened?

930
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,440
What happened in there?
Talk to me!

931
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,560
<i>Tell them-- No! Fuck!
What are you talking about?</i>

932
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,720
<i>McCoy!</i>

933
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,400
<i>What's up, Rush?</i>

934
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,440
<i>What are you doing?
What am I doing?</i>

935
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,560
<i>What are you telling Blix? Nothing.</i>

936
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,320
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, man.</i>

937
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,400
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, huh?</i>

938
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,960
<i>Get the fuck off him, Rush.
Back off!</i>

939
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,440
<i>Back off, Blix!
I'll cut you like a pig!</i>

940
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,200
<i>Sit down.
Okay, okay.</i>

941
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,720
<i>Get the fuck off me! If you
fuckin' move, I'll snap it.</i>

942
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,760
<i>It'll be real quick.
Piece of shit.</i>

943
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,080
<i>I want you to listen
to me real careful, Mac.</i>

944
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,600
<i>Listen to what?</i>

945
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,480
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

946
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,400
<i>What?
Are you fucking deaf, McCoy?</i>

947
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,080
<i>Am I speaking too softly
for you? No, I hear you.</i>

948
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,200
<i>All right. So you're tuned
in on my frequency, right?</i>

949
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,720
<i>Yes. Good. Now let me ask you again.</i>

950
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,120
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

951
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,240
<i>Yes, I've been
to fucking Vegas.</i>

952
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,680
<i>Good. Now what
do they say?</i>

953
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,320
<i>Uh-- What do they say
about what happens there?</i>

954
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,240
<i>It stays there.
I'm sorry. What was that?</i>

955
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,920
<i>It stays there.</i>

956
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,640
<i>"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."</i>

957
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,040
<i>That's right.
That's right, Big Mac.</i>

958
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,600
<i>Now I want you to think
about our little trip tonight,</i>

959
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,000
<i>like it was a trip to Vegas. Okay.</i>

960
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,320
<i>You read me, soldier?
Yes, I read you.</i>

961
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,720
<i>Do you fuckin' read me?
Yes, I hear you!</i>

962
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,800
<i>[sniffs deeply]</i>

963
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,840
<i>[coughs]</i>

964
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,480
<i>Sometimes, man--</i>

965
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>I swear to God.</i>

966
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,000
<i>For a college boy, you can
be real fucking stupid.</i>

967
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,280
<i>Where's Flake, Rush?</i>

968
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,280
<i>What the fuck
do you care, hairball?</i>

969
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,960
<i>Huh?</i>

970
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,040
<i>For your information, our boy
Flake is inside right now.</i>

971
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,920
<i>Sleeping like
a little baby.</i>

972
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,040
<i>You know what
that's like, right, Blix?</i>

973
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,280
<i>Right after you've been
sucked and fucked?</i>

974
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,800
<i>Hey, Mac, man.
Where were you?</i>

975
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,160
<i>What do you mean,
where was I?</i>

976
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,960
<i>I mean, what the fuck
happened to you?</i>

977
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,920
<i>I went outside.
I was on watch.</i>

978
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,040
<i>[scoffs] Flake stuck a gun
in my face. You remember that?</i>

979
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,120
<i>That's right, that's right.
You were on watch.</i>

980
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,800
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

981
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,400
<i>Ah. No, I didn't
see anything.</i>

982
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,400
<i>Well, that's good. That's good,
because you were on watch, right?</i>

983
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,760
<i>Yeah, I was on watch, so--</i>

984
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,200
<i>I mean, it was kind of
dark out there, too.</i>

985
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>Yeah, it was
pitch dark, actually.</i>

986
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,480
<i>Yeah.</i>

987
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,840
<i>What about the fire?
Did you see the fire?</i>

988
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,680
<i>Fire?
It was a big fuckin' fire.</i>

989
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,360
<i>You didn't see that?
No, I didn't see it.</i>

990
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,160
<i>I had my back
to the house,</i>

991
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,560
<i>just looking around,
so I guess I must have</i>

992
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,760
<i>missed the fire.</i>

993
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,840
<i>That's good.
That's good, man.</i>

994
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,360
<i>And what about
the insurgents?</i>

995
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,040
<i>Insurgents?
Yeah, man.</i>

996
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,000
<i>We had to hightail it
out of there.</i>

997
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,640
<i>They were
like, all over the place.</i>

998
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,680
<i>And really pissed.</i>

999
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,640
<i>Mm.</i>

1000
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,480
<i>That must have been one of
those Sunni-Shiite things.</i>

1001
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,280
<i>Right.
You know, I mean--</i>

1002
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,520
<i>We don't want to get caught
in a civil war crossfire.</i>

1003
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,360
<i>So the, uh, insurgents
set the fire.</i>

1004
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,400
<i>Yeah, it must have been.</i>

1005
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,960
<i>Because you know,</i>

1006
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,800
<i>when they're not trying
to kill us,</i>

1007
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,560
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1008
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,240
<i>Yeah, they're torchi''
each other.</i>

1009
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,720
[Arabic]

1010
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,320
And when did you start
having these dreams?

1011
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,400
A couple nights.
I couldn't sleep.

1012
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,320
I don't want to sleep.

1013
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,240
Can you remember anything?
Anything that happened

1014
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,840
that could have
triggered them?

1015
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,120
Yeah, after Sweet died?

1016
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,800
And I was shooting it
when it happened.

1017
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,960
He got blown apart.
I got it all on tape.

1018
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,360
His arm landed
right in front of me.

1019
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,360
Have you looked
at the video?

1020
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,400
Couple of times,
but then I stop,

1021
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,840
but it kept going, going over
and over again in my head.

1022
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,320
That's when I began
hating everyone.

1023
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,080
<i>Every hajji out there.</i>

1024
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,520
I couldn't stand the sight of
them, and I got angry all the time.

1025
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,240
And then I couldn't sleep,
and every time I did,

1026
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,400
I'd have the same dream
of her body burning.

1027
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,160
Her body?

1028
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,600
No. No.
No, his body.

1029
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,440
Sweet's body.

1030
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,080
It gets mixed up
in my head.

1031
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,560
And you videoed it.

1032
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,480
Yeah. It's part of my diary
of my experiences here.

1033
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,360
I'm going to use it
to get into film school.

1034
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,360
Is this part
of your experience?

1035
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,200
What, talking to you?
Yeah.

1036
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,440
Talking to me.

1037
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,920
I can't do it anymore.

1038
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,560
Everything
you shouldn't see,

1039
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,000
just because you're watching it
doesn't mean you're not a part of it.

1040
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,120
That's what everyone does, you know?
They just watch, and they do nothing.

1041
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,680
[weeping] Or they make a
video for people to watch,

1042
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,080
and they do nothing!

1043
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,880
[sobbing]

1044
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,760
Got to tell someone.

1045
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,600
It's driving me crazy.

1046
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,200
Dad, if something happened,

1047
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,200
something really,
really horrible,

1048
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,560
and you knew who
was responsible,

1049
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,040
isn't it your duty

What did you do?

01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do a damn thing.

1052
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,560
A couple of my buddies--

Members of your squad?
Yes, sir.

1054
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,240
I hope you realize how serious
this situation could be.

1055
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,920
Yes, I do realize.

I understand that,
sir, but--

1058
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,880
I mean, if your brothers
screwed up,

1059
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,560
that behavior reflects
on the whole Corps.

1060
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,120
There was a crime, sir. I
think charges should be brought.

1061
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,280
Son, listen to me.

1062
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,760
Do you know the first thing
to come into question

1063
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,280
in a court martial
in a thing like this

1064
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,360
will be your sanity.
My sanity?

1065
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,120
That's right! Your sanity,
for bringing charges like this.

1066
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,120

1072

I can't show it to anybody, because
I'd get in a lot of trouble here.

1073

everyone's going to see this.

The truth about

[Male reporter] The body being

1082
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,600
is believed to be that of the U.S.
soldier missing since last Friday.

1083
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,240
That's according to Iraq Defense
Ministry Secretary, Abdul Aziz.

1084
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,600
This Bedouin encampment
where the body was discovered

1085
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,520
just moments ago is outside
the Samarra base camp

where the soldier
was kidnapped.

on the identity of the body,

1089
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,680

could be the body of Angel Salazar,

Daddy was a gambler,

Mike Dancer,
he's a troublemaker.

1171
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,200
And what do you think
our Wild Bunch did?

1172
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,920
They just blasted
the shit out of him, right?

1173
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,680
Wrong. They asked him
for a job.

1174
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,680
A job.
Yeah, that's right.

1175
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,560
A job. They're too
chickenshit to shoot him.

1176
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,560
He's the head of a local.

1177
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,440
Since they're not getting paid
for not killing him--

they ask him for a job.

They really asked him
for a job?

1181
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,800

He's like,

"Come by the office in the morning.
I'll see what I can do for you."

...playing pool.

Invites him in the back room,

1192
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,160

beef with Dancer, right?

1193
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,760
Contract for 20,000? My brother
says he'll do it for ten.

1194

guys, says Clyde.

Steps over the body,

1202
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,480
goes upstairs,
kills the wife and kids,

1203
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:06,000
in and out, five minutes.

1204

01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,760
Wow. Um--
[clears throat]

1206
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,280
All right. So, uh,

1207
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,280
All right.

1208
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
[chuckling]
Great story.

1209
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,320
All right. Private,

1210
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,800
what would you say
would be the lesson

1211
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,200
that we have
learned here today?

1212
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,400
Uh, the lesson is that,
when you're on a mission,

1213
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,080
a deadly mission--

1214
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,640
Deadly mission.

1215
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,960
It's all about having
the right mix of guys.

1216
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,840
And in that mix, there's
got to be the wild card.

1217
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,800
Vegas was the wild card.

1218
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
And so am I.

1219
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,840
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.

1220
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,240
And what has become
of the wild card, Vegas?

1221
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,320
He's dead.

1222
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,320
He died in prison.

1223
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,320
Jesus.
He got caught?

1224
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,600
Took about, what, 24 hours.

1225
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,040
Cops come knocking
on Clyde's door,

1226
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,120
they flip him,
go to the bar,

1227
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,840
find Vegas--

1228
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,840
Only takes one fucking rat
to bring the whole house down.

1229
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,880
Jesus, dude. What are you
looking at me for?

1230
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,560
I'm sorry.

1231
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,360
You know, my mom always told
me it was impolite to stare.

1232
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,000
Come on, dude.

1233
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,080
I mean, what about
the other guys?

1234
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,600
[chuckles]

1235
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,400
What about the other guys?

1236
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Well, McCoy didn't
see nothing.

1237
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,400
And Angel--

1238
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,720
Well, kind of
lost his head.

1239
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,400

1264
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,640
Did you see the woman
being raped?

1265
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,400
Yeir. Well, uh,
not really.

1266
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,760
Rush was holding her down
when I went outside.

1267
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,400
Well, to do what?
To get away.

1268
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,800
I didn't think they were
actually going to do it.

1269
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,240
How did you know her?

1270
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,000
Flake put a gun in my face
and told me to go on watch.

1271
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,280
How did you know her?

1272
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,440
She would go in and out
of our checkpoint every day.

1273
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,200
Rush would take a little
extra time with her.

1274
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,680
Said he was just
being thorough.

1275
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,200
And why did you
make this assumption

1276
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,120
that she was a girl
and not a woman?

1277
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,760
Because she was
younger than that.

1278
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,360
She didn't look that old,
so I just assumed that she--

1279
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,640
Wasn't she an insurgent,
resisting arrest?

1280
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,640
[chuckles]
Uh, no. No.

1281
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,200
She was just a girl.
She was scared to death.

1282
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,320
How do you know
she wasn't scared to death

1283
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,160
because she was an insurgent
resisting arrest?

1284
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,680
Because, um,

1285
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,640
Flake said that we were
going to get this girl

1286
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,840
and "have a little fun."

1287
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,720
Oh, that's new.
When did he say that?

1288
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,840
He said it when we were
playing poker one night.

1289
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,280
I thought he was
just kidding around.

1290
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,960
Did you see Flake
rape her?

1291
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,680
No, I told you.
I went outside.

1292
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,160
So what did you see?
I didn't see him ra--

1293
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,960
I heard some shots.
I heard some screams.

1294
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,000
Then what happened?
Then I went up the stairs,

1295
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,240
and I saw Salazar, and he
told me what happened inside.

1296
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,040
You didn't actually
see him shoot her.

1297
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,640
No, but Flake had a gun
pointed at her head--

1298
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,240
So did Salazar and Rush
have guns?

1299
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,520
Yes, sir. Rush had a gun.
Did you have a gun?

1300
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,400
Yes, sir, I did. Couldn't
Rush have shot her?

1301
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,440
No! I--
Couldn't you have shot her?

1302
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,720
I didn't shoot the girl.

1303
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,080
But when you saw her,
she was still alive.

1304
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,800
I told you. I didn't
go back inside.

1305
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,840
Salazar said-- We're not
interested in what Salazar said.

1306
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,040
We're interested in
what you saw.

1307
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,080
Flake shot her
in the face!

1308
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,120
So you believed
she was dead.

1309
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,760
Yes! I believed
she was dead.

1310
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,560
But you didn't
see him shoot her.

1311
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,760
No, but I didn't know--

1312
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,240
And you didn't
see him rape her.

1313
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,440
No, but that's
not the point!

1314
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,840
What is the point?

1315
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,080
Isn't your testimony that you
were outside keeping watch?

1316
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,200
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to see it,

1317
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,080
and I didn't want
to be a part of it.

1318
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:51,880
Why don't you believe me?

1319
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,720
This is the scene

1320
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,320
of one of the most
shocking crimes

1321
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,760
alleged to have been
carried out

1322
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,880
by American
soldiers in Iraq.

1323
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,960
According to evidence
at the hearing,

1324
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,800
one July evening,
four U.S. soldiers

1325
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,240
came to this house here.

1326
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,000
According to Lawyer McCoy's
statement,

1327
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,440
Reno Flake and B.B. Rush

1328
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,800
repeatedly raped
a 15-year-old girl.

1329
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,760
In another room,

1330
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,320
the girl's grandfather,
mother, and little sister

1331
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,720
were shot dead.

1332
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,280
This man, Private Reno Flake,

1333
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,560
is accused of committing
all the murders.

1334
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,360
His accomplice,
B.B. Rush, was taken--

1335
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,760
[Rush]
We were securing the area.

1336
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,080
We checked everyone
and everything.

1337
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,000
And that girl went in
and out of our checkpoint

1338
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,800
again and again.

1339
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,800
So, yeah, I checked
her thoroughly.

1340
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,160
Every fucking time, because there
was something fishy about her.

1341
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,400
"Fishy"? What exactly do you
mean by fishy, Specialist Rush?

1342
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,120
Fishy, fishy, like
she was up to something.

1343
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,120
And I'll deal you
one more card.

1344
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,760
It's angel faces
like hers

1345
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,720
that are going to walk right up to
you and give you a great big smile,

1346
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,640
and then blow you
the fuck apart.

1347
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,360
And sure as shit,
the next day,

1348
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,280
the very
next fucking day,

1349
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,800
one of my best buddies

1350
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,920
got torched on a path that
she just walked right over.

1351
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,640
Didn't miss a beat.

1352
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,720
So don't you dare sit there
for one second and think

1353
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,000
that she didn't know where
that fuckin' IED was planted.

1354
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
[Flake chuckles]

1355
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,760
You know, I went back
to the house because

1356
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,560
I knew they were hiding
weapons and shit?

1357
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,240
I mean, hell,
that old man,

1358
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:44,040
broken back, tried to
shoot me with an AK-47.

1359
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,560
You know-- Hey--

1360
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,800
It really
pisses me off, sir,

1361
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,960
when I think of everything

1362
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,240
we've done for these
sand niggers?

1363
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,120
Got rid of Saddam,
planted democracy,

1364
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,920
giving up our lives to keep them
safe from their own insurgents,

1365
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,600
and I'm not looking
for a thank-you, but--

1366
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,800
I want them to stop
trying to kill us!

1367
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,560
Mm-hmm. Did you
find these weapons

1368
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,160
before or after
you raped the girl?

1369
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,840
Raped?

1370
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,160
I mean--

1371
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,280
<i>That hajji bitch
was all over me.</i>

1372
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,080
What, bombing and shooting them is okay,

1373
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,200
but fucking them
isn't.

1374
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,600
I mean,
who-- who says--

1375
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,200
Do you say?

1376
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,400
Who says their pussies
aren't better

1377
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,560
than their
hearts and minds?

1378
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,280
Would you answer
the question, Pratt?

1379
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,480
This is bullshit.

1380
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,600
Just a, you know--

1381
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,920
It's
a dog and pony show

1382
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,360
for the folks
back home, right?

1383
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,440
I'm just one of those
bad apples, huh?

1384
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,680
Soldiers
like B.B. Rush and I?

1385
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,560
We're keeping the Arab
scum off your doorstep.

1386
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,600
We shouldn't be in here
answering this crap.

1387
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,720
Let me tell you
something, sir.

1388
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,240
We should be out,
doing our job,

1389
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,000
boots on the ground,

1390
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,160
finding the bad guys,

1391
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,360
putting two in the heart
and one in the head,

1392
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,480
keeping America safe

1393
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,840
and making sure
the motherfucker's dead.

1394
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,720
You prosecute
guys like us.

1395
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,640
You're just aiding
the terrorists.

1396

<i>A quick death...</i>

1397

1400

1401
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,560

1402

1403

1410

<i>This is the same monster</i>

1411
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,840

<i>You don't see the My Lai

1414

of that fascist orgy</i>

1415

Oh. Okay. Okay, that's great.

[giggling]

1425
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,480
All right. All right, now--

1426
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,040
Hey, McCoy--
Woman!

1427
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,240
...I'm not
getting your faces.

1428
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,400
Come on, I want you
to turn toward me.

1429
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Come on, come on.

1430
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,600
Look in the lens here.

1431
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,000
All right, all right,
all right.

1432
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,200
Hurry up.
Take your picture.

1433
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,400
ALl right, here we go.

1434
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,000
Ready? Come on. Face me.
Here we go.

1435
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,400
Here we go.

1436
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,800
Come on, Judy, look at me.

1437
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,560
Here we go. 1, 2--

1438
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,480
No, I got to go
fix my face.

1439
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,920
Your-- What?
Your face is fine.

1440
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,360
It's just--
I'll fix my lipstick.

1441
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,400
It's perfectly fine.

1442
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,920
You look great! Judy!

1443
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,120
Okay.

1444
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,560
How about a war story?

1445
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,560
Yeah, how about not?

1446
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,640
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

1447
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,680
There are no war stories.

1448
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,960
Tell us a war story.

1449
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,480
You don't want to hear
a war story.

1450
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Sure we do. Tell us
what you did out there.

1451
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,120
Did you kill
anybody?

1452
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,400
Come on!
Let's hear one.

1453
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,840
Do you want to hear
a war story?

1454
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,920
Absolutely.

1455
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,200
Do you really want
to hear a war story?

1456
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,360
Very much so.
Absolutely.

1457
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,000
All right. Here's
a war story for you.

1458
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,800
Uh...

1459
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,040
when I first went over there,

1460
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,920
to Afghanistan,

1461
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,440
I was, uh, I was all amped up
to kill for my country.

1462
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,440
I was ready to just kick
some ass, you know?

1463
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,600
Get some licks in for what
they did to the Towers.

1464
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,520
Just be a big fucking
war hero.

1465
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,320
[clapping] Right on! Yeah!

1466
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,360
I get over to Iraq,

1467
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,440
and man, it's just--

1468
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,920
it's just a totally
different story.

1469
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,800
You grow up really,
really fast over there

1470
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,120
because everything you see,

1471
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,080
everywhere you look
is just death,

1472
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,800
and it's suffering.

1473
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,440
And the killing
that I did do,

1474
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,320
it made me sick to my stomach

1475
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,640
because of these smells
and these sounds

1476
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,800
and these images.

1477
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,040
I have these-- these
snapshots in my brain

1478
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,320
that are burned
in there forever,

1479
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,640
and I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do about them.

1480
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,480
And what was I doing there?

1481
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,680
What was I
doing in a country

1482
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,320
that's done nothing
to me?

1483
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,200
Just following orders?
Bullshit. Bull shit.

1484
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,200
You better have a really
good fucking reason

1485
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,160
for one of your buddies
to die in your arms,

1486
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,760
to be blown up
right in front of you.

1487
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,720
A really good
fucking reason.

1488
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,280
And I saw some shit
there, man. I just--

1489
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,920
I just don't know how
I'm going to live with.

1490
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,800
I went on a raid
in Samarra.

1491
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,040
And two men from my unit

1492
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,760
raped and killed
a 15-year-old girl

1493
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,240
and burned her body.

1494
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,160
And I didn't do
anything to stop it.

1495
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,920
[soft voice]
Oh, no.

1496
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,440
No, no.

1497
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,040
This is a celebration
for a war hero.

1498

Come on, come on.
Celebration!

Come on, come on.

And I'm going
to get my picture here.

1502
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,960
Okay. Okay. Okay, McCoy.
Here we go.

1503
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,640
Look at the camera.
Come on, Judy.

1504
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,320
Look at us here.
Here we go.
