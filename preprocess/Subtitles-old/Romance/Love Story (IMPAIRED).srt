00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,153

[Oliver]
of cranston, rhode island.

496
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,658
How interesting.

497
00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:06,160
So your people come
from cranston, jenny.

498
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,662
Well, mostly.

499
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,664
My mother came
from fall river.

500
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,666
The barretts have mills
in fall river.

501
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,669
Where they exploited the new
england poor for generations.

502
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,671
In the 19th century.

503
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,172
When you inherit,
oliver,

504
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:21,175
you can give all our money back as reparations.

505
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:24,679
Well, that's exactly what the
philosopher saint-simon advocated.

506
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,681
In the 18th century.

507
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,685
It's getting late.

508
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,686
For what?

509
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:33,688
You're staying for dinner,
aren't you?

510
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:34,689
No. Yes.

511
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,190
No. I've got to
get back.

512
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,192
Nonsense. You're staying
for dinner,

513
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:39,694
and that's an order.

514
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:41,195
Everything is
an order,

515
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,197
a directive,
a command.

516
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:45,700
Where is your
sense of humor?

517
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,702
You know,
when i was in school,

518
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,204
he used to send me
memos. Memos!

519
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,707
I mean, don't you
find that rather odd?

520
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:54,208
I find it
rather cute.

521
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:59,714
Tell me, oliver, have you heard
from law school?

522
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,216
Uh, no, sir, not yet.

523
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:04,719
He'll get in.
Who is better than oliver?

524
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,220
I quite agree.

525
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,223
He's bound to be graduated
with honors.

526
00:32:09,223 --> 00:32:11,225
Oliver has always done well in school.

527
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,727
At exeter,
he was the very--

528

it doesn't mean
a thing.

529
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:17,231
A lot of guys are trying
to get into law school.

530
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:19,734
I could give
price zimmerman a ring--

531
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,235
no!

532
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:23,738
I mean,
please don't, sir.

533
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:26,240
Merely to find out
if he knows.

534
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,244
I want to get my letter
with everyone else, please.

535
00:32:32,747 --> 00:32:35,249
He was only trying
to be helpful.

536
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,753
But, jenny, i don't need
that kind of help.

537
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,254
O.k.

00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:41,756
no, it's not o.k.!

539
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,758
He's not going to
be satisfied

540
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,760
till he cuts them off.

541
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,261
What?

542
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:49,764
What you wouldn't like
to be cut off.

but get there.

You really like to bug your father,
don't you?

549
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:12,286
The feeling's mutual,
or haven't you noticed?

550

I didn't think you'd stop at anything

just to get
to your old man.

is pretty steep.

656
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:08,582
Yes.

657
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:12,086
Dean thompson,
i need a scholarship.

658
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,588
I'm a harvard magna.
I've already been accepted.

659
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,590
I don't have any money
in the bank.

660
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,094
You have
a millionaire father.

661
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:21,595
Had, dean, had.

662
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:23,097
Why should i be
penalized

663
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,599
because i was once
related to a rich man?

664
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,101
Uh, mr. Barrett,

665
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:30,104
i really don't think
that this office

666
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,605
should enter
into a...

667
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:33,607
family quarrel?

668
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:36,110
A rather distressing one,
at that.

669
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,611
I see.

670
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,113
Thank you.

671
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:41,115
Uh...

672
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,616
perhaps...

673
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:44,118
at midyear--

674
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,621
thank you.

675
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,124
You've been very generous
with your time.

676
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,133
[Jenny] we just passed my junior high school!

677
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:02,052
[Oliver] i can't believe he liked my instant poverty.

678
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:03,554
He did, i swear.

679
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,639
At least now you've got something in common.

680
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,642
God, when i first told him oliver barrett--

681
00:39:08,642 --> 00:39:10,644
yeah? Yeah?

682
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:13,147
I mean, he just
couldn't believe it.

683
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:14,648
He kept
reminding me

684
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:16,150
of the 11th
commandment.

685
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,651
11th?

686
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:20,154
"Do not bullshit
thy father."

687
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:23,157
Any other commandments
i ought to know about?

688
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,658
Yeah. "Stay loose."

689
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,664
[Children shouting]

690
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,674
[dog barking]

691
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,183
so, is he for it?
Does he approve?

692
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:50,684
What do you think?

693
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:52,186
[Phil]
i won't allow it!

694
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,188
I won't allow it!
Get me?

695
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:55,689
You're tilting
at windmills, phil!

696
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,692
Stop referring to his father as a windmill.

697
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,694
He's a distinguished
citizen of boston--

698
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:01,695
mr. Cavilleri--

699
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:03,197
phil.
My name is phil.

700
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,200
I'll call his goddamn father.
I'll go to boston!

701
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,702
It won't do any good,
goddamn it!

702
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:11,205
Would you please not use profanity in this house?

703
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:12,706
You do.

704
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:14,708
What the hell
will he think?

705
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,210
That you've lost
your marbles.

706
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,712
Because i won't allow
a parent to reject a child?

707
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:19,746
Mr. Cavilleri--

708
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:21,715
phil. Ha ha ha!

709
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:23,217
Phil.

710
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,718
Phil, sir,

711
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:26,720
i reject him, too.

712
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:28,722
Now, don't talk
like that, oliver.

713
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:31,725
A father's love is something
to cherish and respect.

714
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:33,227
It's a rare thing.

715
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:34,728
Especially
in my family.

716
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,730
Let's get him
on the phone.

717
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,233
No, no. You see,
my father and i

718
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,734
have installed
this cold line.

719
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:43,237
He'll thaw, oliver.
He'll thaw, and he'll melt.

720
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,739
Believe me, when it's time
to go to church--

721
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,741
let's get him
on the phone.

722
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:49,243
Uh, wait. Phil.

723
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:51,245
What?

724
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:52,746
Um,

725
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,248
about
the church bit.

726
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:57,251
Well, we're kind of
negative on it.

727
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:01,755
Oh. Ha ha!

728
00:41:01,755 --> 00:41:05,759
Well, i-- i didn't necessarily m-mean the catholic church.

729
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,261
I, uh--

730
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,764
you-- you know
that, uh,

731
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:12,266
jennifer
is catholic.

732
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,768
She may have
told you that.

733
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:17,271
And her...
sainted mother

734
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,773
always dreamed
of a--

735
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:21,775
well, the whole
mass rigmarole,

736
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,777
but-but you're--

737
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:28,732
well, god would bless this union in any church.

738
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:30,284
Uh, phil--

739
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:31,285
yeah.

740
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,287
About the god bit.

741
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:34,404
Yeah?

742
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,790
Well, we're sort of negative
about that, too.

743
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,292
About god?

744
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:42,296
About anybody's god?

745
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:43,797
See...

746
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:46,300
we neither one of us
believe...

747
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,752
and we won't be
hypocrites.

748
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,304
Well.

749
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:51,305
Well, uh...

750
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,808
if that's
what you wish,

751
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,810
just tell me
who performs the wedding.

752
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,762
We do.

753
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:04,818
You mean,
do-it-yourself?

754
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,820
Huh?

755
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,323
Ha ha! Ha ha!

756
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:10,824
That's, uh--

757
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:12,326
that's wonderful.

758
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:15,829
I know i'm--

759
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,831
i mean, that's--

760
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,833
that's... just--

761
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,335
just wonderful.

762
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,340
Do-- do it yourself, huh?

763
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,342
I think that's...

764
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:29,843
just wonderful.

765
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:32,846
But, uh, tell me.

766
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:35,849
Is-- is it, uh--
what's the word?

767
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,351
You mean legal?

768
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,353
Legal. Is that it?
Is it?

769
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,856
Yes.
One of the college chaplains just sort of--

770
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:44,808
oh!

771
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:47,361
No, i mean
he presides over it,

772
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,863
and then the man and the woman
address each other.

773
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:52,366
You mean
the bride speaks, too?

774
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:55,369
Ha ha ha!

775
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,371
It's a new world,
philip.

776
00:42:57,704 --> 00:42:58,872
Oh, yeah, yeah,

777
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,875
it's-- it's-- it's new,
all right.

778
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,391
You two ready?

779
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:18,892
Amen.

780
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,394
They haven't
started yet.

781
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:21,895
[Chaplain]
friends--

782
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:23,397
how would i know?

783
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:25,899
I've never been
to a do-it-yourself.

784
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,901
Let us listen
to the words

785
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,903
they've chosen to read
on this sacred occasion.

786
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:31,405
Amen.

787
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:32,906
[Ray]
huh?

788
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:34,908
He said "sacred'"
the priest.

789
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:37,411
[Ray]
he's not a priest.

790
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,413
He is to me.

791
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:54,428
When our two souls stand up erect and strong,

792
00:43:54,428 --> 00:43:56,430
face to face,

793
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,433
silent, drawing
nigh and nigher

794
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:01,935
until the lengthening
wings break into fire

795
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:03,437
at either curved
point,

796
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,940
what bitter wrong can the earth do to us

797
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,943
that we should not long be here contented?

798
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,445
Think.
In mounting higher,

799
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:13,947
the angels
would press on us

800
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:17,951
and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song

801
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,953
into our deep,
dear silence.

802
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:23,457
Let us stay rather
on earth, beloved,

803
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,960
where the unfit,
contrarious moods of men

804
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,962
recoil away...

805
00:44:28,962 --> 00:44:30,964
and isolate
pure spirits...

806
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:35,469
and permit a place to stand and love in for a day,

807
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,472
with darkness and the death-hour rounding it.

808
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:42,976
I give you my hand.

809
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:48,482
I give you my love,
more precious than money.

810
00:44:50,484 --> 00:44:53,487
I give you myself before preaching or law.

811
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:56,990
Will you give me
yourself?

812
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:00,994
Will you
come travel with me?

813
00:45:02,496 --> 00:45:04,498
Shall we stick
by each other

814
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,999
as long as we live?

815
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:13,538
I, oliver barrett...

816
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,540
take you,
jennifer cavilleri,

817
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:20,045
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

818
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:26,051
to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

819
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,054
I, jennifer
cavilleri,

820
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,056
take you,
oliver barrett,

821
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:33,058
as my wedded husband

822
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:34,559
from this day
forward,

823
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,561
to love
and to cherish

824
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,064
till death
do us part.

825
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,079
By the authority
vested in me

826
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,580
by the commonwealth
of massachusetts,

827
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:58,083
i pronounce you
man and wife.

828
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,590
[Oliver] so i'm being kept by a woman.

829
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,092
[Jenny]
you won't like it.

830
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:08,593
I already do.

831
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,095
Oliver,
the shady lane school

832
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:12,597
is only paying me
three thou a year.

833
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,099
Why?

834
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,101
Because my goddamn name
is mrs. Barrett.

835
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:18,103
Well, couldn't you
be miss cavilleri?

836
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:20,071
If i was miss cavilleri,

837
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,107
i'd be the queen
of paris.

838
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:24,109
I tell you,
it's a great bargain.

839
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:26,611
Oliver, 4 rooms
for $82.50 a month

840
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:28,613
is impossible
this side of mongolia.

841
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:32,117
Ah, but this is the mongolian section of cambridge.

842
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,625
[Jenny]
gee.

843
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:43,128
I have to admit
that it's...

844
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,630
even worse
than i expected.

845
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,132
Ha ha!

846
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,633
Yeah, but it's home.

847
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,135
Yeah.

848
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:51,636
Well?

849
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,138
Well what?

850
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:55,640
There's the threshold.
Carry me over it.

851
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,143
You don't believe in that nonsense,
do you?

852
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,145
Carry me.
I'll tell you later.

853
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,147
We're almost
at the top floor.

854
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,649
O.k., i'll be a young
and beautiful divorcee.

855
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:08,153
Hey, what is this,
barrett?

856
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:09,654
Oh, what is this?

857
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:12,123
I'll tell you after we cross
the threshold.

858
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,658
Ha ha ha!

859
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,662
O.k.?

860
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:19,164
This is not
a threshold.

861
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,166
Well, i see our name
by the bell.

862
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,668
Look, it's not an official
goddamn threshold.

863
00:47:23,668 --> 00:47:25,170
Now, upstairs,
you preppie.

864
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,676
Why are you
so heavy?

865
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,179
Did you ever think
i might be pregnant?

866
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:35,680
Are you?

867
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,182
Ha ha! Scared you,
didn't i?

868
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:38,683
No, i--

869
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:39,684
don't bullshit me.

870
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:42,187
Well, yeah,
for a second, i clutched.

871
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:44,189
Now, is this the official threshold?

872
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:45,690
What do you think,
huh?

873
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,193
I think if you don't
say yes, i'll--

874
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,695
yes! Yes!
Ha ha ha!

875
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,260
[Jenny] is there a barrett in the house?

876
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,261
Hey, where are
the kids?

877
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,263
Asleep, thank god!

878
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:01,266
It's siesta time.
I've got 45 minutes.

879
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,768
That's more
than they give me.

880
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,770
[Boat whistle]

881
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:14,779
[clanking]

882
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,781
oh, damn it.

883
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,751
I don't know what's wrong
with this engine.

884
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,669
You're
a harvard magna.

885
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:22,787
Not in mechanics.

886
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:24,789
Welcome to the world,
preppie.

887
00:49:25,206 --> 00:49:26,291
Listen, cavilleri--

888
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,792
the name's barrett,
barrett.

889
00:49:28,293 --> 00:49:31,296
Sometimes you are
really a bitch.

890
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:40,305
How are they
treating you?

891
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:42,774
Fine, except for
the rittenhouse brat.

892
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:45,310
I swear he'll be breaking and entering before he's ten.

893
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,811
Oh, yeah? What now?

894
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:48,279
He tried to pinch me.

895
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,315
Ha ha!
I don't blame him.

896
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:53,284
Next time he does,
i'm going to wallop him.

897
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:55,820
Jesus, no!
Not until you get his parents' tip.

898
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:57,822
[Zap]

899
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,824
damn it.

900
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:01,826
Ha ha ha!

901
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:05,830
Let's get the hell
out of here.

902
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,332
Hey, don't touch me,
oliver.

903
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:09,334
What a thing to say
to your husband.

904
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,836
Wash, and you can
touch me afterwards.

905
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:13,338
I will.

906
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:15,840
Hey, i had another
salary hassle today

907
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,842
with miss
anne miller whitman.

908
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:20,845
I hope you laid it on
thick this time.

909
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:23,848
I told her how proud
i was to be a member

910
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,850
of the faculty of
the shady lane school.

911
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,852
I said, "you know,
miss whitman,

912
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:30,355
even barretts
have to pay their rent."

913
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:31,856
To which
she retorted?

914
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:33,358
"Ho ho ho."

915
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,360
Uh,

916
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,362
define "ho ho ho."

917
00:50:37,362 --> 00:50:39,864
3,500 for the year.

918
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:41,366
Oh, that's
ridiculous.

919
00:50:41,366 --> 00:50:43,368
Listen, how would you
like to supportme

920
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:46,871
while i take the courses necessary
to teach in public school?

921
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:51,876
Would you please
say something?

922
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,878
Ho ho ho.

923
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:41,426
[Oliver]
i thought you'd call

924
00:51:41,426 --> 00:51:42,927
when the meeting
broke.

925
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:44,929
Yeah, but i wanted you
to study.

926
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:46,431
Did you eat?

927
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:47,932
Uh-uh.
I waited for you.

928
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,934
But you're
a growing boy.

929
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:51,436
Ha ha!
Not anymore.

930
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,937
Yes, you are, in mind.

931
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:54,439
Did you check the mail?

932
00:51:54,439 --> 00:51:55,940
Just one second,
jenny.

933
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,442
This is a crucial
precedent.

934
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,452
Did you check
the mail?

935
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:09,454
No, i didn't.
Anything vital?

936
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:10,955
We are cordially
invited--

937
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:12,957
to pay
the light bill.

938
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:14,959
To a dinner.

939
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:18,963
Your father's
60th birthday.

940
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:23,468
Did you hear me?

941
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,969
Yes.

942
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:26,971
R.s.v.p.

943
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:28,473
you even have to ask?

944
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,475
Oliver, i think
it's about time.

945
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:31,476
For what?

946
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:32,977
You know
very well what.

947
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:34,979
Does he have to
crawl here?

948
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:36,481
Negative.

949
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:37,982
He's reaching out
to you.

950
00:52:37,982 --> 00:52:39,484
My mother
addressed it.

951
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:40,985
Oliver, think.
60 years old.

952
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:42,487
Nothing says
he'll be around

953
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:43,988
when you're
finally ready

954
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,490
for
a reconciliation.

955
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,991
There won'tbe
a reconciliation.

956
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,493
Someday when
you're being bugged

957
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:49,994
by oliver v--

958
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:51,496
he won't be
oliver v!

959
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:52,997
He can be
bozo the clown,

960
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:54,499
and he'll still
resent you

961
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:56,000
because you were
a harvard jock!

962
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,503
You'll probably be
on the supreme court.

963
00:52:58,503 --> 00:52:59,504
He won't resent me!

964
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:00,505
Why not?

965
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:01,506
Because--

966
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:03,508
your father loves you,
too, oliver,

967
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:05,510
just the way
you'll love bozo,

968
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,012
but you barretts are
so proud and competitive

969
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:10,014
you'll go
through your whole life

970
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:11,516
thinking you hate
each other.

971
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:12,517
If it weren't
for you!

972
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:13,518
Yes!

973
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:15,520
The case
is closed!

974
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:21,025
There's still
the matter

975
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:23,027
of the r.s.v.p.

976
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:25,530
i think
you can handle it.

977
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,031
In my whole life,

978
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,534
i have never deliberately hurt anyone,

979
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,536
and i just
don't think i could.

980
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:33,538
Jennifer,

981
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,540

Hey, jenny,

01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,002
I'm actually
getting to like

1148
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,503

1149
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,005
For what?

1150
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,506
For our kid,

Bozo barrett?

1153

It's the name of a real harvard superjock.

1154
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,015
You would
actually call

1155

offspring "bozo?"

I thought we had
run that gamut.

1162

But you weren't
a lawyer,

1163
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,044

I want her to study

to have a baby,

told soon.

You on
the other side

1307
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:22,736
of a punch-out
rap.

1308
01:16:22,736 --> 01:16:24,237
I turned him down.

1309
01:16:24,237 --> 01:16:25,739
Why?

1310
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,240
I don't know.

1311
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,743
I just couldn't see
living in some hotel.

1312
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,746
Boy, you're
really married.

1313
01:16:35,248 --> 01:16:36,750
Your time
will come.

1314
01:17:36,893 --> 01:17:38,311
[Oliver]
hey, mrs. Barrett.

1315
01:17:38,812 --> 01:17:40,814
I'm in the kitchen,
where i belong.

1316
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:42,816
Get the hell
in here, preppie.

1317
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,818
Mrs. Barrett,
guess what.

1318
01:17:44,818 --> 01:17:46,319
You got fired.

1319
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:48,822
I got fired up,
and guess where to.

1320
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:50,323
Reno, nevada.
Paris, france.

1321
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:52,325
We'll be there
christmas day.

1322
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:57,330
No. That's not the way
we'll do it.

1323
01:17:57,463 --> 01:17:59,833
Do what?

1324
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,334
I don't want paris.

1325
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:04,337
I don't need paris.
I just want you.

1326
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:07,340
Well, that
you've got, baby.

1327
01:18:09,342 --> 01:18:13,847
And i want time,
which you can't give me.

1328
01:18:18,852 --> 01:18:20,353
You saw
dr. Shapeley?

1329
01:18:20,603 --> 01:18:22,355
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:25,859
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.

1331
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,363
Who?

1332
01:18:30,446 --> 01:18:31,865
Dr. Addison.

1333
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:34,367
He's a yalie--
college and med school,

1334
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:36,369
but i said
you wouldn't mind.

1335
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:40,874
No, not if he's
a nice guy.

1336
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:44,377
He didn't bullshit me,
and that's what i wanted.

1337
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:50,850
O.k., then, for
the yalie doctor.

1338
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,353
O.k.

1339
01:19:05,398 --> 01:19:08,401
i'm counting on you
to be strong,

1340
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:10,904
you goddamn
hockey jock.

1341
01:19:11,404 --> 01:19:14,407
I will, baby.
I will.

1342
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,912
No. I mean for phil.

1343
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:21,915
It's going to be
hardest on him.

1344
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:23,416
You, after all,

1345
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,919
you're going to be
the merry widower.

1346
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:31,424
I won't be merry.

1347
01:19:31,424 --> 01:19:32,926
Yes, you will be.

1348
01:19:32,926 --> 01:19:34,928
I want you
to be merry.

1349
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:36,930
You'll be merry,
o.k.?

1350
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,434
O.k.

1351
01:19:42,936 --> 01:19:44,437
o.k.

1352
01:21:15,528 --> 01:21:17,030
enough?

1353
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:18,531
Not for me.

1354
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:20,533
I love watching you
dodge and weave.

1355
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,535
The old hockey
fake-out.

1356
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:24,537
That's you
all right--

1357
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:26,539
the old hockey
fake-out.

1358
01:21:26,706 --> 01:21:28,541
Can we get a cup
of hot chocolate?

1359
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,543
Sure.
I'll even pay.

1360
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:32,045
Very gracious of you.

1361
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:35,048
I told you
i liked it best

1362
01:21:35,048 --> 01:21:36,549
when i
supported you.

1363
01:21:36,966 --> 01:21:38,051
You always
supported me.

1364
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:40,553
I mean, after all,
what's money?

1365
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:43,556
I don't know.

1366
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,066
Hey, could we
afford a taxi?

1367
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:54,567
Sure.

1368
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:57,570
Where do you
want to go?

1369
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,572
The hospital.

1370
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:31,164
She's getting white cells and platelets,

1371
01:23:31,164 --> 01:23:32,665
which,
at the moment,

1372
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,667
is the most important thing she needs.

1373
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:37,170
She doesn't want antimetabolites at all.

1374
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,671
What does that mean?

1375
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:40,173
That's a treatment

1376
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:41,674
that slows
cell destruction,

1377
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:44,677
but there are unpleasant side effects.

1378
01:23:44,677 --> 01:23:47,680
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.

1379
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,682
You fellows do
everything you can

1380
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:51,684
to make sure
it doesn't hurt.

1381
01:23:51,684 --> 01:23:53,686
You can be sure
of that.

1382
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:56,689
I don't care
what it costs.

1383
01:23:56,822 --> 01:23:58,191
It could take
weeks and months.

1384
01:23:58,191 --> 01:23:59,692
Screw the cost.

1385
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:01,694
There's no way
of knowing

1386
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:03,196
how long
she'll linger.

1387
01:24:03,196 --> 01:24:06,699
I want her to have
the very best.

1388
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:08,701
I'm wealthy.

1389
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:11,204
I'm rich, really.

1390
01:24:11,204 --> 01:24:13,706
Really, i'm like
a millionaire.

1391
01:24:51,744 --> 01:24:53,746
How have you been,
oliver?

1392
01:24:53,746 --> 01:24:55,248
Fine, sir.

1393
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:56,749
And how is jennifer?

1394
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,751
She's fine, sir.

1395
01:25:03,756 --> 01:25:05,758
[Oliver] i need to borrow $5,000

1396
01:25:05,758 --> 01:25:07,760
for a very good
reason.

1397
01:25:12,265 --> 01:25:13,766
Well?

1398
01:25:16,269 --> 01:25:17,270
S-sir?

1399
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,273
May i know
the reason?

1400
01:25:20,273 --> 01:25:21,774
I can't tell you.

1401
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:23,776
Just lend me
the money, please.

1402
01:25:25,278 --> 01:25:27,280
Don't they pay you
at jonas and marsh?

1403
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,748
Yes, sir.

1404
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,283
And doesn't she
teach?

1405
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:32,752
Don't call her
"she."

1406
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:34,787
Doesn't jennifer
teach?

1407
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:36,289
Leave her
out of this.

1408
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:37,790
Just write out
a check.

1409
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:38,791
It's a personal
matter--

1410
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:41,294
a very important
personal matter.

1411
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:44,297
You got some girl
in trouble?

1412
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,303
Yeah. Yeah.
That's it.

1413
01:25:55,308 --> 01:25:57,810
Please lend me
the money.

1414
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,320
[Mr. Barrett writing]

1415
01:26:41,354 --> 01:26:42,855
thank you, father.

1416
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:47,360
[Door closes]

1417
01:27:50,423 --> 01:27:51,924
how is she?

1418
01:27:51,924 --> 01:27:54,927
She wants the troops
home for christmas.

1419
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:56,429
Always running
the show.

1420
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:59,432
She may succeed.

1421
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:00,933
That fast?

1422
01:28:01,434 --> 01:28:02,435
Yes.

1423
01:28:20,953 --> 01:28:23,456
Hello, baby.

1424
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:24,957
Phil.

1425
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:26,959
How's it going,
mrs. B?

1426
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,462
It's going, preppie.

1427
01:28:29,962 --> 01:28:32,465
The troops will be
home for christmas.

1428
01:28:32,465 --> 01:28:33,966
That's
a little trite.

1429
01:28:33,966 --> 01:28:35,468
It's
the goddamn truth.

1430
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:36,969
Hey, watch your language.

1431
01:28:36,969 --> 01:28:39,472
There's
a grownup present.

1432
01:28:40,973 --> 01:28:42,475
I hope so.

1433
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:45,109
I mean, phil made
a few promises.

1434
01:28:45,109 --> 01:28:46,611
Don't worry, jenny.

1435
01:28:49,614 --> 01:28:53,117
Maybe i ought to
let you guys--

1436
01:28:53,117 --> 01:28:55,119
i'll be nearby.

1437
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:06,130
It doesn't hurt,
ollie.

1438
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,632
Really, it doesn't.

1439
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:11,636
It's like
falling off a cliff

1440
01:29:12,136 --> 01:29:13,137
in slow motion,
you know?

1441
01:29:13,638 --> 01:29:14,639
Only after a while,

1442
01:29:15,139 --> 01:29:17,642
you wish you'd hit
the ground, you know?

1443
01:29:19,644 --> 01:29:21,145
Yeah.

1444
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:23,147
Bullshit. You never
fell off a cliff

1445
01:29:23,147 --> 01:29:24,649
in your whole life.

1446
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:27,652
Yes, i did--

1447
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:29,153
when i met you.

1448
01:29:31,656 --> 01:29:33,157
Yeah.

1449
01:29:33,157 --> 01:29:35,660
"What a falling off
was there."

1450
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:38,663
Who said that?

1451
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:40,665
I don't know--
shakespeare.

1452
01:29:40,665 --> 01:29:42,667
Yeah, but who?

1453
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,672
I mean, what play?
I went to radcliffe.

1454
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,174
I'm supposed to
remember those things.

1455
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,683
I once knew all
the mozart kochel listings.

1456
01:30:00,184 --> 01:30:01,686
Big deal.

1457
01:30:02,053 --> 01:30:04,188
You bet it was.

1458
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:09,694
What-what number
is the a-major concerto?

1459
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:13,147
I don't know.
I'll look it up.

1460
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,199
But i used to know
all those things.

1461
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,201
I used to know
allthose things.

1462
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:21,205
You want to talk music?

1463
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:24,158
What do you want
to talk, funerals?

1464
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,214
No, i don't.

1465
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:38,222
Ollie?

1466
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:42,226
I told phil
you could have

1467
01:30:42,226 --> 01:30:44,228
a catholic service

1468
01:30:44,228 --> 01:30:46,230
and you'd say o.k.

1469
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,232
o.k.?

1470
01:30:50,518 --> 01:30:52,236
It will really
help him a lot.

1471
01:30:52,236 --> 01:30:53,738
You know?

1472
01:30:56,741 --> 01:30:58,743
O.k.

1473
01:31:00,745 --> 01:31:03,247
now you got to
stop being sick.

1474
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,750
Me?

1475
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,753
That guilty look
on your face--

1476
01:31:08,753 --> 01:31:10,254
it's sick.

1477
01:31:18,262 --> 01:31:19,764
Would you stop
blaming yourself,

1478
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:21,265
you goddamn
stupid preppie?

1479
01:31:21,766 --> 01:31:22,767
It's nobody's fault.

1480
01:31:29,273 --> 01:31:31,275
It's not your fault.

1481
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:38,282
That's
the only thing

1482
01:31:38,282 --> 01:31:39,784
i'm going to
ask you.

1483
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:41,285
Otherwise, i know
you'll be o.k.

1484
01:31:59,303 --> 01:32:01,806

1485
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:06,310

Screw paris
and music

1487
01:32:09,313 --> 01:32:10,815
and all that stuff

1488
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:12,316
you thought
you stole from me.

1489
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:13,818
I don't care.

1490
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:15,820
Don't you
believe that?

1491
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:28,833
Then get the hell
out of here.

1492
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,835
I don't want you at
my goddamn deathbed.

1493
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,343
I believe you.

1494
01:32:39,343 --> 01:32:41,846
I really do.

1495
01:32:44,348 --> 01:32:45,349
That's better.

1496
01:32:49,854 --> 01:32:52,857
Would you please do
something for me, ollie?

1497
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:02,366
Would you please
hold me?

1498
01:33:14,378 --> 01:33:16,380
No. I mean
really hold me--

1499
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,883
next to me.

1500
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:32,456
Philip.

1501
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:46,470

1502
01:34:51,976 --> 01:34:54,478

1503
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:02,987
i wish i hadn't
promised jenny

1504
01:35:02,987 --> 01:35:04,989
to be strong for you.

1505
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:41,525
[No audible dialogue]

1506
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:50,534
oliver.

1507
01:35:51,035 --> 01:35:52,536
Why didn't you
tell me?

1508
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,538
I made a couple
of calls,

1509
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:57,041
and as soon
as i found out,

1510
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:58,542
i jumped right
in the car.

1511
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:00,044
Oliver,
i want to help.

1512
01:36:02,546 --> 01:36:04,048
Jenny's dead.

1513
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,052
I'm sorry--

1514
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:09,053
love--

1515
01:36:11,422 --> 01:36:15,059
love means never
having to say you're sorry.
