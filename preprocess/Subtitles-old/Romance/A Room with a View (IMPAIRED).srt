And on your right, the fourth pope.

And here he is preaching to the bishops.

200

Ah, Mr. Eager. Good morning.

You see me. I'm leading
a little private tour of my own.

Here he is on his deathbed,

Mr. Eager is our English chaplain

He must weigh as much as I do...

but he's floating up into the sky
like an air balloon.

212
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,700
Remember the facts
about this church of Santa Croce...

213
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,460
how it was built by faith
in the full fervor of medievalism.

214
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,406
Built by faith, indeed. That simply means
the workers weren't paid properly.

215
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,340
Pardon me. The chapel
is somewhat small for two parties.

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,740
the special character of Giotto...

Well may you ask.

But think how he's been brought up...

free from all the superstition
that leads men...

231
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,722
to hate one another in the name of God.

232
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,260
I must go.
My cousin will be most anxious.

I don't require you to fall in love with
my boy, but please try to help him.

that at the side
of the everlasting "why"...

if I had not arrived...

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,260
what would have happened?

482
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,820
I can't think.

483
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,260
Answer me, Lucia.

484
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,966
What would have happened
if I had not appeared?

485
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,770
You did appear!

486
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,260
Oh, I have vexed you at every turn.

487
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,100
It's true.

488
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,620
I am too old for you.

489
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,260
And too dull.

490
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,729
It will be a push to catch
the morning train, but we must try.

491
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,980
Oh, I have failed
in my duty to your mother.

492
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,420
She will never forgive me
when you tell her.

493
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,171
Come away from the window!

494
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,900
She will certainly blame me
when she hears of it.

495
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,525
Certainly.

496
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,688
And deservedly.

497
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
Why need Mother hear of it?

498
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,060
Well, you tell her everything.

499
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,940
Don't you?

500
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,420
I suppose I do, generally.

501
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,660
There's such a beautiful
confidence between you.

502
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,300
One would hate to break it.

503
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,140
And as I have said before,
I am to blame.

504
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,740
I wouldn't want Mother to think so.

505
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,900
She will think so...

506
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,660
if you tell her.

507
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,980
I shall never speak of it...

508
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,048
either to Mother or to anyone.

509
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,484
We'll both be as silent as the grave.

510
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,807
You'd better get to bed, dear.
We have to make an early start.

511
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,685
But, of course,
we have not had a full week.

512
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,020
I reserved the rooms for a week
like you wrote you wanted.

513
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,620
Yes, but we've only had half a week...

514
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,780
so by my calculations,
we owe you half the price.

515
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,780
I'm the loser. I could have
let them rooms five times over.

asked my permission...

but when he comes to the point,
he can't manage without me.

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,940
- Nor me.
- You?

530
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,820
- He asked my permission also.
- How very odd. Whatever did you say?

00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,420
- I said no.
- What?

I can't help it. It's the way he put it.

He said, didn't I think it would be a
splendid thing for Lucy if he married her...

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,340

You think his sister is promising?

I have a pet theory
about Miss Honeychurch.

563
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,940
Does it not strike you as odd
that she should play so wonderfully...

564
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,329
play Beethoven with such passion,
and live so quietly?

565

I suspect that one day...

566
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,291
music and life will mingle.

567
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,100
Then she will be wonderful in both.

a tenant as vulgar as himself.

a father and a son... the oddest couple.

781

In the course of conversazione...

782
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,620
they said they wanted
a country cottage...

783
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,220
and did I know of one?

784
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,420
A simple burrow
they could call their own...

785
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,420
where they could smell the earth.

786
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,940
Of course, London has its own character.

CECIL: Listen, Lucy.

1108
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,780
Three split infinitives.

- "And then the cry was heard...
- 40-30.

'Once more into the breach,
my friends."'

GEORGE: Victory, Mr. Floyd!

1112
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,340
"The scene is set in Florence.

1113
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,820
The sunset.

1114
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,649
The sunset of Italy."

1115
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,700
Did you mind losing?

1116
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,380
LUCY: Of course I do.

1117
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,100
I don't think you're
such a splendid player though.

1118
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,580
The light was behind you
and it was in my eyes.

1119
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,900
Never said I was.

1120
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,660
"Under Orcagna's loggia...

as we sometimes call it now"...

1122
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,286
What's the title?

1123
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,820
Under a Loggia by Eleanor Lavish.

Eleanor Lavish?

1125

My goodness!

1126
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,380
Do you remember Miss Lavish,
Mr. Emerson?

1127
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,020
- Yes, of course I do.
- No wonder the novel's so bad.

1128
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,020
Still, one ought to read it,
I suppose, if one's met her.

1129
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,300
(GRUMBLES) There's an absurd account
of a view which I will spare you.

1130
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,420
Oh, no, do read it.

1131
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,820
What do you think of our view,
Mr. Emerson?

1132
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,900
My father says there's
only one perfect view...

1133
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,004
and that's the view
of the sky over our heads.

1134
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,980
I expect your father
has been reading Dante.

(CHUCKLES)

1136
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,020
Cecil, do read
the description of the view.

1137
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,700
- Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.
- No, no. Read away.

1138
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,860
Nothing's funnier than
having silly things read aloud.

1139
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,860
And if Mr. Emerson finds us frivolous,
he can go and look for tennis balls.

1140
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,780
Go and look for tennis balls,
Mr. Emerson.

1141
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,020
- Do I have to?
- No, of course not.

1142
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,205
CECIL: It's in chapter two.
Just find me chapter two.

1143
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,780
CECIL: Give it here.

1144
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,780
- No, really, honestly. It's the silliest thing.
- Come on.

1145
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,121
- C-Cecil!
- Thank you.

1146
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,020
Aha.

1147
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,060
"Afar off, the towers of Florence.

1148
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,460
And she wandered as though in a dream...

1149
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,260
through the wavering,
golden sea of barley...

1150
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,682
touched with crimson stains of poppies.

1151

All unobserved, he came to her."

"There came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal lovers use.

1154
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,100
No eloquence was his,
nor did he suffer from the lack of it.

1155
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,300
He simply enfolded her
in his manly arms."

1156
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,860
No, this isn't the bit.
There's another much funnier further on.

Cecil, ask Mary for sandwiches.

I'll be with you in a moment.

1163
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,580
Do you know anything
about Miss Lavish's novel?

1164
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,860
There's a scene in it...
the hero and heroine make love.

1165
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,088
Do you know about that?

Do you know about it?

1167
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,410
They're on a hillside,
and Florence is in the distance.

1168
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,260
There are poppies and a barley field.

I can't believe it's a coincidence.

Oh, Lucy.

1172
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,860
Oh, dearest girl.

1173
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,282
She hasn't put that in her novel.

1174
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,420
Then never...

1175
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,740
never, never more shall Eleanor Lavish
be a friend of mine.

1176
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:09,129
So you did tell. Why, when you
wouldn't even let me tell Mother?

(EXHALES)

1178

Cecil read it to me.

1179
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,260
And that man took the opportunity...

1180
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,900
to insult me again behind Cecil's back.

1181
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,420
Why did you tell her?

1182
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,522
What made you?

1183
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,780
Even if you forgive me,
I shall never forgive myself...

Go and call him.

Call Mr. Vyse?

1187
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,640
No. The other one.

1188
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,761
This time I'll deal with him myself.

1189

You missed a good match, Miss Bartlett.

LUCY: Charlotte, please stay.

1192
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,740
Mr. Emerson, go out of this house...

1193
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,340
and don't come back into it again
as long as I live here.

1194
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,046
- I can't.
- No discussion.

1195
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,008
Go, please.
I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.

1196
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,940
You don't mean
you're going to marry that man?

1197
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,620
You're being ridiculous.

1198

Oh, I would have held back
if your Cecil had been a different person.

1199
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:48,001
But he's the sort who can't know anyone
intimately, least of all a woman.

1200
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:51,340
He doesn't know what a woman is.

1201
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,100
He wants you for a possession,
something to look at...

1202
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,460
like a painting or an ivory box.

1203
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,642
Something to own and to display.

1204
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,460
He doesn't want you to be real...

1205
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,140
to think and to live.

1206
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,460
He doesn't love you. But I love you.

1207
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,020
I want you to have your own thoughts
and ideas and feelings...

this time, not if you understood.

It's such a blessing. Don't you see?

1214

And the fact that I love Cecil
and shall be his wife shortly...

1215
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,300
I suppose that's
a detail of no importance.

This tremendous thing
has happened between us...

it means that nothing
must hinder us ever again.

That's what it means.
You have to understand that.

there are some chaps who are no good
for anything but books.

I plead guilty to being such a chap.

Because I wouldn't
play tennis with Freddy?

You don't. It's only as something else.

1261
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,500
As something you own.

1262
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,460
A painting.

1263
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,020
A Leonardo.

1264
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,727
I don't want to be a Leonardo.
I want to be myself.

1265
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,780
Oh, let's not go on now.

1266
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,963
I'll only say things
that will make me unhappy afterwards.

1267
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,540
You don't love me, evidently.

1268
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,060
(COUGHS)
I daresay you're right not to...

1269
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,500
but, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

1270
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,288
it would help a little,
hurt a little less, if I knew why.

1271
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,683
Because...

1272
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,689
you're the sort who can't know anyone
intimately, least of all a woman.

1273
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,380
Well, I don't mean exactly that...

1274
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,801
but you will go on asking questions.

1275
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,140
You wrap yourself up in art and books
and music, and you want to wrap me up.

1276
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,242
That's why I'm breaking off
my engagement.

1277
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,170
Well, it's true.

1278
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,644
True, on the whole.

1279
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,620
You're so different tonight...

1280
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,769
like a different person
speaking with a new voice.

1281
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,540
What do you mean by "a new voice"?

1282
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,540
If you think I'm in love with someone else,
you're very much mistaken.

1283
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,380
No, of course I don't.
I only meant that...

1284
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,580
there was a...

1285
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,729
a force in you
that I hadn't known of up to now.

1286
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,620
If a girl breaks off her engagement,
everyone thinks, "Oh, she has someone else.

1287
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,620
She hopes to get someone else."

1288
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,927
It's disgusting, brutal!

1289
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,210
You must forgive me
if I say stupid things.

1290

My brain has gone to pieces.

1291
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,404
I think I'd better go to bed,
if you don't mind.

Let me do that for you.

1293
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,245
I must actually thank you
for what you've done...

1294
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,925

from some friends of ours, the Miss Alans.

"Since Florence did my sister
so much good...

- Never.

appreciate the romance of this Greek visit.

1319
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,260
I've never been to Greece myself,
nor do I have any plans to do so.

1320

You're quite right.

1324
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,340

01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,606
she is Charlotte Bartlett.

01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,364
Tune's right enough,
but the words are rotten.

1417
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,460
Marian?

1418
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,580
- Oh, Charlotte!
- Lucy has a plan.

1419
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,940
Isn't this a tragedy?

1420
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,420
No sooner do I get one thing tied up,
then another thing falls over.

1421
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,980
The Misses Alan are going abroad.
They're going to Greece.

1422
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,420
Well, good luck to them.

1423
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,490
Lucy would like to join them
as far as Athens.

1424
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,140
She'd what?

1425
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:26,484
And then on to Delphi,
if the roads are safe.

1430
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,300
You can take all those.

1431
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:07,644
But leave me Thoreau till I go.
I need him by me now.

1432
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,020
It's an ugly house.

1433
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,929
We never liked it.

1434
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,780
Well, I mustn't miss the train.

1435
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,940
The removers can do the rest.

1436
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,660
- Oh, I...
- No.

1437
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,286
I don't want you straining your back.

1438
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,763
I won't be down at the weekend.
There's no point.

1439
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,962
I'll come to take you back to town
the week after.

1440
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,540
And paper soap is a great help...

1441
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,700
towards freshening up
one's face on a train.

1442
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,770
But you know all about these matters.

1443
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,690
And you have Mr. Vyse to help you.

1444
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,380
A gentleman is such a standby.

1445
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,820
We think it's so good
of Mr. Vyse to spare you.

1446
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,900
But perhaps he will come out
and join you later.

1447
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,460
Or does his work keep him in London?

1448
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,100
We shall meet him when he sees you off.

1449
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,180
No one will see Lucy off.
She doesn't like it.

1450
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,700
Really?

1451
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,830
(CHUCKLES)

1452
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:42,791
- I should have thought in this case...
- Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren't going?

1453
01:41:42,891 --> 01:41:44,740
Yes, I'm afraid we must.
We have a train to catch.

1454
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,180
Oh. It's been such a pleasure
to have met you.

1455
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,100
We will write you often
a-and send pretty cards from every place.

1456
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,340
- We know how anxious you would be to hear.
- Thank you for taking her.

1457
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,330
- (CHATTERING CONTINUES)
- Bye-bye.

1458
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,603
Well, we just got through that time.

1459
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,724
Yes, and were seen through,
which is most unpleasant.

1460
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,684
I shall never understand
this hole and corner business.

1461
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,525
You got rid of Cecil. Well and good.

1462
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,940
- I'm thankful. Why not announce it?
- (HORN SQUAWKING)

1463
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,420
I promised not to till I left England.
It's only for a few days.

1464
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,860
Victoria Station.

1465
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,660
I couldn't help thinking
that our dear Lucy did not...

1466
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,540
No.

1467
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,140
I wish you'd learn to finish
your sentences, Catharine.

1468
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,420
- You're getting worse and worse.
- Mmm.

1469
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,729
Did not look like a bride-to-be.

1470
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,650
Oh? Pray, how should a bride-to-be look?

1471
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,860
According to your great wisdom
and experience in these matters.

1472
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,860
Well, I can't say exactly how.

1473
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,820
Only that... she lacked something.

1474
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:55,180
And if you want to know,
Teresa, she lacked...

1475
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,009
radiance.

1476
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,740
- Miss Bartlett.
- Mr. Beebe.

1477
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,780
What is happening to your neighbors?

1478
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,900
Oh, alas, they're... they're moving out.

1479
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,900
Old Mr. Emerson's
rheumatism has come on...

1480
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,180
and George just thinks it's too far.

1481
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,740
In fact, Mr. Emerson is taking refuge
from the removers inside.

1482
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,860
Might I impose on your kindness
and wait here for Mrs. Honeychurch?

1483
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,180
By all means.
I'm afraid you must excuse me.

1484
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,442
- (CHURCH BELL RINGING)
As you can hear, they're getting on.

1485
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,404
Mr. Emerson, Miss Bartlett, excuse me.

1486
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,900
Oh, please.

1487
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,740
I am sorry, Mr. Emerson, to hear the house
has brought on your rheumatism.

1488
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,140
Oh, it's not the rheumatism.

1489
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,380
It's my boy.

1490
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,970
George is so sorry.

1491
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,060
Oh, I cannot blame him...

1492
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,300
but I wish he'd told me about it first.

1493
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:01,460
He never told you
what happened in Italy?

1494
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,164
Not one word.

1495
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,020
No.

1496
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,500
Lucy said he wouldn't.

1497
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,700
I was only told last Sunday.

1498
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,220
What were you told?

1499
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,084
That he loves her.

1500
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,140
Won't you... Won't you sit down?

1501
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,820
I-I... I think I hear the carriage.

1502
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,060
It would be most discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting.

1503
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,606
There isn't any carriage.

1504
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,209
Sit down, my dear.

1505
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,260
Everyone's been lying...

1506
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,340
except George.

1507
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:47,060
And now here's Miss Honeychurch
marrying Mr. Vyse in January.

1508
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,980
Miss Honeychurch
has broken off her engagement.

1509
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:54,820
It was all done with great tact
and discretion, naturally.

1510
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,180
And for the time being,
we would all like to keep it quiet.

1511
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,780
Oh, there's a time for
keeping quiet, Miss Bartlett...

1512
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,201
and there's a time for speaking out.

1513
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,540
Now, you don't hear any carriage.

1514
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:11,940
But why don't you sit back,
make yourself more comfortable?

1515
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,580
Here. Take this.

1516
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:17,524
There. Oh, you look much better.

1517
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,820
Oh, so, she, uh...

1518
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,220
she's not marrying Mr. Vyse.

1519
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,020
(CHUCKLES)

1520
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,140
Why?

1521
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,730
Why Greece?

1522
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,049
Why go rushing off
to the ends of the earth?

1523
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,860
You're tired of your home.

1524
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,140
You're tired of Windy Corner.

1525
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,242
And you're tired of Freddy and me.

1526
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,980
Of course I'm not tired of Windy Corner.

1527
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,380
But as we're talking about it...

1528
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:50,540
I may as well say that in the future
I shall want to come up to London more.

1529
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:54,167
I might even share a flat
for a little with some other girl.

1530
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,326
You see, I come into my money next year.

1531
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,562
To mess about with typewriters
and latchkeys and call it work.

1532
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,180
Perhaps I spoke hastily.

1533
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,020
Oh, goodness, how you do remind me
of Charlotte Bartlett!

1534
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,340
- Charlotte?
- Charlotte.

1535
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,169
To a "T."

1536
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,020
I don't know what you mean.
Charlotte and I are not in the least alike.

1537
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:24,043
You never used to be.

1538
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,564
Can't we have the hood down?

1539
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,167
Can we have the hood down, Powell?

1540
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,620
Powell, is that house to be let again?

1541
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,166
Sir Harry's looking for new tenants,
I hear, miss.

1542
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,860
What a pity about the Emersons.

1543
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,900
Freddy'll be so sorry.

1544
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,020
And, indeed, so am I.

1545
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,140
All right, Powell, stop at the stores.

1546
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,004
Yes, ma'am. Walk on.

1547
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,620
They were such an agreeable family.

1548
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,449
What a pity.

1549
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,980
No Charlotte.

1550
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,980
Lucy, go and see
if she's at Mr. Beebe's.

1551
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,980
And do hurry, both of you...

1552
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,208
because Mary has her fish pie in.

1553
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,291
Did you hear what I said, Lucy?

1554
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,404
Lucy!

1555
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,940
Mr. Emerson says it's all his fault.

1556
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,900
Because I told him to trust to love.

1557
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,980
I told him, "George, love
and do what you will."

1558
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,140
It's what I taught him.

1559
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,720
So you see, it is all my fault.

1560
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,300
Where are you going?

1561
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,610
Your dear mother most kindly offered
to fetch me in her carriage...

1562
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,530
and I have not been brought up
to keep anyone waiting...

1563
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:24,007
least of all a kind hostess.

1564
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,980
And now where's Lucy?

1565
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,980
You get in, Charlotte.

1566
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,580
If Mary's fish pie spoils,
she'll mope from now till next Friday.

1567
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,340
- I will sit here.
- Nonsense.

1568
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,340
No, this will do me very well.
I mustn't inconvenience you.

1569
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,860
Oh, Charlotte!
You know you prefer facing.

1570
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,260
I've no wish to discuss your son
or even to hear his name mentioned.

1571
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,761
He has misbehaved from the first.

1572
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,340
Well, in fact, he's behaved abominably.

1573
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,500
Not abominably.

1574
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,967
He only tried
when he should not have tried.

1575
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,340
No, of course.

1576
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,205
"Abominable" is too strong a word.

1577
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:10,220
I'm sorry. It's no good
discussing this affair.

1578
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,290
George is coming
to take me up to London.

1579
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,927
He can't bear to be here,
and I must be where he is.

1580
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,380
He says the thought of...

1581
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,420
seeing you or hearing about you...

1582
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,460
Oh, Mr. Emerson, please don't go.
At least not on my account.

1583
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,210
I'm going to Greece.

1584
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,260
Don't leave your comfortable house.
You mustn't.

1585
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,601
Why are you going to Greece?

1586
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,300
Forgive me, my dear, but it seems to me
that you're in a muddle.

1587
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,740
Seems to me that the reason
you're going to Greece...

1588
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,740
the reason you've
broken off your engagement...

1589
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,340
Yes, Miss Bartlett told me...

1590
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,140
is that...

1591
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,980
you love George.

1592
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,082
(SIGHS, SOBBING)

1593
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,420
All the light's
gone out of your pretty face.

1594
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:01,251
Just like it's gone out of George.

1595
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,500
I can't bear it,
and now I've made you cry.

1596
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,900
Dear girl, forgive me.

1597
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,620
But I've got to go to Greece now.

1598
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,020
The ticket's bought and everything.
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

1599
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,300
Oh, it's impossible.

1600
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,260
There's only one thing impossible.

1601
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,330
That's to love... and to part.

1602
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,284
MRS. HONEYCHURCH: Lucy!

1603
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,700
You love George.

1604
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,408
You love the boy body and soul,
as he loves you.

1605
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,100
But of course I do.

1606
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,020
What did you all think?
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

1607
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,540
- Then...
- No.

1608
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,820
Mother's calling. I've got to go.

1609
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,500
They trust me.

1610
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,204
Why should they...

1611
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,660
when you've deceived everyone...

1612
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,888
including yourself?

1613
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,980
Charlotte, come and sit here.

1614
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,082
- Go on, Powell.
- POWELL: Walk on.

1615
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,740
One week Italy. The next week Greece.

1616
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,140
CHARLOTTE:
The plan for Greece may be canceled.

1617
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,140
- What?
- CHARLOTTE: Oh, stop. Do stop!

1618
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,140
I think Lucy has something to tell us.

1619
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,163
- Stop the horse!
- Lucy?

1620
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,500
LUCY'S VOICE: "Dear Cousin Charlotte...

1621
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,180
After an appalling journey during which our
luggage went missing not once, but twice...

1622
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,180
we reached Florence.

1623
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,660
You'll be glad to hear that the Pensione
Bertolini is entirely its own dear self.

1624
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,460
The Cockney signora still marches
up and down, terrorizing the staff.

1625
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,460
Even her guests appear
to be just another set...

1626
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,060
of Miss Alans, Miss Lavish, Mr. Beebe...

1627
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,700
and, indeed, Charlotte and Lucy."

1628
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:54,020
We were promised rooms with a view.

1629
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,620
Hush, dear. We mustn't.

1630
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:59,660
First thing tomorrow, I shall have
a bone to pick with the signora.

1631
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,540
But not now.

1632
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,860
It's so unfair.

1633
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,540
Don't you agree
that on one's first visit to Florence...

1634
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,860
one must have a room with a view?

1635
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,644
We have a view.

1636
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,890
Kiss me again.

1637
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,300
- And again.
- I'm reading.

1638
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,300
- (BELL TOLLING)
- What are you reading?

1639
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,060
It's from Freddy.

1640
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,844
What does he say?

1641
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,140
Silly boy.

1642
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,740
He thinks he's being dignified.

1643
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,740
I mean, everybody knew...

1644
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,525
we were going away in the spring.

1645
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,762
(TOLLING CONTINUES)
