Look at us.

00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,412
Running around,

3
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:34,049
always rushed, always late.

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,624
I guess that's why they call it
the human race.

5
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,993
What we crave most in this world
is connection.

6
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,304
And for some people,
it happens at first sight.

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,532
It's when you know, you know.

8
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,841
It's fate working its magic.

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,512
And that's great for them.

12
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,082
But that's not the way it really works.

13
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,658
For the rest of us,
it's a bit less romantic.

14
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,100
It's complicated and it's messy.

15
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:23,106
It's about horrible timing
and fumbled opportunities

16
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:27,838
and not being able to say
what you need to say

17
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,175
when you need to say it.

18
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,880
At least, that's the way it was for me.

You are not
a beady-eyed little man-child.

40
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,735
"Boy," he distinctly said, okay?
And that's worse.

41
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,808
And I am, I'm like a--
I'm a beady-eyed-looking little man-boy

Kassie, exactly.
He had no reason to be polite, okay?

45
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,811
It was like a Tourette's-style
truth-serum affliction this guy had,

46
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,476
and I was caught in the cross hairs.

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,645
- I can't believe this stuff bothers you.
- It does.

48
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,121
Now, I have some big news.
I wanna show you something.

49
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,192
First I wanna show you something.
Check this out.

50
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,954
- Look at that.
- What? What is that?

51
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,589
I seem to have a growth.

52
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,199
Oh, my God, is that your scrotum?

53
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,462
- It's not a sunset.
- Ugh. You're exhausting.

54
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,799
My health exhausts you?

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,773
- Fine, we'll deal with my death later.
- My turn.

56
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,967
- See this?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,011
That's the dollar in yen.
I bought in a week ago.

58
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,776
- Good for you. Now look at it like this.
- Yeah, sideways.

59
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,886
If someone you knew owned this stock
what advice would you give them?

60
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,347
I don't know, Kassie. I gotta look
at fundamentals, you know, P/E ratios.

61
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,323
- Simple, simple. Hold or sell?
- You gotta sell that, it's going down.

62
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,552
Exactly.

63
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,755
This, Wally, this is what a woman's fertility
looks like after a certain age.

64
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,956
So?

65
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,397
So I would like you
to be the first to know

66
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,297
I'm having a baby.

67
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,039
- You're pregnant?
- No, not yet. But I'm working on it.

68
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,737
Went to the doctor, she said all my levels
were really great, considering.

69
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,906
And, uh, she said that my cervical mucus
is gorgeous, by the way.

70
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,608
- Thanks for that.
- And, uh...

71
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,845
Then she started giving me this lecture
about my age,

72
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,513
and I was really starting to hear her
about timing and why wait?

Would you please stop having sex
with food?

Sorry, you know I don't know
when I do it.

77
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,726
And then I thought to myself,
"I can do this."

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,769
I've got a, you know,
killer new job at the network,

79
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,565
and I don't need a man to have a baby.

80
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,038
Technically speaking, you do.
Where's all this coming from?

81
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,233
Is this about Paul?

82
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,313
Why don't you chalk it up as another of
your disastrous flameouts and move on?

83
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,347
This has absolutely nothing to do
with Paul.

84
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,610
- I think it does.
- And thank you for bringing it up.

All I'm saying is
don't kick that can down the road.

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,048
You need to look at your relationships
instead of biting off the next step.

87
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,919
- Deal with the one before.
- You know what?

88
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,119
I'm just tired of thinking about
how this is supposed to go, all right?

89
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,889
I'm just ready to do it now.

- Life is in session.

- Is that from an infomercial?
- No.

- Really?
- Yes.

- Did you buy the DvD?
- One.

94
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,603
But it really was something
that resonated with me.

You know what? I'm gonna do this.

You gonna read résumés?
You know, all that stuff is crap.

103
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,206
I heard about this woman in Queens,

104
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,775
she thought she was buying the sperm
of an Ivy League athlete,

105
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,435
turned out it came
from a homeless guy.

one of which I'm prepared for, okay?

00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,456
Listen. Now, what's wrong with my sperm,
by the way?

00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,262
- With your sperm?
- It works.

00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,100
Nothing.

116
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,833
- I'm sure you have killer sperm.
- You're damn right.

But, you know, we're best friends.
Isn't that weird? That'd be weird.

- That's weird.

- Careful.

- Little self-absorbed and pessimistic.
- I got it.

And I'm not pessimistic, sorry,
I'm a realist.

She put you in the friend zone
six years ago, brother.

That's a cold and inhospitable place

is an endangered species.

And now we're talking about your seed
getting devalued by her.

136
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,592
Hey, so that we're clear,
she did not put me in the friend zone.

137
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,752
We put each other in the friend zone.
It was mutual.

138

Let's be honest with ourselves.

139
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,662
You had your window with Kassie,

140
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,824
and you went all Wally on her
and you doomed it.

Hey, what is that even supposed to mean?

at least through the appetizers.

145
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,802
which one of your three failed marriages
taught you that lesson?

All three,
in their special and various ways.

I appreciate the kind advice, but I'm fine.

you e-mailed me a picture of your armpit.

150
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,986

- And what have you got on today?
- What?

1060
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:36,476
- It's a rock-climbing outfit.
- Is it?

1061
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,883
Yeah, Roland got it for me
because it was--

Listen, come on, be nice.

Pretty aerodynamic.
Lot of wind up there?

- Can you--? Never mind.
ROLAND: Fantastic, okay.

1065
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,492
- I don't wanna climb the wall.
- What?

1066
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:53,091
- No, but I promise you it's gonna be fun.
- I don't think so.

1067
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,760
Sebastian, the whole reason
we're having your party here

1068
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,896
is to climb the wall.

1069
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,270
We don't want the wall to go to waste,
now, do we?

So where did Sebastian
really wanna throw his party?

1072
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,608
A kill shelter.

1073
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,342
A kill shelter?

1074
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,921
It's like a last-stop dog shelter before they,
you know.

1075
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:16,149
Anyway, and he thought
it would compel people to save dogs, but--

1076

- Smart.
- But this is good for him, you know?

1077
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,060

SEBASTIAN: It's too high! No!

- The most important thing is to have fun.

Just count to three and let go.

Well, I don't really relate to that.

Well...

1132
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:01,884
Neurotic is simply an intense form
of introspection, okay?

1133
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,855
So you're basically calling him
introspective,

1134
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,961
and being introspective is good, okay?

1135

- Yeah, those rough edges.

and talking and talking.

He thinks that he's my best friend.

to be a better father to my son, you know?

you're taking an interest in his hobbies,

1165
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,714
but, um, listen,
I think the first order of business

1166
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,820
is for you to take care of this thing

she's spending time with Roland,

Ah. So go with that. Go with the eyes.

1177
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:08,014
And now I think
that I have feelings for her.

1178
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:12,748
Really? You think so?
It's only been, uh, 13 years.

for a very long time.

- Well, this is all good news.

That's just-- You're in love
with the mother of your child.

Meanwhile, she's falling for Roland.

1183
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,264
And I know that I could save all of this
by just telling her the truth,

1184
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,268
but if I do that, I lose everything, right?

1185
