1
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,124
9-ball is rotation pool.

2
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:57,127
The balls are pocketed
in numbered order.

3
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,129
The only ball
that means anything...

4
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:02,132
that wins it,
is the 9.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,034
The player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row...

6
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:09,300
blow the 9, and lose.

7
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:12,475
On the other hand...

8
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:15,479
the player can get
the 9 in on the break...

9
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:18,641
if the balls spread right,
and win.

10
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:23,983
Which is to say that luck
plays a part in 9-ball.

11
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:26,216
But for some players...

12
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,292
luck itself is an art.

13
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:11,589
Color.

14
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:13,654
Check the color.

15
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,995
Dead giveaway,
you know?

16
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,763
It's thick.
You can almost feel it.

17
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:23,432
Lay down and let it
roll all over you.

18
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,100
That's single malt.

19
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,411
On the other hand,
you got something like Old McDonnell.

20
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:33,109
More like Young McDonnell,
actually.

21
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:36,847
Tastes like
6-year-old bonded.

22
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,923
Smell this.

23
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,122
Mmm.

24
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,786
Hmm?

25
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,160
That's good stuff.

26
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,702
Yeah.

27
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:55,466
Very good stuff.

28
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,976
I can get you a case
for $3 5.50 less...

29
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:03,036
than your wholesaler
can get you a case ofJack Daniel's.

30
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:06,674
Go peddle that to one
of your hotel chains.

31
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,012
Peddle?

32
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:11,555
I don't do that, do I?
This is family.

33
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:14,056
I'm glad
to see you, too.

34
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,023
Come to my house
tonight.

35
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:18,061
I'll make you
an omelet.

36
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,527
I'll make the omelets.

37
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,532
Did you forget the omelet
I made you last time?

38
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:24,532
No.

39
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:26,068
What was in it?

40
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,228
Sweet sausage.

41
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:28,464
Sweet sausage.

42
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,236
Hey, I never made you
sweet sausage.

43
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,367
Eddie.

44
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,538
Come on,
what was in it?

45
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:37,739
Sour.

46
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:39,248
Sour cream
and caviar, right?

47
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,544
Okay. Excuse me.

48
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:43,711
Eddie.

49
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,721
Julian,
am I working?

50
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,256
I'm working, too.

51
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,986
This guy is up
for 20 a rack.

52
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,212
What guy?

53
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,185
Playing 2, 2 1 /2 hours
for 5 a game.

54
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:01,016
He's up 30.

55
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:03,215
I've been
playing him off.

56
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,862
Yo, Vincent!

57
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,898
Vincent, we're on.

58
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,830
Hey, Vincent.

59
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,772
Can you believe this guy?
Hey, Vinnie.

60
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:24,801
You slide this stuff
into a bottle of Old Granddad...

61
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,871
you'd hardly be lying.

62
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:31,884
Pick me up.
I get off at 1 0:00.

63
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,851
Not without me
you don't.

64
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:35,479
Do you?

65
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,023
Lately...

66
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,525
Wait a minute.
I'm talking bourbon.

67
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,492
You know the secret?

68
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:44,531
These people get a hold
of aged kegs.

69
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:47,362
You're tasting
low fusel oil content.

70
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,528
Just like the big guys.
It's the kegs.

71
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:53,038
Where do you get
the kegs?

72
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,473
Hey.

73
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,543
That was fast.
What the hell happened?

74
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,510
I slipped.

75
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,014
He slipped.

76
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,415
Where do they get
the kegs?

77
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,420
They just do.
Do whatever you want.

78
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:10,753
It'll leave the warehouse
one way or another.

79
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:14,589
On the snap, Vincent.

80
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,529
That kid's got
a sledgehammer break.

81
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,935
Bottoms up.

82
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:26,006
Do you know who
loves this stuff?

83
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:27,507
The Chinese.

84
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,442
It must be the low
fusel oil content.

85
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,446
Don't kid yourself.
It has its effect.

86
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:37,450
It's like those things
you take for granted, like electricity.

87
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:39,520
Eddie, loan me
another 20.

88
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:41,953
Who you working,
me or him?

89
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:45,719
He's on the ropes.
He just lucked out.

90
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,624
You know me, right?

91
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,526
Take it easy.

92
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:50,689
Woo!

93
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:53,097
Woo! Woo! Woo!

94
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,270
Victory.

95
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,448
Pick us out
a nice bottle of wine.

96
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,211
Red or white?

97
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,719
On the snap, Vincent.

98
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,461
Hey, Eddie,
about those labels.

99
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,964
Can you get me
some Wild Turkey labels?

100
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,466
Sure.

101
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:31,467
*...Oh, one more night *

102
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:35,941
* 'Cause I can't
wait forever *

103
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,002
* Give me one more night *

104
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:42,173
* Give me just
one more night *

105
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:45,480
* Give me one more night *

106
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:49,078
*I can't wait forever...*

107
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:51,250
Hiya.
How you doing?

108
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,920
*...Like a river
to the sea *

109
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:58,625
*I will always be
with you *

110
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,930
*And if you should
sail away *

111
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:05,598
*I will follow you *

112
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:08,540
* Give me one more night *

113
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:10,543
* Give me just
one more night *

114
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:13,136
Kid draws
some bead, huh?

115
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,705
* Oh, one more night *

116
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:20,049
*I can't wait forever *

117
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:25,057
*I know there'll
never be a time...*

118
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,822
Play him again.
You really got him on the ropes.

119
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,023
One more,
right, chief?

120
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:33,362
I got to split.

121
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,798
You're going.

122
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,030
Come on,
one more game.

123
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,003
I'm bust.

124
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,904
So let's just
play play.

125
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:41,906
What?

126
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,204
Play for play.
No money.

127
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,138
Play play?

128
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,080
Show me
what you got.

129
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,309
Vincent.

130
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:53,410
Julian, I just want
your best game.

131
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,489
I think the money's
throwing you off today.

132
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,820
*...One more night *

133
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:01,658
* 'Cause I can't
wait forever *

134
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:04,220
How about I win,
no money.

135
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:06,391
You win,
I'll throw you 20.

136
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,697
* One more night *

137
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,897
No?

138
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:15,032
* 'Cause I can't
wait forever **

139
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,080
What's the matter
with this guy?

140
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,741
All right, Carmen,
who's next?

141
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,112
Nobody.

142
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,119
Hey.

143
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,121
You want to play me?

144
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,747
For your girlfriend.

145
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:32,086
One game.

146
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,285
No.

147
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,760
I'll spot you
the 7 and 8.

148
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,798
I'll give you
the table.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,764
You want to play him?

150
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,769
Me?

151
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,805
Sure.

152
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,772
20 a rack.

153
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,309
No. 500 a rack.

154
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:52,379
Oh, you serious?

155
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,316
I never kid
about money.

156
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,975
Ha ha ha ha!

157
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,279
Cowards!

158
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,378
Off with their heads.

159
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,828
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

160
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,830
What do you mean?

161
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:13,332
Well, you just blew
500 bucks.

162
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,403
That kid, he has both arms
in traction...

163
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,836
he beats anybody
in the room.

164
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,339
Yeah, he could.

165
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:23,342
So I'll offer it
to you again.

166
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:26,902
I'll play him
for 500 bucks.

167
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,848
You don't know
what to say, do you?

168
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:32,852
Maybe I'm hustling you,
maybe I'm not.

169
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:35,855
You don't know,
but you should know.

170
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:39,916
If you know that,
you know when to say no.

171
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,928
What should I say?

172
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,861
You should say no.

173
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:46,365
Why? Because
it's too much money

174
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,368
and I'm an unknown.

175
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,871
He should be the unknown.

176
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,874
That would be nice.

177
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,876
That would
be beautiful.

178
00:10:56,978 --> 00:11:00,379
You could play around
with that.

179
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:02,381
You could control that.

180
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,815
I'll offer it
to you again.

181
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,819
I'll play him
for 500 bucks.

182
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,980
No.

183
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,490
Actually,
you should have said yes.

184
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,027
It's very hard
to know that.

185
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:15,652
It's very complex...

186
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,665
like which twin
has got the Toni.

187
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,167
Maybe they both
got the Toni.

188
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:24,329
Maybe Toni's a guy.
It's very complicated.

189
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:26,373
Plus it's too much money.

190
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:27,873
God, you're crazy.

191
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,466
No, I'm not.
Just common sense.

192
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:35,982
How about I take you guys
out for dinner tonight?

193
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,352
You should ask Vincent.

194
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,820
No. You should
ask Vincent.

195
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:54,868
You know the last time
Julian lost for me?

196
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:59,287
It's just a game, man.
Some balls and a stick.

197
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:01,389
9-ball's not that tough.

198
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,320
Stalker is tough.

199
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,655
It's his video game.

200
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,592
Vincent's the best
at it.

201
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,597
In pool, you just
got these balls.

202
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,759
You take your time,
set up a shot.

203
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:17,668
Can you make any money
playing Stalker?

204
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:21,038
I'll tell you what
I can do off Stalker.

205
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:25,045
1 0 years from now,
I can go to West Point.

206
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:28,048
It's all coming down
to video-game reflexes.

207
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:30,084
Computerized tanks,
Star Wars.

208
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,348
In 1 0 years,
a heavy scorer on Stalker...

209
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,015
is a shoo-in
at the Point.

210
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,286
You are beautiful.

211
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:41,226
What do you mean,
''money''?

212
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,695
Money money.

213
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,755
Really?

214
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,197
Hey, look.

215
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,963
If you got an area
of excellence...

216
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,538
you're the best
at something, anything...

217
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,540
then rich
can be arranged.

218
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,542
Rich can come
fairly easy.

219
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,202
Really?

220
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,736
You got some other
area of excellence besides Stalker?

221
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,806
9-ball, right?

222
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:06,216
You're some
piece of work.

223
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,948
You're also
a natural character.

224
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:11,583
I've been telling her that.
I got natural character.

225
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,923
That's not
what I said, kid.

226
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:17,658
I said you are
a natural character.

227
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,495
You're
an incredible flake.

228
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,466
But that's a gift.

229
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,470
Guys spend half their lives
inventing that.

230
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:28,269
You walk into a poolroom
with that ''go, go, go...''

231
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,573
guys will be
killing each other...

232
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,476
trying to get
to you.

233
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,979
You got that.

234
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,482
But I'll tell you
something, kiddo.

235
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,484
You couldn't
find big time...

236
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,486
if you had
a road map.

237
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:43,648
Pool excellence is not about
excellent pool.

238
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,191
It's about becoming something.

239
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:48,487
Yeah?

240
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:51,030
Yeah.

241
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,656
Like what?

242
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,099
You got to be a student...

243
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,603
of human moves.

244
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,606
See, all the greats
that I know of...

245
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:02,040
were students
of human moves.

246
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:05,203
Students
of human moves?

247
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:09,010
Yeah. That's my area
of excellence.

248
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,778
Oh, yeah?

249
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,945
Yeah.

250
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:14,454
Ahem.

251
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,114
What?

252
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,460
What?

253
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:24,462
That guy at the end
of the bar...

254
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,968
he's been hustling that broad
for half an hour.

255
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:31,528
He's going to throw in the towel
in 30 seconds for a buck.

256
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,005
You got it.
Starting now.

257
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,474
1 0 seconds.

258
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,740
What do you mean,
rich can be arranged?

259
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,474
Shh.

260
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,311
22, 23, 2 4...

261
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,977
25, 26, 27, 28.

262
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:47,180
Guess the news.
You lose.

263
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:52,754
And I just missed it
by a couple of seconds.

264
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,853
Want to up the bet?

265
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,557
Yeah.

266
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:02,534
Check for the meal says
I leave with her in two minutes.

267
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:07,336
Okay. Ready, go.

268
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,241
Now. I'm counting.

269
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,946
I know this will
sound crazy...

270
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,951
but would you come outside
and look at my car?

271
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,452
Your car?

272
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,854
Yeah.

273
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,552
Come on.

274
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:31,554
Hold it here
for a second.

275
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,598
Human moves, kid.

276
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,040
You study the watch...

277
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,045
but I study you.

278
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,741
You get the check.
Excuse me.

279
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,416
Cab's on me.

280
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,424
What's with
the car, Eddie?

281
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,326
Nothing.
I'll drive you home.

282
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,797
I hated to see you
sitting alone.

283
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,800
Did you seeJulian?

284
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:10,803
Yeah. Does he still
got his nighttime job?

285
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:15,968
He wanted to talk to you,
but you were busy.

286
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:22,745
Where did you go?

287
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,580
What?

288
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,643
You certainly
weren't here.

289
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:30,155
Oh, yeah?
Where was I?

290
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:34,493
God, the earth moved.

291
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,496
Didn't it move
for you a little bit?

292
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,589
That was a train.

293
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,593
No, it was you...

294
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,973
but it certainly wasn't San Juan.

295
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:52,501
I mean, if you're going to talk
earth moving...

296
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,013
you got to talk San Juan.

297
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:58,552
Remember that water bed we had?

298
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,518
God!

299
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,953
Sometimes I think about that week.

300
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:04,958
When I'm behind the bar...

301
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:09,463
I think,
''I'm going to get me a water bed...''

302
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,963
and not tell anybody...

303
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:14,058
Just make it a surprise.

304
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,736
Get some rum and pineapple juice.

305
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,999
You couldn't tell me
one word I just said...

306
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,477
could you?

307
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,480
No, I couldn't.

308
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:31,177
Water bed, rum, pineapple juice.

309
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:33,720
Not that, it's...

310
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:37,817
I don't know,
that kid today...

311
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,692
it was like watching
a home movie.

312
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:46,333
Ah, it just
made me wonder.

313
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,062
Wonder what?

314
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,896
It made me wonder
about San Juan.

315
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,449
What did you mean
last night about money...

316
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,750
and all that stuff?

317
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,694
I want to show you
something.

318
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,248
So this is
liquor money.

319
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:39,582
Some. Do you know
what I invest in?

320
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:41,554
Excellence.

321
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,790
You think Vincent's
that good?

322
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:50,330
Well, he's got the eye.
He's got the stroke.

323
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:53,093
He's got the flake
down cold...

324
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,000
but can he flake on
and flake off?

325
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,664
I don't know whether
that can be taught.

326
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:01,571
He's got to learn how to be himself,
but on purpose.

327
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,837
Yeah.

328
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,810
Do you like to travel?

329
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:06,845
Yeah.

330
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,109
You like hotels?

331
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,514
They're okay.

332
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:14,019
Are you going to
help me with him?

333
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,416
That lady you picked up
last night--

334
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:23,191
you knew her
from before, right?

335
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,357
Mm-hmm.

336
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:27,764
And the guy.

337
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:31,464
You probably had his schedule
down cold.

338
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,007
Maybe he's your
brother-in-law.

339
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:36,474
You're a hard broad.

340
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:39,138
What does Vincent
see in you?

341
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,805
Vincent's the best.

342
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,942
That's what
he sees in me.

343
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,851
We've just been together
about a year.

344
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:50,390
Vincent made us
get a place together.

345
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,823
You know how we met?

346
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,294
My old boyfriend
last year got busted

347
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,831
breaking into Vincent's
parents' house.

348
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,391
We met
at the police station.

349
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:02,823
You were bailing
your boyfriend out.

350
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,758
No. I got
busted, too.

351
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,797
I was driving
the car.

352
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:08,297
See this?

353
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,924
Look.

354
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,336
Vincent's mother's.

355
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,302
He gave that to you?

356
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,432
Nope.
From the robbery.

357
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:23,313
Vince says his mother
has one just like it.

358
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:26,475
He's sweet.

359
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,542
Vincent's real sweet.

360
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,458
The problem with this one
is that it's made in Taiwan.

361
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,866
You want something
for your kid to bounce in.

362
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,335
What animal bounces?

363
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,531
Kangaroo.

364
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,368
It comes from Australia.

365
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,873
This is
Australian made.

366
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,876
It's twice
as expensive...

367
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:56,879
but it's three times
better than Taiwan.

368
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,380
I'll take 1 5 off.

369
00:20:58,482 --> 00:20:59,881
Yeah, okay.

370
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,418
All right,
Mr. and Mrs. Randall...

371
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,351
it's a good buy.

372
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,856
Lou, could you
write them up?

373
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:09,859
If you ever need anything,
Vincent, okay?

374
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:11,360
Thanks.

375
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,364
Mr. Felson,
what can I do you for?

376
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:15,865
Eddie is okay.

377
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,868
In fact,just plain Ed
if you want.

378
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,870
Ed. Yes, sir.

379
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:22,929
Can we talk privately?

380
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:28,378
There's a 9-ball tournament,
end of April.

381
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:32,075
I think
we ought to go.

382
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,174
We?

383
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,277
Yeah. Me, you,
and Carmen.

384
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,288
Yeah? That sounds
like a lot of fun.

385
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,517
We ought to
leave tomorrow.

386
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,356
Tomorrow.
Why not leave today?

387
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,953
What is it
with this guy?

388
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,759
If you're going to
take the plunge...

389
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,391
give yourself
a fair shake.

390
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:53,437
Don't go half-assed.

391
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:58,804
Go on the road for six weeks.
Get some seasoning.

392
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,071
Why don't you
askJulian?

393
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,942
Julian's known.
You're nobody.

394
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,914
I get better bets
with you.

395
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,450
If there's
some other way...

396
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:10,987
that I can be
honest with you, tell me.

397
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,579
This is my job, Eddie.

398
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:15,956
You think so?

399
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,290
That's funny.
I don't think so.

400
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,421
I think
it's your problem.

401
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,726
What is?

402
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,770
Well, you're hooked
on Carmen, aren't you?

403
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:29,505
Yeah.

404
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,938
Crazy about her?

405
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:35,602
You're getting
a little personal here.

406
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:41,942
What?

407
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,987
You're losing her,
kiddo.

408
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,988
What do you mean?

409
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,991
She don't get the allure
of this place.

410
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:50,617
Hey, Vincent.

411
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:51,821
Wait.

412
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,420
Take a good look
at her.

413
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,466
She's starting
to pack.

414
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:01,428
You don't know her.

415
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,838
I didn't know that broad
at that bar either.

416
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:07,274
She's bored, Vincent.

417
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,337
Are you listening
to what I'm telling you?

418
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,507
What are you saying?

419
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:15,380
You, me, her on the road.
Six weeks.

420
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:18,455
She'll be a couple years
catching her breath.

421
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,683
Vincent,
these people--

422
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,520
Lou, I'm talking here.

423
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:25,493
Do me a favor.
Take care of them.

424
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:28,191
He's late
for his coffee break.

425
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,995
Go on,
get back to work...

426
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:33,468
but think
about it, okay?

427
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,836
Take your time.
I'll give you five seconds.

428
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,841
Five seconds.

429
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:41,036
You know where
to find me...

430
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,010
if you want to talk.

431
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,072
Vincent.
Don't worry about it.

432
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:01,392
*If I can hold you
tonight *

433
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:03,433
*I might never let go...*

434
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,025
If anybody asks,
I'll be in the back.

435
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,900
*I might never let go *

436
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,235
*If I can hold you
tonight **

437
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,831
[Knock On Door]

438
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,399
Come on in.

439
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:19,539
Hey, Eddie.

440
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,954
Uh... what we were
talking about yesterday...

441
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:28,924
I just wanted to ask you
some questions about it.

442
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,426
What happens?

443
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:33,554
I mean, what happens?

444
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:40,902
Damn.

445
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,939
It's a Balabushka.

446
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,565
It's beautiful.

447
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:48,942
It makes the others
look like stickball bats.

448
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:50,638
This yours?

449
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:52,477
You want it?

450
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,982
No.

451
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,985
This isn't for me.

452
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:58,988
I don't know
who this is for.

453
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,955
No, this isn't for me.

454
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:03,959
John Wayne would carry
something like this...

455
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:06,461
if he played pool.

456
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,964
Babe Ruth.

457
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,499
No. I...

458
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,562
No, I can't accept this.

459
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,502
Go ahead, take it.

460
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,443
You're pushing
pretty hard.

461
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:23,946
You betcha.

462
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:27,677
I've been thinking
about nothing else all day.

463
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:34,323
I don't know
what to tell you, Eddie.

464
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,154
It doesn't matter.

465
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,160
Go outside.
Horse around with it.

466
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:41,288
You don't like it,
bring it back.

467
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,995
Eddie.

468
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,469
Hey, Eddie.

469
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,770
I was talking to Carmen
the other night...

470
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,969
feeling her out.

471
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:55,534
Oh, Willie.
Wait a minute.

472
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,773
Sorry. Go ahead.

473
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:01,875
I said I was talking to Carmen
the other night...

474
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:03,283
feeling her out.

475
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,322
I think
you're wrong, man.

476
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,880
She's doing real good.

477
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:10,222
Okay. I'm glad I'm wrong.

478
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:11,817
Willie.

479
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:16,231
No. I don't know.

480
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,234
I can make it
in half an hour.

481
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,496
Sure.

482
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:38,253
Where's Carmen,
my girlfriend?

483
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,755
She just went
in the bathroom.

484
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,258
You know
what this is?

485
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,760
Balabushka.

486
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,262
Balabushka?

487
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:49,764
Where'd you get
a Balabushka?

488
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:52,267
Eddie Felson
gave it to me.

489
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,269
Eddie gave you
a Balabushka?

490
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:56,771
Yeah.

491
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:58,774
You know
what that's worth?

492
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,275
Yeah.

493
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:03,210
That guy died
about 1 5 years ago.

494
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,738
It must be
a collector's item.

495
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,114
*...Snake's in the garden *

496
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,120
*Apple's on the tree *

497
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:13,747
*All of this
looks easy *

498
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:16,553
*None of this is free *

499
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:18,720
* You might get lucky *

500
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:20,889
* Got the will to win *

501
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,762
* You need a little failure *

502
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:25,232
* To thicken your skin *

503
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,736
*Everybody's talking *

504
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:30,433
* They promise you the moon *

505
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,634
*It's made of paper *

506
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:35,268
*And you find out
pretty soon *

507
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:38,168
* Who owns this place? *

508
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,135
* Who owns this place? *

509
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:40,260
* Who? *

510
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,737
* Who owns this place? *

511
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:46,799
*I'm talking to you...*

512
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:50,243
It's my word
against yours.

513
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:52,748
I'm a rare book
expert.

514
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:54,750
Have you seen
my girlfriend?

515
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:56,285
She went out.

516
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:57,614
Where?

517
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,484
Hey, she's
your girlfriend.

518
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,222
Hey.

519
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:05,659
Everything okay?

520
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,161
Yeah.

521
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,164
Where'd you go?

522
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,166
I went out
for cigs.

523
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:13,168
They sell cigarettes
right here.

524
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,239
So I got them
across the street.

525
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:19,241
You needed
some fresh air, right?

526
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:20,674
What's your problem?

527
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:24,178
No problem.
There's no problem.

528
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:26,476
I'm glad to hear it.

529
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,017
I just didn't know
where you went.

530
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,179
I'm going to sit down now.
Is that okay?

531
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,018
Yeah.

532
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:36,319
I might go to the bathroom
in about half an hour. Is that okay?

533
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:40,021
I'll be sure
and tell you when.

534
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,290
Hey, look.

535
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:44,334
I just didn't know
where you went.

536
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:48,302
Let's not make a federal production
out of this, okay?

537
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:49,805
Okay!

538
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:51,363
Okay.

539
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:58,676
It's a Balabushka.
Eddie gave it to me.

540
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,215
Great.

541
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,134
* Who owns this place? **

542
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:45,259
Excuse me. Eddie?

543
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:47,330
I've been thinking
about it.

544
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,331
Let's do it, okay?

545
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:50,730
Great.

546
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:05,547
I wonder
what's upstairs.

547
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:06,741
Why?

548
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,341
Well, there might
be something soft...

549
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,354
for you
to lean against...

550
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,448
so I don't
crush your skirt.

551
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:26,630
In the Bahamas,
do they tango or rumba?

552
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,364
Samba, I think.

553
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:34,309
How's that Old Mcdonnell
working out?

554
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:36,311
You're drinking
it now.

555
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,313
You're serious.

556
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:42,146
- It's good stuff.
- It's very good stuff.

557
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:44,982
Yo, Eddie,
my man, hey.

558
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:46,316
Why don't you
look in the mirror...

559
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,323
before you leave
the john?

560
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,325
I hate that shit.

561
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:51,325
[Sniff]

562
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:53,328
Better than
that shit.

563
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,330
Will you be
around Monday?

564
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:57,832
A guy's set up
in Camden.

565
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:01,392
No. I'll be out of
town for a few weeks.

566
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,166
Bullshit.

567
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,773
What, you're taking that guy
on the road? What's his name?

568
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:07,309
It's none
of your business.

569
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,072
He's a chump.
He beat me one night.

570
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:12,081
I'll put the 9-ball
up both your asses.

571
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:14,344
Are you serious?
Taking him on the road?

572
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,681
When's the last time
you did the road, 1 960?

573
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:20,348
They didn't even
have cars then.

574
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:25,190
What? Come on?
You bangin' his girlfriend?

575
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:28,594
Right? You can tell me.

576
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:31,190
Jeez, you are
the best,Julian.

577
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,132
Let me play him
tonight.

578
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:36,172
Winner gets
in the car with you.

579
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:37,638
You're the best.

580
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,642
You're not the only
stake horse around.

581
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,678
See you
in Atlantic City.

582
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,974
Don't look
too hard for me.

583
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,651
We're going
to the Bahamas.

584
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,653
I just didn't say when.

585
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:54,656
Appreciate hearing about it
from that dope fiend.

586
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,192
I didn't want
to tell anybody.

587
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:59,159
Makes me feel great,
Eddie.

588
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,697
That guy sucks.
So do you!

589
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:04,164
I'm wrong,
but let me do it my way!

590
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:06,031
Do it any way
you want.

591
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:09,128
I want to go
on the road.

592
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:11,174
Your things
at my apartment...

593
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:14,176
you'll find in a suitcase
out front, okay?

594
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:15,734
Hey, wait a--

595
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,249
I'm sorry.

596
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:25,715
I cover all expenses--
food, room, entry fees.

597
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:28,757
For that, I get 60%
of your winnings.

598
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,657
I also take the losses
if you lose.

599
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:35,164
For that, I get 60%
of what you win.

600
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:37,666
60%? What are you,
a slumlord?

601
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:40,168
Honey, you find
a newcomer...

602
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:43,673
with a better deal,
come to me, we talk.

603
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,174
Don't worry.
I'm not going to lose often.

604
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:49,178
Yes, you will.
That's what I'll teach you.

605
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,771
Sometimes
if you lose, you win.

606
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,680
So who's
the heaviest guy?

607
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:56,685
I'm the heaviest guy,
right, Eddie?

608
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:59,187
It doesn't make sense.
It goes in streaks.

609
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:02,225
The balls roll funny
for everybody, kiddo.

610
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,192
There's this guy--
Grady Seasons.

611
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:06,729
He's making the most
on paper...

612
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,696
but that doesn't
mean anything.

613
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:11,199
The money's
in the practice room.

614
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:13,702
That's where
you get good games.

615
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,705
You can get wiped out
at the tournament...

616
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:18,741
hang around
the practice room...

617
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:21,743
and make more money than
the tournament winner.

618
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,711
Hear that?
The practice room.

619
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,714
Hey, watch the paint.

620
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:28,444
What? Oh.

621
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,746
Is that metal
on your jacket?

622
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,720
- Sorry.
- Shit.

623
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,669
I'm starved.

624
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:51,172
Rub-a-dub,
here's the grub.

625
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:53,174
My pancakes are burnt.

626
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:54,675
Wait a minute.

627
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:58,680
We ordered four on,
two up.

628
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:00,147
I don't want sausage.

629
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,184
Sorry.
It's the wrong order.

630
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:04,185
That's a dead giveaway--

631
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,948
Four on two.

632
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,649
Oh. Egg talk.

633
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:09,657
She was
the killer waitress...

634
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,158
at the Acropolis.

635
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:14,162
She did them a favor
and quit. Ow.

636
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:18,132
You think he's the only one
who has to work?

637
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:23,301
How come you don't
play pool anymore?

638
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,931
I quit.

639
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:28,843
Actually,
somebody retired me.

640
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,277
Sometimes you meet
the wrong people.

641
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:34,283
That was a long
time ago, back east.

642
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:36,182
It's dead and buried.

643
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:38,777
I won my share
of medals.

644
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:42,291
Don't you ever feel
like picking it up again?

645
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,226
I mean, you're always
around those pool halls.

646
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:48,297
I'm too old.
My wheels are shot.

647
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:50,333
It's a young man's game.

648
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,300
Besides, there's drugs now.

649
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:54,803
Kids are playing
on coke, speed.

650
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:57,806
When I was younger,
it was booze.

651
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,739
Somehow it was
more human.

652
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:01,174
Booze, huh?

653
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:02,734
Booze. Yeah.

654
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,371
Wine. It goes back
to the Bible.

655
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:07,541
The Bible never mentions

You religious, Eddie?

657
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:12,412

on the Man upstairs.

658

Isn't there
a masters tournament?

659
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:17,392
I seen this on television--
Them old golfers...

660
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:19,394
like an old-timers
tournament.

661

If you're too old to cut the mustard,
you can lick the jar.

662

Nobody ever asked me
for a refund, honey.

663
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:28,568
Not yet.

664

We're just talking
around things here.

665
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:41,115
It ain't about pool,
sex, love.

666
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,616
It's about money.

667
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,688
The best is the guy
with the most...

668
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:47,620
in all walks
of life.

669
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:50,625
Are you the best
liquor salesman?

670
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:52,752
You betcha.

671
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:12,616
What a way to get
your feet wet.

672
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:14,618
This place
is a classic.

673
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,620
Put that
in the trunk.

674
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,690
What will
I play with?

675
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:20,622
A house cue.

676
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:24,253
Go in with that,
nobody will come near you.

677
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:36,641
I can't believe it.
I got goose bumps.

678
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,141
I love it.

679
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:40,144
You watch for a while.

680
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:42,714
I got to see this guy.

681
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,630
I can't wait
to see what's next.

682
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,639
Good thing I didn't bring
the Balabushka, huh?

683
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:13,144
60%? Are we going to
divvy this up in the car?

684
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:14,735
Enough!

685
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,662
All right. Yes.

686
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:33,698
Had enough,junior?

687
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,192
Hold on.

What are you doing,
Vincent?

689
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:48,511
Beat him,
eat him, and go.

690
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,377
I can't take
his money.

691
00:37:50,482 --> 00:37:52,507
There's a hole
in his throat.

692
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,552
So what?

693
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,450
The guy's
breaking my heart.

694
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:58,956
Look. He's on
his last legs.

695
00:37:59,024 --> 00:38:02,050
It's only 60 bucks.
It's no big deal.

696
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,061
No big deal?

697
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,058
You want me
to quit?

698
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:13,969
Yeah, if you're going to
keep dumping like this.

699
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,408
Unless... show me.

Make it
a real performance.

701

Okay, chief,

Just bring it
around front.

Head it that way.

708

That's the wrong way, Eddie.

00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,374
Eddie, are you
stake horsing?

819
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:31,343
Know who you got
stake horsing for you?

820
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:33,345
This here's
Fast Eddie Felson.

821
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:37,440
Who the hell are you--
the end of the world?

822
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,849
Ease it up, will you, Orvis?

823
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,047
Him I'll steer for 1 5...

824
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:43,282
since he's staked...

825
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,018
by Fast Eddie
the stake horse.

826
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:47,856
Playing 9-ball
or straight?

827
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:50,556
I'll set it up
for you.

828
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,428
The table will
cost you $ 1 2.

829
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,311
*It's in the way
that you use it...**

830
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:10,383
Maybe you should
go back to the motel.

831
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,815
Why?

832
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,818
There are
rape artists here.

833
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,820
Maybe you
should go back...

834
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,822
pretty boy
like you.

835
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,324
Ooh, you're such
a cute boy.

836
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,394
Carmen.

837
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,895
- Vincent.
- Not here.

838
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:26,626
Hey, let me give you
the scoop.

839
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:29,497
See the guy with the
tie pin in his nose?

840
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:31,093
That's Moselle.

841
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,832
Him you
stay away from.

842
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:35,806
- No shit.
- Grow up.

843
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:38,309
He's the main stick
around here.

844
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:39,811
You beat him...

845
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:42,177
it scares away
that gentleman.

846
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:44,477
- Who's he?
- Earl.

847
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:47,348
He comes in with $6,000
in his pocket.

848
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:48,512
Jesus.

849
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,317
Yeah.
Runs the numbers.

850
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:52,824
Orvis says he
don't mind losing.

851
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:55,520
He just don't like
giving it away.

852
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:56,994
You beat Moselle...

853
00:45:57,097 --> 00:45:59,190
old Earl there
loses interest.

854
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,994
What happens now?

855
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:03,035
Nothing
for a little while.

856
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:06,037
We'll play
over here.

857
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,540
He'll be watching you,
and he'll come to you.

858
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:12,009
Who am I
going to play?

859
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:13,044
Me.

860
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,511
You? Okay.

861
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:17,048
I want her
to go back.

862
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,208
Oh, Christ.

863
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,014
This place is
a damn bird land.

864
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:22,645
I've dated
worse guys.

865
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:25,054
Watch
your hands.

866
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,648
Okay, okay, okay.

867
00:46:26,726 --> 00:46:30,127
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough. Okay.

868
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:31,391
That's enough.

869
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,797
Have Orvis call a cab
back to the hotel.

870
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,859
I don't want--
goddamn it.

871
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,897
Jesus Christ.

872
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,814
No thunderbolt breaks,
no runned over 4-balls.

873
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:49,872
Just take it easy.

874
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:56,754
She never went out
with any guys like these.

875
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,757
Vincent, will you
pay attention?

876
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,259
That guy Earl
is paying attention.

877
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,261
Are you listening
to me?

878
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,887
Yeah, yeah.

879
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,271
Want me to break,
or do you want to?

880
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,897
No. I'll break.

881
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,780
What did they do,
saw the legs off?

882
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:24,783
It's a table for dwarves
or something.

883
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,785
Oh, come on,
Fast Eddie.

884
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,788
Let's see some
heavy legend action here.

885
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,916
There's got to be
3 5 balls down there.

886
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:37,790
[Whistle]

887
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,798
Not bad.
This ain't pool.

888
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,765
This is for bangers.

889
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:43,802
Straight pool
is pool.

890
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:45,769
This is like
handball...

891
00:47:45,872 --> 00:47:47,806
or cribbage
or something.

892
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:51,776
Straight pool you got
to be a real surgeon...

893
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:53,778
to get it--

894
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,814
You know,
it's all finesse.

895
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,817
Now everything is 9-ball
because it's fast...

896
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,784
good for TV...

897
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,788
good for a lot
of break shots.

898
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,790
Oh, well.
What the hell.

899
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:07,917
Checkers sells more
than chess.

900
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,325
Pretty damn good.

901
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:15,799
Not bad for a blind man.
Rack 'em up.

902
00:48:15,902 --> 00:48:19,429
Yes, sir. Rack 'em up
for Mr. Fast Eddie.

903
00:48:19,506 --> 00:48:21,337
I haven't played
serious pool...

904
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,306
since before
you were born...

905
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,311
and right away,
I'm laying them to waste.

906
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:29,007
Watch this.
9 on the break.

907
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:31,575
Ooh!

908
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:35,786
- Damn!
- All yours.

909
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:37,686
That was phenomenal.

910
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,487
I'd like to play
that big dude Moselle.

911
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:45,354
I bet he ain't
that good.

912
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,523
Yeah?

913
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:50,125
I don't know, Eddie.
Maybe you're right.

914
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:54,663
Maybe this game
is just for bangers.

915
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,045
Cool it.

916
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:12,352
But the thing is...

917
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:15,326
even if it is just for bangers,
everybody's doing it.

918
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:21,793
If everybody's doing it...

919
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:23,733
there's a lot of guys doing it.

920
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:29,669
A lot of guys
doing it...

921
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:42,219
but only one guy
can be the best.

922
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,554
Eddie, hey!

923
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:54,055
Hey!

924
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,662
Eddie.

925
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:01,006
Eddie! Eddie, what--

926
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:02,939
Where you goin'?

927
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,510
All right, hey.

928
00:50:04,577 --> 00:50:06,511
Those were
easy shots, man.

929
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,012
Come on.

930
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:11,016
I'm a smart ass.
I was showing off.

931
00:50:11,084 --> 00:50:12,949
I'm sorry.
All right?

932
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,453
This is turning
into a waste...

933
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,580
of my time and money.

934
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,457
Where are you going?

935
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:26,031
You're going to
leave me here?

936
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,088
What--

937
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,593
I don't believe
this guy!

938
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:45,411
Child care.

939
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,952
Eddie.

940
00:51:00,834 --> 00:51:03,667
- Vincent back?
- Yeah, but he's out.

941
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,967
- What do you mean, out?
- Not in the room.

942
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:09,906
- Mind getting dressed?
- Why? Are we going somewhere?

943
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,672
What if I was
somebody else?

944
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,805
- Like who?
- That's not the point.

945
00:51:15,915 --> 00:51:17,849
I'm not naked
or anything.

946
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:20,351
Work with me,
not against me.

947
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,422
Don't talk to Vincent
like you did at Chalkies.

948
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,859
Gets him upset.
Use that thing right.

949
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:30,191
Use what thing?

950
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:37,601
Come on.

951
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,535
What are you doing?

952
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,106
Me and you.

953
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:43,608
Quick one
before Vincent gets back.

954
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:46,042
All right? Hey.

955
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,611
I'm not your daddy or your boyfriend,
so don't play games with me.

956
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:52,116
I'm your partner.

957
00:51:52,185 --> 00:51:54,153
You don't flirt
with me.

958
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,619
Don't flatter
yourself.

959
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:59,055
Don't waste my time
with bullshit, Carmen.

960
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,163
We got
a racehorse here...

961
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,664
a thoroughbred.

962
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:19,170
You make him feel good,
I teach him how to run.

963
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:21,296
We're businesspeople.

964
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,798
Got you.

965
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,249
Where's the Balabushka?

966
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:34,682
Vincent took it.

967
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:36,584
You said he was out.

968
00:52:36,688 --> 00:52:38,553
He was in and out.

969
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:39,919
He took
the cue stick?

970
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:41,322
Yes.

971
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:42,519
You let him?

972
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:44,994
Well, so what?

973
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,927
Shit.

974
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:53,266
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

975
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,670
Jesus. Goddamn.
Child care!

976
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:17,127
Shit.

977
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,425
Good game.
Good game.

978
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,766
What you got in there?

979
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,468
In here?

980
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,611
Doom.

981
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,818
Come on, boy,
let's play.

982
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:49,655
Yeah, let's play.
We'll have a lot of fun.

983
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:54,830
* Ow-ooo
werewolves of London *

984
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:57,663
* Ow-ooo *

985
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:58,827
Hey!

986
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:21,956
*He's the hairy-handed gent
who ran amuck in Kent *

987
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:26,429
*Lately he's been overheard
in Mayfair *

988
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:28,989
* You better
stay away from him *

989
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,864
*He'll rip
your lungs out,Jim *

990
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,200
*Ha! I'd like to meet
his tailor *

991
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:40,008
* Ow-ooo
werewolves of London *

992
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,873
* Ow-ooo *

993
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:45,882
[Applause]

994
00:54:45,984 --> 00:54:48,043
* Ow-ooo *

995
00:54:48,153 --> 00:54:50,781
* Werewolves of London *

996
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:55,019
* Ow-ooo *

997
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:58,118
* Well, I saw Lon Chaney
walkin' with the Queen *

998
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:02,132
*Doin'the werewolves
of London *

999
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:07,671
*I saw Lon Chaney,Jr.
walkin' with the Queen *

1000
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,138
Hoo!

1001
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:11,471
*Doin'the werewolves
of London *

1002
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,145
*I saw a werewolf
drinking a pina colada *

1003
00:55:16,214 --> 00:55:17,476
*At Trader Vic's *

1004
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:19,016
[Clapping]

1005
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,812
*His hair was perfect *

1006
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:27,988
* Ow-ooo *

1007
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:30,550
* Werewolves of London *

1008
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,152
Huh!

1009
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,495
* Ow-ooo **

1010
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:37,000
Ow!

1011
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,536
[Applause]

1012
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:54,677
Woo!

1013
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:57,186
Not bad, my man,
not bad.

1014
00:55:57,255 --> 00:55:59,689
When you leaving town?
Now, right?

1015
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,692
You don't want
to play me again?

1016
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,751
Don't kill me.

1017
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:13,468
That boy's hot.

1018
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:22,109
Did you
see me tonight?

1019
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:26,047
Hey!
What?

1020
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,278
I m--
I made money.

1021
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:29,648
You lost money.

1022
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:32,279
The town
is dead for you.

1023
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,053
Do I not speak your native language?
What is the matter?

1024
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,960
You give me this stick
and tell me to lay low.

1025
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,554
The goddamn thing, I lay it down
and it jumps up at me!

1026
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,328
You don't deserve
this stick.

1027
00:56:44,636 --> 00:56:46,570
I don't deserve this?

1028
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,073
You don't deserve
this stick.

1029
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:53,076
Alls you do
is you sit in there.

1030
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,578
You talk.
You tell me things.

1031
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:58,582
I played.
I'm a fuckin' pool player.

1032
00:57:00,652 --> 00:57:02,085
You know something?

1033
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:03,586
I'm a fuckin' animal!

1034
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:05,418
Ow-ooo!

1035
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,752
Animal!

1036
00:57:11,663 --> 00:57:13,597
Vincent,
get in the car.

1037
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,098
This is embarrassing.

1038
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,100
You're acting
like some girl...

1039
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:20,103
who got felt up
in a drive-in.

1040
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,105
It looks terrible.

1041
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:23,606
Tough shit.

1042
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:26,644
How much did you
take off of Moselle?

1043
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:28,144
I heard 1 00.

1044
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,645
1 50.

1045
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:31,147
1 50?

1046
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,614
Yeah. 1 50.

1047
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:35,653
Walk into a shoe store
with 1 50 bucks...

1048
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,551
you leave with one shoe.

1049
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,623
We were working
on 5,000.

1050
00:57:39,691 --> 00:57:41,625
Come on.

1051
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:43,786
Get in. It's cold.

1052
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:49,132
Vincent.

1053
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:58,331
You got me
talking to myself.

1054
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,138
Half of me says
I got a hold of...

1055
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,735
the best thing
I ever seen.

1056
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,577
Half of me says
it ain't worth it.

1057
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:08,049
Either I don't
teach you right...

1058
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,483
or you don't listen...

1059
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:13,320
or you listen,
but you don't hear.

1060
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:15,325
What was
that voodoo stuff?

1061
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:16,917
That wasn't pool.
That was a circus.

1062
00:58:17,028 --> 00:58:19,019
You dropped your pants.

1063
00:58:19,097 --> 00:58:21,565
You want to get down?
Good.

1064
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,566
You and Gypsy Rose Lee.

1065
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,569
I can always
go back to whiskey.

1066
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:29,071
It's been
very good to me.

1067
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:32,074
You're sitting in it,
and I'm wearing it...

1068
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,077
but it's tired.

1069
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:38,046
You know, it's just
kind of run on.

1070
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:41,552
You appear on the scene,
I'm jumping again.

1071
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,521
You remind me that--
that money won...

1072
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:48,525
is twice as sweet
as money earned.

1073
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:52,552
25 years ago, I had
the screws put on me.

1074
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,564
It was over for me...

1075
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,532
before it really
got started.

1076
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,535
But I'm hungry again...

1077
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:01,800
and you bled that
back into me.

1078
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:05,535
You got to have
two things to win.

1079
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,578
You got to have brains...

1080
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,045
and you got to
have balls.

1081
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,548
You've got
too much of one...

1082
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:15,108
and not enough
of the other.

1083
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:20,089
I mean,
I don't know.

1084
00:59:20,158 --> 00:59:23,093
Tell me what
you want to do.

1085
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:25,220
Give me a clue.

1086
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,633
Uh...

1087
00:59:34,172 --> 00:59:35,605
Um, yeah.

1088
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,573
I'll try.

1089
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:39,576
I'll really try,
you know?

1090
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,578
Let's go for it.

1091
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,581
You know, Eddie,
I mean, uh...

1092
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,585
it's just tough
for me to lay down.

1093
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,587
You know,
it's just, uh...

1094
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,590
I get in there,
and it's just tough.

1095
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:57,094
It's just, uh,
it's just tough to lay down...

1096
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:00,096
but I'll try. Okay?

1097
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:02,155
Tough to lay down, huh?

1098
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,793
Well, roll over,
sweetheart.

1099
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,928
Give me.

1100
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:09,472
What?

1101
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,472
90 bucks.

1102
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,702
60% of 1 50
is 90 bucks.

1103
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,852
I wake you up?

1104
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:28,619
Well, do you
want to hang up?

1105
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:32,151
Are you still
pissed off at me?

1106
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,690
Well, if you were, uh,
I'd understand.

1107
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,170
I don't know.

1108
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:44,174
Uh, I'm having nightmares,
sweats, and everything.

1109
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,972
What kind of rent
are you paying?

1110
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:50,173
I said what kind of rent
do you pay?

1111
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:53,149
Well, listen.

1112
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:54,684
Ahem.

1113
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,652
After the Bahamas...

1114
01:00:56,721 --> 01:01:00,179
maybe you could
move in with me...

1115
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:02,055
just for practice.

1116
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:06,159
What do you mean?

1117
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,666
No, nothing's going on.
What are you, a shrink?

1118
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:13,170
I miss you.
I say nice things to you.

1119
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,670
Fine.

1120
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:18,175
A couple of curve balls
every now and then.

1121
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,210
They're young.
They're kids.

1122
01:01:20,278 --> 01:01:22,371
No, no. You're perfect.

1123
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,944
I love this. You should have seen
Eddie play last night.

1124
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:31,453
Terrific.

1125
01:01:31,556 --> 01:01:34,719
Are we going to make
some money today?

1126
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,589
We'll make some money.
Definitely.

1127
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,559
I'm a wild man today.

1128
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:41,427
Did you ever hear
of a hustle...

1129
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,966
called two brothers
and a stranger?

1130
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:46,866
That's the guy
in the Bible...

1131
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:49,133
with the many-colored coats,
right?

1132
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,641
I'm joking, you guys.
Come on.

1133
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:55,235
Did I get through
to you?

1134
01:01:55,313 --> 01:01:57,713
I'll run it by you
another way.

1135
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:59,716
If you'd have
kicked ass...

1136
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:01,718
in any place
but Chalkies...

1137
01:02:01,786 --> 01:02:04,721
Atlantic City would
be dead for us.

1138
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:07,223
The guys never
leave the street.

1139
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,953
Otherwise, it would
be all around.

1297
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:17,516
Why can't we hustle
where I win?

1298
01:11:17,627 --> 01:11:20,790
Because
there's something...

1299
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,832
at the end of this.

1300
01:11:22,933 --> 01:11:25,299
I wouldn't
have you do it...

1301
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,302
unless the payoff
was phenomenal.

1302
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,339
Look, do whatever you want to do.
Do whatever you want.

1303
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:34,935
I'll play.
I ask a question, he panics.

1304
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,660
It's like a nightmare,
isn't it?

1305
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,872
It just keeps getting
worse and worse...

1306
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:09,207
Doesn't it?

1307
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:19,012
*Are you going to
fall for this? *

1308
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:23,588
* We're gonna pay
hell for this *

1309
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:27,896
*And now we can
move through it *

1310
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:30,432
Oh. The impossible dream.

1311
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:35,597
*Let ourselves
in for it...*

1312
01:12:57,427 --> 01:12:58,553
Don't choke now.

1313
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:02,394
It's not
that hard a shot.

1314
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:05,400
Did you just say,
''don't choke now''?

1315
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:06,901
You heard me.

1316
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:10,462
Yeah. Yeah,
I heard you.

1317
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:15,443
*Let ourselves in for it *

1318
01:13:18,915 --> 01:13:21,076
Oh!

1319
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,415
*Let yourself in *

1320
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:28,881
*Any way that you figure it *

1321
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:31,450
*It's down here
at our fingertips *

1322
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,586
*Back again, again...**

1323
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:45,131
Hey, Grady.

1324
01:13:45,242 --> 01:13:47,972
Up your ass with the spot,
okay with you?

1325
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:50,342
Fine with me.

1326
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:08,459
[Applause]

1327
01:15:12,814 --> 01:15:16,682
How you doing?
Hmm?

1328
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:19,344
Carmen, I'm playing
here now.

1329
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:21,820
I know.

1330
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:23,322
Vincent,
you win one more game...

1331
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,882
you're gonna be humping
your fist for a long time.

1332
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:31,227
You got that,
Vincent?

1333
01:15:42,677 --> 01:15:46,408
What are you doing,
meditating?

1334
01:16:14,342 --> 01:16:15,775
Yeah?

1335
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:17,777
Ha ha ha ha!

1336
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:19,744
Ha ha ha ha!

1337
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:23,374
Ha ha ha!

1338
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:24,884
Yeah?

1339
01:16:24,952 --> 01:16:26,419
Ha ha ha!

1340
01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:29,422
Can I have
the Balabushka?

1341
01:16:29,524 --> 01:16:31,389
Yeah.

1342
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:32,892
Ha ha ha!

1343
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,428
Are you going
to play, Eddie?

1344
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:36,929
Yeah, maybe.

1345
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:38,396
Where?

1346
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:40,400
I don't know.
Gunther's.

1347
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:43,062
Are you mad at me
about last night?

1348
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:44,331
No. You done good.

1349
01:16:46,974 --> 01:16:48,908
Where's he going?

1350
01:16:48,976 --> 01:16:50,944
He's going to
Gunther's,ja.

1351
01:17:19,774 --> 01:17:23,676
Hey, Bill.

1352
01:17:23,778 --> 01:17:27,145
Why don't you
call Dud?

1353
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:31,150
*Just about
to lose my mind *

1354
01:17:32,854 --> 01:17:36,449
*Never gonna let
your love...**

1355
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:37,957
Thank you.

1356
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,327
I'll have another Drambuie
and potato salad.

1357
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,830
Give my friend
anotherJ.T.S. Brown.

1358
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:46,263
One more time?

1359
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:47,699
Absolutely.

1360
01:17:47,802 --> 01:17:49,702
You remind me a lot...

1361
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:53,137
of a guy I played
about 20 years ago.

1362
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:57,041
After that, five of us
went on a road trip...

1363
01:17:57,145 --> 01:17:58,544
to San Antonio.

1364
01:17:58,646 --> 01:18:00,511
We didn't get any action.

1365
01:18:00,615 --> 01:18:04,449
The windup was we ended up
playing each other.

1366
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:08,387
That's all she wrote.

1367
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:09,786
Nice book, though.

1368
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,222
Buy you one?

1369
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:13,190
No, I'll buy you one.

1370
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:16,161
I'm going to play
for a while.

1371
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,130
It's crazy, you know.

1372
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:21,566
I was working at this job
busting my butt.

1373
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:24,001
They didn't
give me a raise.

1374
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:26,471
My old lady,
she leaves me...

1375
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:28,907
because
she says I'm a bum...

1376
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,409
because I quit.

1377
01:18:30,511 --> 01:18:33,344
Then after, I start
working at the university...

1378
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:35,314
strictly
for the experience.

1379
01:18:35,383 --> 01:18:37,317
Guess what I was.

1380
01:18:37,385 --> 01:18:39,410
What were you?

1381
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,920
I was a subject.

1382
01:18:42,023 --> 01:18:44,150
A what?

1383
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:46,420
A subject
in the psych department.

1384
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,121
I was a subject
for experiments--

1385
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:51,729
reflexes, memory things.

1386
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,164
I didn't do anything...

1387
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:55,225
when it got
to electric shock.

1388
01:18:55,336 --> 01:19:00,069
I did just once,
but it don't count.

1389
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:01,505
Oh!

1390
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:10,916
Okay.

1391
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:13,043
That's 80.

1392
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:17,586
- Do it again?
- Yeah, sure, I don't care.

1393
01:19:17,692 --> 01:19:20,354
- Double or nothing?
- Double or nothing.

1394
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:23,454
Is there an echo?

1395
01:19:23,564 --> 01:19:24,963
Let's play.

1396
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:31,302
Eddie, how you doing?

1397
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:34,897
Holding my own
and a little bit of his.

1398
01:19:34,976 --> 01:19:36,375
Good man.

1399
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:37,911
Here.

1400
01:19:38,913 --> 01:19:40,107
Go!

1401
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,238
Go!

1402
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:42,247
Go!

1403
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:44,876
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

1404
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,044
Fall!

1405
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:49,154
Is that it?

1406
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:52,624
Do it again.

1407
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,092
Double or nothing?

1408
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:55,992
What else?

1409
01:19:56,097 --> 01:19:58,088
All right.

1410
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:04,295
Ha ha ha!

1411
01:20:04,405 --> 01:20:07,966
That is bullshit.

1412
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:12,171
I never did that.
That is luck, man!

1413
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,348
I'm really sorry.

1414
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:19,942
There's nothing I can do.
The 9-ball fell.

1415
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:21,921
I can't believe that.

1416
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:24,981
Are you
a hustler, Amos?

1417
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,325
Come on, Eddie, man.

1418
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:29,760
Luck.

1419
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:33,493
Are you a hustler?

1420
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:37,093
Hey, you don't
want to pay me?

1421
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,036
Keep it.
Forget it.

1422
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,836
I don't want
no bad feelings.

1423
01:20:41,943 --> 01:20:43,877
When the
big guy loses.

1424
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:46,708
I lost, I paid.
I don't...

1425
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:50,845
Are you a hustler, Amos?

1426
01:20:56,991 --> 01:20:57,889
What?

1427
01:20:57,992 --> 01:20:59,892
You want to quit?

1428
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:06,231
Fuck you, kid.
Double it again.

1429
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:32,748
*Don't bother *

1430
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:36,920
*Sure enough I do *

1431
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:40,495
* Oh, well *

1432
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:50,541
Hey, I want to
ask you something.

1433
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:52,169
I want you to be honest.

1434
01:21:56,217 --> 01:21:59,084
You think I need
to lose some weight?

1435
01:21:59,186 --> 01:22:01,416
*...All of my life *

1436
01:22:03,224 --> 01:22:08,059
* Well, I sure
don't remember **

1437
01:22:27,748 --> 01:22:32,981
How could I
get suckered like that?

1438
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:38,922
You got to
work hard.

1439
01:22:38,993 --> 01:22:43,327
That takes a real gift
to show your ass like that.

1440
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:50,669
Everything in a stack.

1441
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:54,832
Everything--just probably
a little too much booze...

1442
01:22:54,942 --> 01:22:56,842
a little too cocky...

1443
01:22:56,944 --> 01:22:59,105
right amount of jerk...

1444
01:23:02,116 --> 01:23:05,449
to miss all those
fuckin' signals.

1445
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:17,863
Hey.

1446
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:21,857
Eddie, you'll
get him next time.

1447
01:23:37,818 --> 01:23:42,118
How much would you need
to go it on your own...

1448
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,884
from here
to Atlantic City?

1449
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,219
What?

1450
01:23:45,326 --> 01:23:47,988
Should have wiped
the floor with that guy.

1451
01:23:48,062 --> 01:23:49,461
Yeah? So?

1452
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:53,398
How much would you need
to go to Atlantic City?

1453
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:54,832
A couple thousand?

1454
01:23:54,902 --> 01:23:56,301
Come on, Eddie.

1455
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,736
You had too much
to drink.

1456
01:23:58,839 --> 01:24:00,704
Let's forget
about it.

1457
01:24:00,808 --> 01:24:03,140
I got nothing
left to teach.

1458
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,973
That was
the last lesson.

1459
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,171
Take the money.

1460
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:08,238
Front for yourself.
You'll do fine.

1461
01:24:08,349 --> 01:24:10,544
You're walking off?

1462
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:12,583
Dumping us.

1463
01:24:12,817 --> 01:24:13,875
Dumping you?

1464
01:24:13,985 --> 01:24:15,850
I'm giving you
a stake.

1465
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,320
I showed you
all I got.

1466
01:24:18,389 --> 01:24:20,516
What the hell else
you want?

1467
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:22,354
That's it!
That's all!

1468
01:24:23,728 --> 01:24:25,992
What are we
supposed to do?

1469
01:24:26,063 --> 01:24:29,362
Where we supposed
to go from here?

1470
01:24:29,433 --> 01:24:30,730
Here's you, see?

1471
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:32,530
Between you
and Atlantic City...

1472
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:34,503
there's about 27
pool halls.

1473
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:36,904
Three weeks, a couple
thousand dollars.

1474
01:24:37,008 --> 01:24:38,908
Why you talking
this way?

1475
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:42,002
You're played for a chump,
so you walk out?

1476
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:44,513
We'll get this guy
next time...

1477
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:46,277
Eddie.

1478
01:24:47,585 --> 01:24:49,519
Hey, hey!

1479
01:24:49,587 --> 01:24:52,954
You do this
to some guy on the street...

1480
01:24:53,057 --> 01:24:54,456
not to me.

1481
01:24:54,558 --> 01:24:56,287
What about the stuff
you told me?

1482
01:24:56,494 --> 01:24:59,395
You're going to
ruin everything.

1483
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:02,694
Carmen and me,
you told me about that.

1484
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:04,234
Okay, look, Eddie.

1485
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:06,201
Hey, it's
my attitude, right?

1486
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,635
From now on--

1487
01:25:07,738 --> 01:25:09,069
Attitude, bullshit.

1488
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,938
You always do
what you want to do!

1489
01:25:12,043 --> 01:25:13,943
Don't tell me that!

1490
01:25:14,045 --> 01:25:15,376
I'm tired!

1491
01:25:15,446 --> 01:25:17,311
I try
to do everything!

1492
01:25:17,415 --> 01:25:18,712
Take the money.

1493
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:22,742
It's the last thing
I can give you.

1494
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,253
Let it go, Vincent.

1495
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:26,482
You give me money
to get rid of me.

1496
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:29,388
You got
a long way to go.

1497
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:33,226
This is
nickel-and-dime shit.

1498
01:25:33,297 --> 01:25:34,286
Shut up
and give me money.

1499
01:25:34,398 --> 01:25:35,660
Make it 3,000.

1500
01:25:35,766 --> 01:25:38,098
I'll give you
what I got!

1501
01:25:38,169 --> 01:25:39,602
You know something?

1502
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,003
Just keep your
fuckin' money, pal.

1503
01:25:43,107 --> 01:25:44,131
Here.

1504
01:25:45,643 --> 01:25:48,077
Fuck it.

1505
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:52,242
Fuck.

1506
01:27:17,101 --> 01:27:19,365
Feel good, don't it?

1507
01:27:19,436 --> 01:27:20,869
I'm blind.

1508
01:27:20,938 --> 01:27:22,428
You're cool.

1509
01:27:37,922 --> 01:27:40,356
Better?
The same? Worse?

1510
01:27:40,424 --> 01:27:41,516
Better.

1511
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,721
Better?
Same? Worse?

1512
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,227
Better.

1513
01:27:48,299 --> 01:27:50,699
Better?
Same? Worse?

1514
01:28:44,922 --> 01:28:48,688
I like
the glasses.

1515
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:50,692
Fast Eddie,
this here's Moselle.

1516
01:28:50,794 --> 01:28:52,125
He plays pool.

1517
01:28:52,196 --> 01:28:53,595
No kidding.

1518
01:28:53,664 --> 01:28:55,529
That's a nice stick.

1519
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,464
I get the break.

1520
01:28:57,534 --> 01:28:58,865
What's the book?

1521
01:28:58,969 --> 01:29:01,767
50 on Fast Eddie
wins you 1 00.

1522
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:04,171
50 on Moselle
wins you 25.

1523
01:29:04,275 --> 01:29:05,173
Thanks.

1524
01:29:05,276 --> 01:29:07,107
Facts of life, man.

1525
01:29:07,177 --> 01:29:09,008
1 00 on the side?

1526
01:29:09,113 --> 01:29:10,637
Read my mind.

1527
01:29:10,714 --> 01:29:12,341
Rack 'em up.

1528
01:29:13,684 --> 01:29:14,946
Give it up.

1529
01:29:15,019 --> 01:29:15,951
Eddie.

1530
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:16,952
Eddie.

1531
01:29:17,021 --> 01:29:17,953
Moselle.

1532
01:29:18,022 --> 01:29:19,319
Moselle. Moselle.

1533
01:29:44,515 --> 01:29:47,313
- Shh!
- Shh!

1534
01:29:52,423 --> 01:29:54,152
- Yeah!
- All right!

1535
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:28,417
You guys going
to Atlantic City?

1536
01:31:28,485 --> 01:31:30,419
[Airplane]

1537
01:31:47,538 --> 01:31:48,766
That's $4.00.

1538
01:31:48,839 --> 01:31:50,670
You need
at least $5.00.

1539
01:31:50,774 --> 01:31:52,674
Resorts International
Hotel And Casino...

1540
01:31:52,776 --> 01:31:55,301
on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City...

1541
01:31:55,379 --> 01:31:57,973
welcomes you
to our casino.

1542
01:31:58,048 --> 01:32:00,346
As anyone can tell you...

1543
01:32:00,451 --> 01:32:02,351
the greatest secret to success...

1544
01:32:02,553 --> 01:32:06,819
on the casino floor is knowing
how to play the game.

1545
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:09,859
There are slot machines,
roulette, blackjack, craps...

1546
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,791
deep-six,
and baccarat tables.

1547
01:32:11,862 --> 01:32:14,854
Some have simple,
easy-to-learn rules...

1548
01:32:14,965 --> 01:32:18,332
but most are
more complicated...

1549
01:32:22,973 --> 01:32:25,305
The rules, regulations,
and pay-out odds...

1550
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,240
are established
and supervised...

1551
01:32:27,344 --> 01:32:29,892
by the NewJersey
Casino Control Commission.

1552
01:32:47,543 --> 01:32:48,976
Knock 'em dead.

1553
01:32:49,045 --> 01:32:51,070
I'll try.

1554
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:38,615
Hey!

1555
01:33:43,432 --> 01:33:44,797
*Keep saying now *

1556
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,698
* ''Daddy, I have to
leave you''*

1557
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:49,863
* Oh,yeah *

1558
01:33:49,939 --> 01:33:54,740
* ''But I'm in love
with another guy''*

1559
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,368
* Oh, no, no *

1560
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,606
*I couldn't believe...**

1561
01:33:58,714 --> 01:34:00,147
Hey, Eddie.

1562
01:34:02,718 --> 01:34:03,707
What?

1563
01:34:03,786 --> 01:34:05,117
You playing?

1564
01:34:05,221 --> 01:34:07,052
Got a problem
with that?

1565
01:34:07,123 --> 01:34:09,956
No. You got
any problem with that?

1566
01:34:10,059 --> 01:34:12,755
If it makes
you happy, do it.

1567
01:34:15,264 --> 01:34:18,062
I just wanted
to say hello.

1568
01:34:23,305 --> 01:34:25,569
Hello, test. 1, 2, 3.

1569
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:27,006
1, test.

1570
01:34:34,617 --> 01:34:36,016
Ladies and gentlemen...

1571
01:34:36,118 --> 01:34:38,985
it's nice to see so many faces here...

1572
01:34:39,088 --> 01:34:41,579
for today's 9-ball classic.

1573
01:34:41,657 --> 01:34:43,591
[Applause]

1574
01:34:46,595 --> 01:34:49,086
Players,
start your matches.

1575
01:34:51,801 --> 01:34:53,598
[Applause]

1576
01:34:59,642 --> 01:35:01,542
I didn't deserve that.

1577
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:08,506
Is this your first
tournament, Duke?

1578
01:35:18,527 --> 01:35:20,358
Match to Mr. Felson.

1579
01:35:20,463 --> 01:35:22,556
1 1 games to 5.

1580
01:35:26,302 --> 01:35:28,668
I didn't deserve that.

1581
01:35:28,737 --> 01:35:30,864
Yes, you did.

1582
01:35:42,685 --> 01:35:45,586
* Tall and tan
and young and handsome *

1583
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:49,647
* The boy from Ipanema
goes walking *

1584
01:35:49,725 --> 01:35:51,522
* And when he passes *

1585
01:35:51,594 --> 01:35:54,529
* Each girl
he passes goes *

1586
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:58,258
* Ahh! *

1587
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:00,526
We'll play 1 0 games.

1588
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:03,504
You win 8.
I got to win 1 0.

1589
01:36:03,572 --> 01:36:06,507
I'll put up $1 ,200.
You put up $800.

1590
01:36:06,575 --> 01:36:09,510
I win 8 games
to your 1 0?

1591
01:36:09,578 --> 01:36:12,513
You're putting up
$1 ,200 to my $800?

1592
01:36:12,581 --> 01:36:15,550
This is a good deal,
isn't it?

1593
01:36:15,618 --> 01:36:18,519
This guy won
the Akron Open, Vincent.

1594
01:36:18,587 --> 01:36:20,521
There is no such thing.

1595
01:36:20,589 --> 01:36:22,557
What have I
been reading?

1596
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:24,525
I can win 8 games.

1597
01:36:24,593 --> 01:36:27,027
I just don't like
the deal.

1598
01:36:27,096 --> 01:36:29,690
What don't
you like, lady?

1599
01:36:29,765 --> 01:36:31,699
Up your end
to 1 ,500.

1600
01:36:31,767 --> 01:36:34,201
$300 isn't going to
kill the guy!

1601
01:36:36,772 --> 01:36:38,967
All right.
All right.

1602
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:40,974
I shouldn't,
but I will.

1603
01:36:41,076 --> 01:36:42,475
$1 ,500,
how's that?

1604
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:44,569
Okay. Yeah.
I'm sorry.

1605
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:46,046
Don't be sorry.

1606
01:36:46,115 --> 01:36:47,980
All right,
it's 8:30.

1607
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,483
How about 1 2:30
in the green room?

1608
01:36:50,586 --> 01:36:51,985
1 2:30. Great.

1609
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:53,645
Terrific.

1610
01:36:53,756 --> 01:36:56,054
You can
get these, right?

1611
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,490
No problem.

1612
01:36:57,593 --> 01:36:59,561
We got it
covered here.

1613
01:37:02,598 --> 01:37:03,496
$1 ,500?

1614
01:37:03,599 --> 01:37:04,998
Not bad, huh?

1615
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,499
'' Not bad, huh?''

1616
01:37:06,602 --> 01:37:08,502
He wouldn't
go for more--

1617
01:37:08,604 --> 01:37:12,062
That guy had $2,000
written all over his face.

1618
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:15,577
You gave him $500,
and you're buying his drink.

1619
01:37:15,644 --> 01:37:17,578
Do it yourself
next time.

1620
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,485
I got to go rest.

1621
01:37:26,589 --> 01:37:27,578
Great.

1622
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,592
Eddie.

1623
01:37:33,762 --> 01:37:36,458
You got new glasses.
They look good.

1624
01:37:36,532 --> 01:37:39,501
If it isn't
the kid and Carmen.

1625
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:41,263
How's it going?

1626
01:37:41,337 --> 01:37:43,305
Can't complain. You?

1627
01:37:43,372 --> 01:37:44,999
$4,000 in 3 weeks.

1628
01:37:45,107 --> 01:37:47,098
Could have been better,
could have been worse.

1629
01:37:47,176 --> 01:37:49,474
Well, I'm happy for you.

1630
01:37:49,545 --> 01:37:53,037
At 1 2:30 we're taking out
that lame from Akron.

1631
01:37:53,148 --> 01:37:55,139
You want in on it?

1632
01:37:55,217 --> 01:37:59,051
Well, thanks, uh...

1633
01:37:59,154 --> 01:38:01,520
listen, I'll pass up
on that.

1634
01:38:01,624 --> 01:38:03,956
I got to play
at 1 0:00.

1635
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:06,017
All right.
It's on you.

1636
01:38:06,128 --> 01:38:07,823
Good luck tomorrow.

1637
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:09,523
Same to you.

1638
01:38:09,632 --> 01:38:11,725
I got to go rest.

1639
01:38:11,834 --> 01:38:15,201
Uh, come get me
in about three hours, okay?

1640
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:16,862
In three?

1641
01:38:16,972 --> 01:38:18,564
Yeah. Yeah.

1642
01:38:21,143 --> 01:38:22,542
Going good?

1643
01:38:22,645 --> 01:38:25,045
Yeah. Yeah.
We're doing okay.

1644
01:38:25,147 --> 01:38:26,546
You were right.

1645
01:38:26,649 --> 01:38:28,674
We didn't need you anymore.

1646
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:30,981
That's what I said.

1647
01:38:31,053 --> 01:38:34,216
You wouldn't believe
Vincent now.

1648
01:38:34,323 --> 01:38:36,814
Oh, he's a new man, huh?

1649
01:38:36,892 --> 01:38:39,690
Why don't you
take him up on tonight?

1650
01:38:39,762 --> 01:38:43,061
I got to get up early
and play, so...

1651
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,568
Well, see you around.

1652
01:39:13,128 --> 01:39:14,595
[Applause]

1653
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,142
[Applause]

1654
01:39:45,227 --> 01:39:47,661
It's like a nightmare,
isn't it?

1655
01:39:47,763 --> 01:39:50,596
You got lucky,
you lucky prick.

1656
01:40:11,229 --> 01:40:15,256
Wipe your nose,
will you,Julian?

1657
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:18,166
You're going down,
Eddie.

1658
01:40:26,078 --> 01:40:28,342
Oh! Goddamn.

1659
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:30,938
Jesus Christ.

1660
01:40:31,016 --> 01:40:33,450
It keeps getting worse,
doesn't it?

1661
01:40:33,518 --> 01:40:36,453
Take it on off.
I can't help it.

1662
01:40:41,426 --> 01:40:42,324
Eddie.

1663
01:40:42,427 --> 01:40:44,327
Nice game, Eddie.

1664
01:40:44,429 --> 01:40:45,828
Thank you.

1665
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:47,330
Dynamite game, Eddie.

1666
01:40:47,432 --> 01:40:48,831
Good game.

1667
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:56,808
- Excuse me.
- Way to go.

1668
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:58,342
I'm doing fine.

1669
01:40:58,443 --> 01:41:02,379
I'm only feeling nervous
because I feel good.

1670
01:41:02,481 --> 01:41:07,942
Yeah. Eyes feel good,
legs feel great.

1671
01:41:08,019 --> 01:41:10,453
I get no grief down here.

1672
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:13,457
Come on down
and give me some grief.

1673
01:41:13,525 --> 01:41:15,891
Forget the Bahamas.
This is it.

1674
01:41:15,994 --> 01:41:17,052
Hey.

1675
01:41:17,162 --> 01:41:20,154
It would be good
having you here.

1676
01:41:58,370 --> 01:42:01,362
Pow!

1677
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:07,601
Hey.

1678
01:42:08,847 --> 01:42:12,180
I'm going to
beat him, you know.

1679
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:14,377
Well...

1680
01:42:15,887 --> 01:42:18,754
Maybe.

1681
01:42:21,259 --> 01:42:22,726
Hello, Eddie.

1682
01:42:40,745 --> 01:42:43,771
That was nice.

1683
01:42:49,254 --> 01:42:51,620
[Applause]

1684
01:42:51,723 --> 01:42:54,658
...Ron Albrecht
and Larry Schwartz.

1685
01:42:54,759 --> 01:42:56,659
[Applause]

1686
01:42:58,563 --> 01:43:01,123
Following match
on table number eight...

1687
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:04,396
Vincent Lauria
and Eddie Felson.

1688
01:43:04,469 --> 01:43:06,903
[Applause]

1689
01:44:06,464 --> 01:44:08,864
[Applause]

1690
01:46:24,269 --> 01:46:26,703
Hey, you shot
a great game.

1691
01:46:28,706 --> 01:46:31,641
The balls roll funny
for everybody.

1692
01:46:31,709 --> 01:46:33,108
I told you that.

1693
01:46:33,178 --> 01:46:35,203
You shot
a great game.

1694
01:47:05,176 --> 01:47:06,507
Ah!

1695
01:47:17,522 --> 01:47:18,989
[Knock Knock]

1696
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:20,490
Oh, come on.

1697
01:47:20,558 --> 01:47:24,392
Eddie!

1698
01:47:24,496 --> 01:47:26,521
- Who is it?
- Vincent!

1699
01:47:26,598 --> 01:47:29,396
[Knock Knock]

1700
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:31,935
Oh, I can't
believe it.

1701
01:47:35,707 --> 01:47:38,107
Hi, guys.

1702
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:40,109
Should we
come back later?

1703
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:42,111
No. No.
We were just--

1704
01:47:42,213 --> 01:47:44,613
Janelle's having
a glass of cham--

1705
01:47:44,716 --> 01:47:46,616
Early bubbly.
Come on in.

1706
01:47:46,718 --> 01:47:48,117
Listen, I--

1707
01:47:48,219 --> 01:47:50,119
I drew
this guy Kennedy...

1708
01:47:50,221 --> 01:47:52,121
in the semifinals.

1709
01:47:52,223 --> 01:47:54,123
You know anything
about him?

1710
01:47:55,727 --> 01:47:57,591
What's that?

1711
01:47:57,725 --> 01:48:00,626
That's for you.

1712
01:48:00,728 --> 01:48:02,753
- Hey, how you doing? That's your cut.
- Cut of what?

1713
01:48:02,863 --> 01:48:04,592
- For the game.
- What game?

1714
01:48:04,698 --> 01:48:08,862
Our game. Got a front
to lay 4,000 on you. Then I dumped.

1715
01:48:08,936 --> 01:48:12,269
I dogged
about four shots.

1716
01:48:12,373 --> 01:48:15,809
Eddie, you know, you are
a very, very good player.

1717
01:48:15,909 --> 01:48:18,969
I feel shitty about getting booted
but there's other tournaments, right?

1718
01:48:19,079 --> 01:48:21,547
Right.

1719
01:48:21,615 --> 01:48:22,912
You dumped, huh?

1720
01:48:22,983 --> 01:48:24,416
Carmen didn't
want to go for it...

1721
01:48:24,485 --> 01:48:26,385
but I told her
you would appreciate it.

1722
01:48:26,453 --> 01:48:28,978
There's $8,000 there.

1723
01:48:29,089 --> 01:48:32,149
After I beat Grady Seasons,
the odds were a joke.

1724
01:48:32,259 --> 01:48:35,160
Two brothers
and a stranger.

1725
01:48:35,262 --> 01:48:38,163
It was beautiful.
It was fuckin' beautiful.

1726
01:48:38,265 --> 01:48:40,756
When I banked the 5--
When I saw the table...

1727
01:48:40,834 --> 01:48:42,096
I knew it was
going to be the 5.

1728
01:48:44,004 --> 01:48:48,304
To be able to just
miss the pocket by a hair...

1729
01:48:48,409 --> 01:48:49,842
I mean,
the audience...''Oh!''

1730
01:48:49,943 --> 01:48:53,106
It was...
It was... I...

1731
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:58,015
$8,000 in there.

1732
01:48:58,118 --> 01:48:59,585
We got to split.

1733
01:48:59,653 --> 01:49:02,087
I got green room games
for the next three nights.

1734
01:49:02,156 --> 01:49:04,021
These guys won't
leave me alone.

1735
01:49:04,124 --> 01:49:06,092
You sure you don't want in on this?
We're talking a lot of money.

1736
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,186
Yeah. Maybe.

1737
01:49:09,296 --> 01:49:11,594
Okay.

1738
01:49:11,665 --> 01:49:13,860
I'll call you, okay?

1739
01:49:13,967 --> 01:49:16,697
Look, good luck
with Kennedy, all right?

1740
01:49:21,175 --> 01:49:24,667
He's a little prick.

1741
01:49:24,778 --> 01:49:26,643
Ladies and gentlemen...

1742
01:49:26,713 --> 01:49:30,171
it's good to see you here
for the semifinals...

1743
01:49:30,284 --> 01:49:32,184
of today's 9-ball classic.

1744
01:49:32,286 --> 01:49:34,186
Right now on table one...

1745
01:49:34,288 --> 01:49:37,519
will be, from Chicago,
Larry Schwartz.

1746
01:49:37,624 --> 01:49:39,558
Larry will be playing...

1747
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:42,060
St. Louis, Missouri...

1748
01:49:44,665 --> 01:49:46,064
[Applause]

1749
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:57,201
...regional 9-ball champion
Lorenzo Kennedy...

1750
01:49:57,311 --> 01:50:00,246
will be playing,
as we welcome back...

1751
01:50:00,347 --> 01:50:01,905
Fast Eddie Felson.

1752
01:50:02,015 --> 01:50:03,414
[Applause]

1753
01:50:06,186 --> 01:50:09,087
Players,
begin your matches.

1754
01:50:52,299 --> 01:50:54,233
What are you
doing?

1755
01:50:54,301 --> 01:50:55,734
I forfeit.

1756
01:50:55,802 --> 01:50:56,791
Forfeit.

1757
01:50:56,904 --> 01:50:58,701
What do you mean,
forfeit?

1758
01:50:58,772 --> 01:51:00,205
You can't forfeit.

1759
01:51:00,274 --> 01:51:02,242
What's he talking about?

1760
01:51:02,309 --> 01:51:04,140
He threw
50,000 away.

1761
01:51:04,244 --> 01:51:06,212
Come on, Eddie.
Don't forfeit.

1762
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:09,249
I don't want
to win like this.

1763
01:51:09,316 --> 01:51:12,285
I don't want
to win like that, though.

1764
01:51:31,972 --> 01:51:33,906
The match on table three...

1765
01:51:33,974 --> 01:51:37,341
has been forfeited
by Eddie Felson.

1766
01:51:37,444 --> 01:51:40,777
Lorenzo Kennedy,
win by default.

1767
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:42,280
[Applause]

1768
01:51:51,858 --> 01:51:53,257
What do you say?

1769
01:51:53,327 --> 01:51:56,785
Why don't we get
the hell out of here?

1770
01:51:58,832 --> 01:52:03,269
The Bahamas are looking
real good to me about now.

1771
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:06,773
Anyway, I got out
of my lease.

1772
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,308
All my stuff's
in boxes.

1773
01:52:09,376 --> 01:52:10,809
That's nice.

1774
01:52:10,877 --> 01:52:14,313
I'm a real big fan
of character in people.

1775
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:17,817
I don't know
if you knew that about me.

1776
01:52:17,884 --> 01:52:19,317
Character, huh?

1777
01:52:19,386 --> 01:52:20,478
Yeah.

1778
01:52:23,123 --> 01:52:24,681
Here it comes.

1779
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:38,304
Vincent says
this is yours.

1780
01:52:38,372 --> 01:52:40,237
You don't want it...

1781
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:42,808
you should give it
to charity.

1782
01:52:42,876 --> 01:52:44,810
What will that solve?

1783
01:52:44,878 --> 01:52:46,846
I don't know
anything anymore.

1784
01:52:46,913 --> 01:52:48,847
I want his best game.

1785
01:52:48,915 --> 01:52:51,315
Then go talk
to him yourself.

1786
01:52:51,385 --> 01:52:53,319
He won't
listen to me.

1787
01:52:53,387 --> 01:52:56,356
So I got to cover
your ass now?

1788
01:52:56,423 --> 01:52:58,891
No. You got to
save it.

1789
01:52:58,992 --> 01:53:00,687
Why should I?

1790
01:53:04,398 --> 01:53:06,730
I'll be in
the green room.

1791
01:53:32,192 --> 01:53:35,025
Stings like a bitch,
don't it?

1792
01:53:35,095 --> 01:53:36,426
Yes, it does.

1793
01:53:42,436 --> 01:53:45,428
You got brass, man.
I'll give you that.

1794
01:53:45,539 --> 01:53:46,699
You want my game?

1795
01:53:46,773 --> 01:53:48,764
You couldn't deal
with my game.

1796
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:53,778
I ain't got a leg to stand on,
but I'm asking you.

1797
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,938
Shove it!

1798
01:53:55,048 --> 01:53:56,140
Don't do that.

1799
01:53:56,249 --> 01:53:58,615
I call the shots.

1800
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:01,779
I don't have that many games
left in me.

1801
01:54:01,888 --> 01:54:05,289
God! You used us!
You used me!

1802
01:54:05,392 --> 01:54:07,053
Yes, I did...

1803
01:54:07,127 --> 01:54:10,324
but you're in Atlantic City now
with the big boys.

1804
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:13,888
You're not back there
playing around with baby dolls.

1805
01:54:13,967 --> 01:54:17,994
Think about it.
It's a wash.

1806
01:54:18,105 --> 01:54:20,903
About all that
other stuff...

1807
01:54:20,974 --> 01:54:24,137
I don't take
much pride in that.

1808
01:54:24,244 --> 01:54:26,144
It's even,
but it ain't settled.

1809
01:54:26,246 --> 01:54:27,270
Let's settle it.

1810
01:54:27,347 --> 01:54:28,814
Why should I?

1811
01:54:28,915 --> 01:54:31,748
How long do you want me to fry?
5 years? 1 0 years?

1812
01:54:31,818 --> 01:54:35,948
You want to play kick the dog
for the rest of your life?

1813
01:54:36,022 --> 01:54:38,820
Come on.
Let's clean it up.

1814
01:54:54,875 --> 01:54:57,776
You want to play for the envelope?
Is that it?

1815
01:54:57,844 --> 01:55:00,005
Whatever.

1816
01:55:14,895 --> 01:55:16,362
Thank you.

1817
01:55:20,467 --> 01:55:22,332
Eddie,
what will you do...

1818
01:55:22,402 --> 01:55:24,336
when I kick
your ass?

1819
01:55:24,404 --> 01:55:27,862
Pick myself up
and let you kick me again.

1820
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:30,637
Oh, yeah?

1821
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:32,041
Yeah.

1822
01:55:32,145 --> 01:55:35,308
Just don't put the money
in the bank, kid.

1823
01:55:35,382 --> 01:55:37,816
If I don't
whip you now...

1824
01:55:37,884 --> 01:55:40,819
I'll whip you
next month in Dallas.

1825
01:55:40,887 --> 01:55:41,819
Houston.

1826
01:55:41,888 --> 01:55:43,321
Houston, Dallas.

1827
01:55:43,390 --> 01:55:46,382
If not, a month after that
in New Orleans.

1828
01:55:46,493 --> 01:55:49,758
What makes you
so sure?

1829
01:55:54,734 --> 01:55:57,669
Hey, I'm back.

1830
01:57:09,429 --> 01:57:13,729
* I feel so
doggone lonely *

1831
01:57:16,235 --> 01:57:21,434
* Today just
isn't my day *

1832
01:57:23,309 --> 01:57:28,440
* When I got home
this mornin' *

1833
01:57:31,150 --> 01:57:35,450
* I found a letter
on my bed *

1834
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:42,457
* When I opened up
that letter *

1835
01:57:44,664 --> 01:57:49,658
* I broke right down
and cried *

1836
01:57:52,472 --> 01:57:56,340
* She said, now, daddy,
I hate to leave you *

1837
01:57:56,442 --> 01:57:58,706
* Oh, yeah *

1838
01:57:58,811 --> 01:58:03,646
* But I'm in love
with another guy *

1839
01:58:03,716 --> 01:58:05,616
* Oh no, no *

1840
01:58:05,685 --> 01:58:08,119
* I couldn't believe *

1841
01:58:08,187 --> 01:58:11,554
* I couldn't believe
she wrote it *

1842
01:58:12,892 --> 01:58:18,626
* So I read her letter again *

1843
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:25,398
* And when I was finished *

1844
01:58:27,707 --> 01:58:32,906
* The tears came down
like rain *

1845
01:58:34,413 --> 01:58:38,816
* The more I read
this doggone letter *

1846
01:58:41,921 --> 01:58:46,824
* The more
my poor heart cries *

1847
01:58:49,162 --> 01:58:53,326
* She said, now daddy,
I hate to leave you *

1848
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:55,492
* Oh yeah *

1849
01:58:55,568 --> 01:59:01,165
* But I'm in love
with another guy *

1850
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:03,765
* My baby, she said *

1851
01:59:05,077 --> 01:59:09,241
* Oh yeah
my baby, she said *

1852
01:59:09,348 --> 01:59:12,181
* My baby, she said *

1853
01:59:12,251 --> 01:59:15,550
* My baby, she said *

1854
01:59:15,621 --> 01:59:17,452
* This what she said *

1855
01:59:17,557 --> 01:59:21,857
* She said, now daddy,
I hate to leave you *

1856
01:59:21,928 --> 01:59:23,896
* Oh yeah *

1857
01:59:23,963 --> 01:59:28,366
* But I'm in love
with another guy **
