00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,040
- [ Bell Rings ]
- [ Girl ] Excuse me, Mr Tate.

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
[ Groans ]

161
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,800
[ Woman ] Try to remember, Harry,
the projector's got teeth.

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,400
[ Coughs ]
Sharp ones.

163
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920
[ Harry ] We should be getting hazard
pay for this sort of faulty equipment.

164
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,160
-[ Nurse ] Yeah, right.
-[ Man ] Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.

165
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
- I, uh-- I called you this weekend.
- [ Gasping, Coughs ]

166
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
I got your machine.
How's your cold?

167
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
- [ Harper ] Oh, I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?

168
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,720
- [ Sneezes ]
- [ Brummel ] A bit tired,
but no complaints.

169
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,840
- Oh.
- I-l got it.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,880
Can we say,
"retirement"?

171
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
- [ Gasps ]
- Maybe you should just go home.

172
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
[ Sighs ]
No, thank you.

173
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,800
I'm saving my sick days
for when I feel better.

174
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
[ Sighs ]

175
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,520
Maybe I should just put
a pen in my eye.

176
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,520
[ Tate Sighs ]

177
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
When will that bitch turn
the air conditioning back on?

178
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,760
[ Male Teacher ] Hey, speaking of which,
has anybody seen Principal Drake?

179
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
[ Tate ] Oh, maybe she had
a sunstroke and died.

180
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
[ Coach Gulping Water ]

181
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,440
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.

182
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,760
[ Tate ]
Probably a pregame ritual.

183
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,480
Just looking at him
makes me want to take a piss.

184
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Good morning, Mrs Olson.

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
You look
very, very pretty today.

186
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,360
So, um...
what was Crusoe's...

187
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,280
greatest fear?

188
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
Anyone?

189
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Uh, yes, Zeke.

190
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be
stuck on that island forever...

191
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
with nothing but calluses.

192
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
- [ Classmates Chuckle ]
- [ Teacher ] No, that's not correct.

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,840
Isolation
was his greatest fear.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,040
Yes, but...

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
his external existence
in no way compared...

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,520
to the internal agony
of the loneliness he felt.

197
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,280
That's very good.

198
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,280
- Like I said, calluses.
- [ Classmates Chuckle ]

199
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,800
[ Girl ] So Cathy tells me one thing,
and then Liz says another...

200
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,720
and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story,

201
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,800
so which one
do you want me to print?

202
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,720
Print them all.
He's a jerk.

203
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,960
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.

204
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,880
Could we back-burner it?

205
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,760
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?

206
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?

207
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,680
- What brought this on?
- [ Sighs ]

209
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, I've been weighing
the importance of being a jock...

210
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,360
- with my impending future,
and I decided--
- You just decided?

211
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
Stan, what about college? The football
scholarship is your only shot.

212
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,920
If I quit now, I can work
harder at studying,

213
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,320
maybe raise
my grades a little.

214
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,040
I'd rather go to college...
based on my intellect.

215
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,040
You're not good
at studying.

216
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,520
Yeah, I've always been good
at football and basketball
and every other sport I try.

218
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,200
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.

219
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,080
And what am I supposed to do
while you're on a yellow-brick
quest for a brain?

220
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,240
- What?
- The accepted social order...

221
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,000
is head cheerleaders date star
quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.

222
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,240
Don't be superficial.

223
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,040
"Superficial."
Four syllables.

224
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,320
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,360
Let me know how
the cancer cure goes.

226
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,080
[ Bell Rings ]

227
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,600
[ Sighs ] I was hoping
you'd be with me on this.

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,280
[ Student Coughing ]

229
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Now, if everyone will turn
to chapter four:

230
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,040
"The Nation of the State."

231
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,240
"Only through conformity
among the masses...

232
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,000
can the unified state offer the benefits
of power order and security."

233
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
Actually, we covered that
last week, Mr Tate.

234
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,200
We're on chapter five.

235
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,640
[ Sighs ]
Whatever.

236
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,280
Now if you could all please
join Stan on chapter five:

237
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,200
"lndividual Action in Society."

238
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,040
# Short circulated #

239
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,040
# Sleeping through
the dopamine #

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,840
# When you've got nothing
you've got nothing to fear ##

241
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
[ Marybeth ]
What are you reading?

242
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.

243
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,120
You one of those
science fiction people?

244
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Y'all believe in alternate universes
and alien beings and stuff?

245
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,480
I'm feeling pretty alien
myself today.

246
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta. I'm new here.

247
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,280
- No shit.
- What's your name?

248
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,960
Why do you want
to know my name?

249
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,440
'Cause I don't have
any friends.

250
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem
to have one less than that.

251
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,880
- So I just thought--
- Stokely, are you seducing
the new students again?

252
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,800
Hi. I'm Delilah.

253
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.

254
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,920
Don't you love the way Stokely
accessorizes different shades
of black in her ensemble?

255
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,160
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist...

256
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,440
on being such a bad example
for your people.

257
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,480
- What people?
- I hope you're not a violent
lesbian like your new friend.

258
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,520
[ Marybeth ]
Uh, no.

259
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm not aware of any lesbianism
in my lineage.

260
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,040
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just
have to keep looking for Miss Right.

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,880
Bipolar bitch.

262
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
[ Sighs ]
Violent.

263
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah.

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,760
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.

265
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,800
This ain't the cafeteria, son.

266
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.

267
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,000
You're, uh--

268
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,680
- I forget your name.
- Casey.

269
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,720
Right.
I've seen you around.

270
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,720
You're not really
into sports.

271
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,560
I don't think a person should run
unless he's being chased.

272
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,680
"Being chased."

273
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,760
I like that.

274
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
Get outta here.

275
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,040
- Mrs Brummel,
may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.

276
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,880
Man, get a fucking eye dog.

277
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,560
Maybe if you didn't paint
your fucking eyes shut.

278
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,240
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.

279
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
Found something
on the football field.

280
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,080
Thought you might want
to take a look.

281
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,120
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

282
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,040
Want to be
lab partners?

283
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,880
I didn't know
you were a lesbian.

284
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
I don't think
I've ever met one before.

285
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Have you been out long?

286
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,160
I think it's very impressive
and evolved of you--

287
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm not a lesbian,
all right?

288
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,560
Be one. Please.
Fly free.

289
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,720
You were right about me. I don't have
any friends, and I like it that way.

290
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,520
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?

291
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,360
People like you.

292
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,040
[ Laughs ]

293
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,040
Complex.

294
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,880
Certain mesozoan...

295
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,600
only exist in the kidney
of certain squid and octopi.

296
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,840
- Which doesn't make sense because--
- This is Ohio.

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,480
Right.

298
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,320
It's a pelagic organism.

299
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,080
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.

300
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Exactly.

301
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,760
But I don't recognize
this surface tissue at all.

302
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,840
Casey, I don't want to blow
smoke up your butt, but I think
you found a new species.

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
[ Scoffs ]
Yeah, right.

304
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,080
It could happen. New species
are discovered every day.

305
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,400
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?

306
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
- No.
- They escaped detection
till the mid-20th century.

307
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
You just know
everything.

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
I'm a contradiction.

309
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,200
Check the mesodermic follicles

as stealing, actually.

768
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,440
- [ Giggles ]
- Just doing my part to
the deconstruction of America.

769
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,960
So if anybody
finds us in here,

770
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,040
just grab ahold of me and pretend
we're making out.

771
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,640
The punishment
will be less severe.

772
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,840
# I don't need
an education #

773
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,120
# I learned all I need
from you #

774
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,840
# They've got me
on some medication ##

775
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
- [ Stan ] Aliens?
- [ Casey ] Do you have
a better explanation, Stan?

776
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,520
[ Stan ] Great. Just listen
to yourselves. Our teachers are aliens?
