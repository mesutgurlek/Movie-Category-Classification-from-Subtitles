...for being the daughter of the wolf.

990
01:32:17,695 --> 01:32:19,185
Peter.

991
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,131
PETER: I have to leave.

992
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:26,296
You won't be safe with me...

993
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:29,132
...until I learn how to protect you from....

994
01:33:13,884 --> 01:33:15,408
I'll wait for you.

995
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:17,918
I thought you'd say that.

996
01:33:43,948 --> 01:33:47,315
VALERIE: It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.

997
01:33:49,287 --> 01:33:54,725
With time, my mother finally realized
that Father would never return.

998
01:33:58,462 --> 01:34:00,123
Henry found his courage.

999
01:34:01,098 --> 01:34:06,126
He chose a life of honor,
protecting us from darkness.

1000
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,632
Daggerhorn fell back
into its old rhythms.

1001
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,710
The wolf didn't come back.

1002
01:34:15,146 --> 01:34:17,046
But the village still lived in fear.

1003
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:20,179
It was the only life they knew.

1004
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:28,023
I could no longer live there.

1005
01:34:29,727 --> 01:34:33,163
I felt more freedom
in the shadows of the forest.

1006
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:37,626
To live apart carries its own dangers.

1007
01:34:38,035 --> 01:34:39,730
But of those...

1008
01:34:40,171 --> 01:34:42,332
...I am less afraid.

1009
01:34:44,008 --> 01:34:45,032
