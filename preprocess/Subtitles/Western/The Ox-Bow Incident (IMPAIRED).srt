1
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,294
Looks deader
than a Paiute's grave.

2
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,463
Well?

3
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,465
That guy's awful slow
gettin' there.

4
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,467
I feel sorry for him.

5
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,231
Always in reach and never able
to do anything about it.

6
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,367
I got a feeling
she could do better.

7
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,378
You're boasting.

8
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,573
- What'll you have? Whiskey?
- What've you got?

9
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,811
- Whiskey.
- You ever see such a guy?

10
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:42,980
All winter I've been thinking--
And all he's got is whiskey.

11
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:45,148
- That's rotten, ain't it?
- Rotten.

12
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,092
Two glasses
and a bottle.

[ Clears Throat ]

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,841
Well, what's on
you boys' mind?

15
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:16,911
- Does somethin'
have to be on my mind?
- Well, there's mud in your eye.

16
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:34,372
Friendly cuss, ain't he?

17
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,705
He's just getting around
to asking if his girl is still in town.

18
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,871
His girl? If you mean
Rose Mapen, no.

19
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:44,541
She went to Frisco
the first stage out this spring.

20
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:47,450
That's a lie.
She said she'd wait.

21
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,886
It's a fact.

22
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,753
What a town.

23
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:58,160
It's my guess
the married women run her out.

24
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, no tar and feathers.
No rails.

25
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,160
They just righteously
made her feel uncomfortable.

26
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,005
Not that she ever
did anything, but--

27
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,735
They just couldn't get over
being afraid she might.

28
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,169
Say, what is there
to do in this town anyway?

29
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,307
- Unless you wanna get in line
and woo Drew's daughter.
- We don't.

30
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:22,514
The only other
unmarried woman I know
is 82, blind and a Paiute.

31
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:26,290
That leaves you five choices.

32
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:30,920
Eat, sleep, drink,
play poker or fight.

33
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,930
Or you can shoot some pool.

34
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:36,195
- I got a new table in the back room.
- That's just great.

35
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,311
- I see Risley's still around.
- The sheriff?

36
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,747
I thought he never
got closer than Reno
except on special calls.

37
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:56,186
Hey, it wouldn't be
that rustling folks we're
talking about last fall?

38
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,084
Could be.

39
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:04,018
Gettin' to be a kinda
touchy subject, huh?

40
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,395
They don't like
to talk about it except
with fellows they sleep with.

41
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:10,458
- Afraid they'll find out
it's somebody they know?
- Maybe.

42
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:13,061
- They lose some more this spring?
- Some.

43
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,505
- How many?
- About 600 head.

44
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,508
They got any leads?

45
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:21,603
They picked up a small-herd
trail and signs of shod horses
down the south draw.

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,114
Wouldn't everybody know
if there were strangers around?

47
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,242
Sure.
And there hadn't been any.

48
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,252
Except you two.

49
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,316
- That ain't funny.
- [ Chuckles ]
Now who's touchy?

50
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,791
You're talking about my business.
Stick to my pleasures.

51
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,387
No offense, Carter.
I just wanted to let you know
where you two stand.

52
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,432
- Listen--
- Take it easy, Gil.

53
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,093
He's had five whiskeys,
and he's sore about Rose Mapen.

54
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,263
- Keep your mouth shut
about Rose, see.
- Okay, Gil.

55
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:49,068
I was just jokin'.
You can take a joke, can't you?

56
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,268
Sure I can take a joke.
Some jokes.

57
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:54,107
Lost any
over your way?

58
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,978
No more than the winter
and the coyotes are to account for.

59
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,574
You haven't got any ideas,
have you Farnley?

60
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,779
Except not to have ideas.

61
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,089
Make that clear.

62
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,925
There are a lot of things
around here ain't clear.

63
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,935
You still talkin'
about rustling?

00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,834

He just needed exercise.

or confused in his mind...

No, a bottle.

- Why should I?
- Because you hit him pretty hard.

You made him look foolish.

It's a good 500 miles

Besides, there may
be a bunch of'em.

It won't help Kinkaid now
to get yourself killed.

idea which way they went.

to get what we go after.

Okay. Make your posse.

It ain't just a rustler
we're after. It's a murderer.

133

is lying out there right now
with a bullet hole in his head.

there won't be nothing
safe around here.

And if nobody else
will do it...

141
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,644
Come on, boys.
Get your guns!

142
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,950
Listen to me, men!
Don't lose your heads like this.

143
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:07,048
You mustn't do this thing.
You must not!

144
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,320
Shut up, Grandma.
Nobody expects you to go.

145
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:14,428
Don't take it so hard, Mr. Davies.
You did all you could.

146
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,832
- Will you do me a favor, Carter?
- That depends.

147
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:21,634
I'm sending Joyce here
for the sheriff and Judge Tyler.

148
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,868
I want you to go along
and help explain.

I'm no rustler though.
I didn't steal 'em!

00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,335
I bought 'em
and paid hard cash for them.

528
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,739
My own cattle were so bad,
I didn't want to risk bringin' 'em up.

529
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,541
So I sold them out at Salinas,
and I had to stock up again.
