LIKE JOHN CHISUM'S.

336
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,018
YES, SIR. THEY HAVE.

337
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,128
AND YOU HAVE, TOO.

338
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,119
HOWEVER...

339
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,132
YOU'RE ONE,

340
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,634
AND THE MURPHY-DOLAN RUSTLERS
ARE MANY.

341
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,136
IF YOU CAN TESTIFY
AGAINST WHAT YOU SAW

342
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,138
IN YOUR LITTLE WAR,

343
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:21,699
I CAN THEN ELIMINATE
THE MANY.

344
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,713
WELL...

345
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,432
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE?

346
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,150
MY TERMS ARE SIMPLE--

347
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,154
YOUR TESTIMONY AGAINST THOSE
WHO MURDERED YOUR EMPLOYER

348
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:34,756
IN EXCHANGE FOR LENIENCY.

349
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,155
NO.

350
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,762
MY TESTIMONY IN EXCHANGE
FOR A FULL PARDON.

351
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,798
WELL,
I'M AFRAID THAT'S--

352
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,166
I TESTIFY,

353
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,795
AND I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN
A FREE MAN.

354
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,006
IF NOT,
I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN NOW.

355
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,420
ANY OF YOUR BOYS
TRY TO FOLLOW ME,

356
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:55,833
THEY'LL WIND UP
IN A PINE BOX.

357
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,059
IF YOU
WERE GIVEN PARDON,

358
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,928
YOU WOULD LEAVE
NEW MEXICO,

359
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,920
NEVER TO RETURN?

360
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:20,935
YOU GO ON THE STAND

361
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,566
AND HELP ME HANG
15 RUSTLERS,

362
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,197
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
PARDON.

363
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,978
HA HA HA HA!

364
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,013
OF COURSE,
15 MINUTES LATER,

365
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:36,218
THE MURPHY BOYS WILL SHOOT YOU
DEAD AS A MANGY DOG

366
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,018
IN THE STREET.

367
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,020
SO WE'LL ARREST YOU,

368
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,057
A STAGED ARREST
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION

369
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,217
BEFORE THE TRIAL.

370
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,641
BUT THAT'S FOR YOU
TO DECIDE.

371
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,223
CAN I HAVE
SOME OF THAT CAKE?

372
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,098
PENDLETON.

373
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,104
UH-UH, PENDLETON.

374
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,041
UH-UH.

375
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,079
THE, UH...
THE WHITE CAKE

376
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,172
WITH THE SWEET FROST.

377
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:19,193
SO...

378
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,183
SHALL WE PROCLAIM

379
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,187
OUR SECRET PARLEY
A SUCCESS?

380
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,192
IT'S A DEAL.

381
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,198
WHEN THE NECK IS BROKEN,
THERE'S ONLY A SHARP PAIN, FAST.

382
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,201
THEN IF THE OTHER PLACE
ACCEPTS YOU,

383
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,213
THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES.

384
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,206
IT TAKES YOU THERE
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

385
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,218
SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.

386
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,210
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SPIRIT HORSE.

387
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,211
SHE'LL COME FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.

388
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,213
GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CHAVEZ.

389
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,228
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CATCH
A SPIRIT HORSE.

390
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,229
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE
THE OTHER SIDE.

391
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,232
I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANNA
HAVE MY NECK BROKE

392
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,233
THROUGH A SHARP, QUICK PAIN.

393
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,169
THE ONLY THING
I REALLY WANT TO DO

394
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,171
IS GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

395
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,160
ME, TOO.

396
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,190
[APPLAUSE]

397
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:25,182
WELL DONE, WILLIAM.
SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.

398
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,251
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
THREE CANDLES LEFT

399
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,187
AND ONLY TWO BULLETS.

400
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,200
[GUNSHOT]

401
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:35,202
SPLENDID, SPLENDID!

402
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:37,305
WHAT DID I SAY?
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

403
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:39,206
MR. BONNEY...

404
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:43,211
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RYNERSON'S
HERE TO SEE YOU.

405
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,202
THE GOVERNOR
THINKS IT'S BEST

406
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:47,338
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR RESTRAINTS ON.

407
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:49,205
HEY, SHERIFF?

408
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,220
CAN YOU BRING THAT
FIDDLE PLAYER IN AGAIN?

409
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,354
HE WAS QUITE GOOD.

410
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:56,224
HOW ABOUT SOME MORE CAKE
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?

411
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,226
AND IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE NIPPY IN HERE.

412
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,228
COULD YOU STOKE UP
THAT FIRE?

413
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,162
THANKS, GEORGE.

414
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,329
YES, SIR.

415
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,168
I WAS STARTING TO GROW FOND
OF PRISON LIFE.

416
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:10,160
TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU, MR. BONNEY.

417
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,173
FINALLY IN CHAINS,
ARE YOU?

418
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,404
STILL TRYING TO
KEEP UP YOUR GAME?

419
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,405
WELL,
WE'LL BE SEEING YOU

420
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,181
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE COURTS VERY SOON.

421
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:21,415
I AIN'T BEING TRIED.

422
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,418
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST DOLAN
AND ALL THE OTHER SWINE

423
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,804
WHO KILLED MY FRIEND
JOHN TUNSTALL. YES, SIR.

424
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:28,189
ARE THE BLOODY COCKS
STILL RUNNING THE COOP?

425
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,458
AH, TO BE SURE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

426
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,193
HA HA HA!

427
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,455
HMM.

428
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,199
WHO GIVES TESTIMONY

429
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,202
IS STRICTLY
WITHIN THE DISCRETION

430
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,204
OF THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY,

431
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,205
WHO HAPPENS TO BE ME,

432
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:49,210
WHO HAPPENS TO THINK
NOT A BLOODY CHANCE

433
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:51,542
IN THE PIT OF HADES.

434
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,203
UGH!

435
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,218
YOU CAN'T BLUFF ME.

436
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,585
NO.

437
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:01,523
I'LL CHARGE YOU,
SENTENCE YOU.

438
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,158
I WILLHANG YOU...

439
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,162
BUT I'D NEVER
BLUFF YOU.

440
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:09,562
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

441
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:15,603
THE GOVERNOR'S ON HIS WAY
BACK TO SANTA FE NOW.

442
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,605
PARDON BILLY THE KID!
IMPOSSIBLE!

443
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,609
I SHOULD HAVE DUSTED
HIS EXCELLENCY'S REGAL ASS

444
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,610
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

445
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:26,180
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
LIE TO ME.

446
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,184
HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER
AGAINST THE IRISH POLITICIANS

447
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,652
WHO WERE STILL RUNNING
LINCOLN COUNTY.

448
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,679
GOOD DAY, MR. BONNEY.

449
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,195
GOOD DAY, MR. DUNG PILE.

450
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,686
HA HA HA!

00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,734
AIN'T THAT A BEAUT?

00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,723
HA HA HA!

453
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:50,738
ANOTHER HISTORICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL FACT

454
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,208
WAS THAT
I HAD SMALL HANDS

455
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,768
AND BIG WRISTS.

456
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,213
AND THAT HAS SAVED MY LIFE

457
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,966
MORE TIMES
THAN COLONEL COLT'S EQUALIZER.

458
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,719
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING
NEAR TO SUPPER TIME.

459

OF NEWS FOR YOU--

GOOD AND BAD.

00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,978
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BAD NEWS FIRST.

ALL WE GOT FOR SUPPER
IS HORSESHIT.

HA HA HA HA!

THE GOOD NEWS?

00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,216
OH, YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW
ALL RIGHT, DOC.

817
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,219
YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW.

818
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,723
YOU'RE BILLY THE KID,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

819
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:53,227
YOU ALL ARE
DIRTY LITTLE BILLY BASTARDS,

820
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:57,231
AND I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING, DOC.

821
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:58,865
OR YOU, CHAVEZ...

822
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:01,801
YOU TOOK MY FARM,
MR. CHISUM.

823
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,173
YOU TOOK A LOT OF FARMS,
MR. CHISUM.

824
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,843
AS LONG AS BILLY THE KID
IS TAKING SOME BACK,

825
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,174
I'M WITH HIM.

826
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:14,848
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHISUM?

827
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,368
YES, YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

828
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,623
UH...GO ON AND BRING
THE MEN IN,

829
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,878
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FRESH COFFEE

830
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,891
WITH THE BOYS HERE.

831
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,191
YOO-HOO!

832
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:27,927
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS.

833
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:29,930
MR. CHISUM, WHICH ONE
OF THESE BOYS

834
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,198
IS THE FASTEST
WITH THE IRON?

835
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,927
DON'T YOU DO IT,
BILLY.

836
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,202
THAT BE ME.

837
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:37,203
YOU.

838
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:38,972
DROP SAM COLT.

839
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,206
BILLY...

840
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:41,970
PUT HER DOWN NOW.

841
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,973
STEP AWAY.

842
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:54,220
YOU OWE ME $5OO,
MR. CHISUM,

843
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:58,225
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS KILL ONE OF YOUR MEN

844
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:00,694
FOR EVERY $5.OO YOU OWE ME.

845
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:03,162
ONLY I'M GOING TO
DO IT FAIR.

846
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,166
HOW'S THAT FOR SQUARE?

847
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,079
NOW, WHEN I GO FOR MY GUN,

848
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,179
YOU START SHOOTING.

849
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,082
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.

850
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,187
READY?

851
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,123
YEAH, I'M READY.

852
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:34,184
DAVE.

853
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,200
OH, MY GOD!

854
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,191
495.

855
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,195
HENDRY.

856
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,204
OH, MY GOD!

857
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:52,201
HENDRY.

858
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,219
49O.

859
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,154
YOU JUST KILLED YOURSELF.

860
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,160
BONNEY, YOU ARE A FOOL!

861
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:12,165
YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SCOURGE OF NEW MEXICO?

862
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:16,169
WELL, BY GOD,
IAMNEW MEXICO,

863
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,172
AND YOU ARE DEAD.

864
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,173
HA HA!

865
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:23,176
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MR. NEW MEXICO.

866
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,178
I WOULDN'T GIVE
A BUCKET OF PISS

867
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:27,169
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

868
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:30,182
SKIN OUT, BOYS.

869
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:33,175
YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD DAY NOW.

870
00:44:41,194 --> 00:44:42,261
I WANT HIM DEAD.

871
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,264
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S PROTECTED

872
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,266
BY THE SURROUNDING
COMMUNITIES.

873
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,200
THEY'VE
MADE A BLOODY HERO

874
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,203
OUT OF A HALF-WIT
COMMON HORSE THIEF.

875
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:51,295
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!

876
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:56,309
LET'S HIRE A THIEF
TO CATCH ONE.

877
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,212
NOW BRING HIM IN,
GOVERNOR,

878
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:00,270
AND MAKE THE OFFER.

879
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,149
PENDLETON.

880
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,411
IF I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE
TO BE, UH...

881
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,179
IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING,

882
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,182
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A FAMILY MAN,

883
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:37,416
FIXING TO SETTLE
AND RUN A BUSINESS.

884
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,181
MR. CHISUM HAS INFORMED US
OF YOUR AMBITIONS,

885
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:41,454
MR. GARRETT.

886
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:44,191
NOW, WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WITH BILLY BONNEY

887
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:46,694
SEVERAL TIMES
WHEN HE CUT MY HERD.

888
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:49,096
NOW, PAT,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY

889
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,649
WHO KNOWS HIS HAUNTS,
HIS, UH, HIDEOUTS,

890
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,201
SOMEBODY WHO'S FAMILIAR
WITH HIS PATTERNS.

891
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:57,204
YOUAREFAMILIAR WITH HIM,
MR. GARRETT.

892
00:45:57,205 --> 00:46:00,206
YOU SEE, PATRICK...

893
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,476
CERTAIN CHANGES
NEED TO BE STRUCTURED.

894
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:04,143
WE NEED A SHERIFF

895
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:06,146
WHO CAN ELIMINATE
THIS PARTICULAR...

896
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,477
PROBLEM.

897
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:12,319
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

898
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,155
WE'RE SAYING
SHERIFF OF LINCOLN COUNTY.

899
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:17,156
SHERIFF PAT GARRETT.

900
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:20,560
NOW THAT OUGHT TO
MAKE YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

901
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:24,564
AND WE'RE SAYING $5OO...

902
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:26,156

AND 5OO AFTER.

904
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:31,604
$1,OOO, MR. GARRETT.

905
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:34,107
AND ALL THE RESOURCES
YOU NEED

906
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,610
TO CARRY OUT
THE EXTERMINATION

907
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:39,613
OF ONE
WILLIAM H. BONNEY.

908
00:46:39,614 --> 00:46:43,174
IS THAT SATISFACTORY?

909
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,191
WHILE PAT WAS THINKING

910
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:55,194
ABOUT THE SANTA FE RING'S
GENEROUS OFFER,

911
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:58,164
ME AND THE BOYS WERE BUSY
SORTING OUT OUR FINANCES.

912
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:01,134
WE FIGURED THAT IF IT WAS
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP

913
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:03,136
FOR CHISUM
TO GIVE US ANY MONEY...

914
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:05,137
HOWDY.

915
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:07,140
WELL,
THEN WE'D HELP HIM OUT

916
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,643
AND JUST TAKE
A FEW OF HIS COWS.

917
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:12,145
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

918
00:47:12,146 --> 00:47:13,145
YOU'RE CALLED KID,

919
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:15,148
AND RUDABAUGH'S
CALLED ARKANSAS DAVE,

920
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,149
AND, UH, I DARESAY

921
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,152
DOC'S CHRISTIAN NAME
AIN'T DOC.

922
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:21,153
YOU WANT A NAME.

923
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,155
YES, SIR.
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

924
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:26,159
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH INDEED.

925
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,
HENDRY.

926
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:31,164
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH PLAIN OLD HENDRY.

927
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:32,222
SORRY.

928
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,225
[RINGING]

929
00:47:58,191 --> 00:47:59,351
[CLICK]

930
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,379
STILL TRYING TO GET
THIS RAG SHEET

931
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,146
OFF THE GROUND, ASH?

932
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:24,383
THE COPY IS GOOD.
THE MACHINE IS BAD.

933
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:26,152
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OPENING UP AN EATING HOUSE,

934
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,141
GARRETT.

935
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,156
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SECURE
AN ADVERTISEMENT?

936
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,418
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

937
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,160
JEEZUM CROW.

938
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,164
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THE SANTA FE RING HIRED--

939
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,465
NEVER MIND THAT.

940
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:41,161
I WANT TO HIRE YOU
FOR A JOB.

941
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:42,468
YOU DO?

942
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:45,170
I WANT YOU TO DOCUMENT
THE HUNT

943
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:47,507
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
IN NEW MEXICO.

944
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,508
I WANT
A BOOK WRITTEN ON IT

945
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,178
SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

946
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,510
I WANT YOU
TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME

947
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,170
AND RECORD THE DANGERS
OF THE EXPEDITION.

948
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,552
RIDEALONG WITH YOU?
ON A HORSE?

949
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:01,120
OH, NO.

950
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,488
THIS I CAN'T DO.

951
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:07,127
I CAME OUT WEST
TO SAVE MY LAST LUNG.

952
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,128
I'M A JOURNALIST.

953
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,131
YOU'RE
A BROKE JOURNALIST,

954
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:14,532
AND YOU'RE A DRUNK.

955
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,144
THE COUNTRY WAS OVERGROWN
WITH WEED AND BRUSH

956
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:27,381
AND ENCUMBERED
WITH LOOSE ROCK,

957
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,617
MAKING IT
ALMOST IMPASSABLE.

958
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:32,151
I LIKE THAT.

959
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:33,619
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

960
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:39,648
MORNING, SHERIFF.

961
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,650
WE MET AT THE GOVERNOR'S.

962
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:44,164
JOHN W. POE,
CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION.

963
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:46,166
THE GOVERNOR SENT ME
AND THESE MEN

964
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,167
TO LEND YOU A HAND.

965
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:50,159
ENCUMBERED BY IDIOTS,
WE PRESSED ON.

966
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:52,700
I LIKE THAT.

967
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,697
IT'S VERY GOOD.

968
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,788
WHAT DID THEY DO NOW--
SPELL YOUR NAME WRONG?

969
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,490
THEY GOT A NEW SHERIFF
ON US, BOYS.

970
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:12,192
GOES BY THE NAME
OF PAT GARRETT.

971
00:50:12,193 --> 00:50:13,792
JESUS CHRIST!

972
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:17,197
WHAT THE HELL
DID HE DO THAT FOR?

973
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:18,699
MAKE HISSELF FAMOUS.

974
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,267
BE A KNOWN MAN LIKE ME.

975
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,834
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

976
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:23,203
WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT ME, HUH?
