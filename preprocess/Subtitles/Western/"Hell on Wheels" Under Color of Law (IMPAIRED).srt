- Father Hatch.
- Well, come in.

171

- Why are we stayin' out here? 
- The Bishop?

172
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:14,243
Ah. He's long gone,
you needn't worry about him.

173
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,546
Now, you've been traveling.

You're tired and hungry.

Wait here.

179
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,644
You look rather cavalier
for a man who's set to hang.

[Laughs]

181
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:52,955
Is it your habit to take the
law of the land so lightly?

182
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,659
Ain't the usual thing for a governor

183
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,659
to come down here and conversate
with condemned fugitives.

184
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,796
I'm askin' if you hold the law in contempt.

185
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:06,364
The law and me have been
at each other pretty hard

186
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,037
for a long time now.

187
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:12,673
We know each other well.

188
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:23,248
You have certain skills, Mr. Snow.

189
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:26,220
I may have need for those skills.

190
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:29,390
The question is whether you
can put them to use for someone

191
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,559
other than yourself.

192
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:35,931
I have never tried.

193
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,535
What if it were worth your life?

194
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,004
Do you swear to enforce the law of Wyoming,

195
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,110
its letter and its spirit,

196
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:54,207
without prejudice of persons
in pursuance of your duties?

197
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,310
Right, yeah. I do.

198
00:15:56,345 --> 00:16:01,081
Then you're our new marshal.

199
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:03,749
Lots of individuals would be surprised.

200
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,483
Cheyenne's full of men wanted elsewhere.

201
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,884
Bail jumpers, fugitives.

202
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,825
Also indentured freedmen
among the railroad workers,

203
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,393

204
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,760
Durant hasn't paid their bond in years.

205
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,963
That means they're illegal too.

206

She's missed this.

That's a fact.

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, I can only guess at what's brought you

back from Cheyenne.

you shouldn't stay on?

You will be made welcome.

247
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,608
Perhaps Bishop Dutson was right after all.

I agree.

503
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,844
About the wine.

504
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:57,647
Mm.

505
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,925
Now...

506
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:04,872
You are not the kind of lady
I expected to find out here.

507
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:08,307
How is it that an east coast sophisticate

508
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,913
like yourself

509
00:40:10,947 --> 00:40:12,714
ends up in a frontier town

510
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:15,813
surrounded by charlatans like Durant,

511
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:19,987
ruffians like Mickey McGinnes...

512
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:24,057
And a defrocked Johnny Reb like Bohannon?

513
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:28,192
I notice you forgot to mention Sidney Snow.

514
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,431
How does a man who shoots up a store

515
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:33,899
and kills a young boy end up wearing

516
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,435
a marshal's badge?

517
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,338
And how do you justify giving it to him?

518
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:40,076
Good question, Miss Ellison.

519
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:41,777
Mr. Bohannon.

520
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:43,839
You're interrupting our dinner.

521
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,918
I aim to hear your answer.

522
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:49,457
How's a man appointed by
Grant to bring law and order

523
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,428
put a badge on a mad dog like Sidney snow,

524
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:53,365
and that's what he is, we both know it.

525
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,838
I'm just lucky I had a man
like him to put a badge on.

526
00:40:56,872 --> 00:41:00,812
I've lost two marshals
to violence in this town,

527
00:41:00,846 --> 00:41:03,616
and I don't need to lose more
to know that I'm a long way

528
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,955
from being able to use peaceful
means to bring "law and order,"

529
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:10,390
as you put it.

530
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:13,393
I think my new marshal's methods

531
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:16,629
exactly fit the bill.

532
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:18,531
What Sidney's bringing ain't law and order,

533
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:21,135
and I can't build a railroad
with them men in jail.

534
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,739
Then the railroad and everything else

535
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:25,507
will have to wait

536
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:31,214
until I bring this town to heel.

537
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:35,852
Let me spell it out for you, Mr. Campbell.

538
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:38,423
Release them prisoners.

539
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:43,095
I'm only askin' you once.

540
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:49,037
If that's a threat, I didn't hear it.

541
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:53,079
Now would you let this lady
and me go on with our dinner?

542
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,123
You remember:

543
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:07,891
I asked you as a gentleman first.

544
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,725
Miss Ellison.

545
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:47,203
