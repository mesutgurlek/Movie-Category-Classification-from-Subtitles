00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,724
Pretty good shooting, young fella.

162
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,352
- You three all right?
- You bet we're all right. American.

163
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,187
Uh-huh.

164
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,816
John, you go and meet your niece.
We'll take care of things around here.

165
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,234
Thanks, Henry.

166
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,694
Oh, uh...

167
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,113
- About that reception for Sallie.
- Yeah?

168
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,489
Bring this young fella along.

169
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,242
I will, and it's about time
you two were introduced.

170
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,036
This is William Bonney.

171
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,205
- Bonney?
- Came to work for me last month.

172
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,374
William Bonney from up Silver City way?

173
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,293
Sometimes.

174
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,505
You also called Billy the Kid?

175
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,382
Sometimes.

176
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,723
Does that change your mind, Mr. Chisum?

177
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,228
An invitation's an invitation.

178
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,480
Thanks, John.

179
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,135
PEPPER: Letting the fox into the henhouse,
that's what it is.

180
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,529
CHISUM: Pepper,
what are you mumbling about?

181
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,739
PEPPER: Nothing.

182
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,741
CHISUM: Well,
it didn't sound like nothing.

183
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,534
PEPPER: Well, you invited him.

184
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,080
Yeah, I did.

185
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,833
(SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

186
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,725
But, señor, we have always
watered our herds at Muddy Creek.

187
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,937
As I explained to your friends,
Muddy Creek's private now.

188
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,146
CHISUM: Bourbon.

189
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,148
But, señor, our herds are small.

190
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,818
There is more than enough water
at Muddy Creek,

191
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,195
- and yesterday...
- I know all about yesterday.

192
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,699
Now listen, Delgado.
I told them then, and I'm telling you now.

193
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,326
And if you don't understand plain English,

194
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,870
maybe there's something else
you will understand.

195
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,831
Dolan, just a minute.

196
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,082
Uh...

197
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,001
I'm sorry, Señor Delgado?

198
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,169
Sí, Señor Murphy.

199
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,130
Yeah, well, you see,
I'm gonna be running a lot of beef,

200
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,549
and I need every drop of water I can get.

201
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm sorry.

202
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,805
- CHISUM: Juan.
- Sí, Señor Chisum.

203
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,684
You and your compadres
can water your herds along the Jicarilla.

204
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,478
It's not much farther,
and it's a whole lot cleaner.

205
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,980
Gracias.

206
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,567
- What are you waiting for?
- Gracias, señor.

207
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,321
Well, John, that's very generous of you.
Buy you a drink?

208
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,366
You've been buying a lot of things
around here lately.

209
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,162
Yeah, matter of fact I just acquired some
land that's contiguous to your spread.

210
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,747
(CHUCKLES) But, what the hell?

211
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,167
Half of New Mexico territory
is contiguous to your spread.

212
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,044
Oh, Pete, let me have my bottle.
John and I are gonna have a drink.

213
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,921
- CHISUM: Nope.
- Why not?

214
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,508
- I don't like you.
- You don't know me.

215
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,260
I know Amos Patton.

216
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,638
We may have to be neighbors,

217
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,475
but I don't have to be neighborly.

218
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,857
Say, Mr. Chisum, I heard
you ran into some trouble today.

219
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,233
Can I do anything for you?

220
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,403
Brady, aren't you standing
on the wrong side of that badge?

221
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,115
I'm the new sheriff, duly appointed.

222
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Oh.

223
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,952
Noon stage got in, Mr. Chisum.

224
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,914
What do you think, Pete? 4:30.

225
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,958
Old Jeb made good time. Whiskey.

226
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,504
Now Mr. Chisum,
if I can do anything for you...

227
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,838
Not likely.

228
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,758
PEPPER: Sheriff.

229
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,896
McSWEEN: Your name John Chisum?

230
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,732
- That's right.
- I thought so.

231
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,567
My name's Alex McSween.

232
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,237
My wife and I came in on the stage
with Sallie.

233
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,614
That's very nice. Uh, where...

234
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,242
Oh.
She went over to that stable over there.

235
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,911
Much obliged. Pepper. Pardon.

236
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,917
- What's she doing in there?
- How should I know?

237
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,085
Oh!

238
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,255
- Uncle John. You got $50 on you?
- $50?

239
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,549
Uh...

240
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,843
Thanks.

241
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,596
- You're welcome, and hello!
- SALLIE: Hello!

242
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,517
- She's your niece.
- Yeah.

243
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,685
(HORSE NICKERING)

244
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,981
Uncle John, meet Bernard.

245
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,275
Bernard?

246
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,820
- You gave $50 for this horse?
- Meet Pepper.

247
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,115
No, $100. I had $50 on me.

248
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,910
I've been thinking about having my own
horse again ever since I left Baltimore.

249
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,123
You know, we have a few horses
at the ranch.

250
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,709
But those are yours. This one's mine.

251
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,421
- Half yours.
- Oh, I'll pay you back the $50.

252
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,382
How about just paying me back?

253
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,512
Well, Cass'll take care of your bags.
Which are yours?

254
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,098
- First one there.
- Well, I see you found her.

255
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,017
- Yes.
- Uncle John...

256
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,311
- We've met.
- Oh. Well, that's good.

257
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,938
Because I've invited the McSween's
to that party you wrote me about.

258
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,232
You did? Well, how about you folks?

259
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,735
Have you a place to stay
until you get settled?

260
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,653
That's very nice of you, Mr. Chisum, but...

261
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,363
Sue and I are staying in town.

262
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,158
I'm going to work
for L.G. Murphy and Company.

263
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,995
Yes, I know the company.

264
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,123
Well, if you'll pardon us,
Sallie, we'd better get underway.

265
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,709
- Goodbye.
- We'll see you Friday.

266
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,504
There sure is gonna be
some interesting people at that party.

267

(CHEERFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

It's quiet. Takes some getting used to.

271
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,819
It beats Aunt Martha and Baltimore.

272
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,572
I had no idea your ranch was so big.

273
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,074
Fair size.

274
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,244
Take a man on a good horse
all summer to cover it.

275
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,913
It's beautiful.

276
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,083
No place on God's earth more beautiful.

277
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,128
I can see why you left Texas
and came here.

278
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,256
Well, that wasn't exactly the reason.

279
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,425
I know. Mother told me all about it.

280
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,928
About how hard things were in Texas
after the war.

281
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,930
She talked about you a lot.

282
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,391
How you gambled everything
on a cattle drive

283
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,935
to some wild, faraway place
called New Mexico.

284
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,189
It was a gamble, all right.
And it was wild.

285
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,152
But there was land here
for the taking and keeping,

286
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,147
if you were willing to fight.

287
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,158
Rustlers, disease,

288
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,369
the land itself, the Indians...

289
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,872
One Indian in particular.

290
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,042
Comanche chief named White Buffalo.

291
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,086
The bravest man I ever knew.

292
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,089
- Is he dead now?
- Might as well be.

293
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:07,594
He's penned up on a piece of desert
the government calls a reservation.

294
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,473
That was the end of his way of life.

295
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,808
Pretty good way, too.

296
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,811
You sound as if you're sorry for him,
your enemy.

297
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,856
I respect him. We're brothers.

298
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,525
As close as your father and I were.

299
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,569
Maybe even closer.

300
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,739
- I don't understand.
- I didn't expect you to.

301
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,158
I wonder what's keeping supper.

302

SALLIE: That's Mother and Dad's
wedding picture.

303
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,412
Yeah.

- Lonely wind.
- Lonely wind.

307
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,677
You had to be lonely out here
all these years.

308
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,346
You never married.

309
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,100
Well, it wasn't because there weren't
women that stirred my blood.

310
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,393
There were.

311
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,189
But this was no place to bring a woman
in those days,

312
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,024
raise a family.

313
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,903
Things are different now.

314
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Uncle John.

315
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,869
Thanks for asking me
to come and stay with you.

316
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,372
I didn't ask you.

317
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,550
$12 for a suit of clothes.

Lawrence G. Murphy?

Not long. I was out here on business

to the whole proposition. Chisum.

Call him the King of the Pecos.
He got here first. He holds the key.

00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,666
The Pecos River
runs right through the middle of his land.

00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,013
So?

455
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,141
Well, you see, he lets the water flow
to all the ranches, big and small.

456
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,646
Now, if another man, with more appetite,
owned that land,

457
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:53,234
he'd control a territory bigger than most
states and bigger than some countries.

458
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,278
- Yeah, but another man doesn't.
- I know. Not yet.

459
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,574
But you see, that's not just a map.
That's a chessboard.

460
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,327
And if another man makes the right moves,

461

a new King of the Pecos.

Yeah. All right, Sheriff.

Listen, Alex,
would you excuse us for a minute?

474
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,736
Certainly.

475
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,579
Lawrence, first it was Neemo, then Riker.
Now Chisum's sent for Judge Wilson.

476
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,291
- What are we gonna do?
- Have some wanted posters printed up.

477
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,167
- On who?
- Riker.

478
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,879
- What for?
- Your prisoner's going to escape.

479
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,048
- He is?
- He is.

480
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,885
Tell him to wait in the line shack
up on Bony Ridge

481
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,178
until the good judge
gets tired of waiting around.

482
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,890
- How much?
- How much what?

483
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,517
- How much reward? $100, or...
- No.

484
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,646
Well, don't be a piker, man.
What, $200... Nobody's gonna collect it.

485
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,735
Why get in a frazzle over Chisum?
You turn me loose on him.

486
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,195
There'll be a sudden funeral
right here in Lincoln.

How's that?

490
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,038
- Do you play chess?
- Chess?

491
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,333
Now, what the hell has that
got to do with Chisum?

492
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,337
Everything. You just leave him alone.
I'll take care of Mr. Chisum.

493
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,214
- That ain't gonna be easy.
- You're right.

494
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,509
But, see, there's a fundamental difference
between Mr. Chisum and me.

495
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,677
Yeah? What's that?

496
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,388
Mr. Chisum is a man who respects the law.

497
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,683
Around here, I'm the man who owns it.

- What's the trouble, Juan?
- No trouble.

503
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,880
This greaser was just trying to tell me
how to run my business.

504
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,424
And just how did he go about that?

505
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,636
They have nearly doubled the prices.
We can't pay what they ask.

506
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,721
You don't like it, go somewhere else.

Maybe they will.

JUAN: There is no place within 100 miles.

509

About those prices, Mr. Murphy.

510
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,483
Well, prices are always going up.
Sign of a healthy economy.

511
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,693
Or a healthier profit.

512
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,072
If he needs some money,
he can always arrange a loan at the bank.

513
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,360
The bank'd be happy
to carry a mortgage on his spread.

514
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,744
Maybe that's what we need around here.
Another bank.

515
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,747
You plan on starting one, Mr. Chisum?

516
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,166
Why not? All it takes is money.

517
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,628
TUNSTALL: Yes, we might even
start up a store, too.

Just in the spirit of healthy competition,
of course.

We brought enough beef
for White Buffalo's people to get by.

and with White Buffalo.

COLONEL: I am not interested in your
opinion of Mr. Chisum's word.

535
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,819
Now, sir, I understand your problem,
but you have to understand mine.

536
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,488
Would you mind explaining?

537
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,200
There are many problems attendant to
running a territory as large as this one.

I don't propose to dwell on them

Well, what do you propose
to do here and now?

When I heard what happened to your cattle,

I made arrangements for the delivery
of another herd at a very good price.

for the Army and for the territory.

All right, Colonel. You don't have to
put it in triplicate. I get the idea.

- You know who you're talking to?
- Looks like an Indian to me.

you ought to know, Sergeant.

00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,635
Lawrence, look. Are you sure
you can provide that much beef?

572
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,805
Oh, don't worry. Army'll get its beef,
and a lot cheaper than from Chisum.

You're in charge of this territory,
not him.

574

And then, after you've
served your tour of duty,

575
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,405
you'll be an officer
in the L.G. Murphy Bank.

Your bank has nothing to do with this.

578
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,443
I'm in the Army.
I wouldn't do anything that would...

579
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,487
And I wouldn't ask you to.

580
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,572
I'll take care of the details.

He's led us on many a cattle drive.

00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,637
He brought your uncle's herd here,
all the way from Texas.

586
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,682
You and Uncle John have come
a long way together, haven't you?

587
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,851
A long way.

588
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,064

Do you always greet people
with so much fanfare?

00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,707
Um, no, ma'am.

601
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,752
Truth is, I was just...

602

Just what?

603
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,841
Well, Mr. Tunstall loaned me his Bible
here so I could practice my reading.

604
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,510
Looks like that ain't all
you were practicing.

605
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,930
- Which part were you reading, Billy?
- About how Cain killed Abel.

606
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,338
You know that was the first killing
that ever took place?

607
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,976
Yes, I know.

608
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,438

00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,197
- Keep practicing, Billy.
- Yes, ma'am.

612
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,151
So they're all in it together.

613
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,946
It may be a chess game to Murphy,

614
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,449
but I don't like his methods,
and I can't go along with him.

615
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,786
Well, it's very kind of you
to tell me, Alex,

616
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,372
but I'm a pretty good chess player myself.

617
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,625
If I were you, Mr. Chisum,
I'd cut off the water to his property.

618
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,504
I can't do that without affecting Henry
and a lot of other outfits.

619
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,840
What are you figuring on doing?

620
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,177
Well, Sue's packing,
and we're gonna go on back to Kansas.

621
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,179
Why don't you stay out here?

622
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,349
New Mexico could use
another good man and woman.

623
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,934
Yes, by all means.

624
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,687

625
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,023
You ran a store back in Kansas,

- Not gonna?
- Not gonna.

Lawrence, I was just coming
to talk to you.

792
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,055
Talk.

793
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,891
- Know what I've been doing lately?
- No, what have you been doing lately?

and see how William's doing.

- Good.
- He's doing his best.

- What did you say?
- I said he's getting plenty of rest.

- He's awake now. You can go on in.
- Thank you.

- How's the patient, Sallie?
- A little impatient, I'm afraid.

- He's getting bored.
- I'm just fine, Mr. Tunstall.

Yes, I'm going to Santa Fe for a bit,
to take care of some business.

01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:53,436
Yeah.

to take care of in Lincoln

with Murphy and Evans.

836
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,528
William, you are not going to do anything.

837
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,739
From now on,
we do everything according to the law.

838

- Mr. Chisum go along with that?
- He does.

Now, you've made a fresh start here,
and you've got a good future.

And I want you to promise me

841
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,333
that you won't do anything
to jeopardize that future.

842
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,687
You're gonna make me swear on the Bible?

843
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,134
No, lad. Your word's
always been good enough for me.

844
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,221
No, I thought perhaps you'd like to
practice your reading some more

- Well, thanks. I would.

I'll see you soon, laddie.

847
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:37,855
- Mr. Tunstall.
- Yeah?

848
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:39,815
I promise.

849
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,653
Oh, uh...

for taking care of William.

Not me, Sallie.

She's a wonderful girl.
And he's a worthwhile lad.

Yeah, Henry, according to you,
everybody's worthwhile.

But William reminds me of someone.

863
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,212
A black sheep in the family, no doubt.

864
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,048
No, a young chap I never even talked to.

865
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,801
Years ago in England,
this young man, very much like William,

866
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,470
killed a man in some senseless brawl.

867
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,307
And I watched that young man
walk to the gallows.

868
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,434
And I saw him hanged.

869
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,145
Ghastly sight.

870
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,775
There was nothing I could do
to help that young lad. Well...

871
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:09,238
- I hope your way works, Henry.
- It will, John. It will.

872
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:24,878
Would you like to listen to my opinion,
Mr. John Simpson Chisum?

Nope.

874

Well, my opinion is all this speechifying,
store-keeping, prayer-meeting

01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,011
don't amount to a spit in the river.

876
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,180
There's only one thing
gonna make this territory know

01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,807
who's the bull of the woods.

878
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:40,185
And sometime or sooner,
it's gonna happen. And you know it.

- Do I?
- You do.

880

It's just gonna be you and Murphy,
head to head, and horn to horn.

But one of you has got to lose.

883
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,868
So, the other one walks away
with the herd and the whole shebang.

about that.

Yeah, I expect we ought to.

All right, you two, go fetch him.

01:46:50,446 --> 01:46:52,363
Ain't like old times...

1404
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:55,075
Billy.

Can you make it?

1411
01:47:52,758 --> 01:47:54,592
What? Where's...

1412
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:01,391
Where are you going?

1413
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:04,310
I resign.

1414
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,187
No more paydays around here.

1415
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,414
I know. It's my fault.

1416
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,542
You were the primer, Billy, but...

1417
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:31,838
I guess, sooner or later,
the lid had to blow off.

1418
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:34,007
Sheriff left town.

1419
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,843
He won't be hard to follow.

1420
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:41,848
- So long, Mr. Chisum.
- Let it go, Billy.

1421
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,976
That smell of death.

1422
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:46,978
Remember?

1423
01:48:47,313 --> 01:48:49,105
Be seeing you, Big Casino.

1424
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:57,488
Are you coming?

01:49:29,355 --> 01:49:30,521
Yeah.

1431
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:32,523
Do that mean the war is over?

1432
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:35,151
- It do.
- I hope so.

1433
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,445
I wouldn't be too sure.

1434
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:39,489
You know,
there's an old saying, Miss Sallie.

1435
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:44,202
"There's no law west of Dodge,
and no God west of the Pecos."

1436
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:46,454
Right, Mr. Chisum?

1437
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:47,789
CHISUM: Wrong, Mr. Pepper.

1438
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:52,168
'Cause no matter where people go,
sooner or later, there's the law.

1439
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:56,631
And, sooner or later,
they find that God's already been there.

1440
01:50:01,762 --> 01:50:03,054
Now, where's he going?

1441
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,098
Don't worry. He'll be back.

1442
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,300
Well, I better get going, too.

1443
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,431
I got some things in Lincoln
that need taken care of.

1444
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:12,605
Lincoln can take care of itself, Sheriff,
until after the dishes are done.
