to be killed by a grizzly...

There was nothing you could have done.
It was God's will.

I thought maybe you'd be interested

in knowing
what some of them's been talking about.

Like what?

361
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:59,023
Well, they've been saying
maybe we ought to burn the boat,

pack the skins on the mules,

Well, sir, I don't know
what's so important about this boat.

365
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,616
I mean, without it,
well, we'd be clear of the snow

366
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,118
and onto flat lands by now.

367
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,121
Mr. Fogarty, that's more than just a boat.

368
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:16,916
It's what's left of my last command.
I don't intend to see it burn.

-Now or ever.
-Yes, sir.

about Zach Bass?

Why can't you let go of him?

380
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:58,958
He's about the only man
I ever truly respected

381

or ever feared.

382
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,091
Zach was a stowaway.

383
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,928
He'd run off from an orphanage,

384
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:14,682
swam out to my ship in Boston Harbor.

385
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,770
I liked his unfearing look
and kept him on.

386
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,774
He'd become like a son to me.

387
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:25,526
Didn't see me as his father.

388
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,780
He learned young to live alone.
Be his own man.

All the years we was together,

390
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:33,868
never let me come close enough to ask

391
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,662
''What's on your mind, Zach,
what's bothering you?''

392
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:40,416
He drew a circle, like, around himself.

01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:42,460
Nobody dared enter it.

394

You do think he's alive,
don't you, Captain?

395
01:19:51,678 --> 01:19:53,679
Yes, Fogarty, he's alive.
