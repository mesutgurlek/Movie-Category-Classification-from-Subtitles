165
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,059
He hasn't asked me to leave,

166
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,261
if that's
what you're wondering.

167
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:47,163
Have you asked him to stay?

[ Sighs ]

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,009
Did you dress your wounds?

170
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,077
Yeah, I used some of that
men-wake you gave me.

171
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:02,913
Thanks. I'm fine.

172
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,814
It will leave a mark.

173
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,050
Mm. Yeah,
I figured it might.

Whoa.
You go surfing?

177
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:15,592
Very funny.

178
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,061
Uh, you heard stories about
anyone poaching any elk lately?

179
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,230
Well, if I had,
you'd have heard about it.

180
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:23,533
Of course, if I had it my way,
they'd be shot on sight.

181
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,568
Poachers are
the lowest of the low.

182
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,138
They got no regard
for natural law.

183
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,873
There's a time to kill things

184
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,574
and a time to let them thrive.

185
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,543
Thank goodness
you have appointed yourself

186
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,011
the protector of natural law.

187
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:39,516
Natural law isn't my usual
jurisdiction, but, uh...

188
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,885
this poacher
didn't stop with the elk.

189
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,087
He also killed a game warden.

190
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:46,656
Which one?
Connor Redding.

191
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:48,692
Aw, shoot.

192
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,593
Young kid. Good guy.

193
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,996
What was this poacher
after? Meat?

194
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:54,531
Don't think so.

195
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,267
Head was gone,
body was left behind.

196
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,536
Looks like whoever it was
was after a trophy.

197
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,604
Not much of a trophy.

198
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:04,641
This time of year, the antlers
are barely starting to grow.

199
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,043
No. Most head hunters
wouldn't even bother.

200
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:10,080
Most poachers don't partially
gut the animal, either,

201
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:13,116
unless they were after
something else.

202
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,785
You mind if I
take a look at this elk?

203
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,721
Yeah.

204
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:20,523
Yeah, just as I suspected.

205
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,559
Pancreas is missing.

206
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,996
That would also explain
why the poacher took the head.

207
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,531
He wanted antler velvet.

208
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,600
Not following you, Omar.

209
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,669
You ever hear of elk velvetine?

210
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,005
I've heard of antler velvet,
but not velvetine.

211
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:38,108
It's one of those new-age
Chinese supplements.

212
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:41,277
Elk pancreas and antler velvet

213
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,280
are the two main ingredients
you need to make the stuff.

214
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,216
You saying this hunter
was killing elk

215
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,084
for its medicinal properties?

216
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:50,587
Well, there's a big, big market
in herbal medicines

217
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:52,188
if you can find
the raw materials.

218
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:56,760
These Chinese companies
hire a few hunters to --

219
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,996
well, kind of like
medical mercenaries.

220
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:02,565
These guys go all over the world
killing animals

221
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,901
just so these companies
can make their remedies.

222
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,670
Mm.

223
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:10,140
How do these Chinese companies
find their poachers?

224
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:12,642
Wait a minute.

225

I know how one guy tried.

226
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,714
About a month ago,
I had a Chinese guy

227
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:20,316
on one of my trips --
Mr. Chen.

228
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,719
Couldn't shoot worth a damn,

229
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,156
but he sure seemed keen on
killing an elk.

230
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,258
Even offered me some cash
to do it for him.

231
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,293
What did you tell him?

232
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:33,596
No, of course.

233
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:37,934
Well, looks like
someone said yes.

Well, uh,
Henry gave me his cellphone,

I'd give you a call,

I found some information
on elk velvetine.

273
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,802
Check in with the other
hunting outfitters in town,

274
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,571
see if Chen
booked any trips with them

00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,540
or if he's got any
updated contact information.

Also, question as many
of the guides as you can.

277
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,313
If Chen hired any of them
to poach for him,

278
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:26,747
that might be our killer.

All right, Ruby.
Shoot.

280
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,084
Well, according to
these articles,

281
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,854
the nearest place
you can buy velvetine is China.

282
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,789
Now, you can get
a little bit online

283
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,758
from those shady
Canadian pharmacies.

284
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,694
But look --
a tiny little bottle

285
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,829
is more expensive
than my car payments.

286
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,050
So, if Mr. Chen found
a way to produce it in the U.S.,

287
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,967
he could make a lot of money.

288

00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,703
No.

326
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,406
Troy, the way I see things,

327
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,609
your chances of
playing college ball

328
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,511
are pretty slim if you don't
get out of this bed.

329
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,447
Now, the wasting sickness
you have,

330
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:42,350
velvetine can cause that.

331
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:46,487
If you used it,
you should tell the doctors.

332
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:48,889
They may be able to
help you play again.

333
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,528
I just need to know
where you got it.

334
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,931
There's at least 20
hunting guides in this town

335
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,066
that need to be questioned.

336
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,835
Don't you have to give, like,

337
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,503
two weeks' notice or something
if you're quitting?

338

what I'm doing yet.

There's stuff
I need to figure out.

So, while you're out
soul searching,

341
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,076
I'm on my own?

342
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,812
What can I say?

343
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,814
You should've voted for me.

344
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,082
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,991
You found her.

348
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,727
My dad wanted a boy.

How can I help you?
Uh...

00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,791
How many hunting guides
do you have on staff?

351
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,500
High season, six,

352
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,602
but this time of year, ain't
that much hunting to guide,

353
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,871
so I only got one --
Keith Dixon.

354
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:38,706
He's up in the big horns.

355
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,475
Left two days ago to scout
fishing holes for a client.

356
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,344
He got a cellphone up there?

357
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:46,313
He's got a radio in his truck.
Checks in at night.

358
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,082
Is there some kind of trouble?

359

[ Chuckles ]

360
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,687
I'm gonna need some information
about a possible client.

361
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:55,923
Did a Mr. Chen book
a hunting trip with you guys?

362
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:58,659
Name doesn't sound familiar.

363
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,028
Oh, is he one of these guys?

364
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,532
You know, it would help
if I knew what he looked like.

365
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,568
I could check the registry,
see if we got any record of him.

366
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,004
That'd be great.
Thanks.

Hargis: It's a shame about Troy.

Kid with natural talent
like that,

371
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,586
as a coach,
you're lucky if you see that

372
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,855
four, maybe five times
in your career.

373
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,657
Could've played
Division-I ball.

He could've taken you with him.

375
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,696
A lot of high-school coaches
like a shot at a college job.

376
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,498
If a player under you
is recruited

377
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,800
into a
Division-I school,

378
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,936
it stands out on your résumé.

379
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,672
Troy said the scouts were
coming to take a look at him.

380
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,707
You needed him to make
a good impression.

381
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,809
So, what are you getting at,
sheriff?

382
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,079
Troy's sickness is caused by
a performance supplement --

383
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,381
stuff called velvetine.

384
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,317
He said you were the one
that gave it to him.

385
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,353
I'll have you know I run
a clean program, sheriff.

386
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,055
I won't deny that
I'd like a college job,

387
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,857
but I'm not risking
the one that I got.

388
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,892
Doping players -- that's grounds
for immediate dismissal.

389
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:07,061
I'm not trying to
get you fired, coach.

00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,629
I'm just looking for a man

391
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,664
that's connected
to the velvetine.

Do you know someone
named Mr. Chen?

Never heard of him.

I care about Troy.

395
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:19,974
I wouldn't push
any kind of supplement on him.

396
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:22,576
Why did Troy
say it was you, then?

protect his father.

a few times.

Grant would do anything
to make sure that Troy succeeds.

Hey.

404
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,935
So, it turns out
Mr. Chen booked trips

405
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:50,738
with five different hunting
outfitters over the last few months.

406
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,507
I talked to as many of
the guides as I could locate.

407
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,743
A few of them admit that he asked
them to shoot elk out of season,

408
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,678
but they all claim
they turned him down.

409
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,613
What are the photos for?

410
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,615
I'm at a dead end
trying to find this guy.

411
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,417
He paid cash
to all the outfitters,

412
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,986
listed the same
useless contact information.

413
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:08,923
So, I called Omar

414
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,659
to see if maybe he had
a picture of Chen

415
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,027
from one of their
hunting trips.

416
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,095
It would help us
to know what he looked like.

00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,465
Ah. And there he is.

have a plan of attack
for treating Troy...

426
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,702
now that they know
he was taking velvetine.

427
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,474
Troy told me he got it from
Coach Hargis.

428
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,978
I spoke to Hargis.
He said it wasn't him.

429
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,714
He thinks
it was someone else --

430
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,716
someone close to Troy.

431
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,657
You just want the best
for your kids.

Want to give them
every advantage.

433
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,931
I thought the stuff
was all-natural.

434
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,467
I had no idea

435
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:27,437
it could have
side effects like this.

436
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,972
Where did you get
the velvetine?

437
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:36,512
I learned about it from
some guy on a hunting trip.

438
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:43,719
This man?

439

When I heard the scouts
were coming,

443
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:58,568
I-I called Chen

444
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,771
and bought as much of the stuff
as he would sell me.

445
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,479
Troy wanted this
more than anything...

446
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,781
and I just wanted to help him.

447
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:17,753

contacting Mr. Chen, then?

00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:36,672
Means you're Mr. Chen.

451
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,375
You're a hard man to find.

Engineer, actually.

00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,886
Coalage hired me
for a special project --

converting coal to liquid gas,
which we sell to China.

458

How's your company feel
about your side business?

459
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:59,529
Jonathan: I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

460
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,564
Selling velvetine.

461
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:03,966
Why should they care?
I've done nothing illegal.

462
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,902
I make many trips to China.

463
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,070
Velvetine is made and sold
legally there.

464
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:11,541
And I bring back small amounts
that the custom laws allow.

465
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:15,378
I might charge my customers
a little bit extra for it here,

466
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,980
but I'm simply obeying
the laws of supply and demand.

467
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,383
I guess that high demand
is the reason

468
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:22,718
you started
harvesting ingredients here --

469
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:26,022
making velvetine yourself,
which is illegal.

470
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,091
You went on hunting trips
over several months.

471
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,993
A few of the outfitters said

472
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:33,963
you offered them money
to kill elk out of season,

473
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:35,731
and the trips stopped.

474
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,733
Which probably means you found

475
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,602
someone
willing to hunt for you.

476
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,437
Or it could simply mean that

477
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:42,972
my workload got a little hectic

478
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,808
and I no longer have time
to take vacations.

479
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,444
So, it's just
a coincidence that, uh,

480
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:51,414
around the time
you stopped taking vacations,

481
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:53,382
a hunter started slaying elk

482
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:55,985
and taking the exact parts
you need to make velvetine.

The first time I met Walt,
we were in sixth grade.

I told him
it was a matter of honor.

Walt did not want to
share the drinking fountain

with a dirty Indian.

525

But then Walt explained

526
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:09,852
he was simply
trying to warn me.

People have germs,

528

00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:28,221
Normally, I wouldn't
blink at that.

806
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:30,089
You have a lot of employees,

807
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:32,125
but then I remembered
what you said

808
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,295
about retail politics.

809
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:38,465
Getting more of
our own voters to the polls,

810
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:42,435
keeping more of
the other guy's voters away.

811
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:45,271
You didn't have anything to do
with Cady's accident, did you?

812
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:48,541
You know, my people have had

813
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:51,978
a bad couple of centuries.

814
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,148
Some of us have learned that
to get by in the present,

815
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:57,250
you need to let go of the past.

816
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:01,387
In fact, I'd imagine that
I have already forgotten more

817
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:04,324
than most people
will ever experience

818
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:07,927
in their lives.

819
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:12,332
My advice to you
would be to do the same.

820
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:14,067
Don't look back.

821
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:17,036
Could lead to real pain.

822
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:19,939
It's better to keep your eyes

823
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,642
down the road, my man,

824
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:25,545
on your very bright future.

825
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:28,581
Not really an answer, Jacob.

826
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:37,123
I'll see you around.

827
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:44,531
Favorite from the Busy Bee.

828
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,366
Biscuits and gravy.

829
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,134
Thank you.

830
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,375
Have you gotten any sleep
in the last few days?

831
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:58,278
I plan to.

832
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:01,548
Things are starting to
settle down.

833
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,285
Got a full team back
at the station again, so...

834
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:07,587
decided to
keep your boyfriend on.

835
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:11,958
He's not my boyfriend.

836
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,361
I'm...
not sure what he is.

837
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:18,331
Well, whatever.

838
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:22,335
"Whatever"?
[ Chuckles ]

839
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:25,738
I don't think I've ever heard you
say that word my entire life.

840
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:32,445
I know I had some issues
with branch in the past, but...

841
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:34,447
I got to let that go.

842
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:39,218
I got to
let a lot of things go.

843
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,487
Maybe I'm just
starting to mellow.

844
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,392
I should
get hit by a car more often.

845
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,628
No.

846
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:51,230
Once was enough.

847
00:42:54,172 --> 00:43:04,675
