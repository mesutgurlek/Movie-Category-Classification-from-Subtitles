00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,508
Well, so who could I be?

27
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,463

- (MUTTERS) He's crazy.

Hi, Will!

30
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,599
Been sittin' up in the

31

Would've shot anything
on two legs moving, Will.

33
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,523
'Ceptin' you. If I knowed it
was you, I sure wouldn't have...

34
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,733
Never mind. Just tell me
what you're telling me.

35
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,318
You should've been here, Willett!

36
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,738
Lettin' me go on thinkin'
everyone's dead and me next.

37
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,824
I pulled up fever-sick,
I said, Coley.

38
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,660
Now, become calm and tell me
in a way I can understand.

39
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
Where is Coigne?

40
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, like I said, after you was gone Leland
and Coigne decided to run into Winslow.

41
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,793
For the pleasure, Coigne says.

42
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,795
"Can I go?" He says no.

43
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,965
"Someone's gotta watch over stores
and things, so you stay, Coley."

44
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,259
Well, then they go off.

45
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,852
Not comin' back till
next morning, early.

46
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,390
I get waked by them
pounding in like hell-bent.

47
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,602
Then I hear 'em talking mad and arguing,
so as I conclude they're drunk.

48
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,897
I mean to go back to sleep when your
brother Coigne tears inside here...

49
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,692
and grabs up his roll
mad as I ever seen.

50
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,694
I said, "What are you doing, Coigne?"

51
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,780
"Shut up," he says.
"I am taking your horse."

52
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,532
And he tears back out.

53
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,869
Sure enough, I see him throw
onto my Shorty and dig out fast.

54
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,080
And there stands Leland,
spittin' in the dust, disgusted.

55
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,750
"How come Coigne rode off
that-a-way, Leland?"

56
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,462
"He rode a man and a little person
down in the streets of Winslow.

57
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,881
Maybe it was a child," Leland says.

58
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,425
"But did he kill 'em?" I ask.

59
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,144
"He's not for sure, but he ain't waitin'
to find out, and now he's runnin'."

60
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,057
"Oh, I hate to hear it," I says.

61
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:34,234
Then I crawls back in to sleep,
assuming Leland done the same.

62
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,688
But damned if I don't
get waked again.

63
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,232
Leland's voice I hear,
and I don't know whose.

64
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,528
Thinking it's your brother, I open up the
flap and look out at Leland drinking coffee.

65
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:47,240
I can't see nothing else, so I ask,
"Who you talking to, Leland?"

66
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,619
He looks like he's makin' to answer
or to take a mouth of coffee...

67
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,663
- when just like that...
- (GUNSHOT)

68
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:56,166
his face all spitters out...

69
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:59,169
spilling in his coffee
and all over hisself...

70
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,172
with none of his
face left on with it.

71
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,801
I reckon someone come to settle with Coigne
on account of what happened in Winslow...

72
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,469
and got Leland instead.

73
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,771
Figurin' I'm next, I jumped
back inside, scared white.

74
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,645
Give me the whips and
jingles so bad, Will, I...

75
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,779
I can't yet catch hold of myself.

76
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:22,901
Is that the whole way of it, Coley?

77
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,702
I believe. (GRUNTING)

78
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,539
My mind's all unsatisfied with it.

79
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,452
Seem to me like if Leland had been
involved with the event in Winslow...

80
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,747
he'd have rode off too, wouldn't he,
like the way you told me Coigne done.

81
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:41,211
Run a man and a little person down.
That's all Leland said. Maybe it was a child.

82
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,005
He's just a-sittin' there,
gettin' killed that-a-way?

83
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,299
I got no understanding of it at all.

84
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,052
- It's a terrible thing.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,304
- Give me hold of your gun, Coley.
- What you want it for?

86
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,723
I might be gonna need it,
so just give it to me.

87
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,602
No. I might be just a-needin' it too.
How do I know? All these happenings.

88
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,147
I hate to tell ya,
all riled up like you are...

89
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,567
but I been trailed most of the
way here by I don't know who.

90
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,820
Where's your own gun?
Go on and use your own gun.

91
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,156
Well, it plainly ain't there,
or I wouldn't be asking you.

92
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,825
No, sir. No. Not with
trouble on the way.

93
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,542
I'm tired, Coley.

94
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,913
And I can't get me no sleep
without you give it to me.

out the other way around.

Will ya just look at that.

158
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,217
I'd be grateful if you'd
sell me one of your horses.

159
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,851
WILL:
You didn't arrive all to here afoot.

160
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:09,015
My horse stumbled and
broke a leg. I shot him.

161
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:13,186
I'll pay you well for a good
horse and for some shelter.

162
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,358
And if you would help me, please,
I need to get my things off my horse.

163
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,527
Well, I'd sure be glad to, ma'am.

164
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,195
Wouldn't we, Will?

165
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,120
No trouble at all.

166
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,577
I'd like the brown one.

167
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,162
The bay?

168
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,623
Oh, well, that bay there is Will's.

169
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,375
His, I mean, ma'am.

170
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,126
I like that one.

171
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,547
Well, main thing is,
I believe Will, he does too.

172
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,514
(CHUCKLES)

173
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,386
I like the brown one!

174
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm gon' give you that
black over there, miss.

175
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,767
He belonged to a dead man,
so's you don't have to pay for him.

176
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:57,028
Coley, fetch Leland's pony
out with just a bridle on her.

177
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,195
What about Coigne's, Will?

178
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,246
Well, he looks stove up.

179
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,624
Then I don't wanna be stuck with him.

180
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,745
Are you looking at me, Mr. Gashade?

181
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,747
WILL: How do you come by that name?

182
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,250
I hear you're a bounty
hunter, Mr. Gashade.

183
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,003
- I wouldn't name myself as that.
- No?

184
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,589
WILL: It was just a way
of making wages once.

185
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,224
- And now?
- Mining suits me just.

186
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,186
Well, you look less
than prosperous at it.

187
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:41,357
How much would you ask to take me
across the Supuecio to Kingsley?

188
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,109
I ain't askin'.

189
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,828
I told you I'd pay you very well.

190
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,956
And I said I'm doing just fine.

191
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,085
Look at me, Mr. Gashade.

192
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,123
Without perishing from the
tricks of my own mind...

193
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,133
how could I possibly get
to Kingsley on my own?

194
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,838
Well, I ain't the only one
knows the way, ma'am.

195
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,139
But it's you I'm asking.

196
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,356
Please think about it.

197
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,735
That's just what I'm doing.

198
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,282
Really nice pony you had here, miss.

199
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,620
Looks to me like you run
him to death though.

200
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,751
Good pony like this hard to come by.

201
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,340
What'd you shoot him for?

202
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,427
There ain't a broke or
unsound bone in his body.

203
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,021
WOMAN: I'll give you 500 now
and 500 when we get there.

204
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,394
How long would it take?
Two weeks? Three?

205
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:03,773
How much gold could you dig out of
this mine in three weeks, Mr. Gashade?

206
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,692
Three weeks?

207
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,527
Let me figure.

208
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,828
Oh, I'd say, bein' it's a...

209
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,999
pretty dead hole, why, uh...

210
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,703
Well, it wouldn't be
a hell of a much.

211
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,371
Would you say, Will?

212
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,915
COLEY: Yeah, I done the
best I could for ol' Lee.

213
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,294
By the time I got out my gun to help,
why, he was already dead.

214
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,714
And what with Will's
brother run off...

215
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:32,218
well, there was only me to
do the best I know how...

216
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,060
for ol' Leland Drum.

217
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,688
It isn't April.

218
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,191
- What's that?
- It's March.

219
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,563
Oh.

220
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,866
"His good friend in... March?"

221
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,451
COLEY: She don't like me much.

222
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,494
WILL: I don't know.

223
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,122
COLEY:
Sure holds out good wages though.

224
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:03,374
WILL: Yep.

225
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,293
But for what she don't say.

226
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,594
Take her to Kingsley, she say.

227
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,965
We'll see.

228
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,849
We're goin'?

229
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,351
I don't know.

230
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,188
What, Will?

231
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,100
Well, if Coigne got in bad...

232
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,103
He went and harmed someone
or killed someone...

233
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,855
A man and a little person.

234
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:29,157
I'm wondering why nobody's
come out here a-lookin' after him.

235
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,536
Maybe it was a child.

236
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,162
- Well, ma'am, I gotta...
- This water is not clean.

237
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,705
In fact, it's stagnant!

238
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,957
(GROANS) Please!

239
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,633
H-Hold on.

240
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,295
Do frogs breed in this water?

241
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,838
Not frogs.

242
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,800
- Well, what then?
- Oh, other things.

243
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Here!

244
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,353
- (YELLS)
- Oh, I'm sorry!

245
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,474
Phew! What is that?

246
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,934
COLEY: Well, it's all I could find.

247
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:06,145
There's some type of snakes knowed
to take a romp in that water.

248
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,147
- In this water?
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,817
And people been knowed to swallow
one of their little eggs...

250
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,778
and it'll hatch out inside 'em without
they's knowing it till it's too late.

251
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,905
What do you mean, too late?

252
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, suppose it was a poison snake
and it hatch out hungry, as they do.

253
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,620
Well, what's it gonna eat but the
nearest thing to it? And that's you.

254
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,832
- (LAUGHING)
- Not me, because I didn't swallow any of it.

255
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,875
Well, you're lucky then.

256
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,510
Say, ma'am. Uh, ma'am?

257
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:34,889
Uh, I been considerin', and,
uh, I got an offer to make.

258
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,885
- Say, ma'am?
- Yes?

259
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,801
I'll take you up to
Kingsley like you asked,

260
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,931
but Coley here's gonna
have to go along with me.

261
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,401
And that's why I'm askin'
a thousand dollars...

262
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,320
so's I can pay him too.

263
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,907
Then there's that five you
mentioned when I get you there.

264
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,904
That's it.

265
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,788
That's my offer.

266
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,371
All right.

267
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,672
Not fine, but all right.

268
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,959
Let's get started.

269
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,961
- Take it, Coley.
- No!

270
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,262
You take it, Mr. Gashade.

271
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm ready to go.

272
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,596
We'll go tomorrow.

273
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,097
Now.

274
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:25,641
Morning always makes a good start.

275
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,352
Would you like to go with me now?

276
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,937
Me?

277
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,821
- Why, sure.
- Coley.

278
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,033
Take up the money then.

279
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:37,535
- Coley...
- Go on!

280
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,282
- Coley!
- What, Will?

281
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,242
Pack the mule.

282
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,785
WOMAN: No mule.

283
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:48,414
I do not intend to be
held back by any mule.

284
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,417
Ain't nothin' will hold you
back like no vittles, ma'am.

285
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,343
No mule!

286
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,220
Gashade! Do you know Cross Tree?

287
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,065
- I do.
- Well, head for there, please.

288
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,603
Cross Tree ain't Kingsley.

289
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,321
Never mind. First, Cross Tree!

290
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,776
- It's out of the way.
- By how much?

291
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,653
Twenty, 25 miles.

292
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:20,453
Which way?

293
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,959
Well, we'll have to go faster then.

294
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,329
Yes, sir.

295
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,631
You run on four now,
you walk on two later.

296
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,384
Haul freight, Coley!

297
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,899
(WHISTLES)

298
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,150
(COLEY GRUNTING)

299
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,119
- Come on!
- (MULE BRAYING)

300
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:06,874
(GRUNTING, PANTING)

301
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,124
Look at that splay-legged,
plantered, spavined...

302
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:16,127
wind-broke, damned droop-naped,
galled stumbler...

303
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:18,170
Coigne went and stuck me with.

304
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,007
And takin' Shorty,
who was as sound as a nickel.

305
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,266
Hell! (SPITS)

306
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,806
You can't haul no pale-pink, ratty,
walleyed devil mule behind no horse...

307
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,017
that ain't got the
sense to switch flies!

308
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,860
Whew! No kiddin'.

309
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,863
This ain't no fun.

310
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,785
Howdy, miss.

311
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,498
We're stoppin', I guess.

312
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,843
She stalled again?

313
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,597
Unpack the grub out of

a thing as I ever seen.

629
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,981
No, sir, I don't like him.

Well, I hope you're gonna
keep that to yourself, Coley.

00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,487
Why should I? What do I care?

632
00:44:57,587 --> 00:45:00,997
For the reason bein' that there's
a hired gun if ever I seen one.

633
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:05,126
I don't want you to do nothin' to put
yourself in the way of it. Okay?

Well, if you say, okay.

ain't he, way he got himself up?

640
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,824
The same into his mouth.

641
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:45,291
It's real hard to do.
I ain't been able to yet.

642
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,065
This is Billy Spear.

643
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:15,613
He wasn't to join us until later,
but now it doesn't matter. He's here.

644
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,991
He'll be going on with us.

645
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:20,285

WOMAN: Mr. Gashade...

647
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:26,367
but does that figure us
now as three or as four?

648
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:28,168
Well, let me see.

649
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:32,547
Whatever you brought him along for,
one thing it ain't is for followin' sign...

650
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,384
or you wouldn't have had to shoot up
half the countryside to get him here.

651
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:39,763
So figurin' it that-a-way...

How 'bout that?

Hey, I got another one too...

656
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,776
but with a nigra's face,
you wanna try.

657
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,281
Good then. I hope we'll make an
effort now to all try and get along.

What'd he have to say?

783
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:03,237
He knows why you're here.

784
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:13,456
I wouldn't worry after
your friend, you know.

785
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:17,418
He's got a real relaxin'
time compared to us.

786
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:21,922
No, that's right. No worries.

Twice as much wouldn't buy you off.

Yeah, I figured you'd
likely do it for nothin'.

What does she mean to you?

She liked me.

You know anything about her?

803
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,610
Her name even?

804
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,198
Ask her.

805
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,831
What lies in that direction?

806
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,628
- More of the same.
- No, but beyond that.

807
01:01:08,306 --> 01:01:10,083
- Kingsley.
- You're right.

808
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:12,551
Kingsley, Gashade, not hell.

809
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:16,013
What about him?
He don't interest you?

811
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,928
- WILL: Who is he?
- Just a friend.

812
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,430
Friend, huh?

813
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,515
(CHUCKLES) Like me and him.

Yes, like you and Billy.

Where's his horse?
I don't see no horse.

816
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:37,569
He must have wandered away.
You thinking of Coley?

01:01:37,669 --> 01:01:40,704
WILL: Yeah. He could've used it.

Well, ain't that somethin'?

821

Why didn't you just shoot him?

822

(SNORTS) Billy, did you
ever leave behind a friend?

823
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,807
I never did have one.

01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,644
How about you, Willett?

825

It's different.

It's candy.
