is to get rid ofTodd's body.

297

Take care of it, Tevis.

298
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,436
- You, Yancy. Give him a hand.
- Sure.

He's just a big dumb animal.
- Yeah, by golly.

303
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,350
What kind of an animal are you,
letting them shoot down an unarmed man?

304
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,787
Kill or be killed.
He was heading for that rifle.

305
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:51,552
- Where's your gun?
- My what?

306
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,690

- Can't you see he hasn't any?

307

Don't you remember?

309
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:04,066

- He sent it to Tucson to have it fixed.

310
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,507

311
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,670
The firing pin was broken.

312
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:16,876
That's a rotten thing to do.

313
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,521
Tevis.

314
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,427
Put that body on a pack mule.

315
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:38,039
Tevis has no respect for the dead.

316
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,669
And he just loves the living.

317
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,679
Why don't you let us bury him?

318
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,341
We won't run away.
We'd hate to get shot in the back.

319
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,283
Go ahead, if it'll make you
feel any better.

320
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:50,286
Wait a minute.
I'll get the baby.

321

She's all right
where she is, Mrs. Owens.

322
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:56,415
If you want to go with your husband, go,
but the baby stays here.

323
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,595
Go with 'em.
Tell Tevis to let 'em bury him.

324
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,601
- Yeah, Zim.
- Stay close.

325
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,660
Yeah, Zim.

326
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,168
All right.
Back to the station.

327
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,262
Well, maybe they want
to say some words.

328
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,307
Well, let 'em get it over with.

329
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,309
You take that shovel and get goin'.

330
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,607

- I said get goin'.

331
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:59,285
Well, go on.
Go on. Say the words.

332

May the Lord grant you
everlasting rest and peace.

333
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,860
Come on. What are you doing?
Preaching a sermon?

334
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,921
Where's my pistol?

335
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,132
It must be behind the water trough.

336
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,958
Just a minute.

337
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,571
Now I want the next stage
to come through and no questions asked.

338
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,475
- But they'll want to know
where Sam is, won't they?
- And you'll tell 'em.

339
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:58,345
Gone to Tucson, Fort Yuma.
Make up your own story.

340
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,077
But make it good,
so nobody gets suspicious.

341

You have two good reasons to be careful.

Where were you bound for?

348
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,577
I was taking Callie to her father's folks
in Independence.

349
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:10,078
- Where is her father?
- He was killed in Gold Run three months ago.

351

Well, what happened?

354
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:29,534
We used to sing and dance
on the Mississippi riverboats.

355
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,600
Jeannie fell in love with a gambler.

356
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:36,145
He got the gold fever.
You know, wanted to go out west.

<i>From mining camp to mining camp.</i>

359
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:47,988
Jeannie was pretty.
Johnny, her husband, was...

360
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,117
hot-tempered and jealous.

361
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:53,789
Every time a man so much
as gaveJeannie a smile there'd be a brawl.

362
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,095
One night a drunken
claim jumper took a fancy to her...

363
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,466
and when the shooting
was over I was alone...

364
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,528
with Callie.

365
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,597
I kept on working.

to get us back east.

Now let's get one thing straight.

00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,844
Owens'll take orders from us
