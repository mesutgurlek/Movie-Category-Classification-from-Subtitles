1
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,081
( eagle shrieks )

2
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,573
- ( wind blowing )
<i>- ( insects chirping )</i>

3
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,195
( brush rustling )

4
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,197
( woman panting )

5
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,499
( music playing )

6
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,709
( grunts )

7
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,079
( panting )

8
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,448
( grunting )

9
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,520
( fire roaring )

10
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,777
( birds chirping )

11
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,313
( gear rattling )

12
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,788
( horse snorting )

13
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,536
( nickers )

14
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,326
( bees buzzing )

15
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,690
( horse neighs )

16
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,335
Wade?

17
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,706
Yep.

18
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,378
M-Marcus.

19
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,447
Marcus McCluskey.

20
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,682
Marcus McCluskey?

21
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,850
Yeah.

22
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,751
( laughs )

23
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,988
What the heck you doing
out here picking flowers?

24
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,824
Uh, for my ma.

25
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:19,858
Yeah?

26
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,926
Eh.

27
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,396
You always was
a mama's boy.

28
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,664
( chuckles )

29
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,399
Heh.

30
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,268
How you been?

31
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,770
I--I been good.

32
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,338
( horse neighs )

33
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,474
What are you
doing here?

34
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,544
Came to see my family,

35
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,280
find some peace.

36
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,981
( horse grunts )

37
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,985
I better be--
better be getting back.

38
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,688
I'll ride with you.
Come on.

39
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:52,691
All right.

40
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,627
Good to see you
again, Wade.

41
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,010
How's Jasper?

42
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,579
He didn't make it back.

43
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,083
Sorry to hear that.

44
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,619
He was a good man.

45
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,454
How are
your parents doing?

46
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,924
My mama heard,
something went wrong
in her head.

47
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,527
She hasn't been
the same since.

48
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,462
And your pa?

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,834
All right, well,
I'll ride over this week,

50
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,669
give them
my condolences at--

51
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,971
( cattle mooing )

52
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,775
Marcus...

53
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,044
where are
all your cattle?

54
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,747
Army took 'em all.

55
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,620
How you making ends meet?

56
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,623
I--I can't be
late for supper.

57
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,926
It's good--good
to see you, Wade.

58
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,961
You, too.

59
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,712
- All right.
- ( neighs )

60
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,786
( pounding on door )

61
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,694
( pounding on door )

62
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,830
Man: Who goes there?

63
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,565
Open up, Seamus.

64
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,701
( rifle cocks )

65
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,936
State your name.

66
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,705
It's Wade.

67
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,675
Wade?

68
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,886
Oh. Howdy, Seamus.

69
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,456
That's how
you're gonna greet
your brother-in-law?

70
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,728
( door rattles )

71
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,000
Abby.

72
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,936
Uncle Wade.

73
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,538
( gasps )

74
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,044
Darling,

75
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,580
let me look at you.

76
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,651
( laughs )

77
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:33,218
Look at you.

78
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,087
I can't
believe it.

79
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,060
All right.

80
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,797
Sammy...

81
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,901
you better
get over here,
hug your uncle.

82
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,539
( laughs )

83
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,707
Look at you.

84
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,576
You're strong...

85
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,846
like your old man.

86
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,248
Wade.

87
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,617
Seamus.

88
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,621
Come here.

89
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,057
Come here,
both of you.

90
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:25,737
Hungriest I've
ever been, Arkansas.

91
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,039
God-awful place.
Don't ever go.

92
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,642
But they marched us
for four days

93
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,011
to the battle
at Pea Ridge.

94
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,945
No food.

95
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:38,683
You get
a little bit of water,
but there's no food.

96
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,854
And our general,
Earl Van Dorn...

97
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,191
gives a big,
passioned speech

98
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,760
about how--how a viper
has a split tongue,

99
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,129
and we are
the split tongue
of the snake.

100
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,631
There will be
a left flank,

101
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,065
there will be
a right flank,

102
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,066
and then
we will surround

103
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,735
the blue bellies
with our tongue,

104
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,204
- and we will gut them.
- ( laughing )

105
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,941
So we find ourselves
in the woods at night,

106
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,309
and it is dark.

107
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,646
I mean, I can't even see
my big old nose.

108
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,980
It is dark outside.

109
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:13,818
And I'm standing there,
and no one's speaking,

110
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,521
and we're just waiting.

111
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,258
And all I can hear...

112
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,595
is my stomach...

113
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,129
( laughs )

114
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,332
my stomach
yelling at me,

115
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,968
"I need corn bread..."

116
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,069
( laughing )

117
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:31,903
"and I need beans."

118
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,740
And then--and then
they give the--
the order to charge,

119
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,076
and all I can
think to myself is,

120
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,846
"Oh, Lord, please just
let me die in Texas."

121
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,648
( laughing )

122
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,319
And that was the battle
of Pea Ridge.

123
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,856
So where's home now?

124
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,293
Will you be staying
with us, Uncle Wade?

125
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:02,334
That's up
to your father, Sammy.

126
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,735
Papa?

127
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,937
Uncle Wade
can stay, can't he?

128
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,041
Afraid we don't have much
in way of a bed.

129
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,982
You can stay
in my room.

130
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:22,787
Abby, I don't need much.
You just dig me a hole.

131
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,098
It's just
for a little while...

132
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,602
till I can find
someplace a little
more permanent.

133
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,973
My roof is yours.

134
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,842
I appreciate that.

135
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,813
( door closes )

136
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,393
Don't feel right
being here without her.

137
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,232
( sniffs )

138
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,868
Her grave's in the field.

139
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,072
You'll find it.

140
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,090
( blade scrapes )

141
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,366
Careful with that.

142
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,369
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle.
I--I was just, uh--

143
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,172
No, no, no,
don't apologize.

144
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,676
Just don't want you
hurting yourself is all.

145
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,085
You still have these?

146
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,787
Every one you made me.

147
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:07,859
You used to say that
that was what you was
gonna be like out there.

148
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,132
Sure did.

149
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,340
( steady thumping )

150
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,746
( thumping continues )

151
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,333
( grunting )

152
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,278
( sighs )

153
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,046
Ah, damn it, Doris.

154
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,516
It's like
fucking a corpse.

155
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,847
( gunshot )

156
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:36,915
Ahh, no,
you gotta--

157
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,917
- Stupid rabbit.
- You gotta aim low.

158
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,119
- I know. I know.
- Look, I'll--

159
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,954
I'm gonna get it.

160
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,123
I ain't stupid.

161
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,227
Ah, come on.

162
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:49,894
No.

163
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,230
- I can't--
- Aim low, like--

164
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,332
Okay, like this, right?

165
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,469
Out here wasting time and
ammunition again, Marcus?

166
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,572
Give me my damn riffle.

167
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,176
Gotta--
We gotta eat, Pop.

168
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,580
What,
you going hungry, son?

169
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,582
Could learn
to catch our own.

170
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,916
( sighs )
You mind telling me

171
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,254
how a son
of mine could end up
so goddamn useless?

172
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:16,921
( laughs )

173
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,625
You ain't half the man
your brother was.

174
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,560
Wade's back.

175
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,462
Who?

176
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,867
Wade, Mary's brother.

177
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,002
La-de-da.

178
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,272
You're useless.

179
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,241
( laughs )

180
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,079
Wait up, Pa!

181
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,023
Morning.

182
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,559
Morning.
So how do they fit?

183
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,295
Mm, fit just fine, Abby.

184
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,096
Whoo, look at this.

185
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,632
You got your garden
looking real nice.

186
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,266
Thank you.

187
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,568
Got you mother's touch,
sweetheart.

188
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,371
Come on.

189
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,040
Howdy.

190
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,276
Morning,
Uncle Wade.

191
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,612
All right,
it's been a while.

192
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:20,151
Maybe you could show me
how you've been doing
things around here, Sammy.

193
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,536
Hey, Uncle,
bet you've never run
traps in a while.

194
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,572
Ah, I seen a few
during the war.

195
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,309
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

196
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,244
We'd be marching
through fields.

197
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,278
Sometimes
in broad daylight,

198
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
a grown man'd
step into one
of these things.

199
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:53,117
And you know what sound
a grown man makes when
he steps into a trap?

200
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,085
What?

201
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,053
"Ouch."

202
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,154
( laughs )

203
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,356
Taking too long.

204
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,326
All right.

205
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,927
"Ouch."

206
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,072
That's good.

207
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,345
Seamus:
Samuel.

208
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,987
Seamus:
Hold these here.

209
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,156
Hold these.

210
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,260
Set this one here.

211
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,430
( traps clanking )

212
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,224
( horse neighs )

213
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,141
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,510
I had to see you.

215
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,314
You crazy?

216
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,316
Someone could've
seen you.

217
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,321
He always checks
the traps this time.

218
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,424
I thought a girl
as beautiful as you

219
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,761
deserved better
than plain old mustard seed.

220
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,529
Thank you.

221
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,724
Till tomorrow, Abigail.

222
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,797
( neighs )

223
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,289
Now, Sammy, a boar,

224
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,592
they're
creatures of habit,
just like people.

225
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,729
They tend to follow
the same routines.

226
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,465
So now if he's
bedding up down there,

227
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,736
chances are he's
gonna follow this path
down to the river,

228
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,238
which means,
if we get lucky,

229
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,707
we'll run
right into him.

230
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,672
Ah, look at you.

231
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,741
Oh, what you made of?

232
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,412
- You made of meat.
- ( pats carcass )

233
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,382
- ( grunts )
- ( metal clattering )

234
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,751
Look at you.

235
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,355
Oh, you--

236
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,457
Oh, come on.

237
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,459
Daddy's
gonna be happy.

238
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,429
( grunting )

239
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,377
( footsteps )

240
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,931
Pa!

241
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,534
Pa!

242
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,408
That's a mighty nice piece
you got there, boy.

243
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,443
It's a big pig.

244
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,645
Good eating.

245
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,414
Where you been?

246
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,983
Out, riding.

247
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,385
Riding?

248
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:31,355
Look what your brother
brought home for us.

249
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,493
What you been doing
for the family?

250
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:40,431
You need to man up, son,
and stop daydreaming.

251
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,734
Good job, boy.

252
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,538
I caught him.
You clean him.

253
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,906
No, come on.
You gotta help--

254
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,574
I caught him.
You clean him.

255
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,742
Dillard, come back!

256
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,411
( laughs )

257
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,012
( door closes )

258
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,381
( sighs )

259
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,789
Sam:
I'm sick of eating this.

260
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,792
You ever had raw mule?

261
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,362
No, but I had
a locust once.

262
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,465
It just--it just
popped in my mouth
like a berry,

263
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,700
and--and it
just flew around,

264
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,768
and I could feel
its little wings
flapping.

265
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,604
Oh, and then,
one time, this fly
went down my throat,

266
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,940
and it was buzzing
all the way down.
It--It tickled.

267
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,777
How long have the McCluskeys
been stealing from you?

268
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,886
How long?

269
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,893
I don't know.
Since Mama died.

270
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,797
Your old man
ain't doing nothing?

271
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,603
It's not that bad.

272
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,674
Pop says they're
just desperate,
like all folk.

273
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,911
Well, they can catch
their own goddamn food.

274
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,482
They don't know
how to trap.

275
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:08,652
They don't
know the spots,
how to catch 'em.

276
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,856
Not like Pop does.

277
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,945
May this food
restore our strength,

278
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,947
giving new energy
to tired limbs,

279
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,616
new thoughts
to weary minds,

280
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,551
giving new visions
of dry spirits,

281
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,519
new warmth
to cold hearts,

282
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,855
and once refreshed,
may we give new
pleasure to you,

283
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:45,723
who gives us all.

284
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,725
Please be with Mama
in Heaven.

285
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,460
And protect
Uncle Wade.

286
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,862
- Amen.
- Amen.

287
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,963
Amen.

288
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,100
Amen.

289
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,968
You hear that?

290
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,770
That is
the type of love

291
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,206
that kept me
in one piece out there.

292
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,509
Did you think
I could hear you, hmm?

293
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,477
In my darkest moment,

294
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,112
I knew you two were
right there with me.

295
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,047
Oh, we was only praying
for you to come back

296
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,550
so you could shoot us
some dinner like you done.

297
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,651
Wade:
Oh, Abby just ruined it.

298
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,120
I don't want to hear
you joking about your
prayers to the Lord.

299
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:20,191
Oh, heaven forbid you have
a sense of humor, Lord.

300
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:21,125
- ( laughs )
- Mm, I know.

301
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,561
I know it's not boar,
but raccoon will have to do.

302
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:27,531
Of course, them McCluskeys
got a thing or two to do
about that, don't they?

303
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,866
Hmm, now,
if it was up to me--

304
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,801
I know it's not--
I'd go over there,

305
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,203
and I'd wring
their necks,

306
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,471
teach them
a lesson or two.

307
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,171
That's enough, Wade.

308
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,506
Mm, you have
not instilled in me

309
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,142
the sense of patience
that you've instilled
in my brother-in-law,

310
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,644
my brother-in-law,
who can pray for
a problem to go away.

311
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,582
- You're real good at that,
ain't you, Seamus?
- ( table bangs )

312
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,854
I said that's enough.

313
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,850
You say your prayers?

314
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,970
You know, when I was
about your age...

315
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,641
my pa, he...

316
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,011
he asked me...

317
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:52,883
what I would do
if I came across a wolf.

318
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,086
Would I panic...

319
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,057
and run off?

320
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,962
Would I try
to scare it off?

321
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,799
Or would I...

322
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,938
would I just leave it be

323
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,142
and act like I never
saw it to begin with?

324
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,114
You'd kill it.

325
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,293
Even if it
never did me harm?

326
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,097
But it could.

327
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,937
( sighs )

328
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,215
( sniffs )

329
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,772
( door creaks )

330
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,831
( gasps )

331
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,400
( thunder rumbles )

332
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,203
Quite a spot
you got you here.

333
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:47,518
      I'll clean up for you
           little bit.

334
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,286
Let's see.

335
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:52,556
I got you these.

336
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,160
         I'm just gonna
   set 'em right here for you.

337
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,830
You do with 'em
what you want.

338
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,865
( chuckles )

339
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,867
Kids are all right.

340
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,337
Abby's all grown up.

341
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,239
She's--

342
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,542
She's a woman,

343
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,944
reminds me of you.

344
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,982
Sammy's--

345
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,350
He's good.

346
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:24,321
          He's strong,
      and he's a sweet kid.

347
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,024
You done a good job.

348
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,494
( music playing )

349
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,876
( music playing only )

350
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,828
( insects chirping )

351
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,130
( match flicks )

352
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,169
( hoofbeats )

353
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,471
( horse snorting )

354
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,847
( horse neighs )

355
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,651
Howdy, Mr. McCluskey.

356
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,419
Howdy-do, Wade.

357
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,955
Go on.
Make yourself at home.

358
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,092
I ain't seen you
in a long time.

359
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,226
( horse neighs )

360
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:40,998
Been about five years
since my last visit.

361
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,067
( clears throat )

362
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,270
Yeah, well,
you're looking good.

363
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,206
You come back
in one piece.

364
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,441
I did better
than most.

365
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:56,280
I wanted to come by
and give my condolences
for Jasper.

366
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:02,653
Yeah, well, war has
to have its consequences,
don't it?

367
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,022
Yeah, it does.

368
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:12,262
So how long you
staying around here for?

369
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,530
Ah, you know me.

370
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:16,199
I like to come and go.

371
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:20,103
But I figured
I'd try to stay on
for a while,

372
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,239
make sure the family's
all right.

373
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:25,008
I know
it's tough around here.

374
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,378
Noticed
your cattle's gone.

375
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Yeah, well,
the Confederate boys,

376
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:34,117
they come in here and
commandeered everything,

377
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,620
but we're doing fine.

378
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,289
Good.

379
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,029
Well, if you need
anything from us,

380
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,031
you don't hesitate
to ask.

381
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:52,469
Well, that's mighty
neighborly of you, Wade.

382
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,572
I appreciate you
saying that.

383
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,409
But like I said,

384
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,279
we're managing just fine.

385
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,549
Yeah, cattleman
without cattle

386
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,584
is doing just fine.

387
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,357
Don't go dancing
around a maypole, son.

388
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,159
You sound like
you got something to say.

389
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,996
Oh, I ain't dancing.

390
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,098
I'm just curious is all.

391
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,133
Curious?

392
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,135
( chuckles )

393
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,437
A man,
he ought to be careful

394
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,241
messing around with
another man's business.

395
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,645
Couldn't have said that
better myself.

396
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:42,519
You go mosey on now, Wade.

397
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,521
Get off my porch.

398
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,056
( match flicks )

399
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,398
I was asking you nice.

400
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,236
( horse neighs )

401
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,638
( music playing )

402
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,074
( whittling )

403
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,456
You're so beautiful.

404
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,167
Don't.

405
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,201
( laughing )

406
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:41,238
Are you afraid
of a little water?

407
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,174
Oh.

408
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,209
That's it.

409
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,578
Okay, how do I do it?

410
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,547
- So you sort of lean...
- ( laughs )

411
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,450
and just give it
a smooth throw.

412
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,218
Give it a try.

413
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,288
- Okay.
- Okay.

414
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,458
Let's see
what you got.

415
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,695
Ooh. Frog. Ooh!

416
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,830
( chuckles )

417
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,331
( rocks clack )

418
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,574
( yelps, laughs )

419
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,442
What's wrong?

420
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,179
It's nothing.

421
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,882
Tell me.

422
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,718
Your uncle came
to the house today,

423
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,787
had words with Pa.

424
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:36,293
For some reason,
he's got it out for us.

425
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,761
( chuckles )

426
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,200
Some reason?

427
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,602
You know the reason.

428
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,405
I know what Pop
and Dillard are doing

429
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:49,406
ain't right, but--

430
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,608
I ain't just them two.

431
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,710
What am I
supposed to do?

432
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:58,782
They'd beat the white
off of me if I didn't
go along with it.

433
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,553
That's coward talk.

434
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,290
I ain't no coward.

435
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,308
( chopping continues )

436
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,744
- Pa.
- Thank you, Abby.

437
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,291
Sammy.

438
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,416
( breathing heavily )

439
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,718
( water sloshing )

440
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,323
( exhales )

441
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,802
( hoofbeats )

442
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,438
( horse neighs )

443
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,750
( horse neighs )

444
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,919
Best make sure
that fire of yourn

445
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,688
don't spread
on over to my land.

446
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,526
You ride all the way
out here to tell me
about my fire, Randolph?

447
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:52,329
Don't sass me,
Seamus.

448
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,496
I rode out here
to tell you

449
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,633
to keep that
wild dog of yourn
off my property.

450
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,935
( horses neigh )

451
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,804
Just trying to help.

452
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:01,404
Help?

453
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,607
I'm the one that
helped your sister
when she got sick.

454
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,110
You didn't
tell him that,
did you, Seamus?

455
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,878
Our debt's been paid,
Randolph.

456
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,981
I'm the one
that decides when
your debt is paid,

457
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,050
and you're far
from it, boy!

458
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,952
( hoofbeats )

459
00:39:55,494 --> 00:40:02,098
"And God saw that
the wickedness of man
was great in the earth,

460
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,503
"and that every imagination
of the thought

461
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:11,574
"of his heart was
only evil continually.

462
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,879
"And the Lord said,
'I will destroy men

463
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:19,749
"'whom I have created
from the face of the earth...

464
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:24,554
for it repenteth me
that I have made them.'"

465
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,157
Boy, they are wretched.

466
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,200
Why did you go there?

467
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:41,037
Why do you let them
do this to you?

468
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:45,708
That's not
your concern, Wade.

469
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:51,214
Well, like it or not,
I am your family.

470
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,850
I have a right to know.

471
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:01,157
They don't take much.

472
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,996
That's not the point.

473
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,833
It's wrong.

474
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:13,470
And you, of all people,
should know that.

475
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,777
Let me help you.

476
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,981
I don't need your help.

477

filled with violence.

00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:36,125
I was in the war...

480
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:43,132
I saw a lot of men
get down on their knees
and start praying.

481
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:47,604
They died
all the same.

482
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,140
Sometimes
in this life

483
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,177
you need to do
things for yourself.

484
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,624
( gasps )

485

Oh, look. It's a 10.

00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,801
( laughs )

492
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,073
All right, jeez, man.

493
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:32,108
Look at this here.

494
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:32,909
( trap clatters )

495
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:35,845
Nice. We got a...

00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:44,954
Howdy.

498
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,860
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

499
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:51,794
It's all right.

500
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:52,729
It's just me, Wade.

501
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:56,599
I was just
sitting there,
and I saw you.

502
00:43:56,901 --> 00:44:00,870
Just wanted
to say hello, Dill.

503
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,238
It's been a while.

504
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
What you want?

505
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,308
Nothing.

506
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,978
You wanna
put the gun down?

507
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:14,884
I ain't--I ain't
supposed to talk to you.

508
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:19,789
Ah, well, I ain't
gonna cause any trouble.

509
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,291
Then what you want?!

510
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,895
Nothing,
like I told you.

511
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,164
Just wanna come by
and say howdy.

512
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,933
Can't a guy
do that anymore?

513
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,975
That's nice.

514
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:42,779
That is a real
nice collection
you got there.

515
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:47,183
No, no, no, I didn't
mean anything by that.

516
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:54,123
Got yourself a raccoon,
skunk, and a rabbit.

517
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,725
That's a big coon.

518
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:59,028
That is
a big raccoon.

519
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,230
Hey, you remember
that time

520
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:04,734
when we were out
in your father's
pasture...

521
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:07,103
and we spooked
the cattle?

522
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:11,207
You remember that?
And they went running.

523
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,341
Yeah.

524
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,877
Craziest thing
I ever saw.

525
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,344
( laughs )

526
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,814
Them big dumb animals
running everywhere.

527
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,449
And then
your--your old man

528
00:45:19,451 --> 00:45:22,852
comes crashing out
of that front porch,

529
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,153
and he starts
yelling at us.

530
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,155
- ( both laughing )
- You remember that?

531
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,061
Uh-huh.

532
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,396
What happened
after that?

533
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,332
Uh, he's chasing us.

534
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:39,168
- Uh-huh.
- And--And you says,
"Run for it,

535
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,370
and I got away
from him 'fore...

536
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:44,974
( chuckles )

537
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:51,314
And you ain't
never said a thing.

538
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,917
Yeah.

539
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,856
( screaming )

540
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,826
Please!

541
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:07,029
Please! ( screams )

542
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,832
Please!
( sobbing )

543
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,901
( screams )

544
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:15,238
Please! ( screams )

545
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,207
( screaming )

546
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,110
( music playing )

547
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,379
Mama!

548
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,849
Mama!

549
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,852
( screams )

550
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:31,521
Come on!

551
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:34,524
( screams )

552
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:37,026
Please!

553
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,395
Please! God!

554
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,497
( screams )

555
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,066
Please!
( sobbing )

556
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,023
( sniffs )

557
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,961
Abigail.

558
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:14,997
Just gonna
go pick some flowers.

559
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,189
( steady creaking )

560
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,941
Mama,

561
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:03,145
you shouldn't be
in Jasper's room.

562
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,614
( creaking )

563
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:07,116
Mm. Mm.

564
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,620
- ( wails ) I been--
- ( shushing )

565
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:11,988
It's all right.

566
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,356
( gasping )

567
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:15,491
( shushing )

568
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,294
- ( water splashes )
- ( shushing )

569
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,499
( muttering )

570
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,369
It's all right, Mama.

571
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:28,905
Dillard?!

572
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,440
You seen your brother?

573
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:33,643
No. What was he doing?

574
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,045
He was due back
hours ago.

575
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,513
( door crashes )

576
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:42,285
Dillard!
Come here, son.

577
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,486
What...

578
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:44,453
( grunting )
He--He...

579
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,188
Who done this to you, boy?

580
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,190
He did it.
He stole it, Pa.

581
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,559
- ( groans )
- Who?

582
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,527
Aah!

583
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,396
It was Wade.

584
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,531
- Ohh!
- Don't move, boy.

585
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,168
Don't move.

586
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,404
( wincing )

587
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,573
( buzzing )

588
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,677
( water lapping )

589
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,487
You told me
it would stop.

590
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,328
What do you want,
pelts, meat?

591
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,629
I'll go get it
for you right now.

592
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,598
Abby, please,
can you just tell him
to lay low, will you?

593
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,568
Just let this all
blow over. Come on.

594
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:37,974
What, so it can go back
to how it was?

595
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,442
Yeah, exactly.

596
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,644
Bet your father
would like that.

597
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,745
Abby, I want
the same as you do.

598
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:47,083
I just--
I need a little more time
to figure this out, okay?

599
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:52,021
We--We ain't gotta
be like them.

600
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,024
We're different. We both--

601
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,660
We're different, and--

602
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:02,999
Why do you think I want
to see you all the time? Hmm?

603
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,034
( laughs )

604
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:07,436
I'm the only girl
for miles.

605
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,272
Don't want no other girl.

606
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,174
I want you.

607
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,213
I don't know.

608
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,280
Hey,

609
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:22,084
ain't nothing to worry about,
you hear me?

610
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:22,585
You hear me?

611
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,588
Everything's gonna
be just fine, okay?

612
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,204
( horse neighing )

613
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,510
( horse snorts )

614
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:48,344
What's going on?

615
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:52,515
Eh, nice of you
to join your family
for a change.

616
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,316
What are you doing?

617
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:55,384
What you think
we're doing?

618
00:50:55,386 --> 00:51:00,089
Think I'm gonna let
that son of a bitch
have his way with us?

619
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:00,823
Dillard was stealing.

620
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:04,226
You told him to.
What do you expect
Wade to do?

621
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,128
( horse neighs )

622
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,463
Listen to me, boy.

623
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:09,698
You're gonna get
back up on that horse,

624
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,200
and you're
gonna come with us,

625
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:15,204
or as God is
my witness, I'm gonna
kill you dead.

626
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,573
( heavy breathing )

627
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,280
Hold that
right there, Sammy.

628
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:28,117
Down low. Hold it low.
Both hands.

629
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,622
All right,
go ahead. Let go.

630
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,404
What you got there?

631
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:54,477
Thought Sammy
might like it.

632
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:59,482
( whittling )

633
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:08,591
( blows )

634
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,898
It must've been horrible
out there in that war.

635
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,235
Is this the peace
you were looking for?

636
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,172
Work keeps me busy.

637
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,641
( whittling )

638
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,381
Uncle...

639
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,485
I know
the McCluskeys have
been bothering you.

640
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:42,424
Seems like
I'm the only one.

641
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,559
That ain't true.

642
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:47,830
Okay, no one likes it,
but they leave us alone.

643
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:51,167
It really
ain't that bad.

644
00:52:55,907 --> 00:53:01,210
You think your mother
would've stood for it?

645
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,520
Things will change.

646
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:15,357
The war's over now,
and they'll get
their business back,

647
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,761
and they won't have
no need for us anymore.

648
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,697
You'll see.

649
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,579
I caught
that Dillard prowling
through our traps.

650
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:40,950
He left right quick,
though.

651
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:43,319
Dropped all
them pelts, too.

652
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,421
You shouldn't
have hurt him, Wade.

653
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,324
Can't give McCluskey
no reason.

654
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,330
I didn't touch him.

655
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,434
I-I'm just afraid
that you might

656
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:01,303
if you were
to catch him again.

657
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,580
All I want is
for us to be safe,

658
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,882
for Sammy
to be safe.

659
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,660
That's all I want, too.

660
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,789
( horse neighs )

661
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:04,066
( hoofbeats )

662
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,068
- ( gear clanking )
- ( gasps )

663
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,471
( horse neighs )

664
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,849
( door creaks open )

665
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,797
Children, go inside.

666
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,503
Come on, Sammy.

667
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,729
What have you done?

668
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:14,737
I'm not gonna
sit back and let them
muck my family.

669
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:15,804
( trap rattles )

670
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:16,772
This is my family, Wade.

671
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:19,007
I told my sister
I'd look out
for those kids.

672
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,877
She has got nothing
to do with this!

673
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,514
Yes, she does.

674
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:28,050
This is your debt.

675
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,586
You have no idea.

676
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:33,822
I did everything,
everything.

677
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:34,957
Bullshit.

678
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:37,860
You and I
both know that,

679
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:40,596
and she was
your wife.

680
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,602
Don't you think
I know that?

681
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:50,072
We took a pact
before God--

682
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,407
Fuck God!

683
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:55,911
She was the godliest
creature I ever saw!

684
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:01,650
He says,
"Thou shalt not steal,"

685
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:05,654
and you let
these animals
steal from you?

686
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,457
You're a coward, Seamus.

687
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,893
You are a coward,

688
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,895
and you are
not righteous,

689
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,563
and you are not holy.

690
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:18,133
She got sick, and you
turned your back.

691
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,643
( clicks )

692
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,547
( footsteps )

693
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,924
"If any of you lack wisdom,

694
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:45,561
"let him ask of God,
that giveth all men
liberally...

695
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,230
"let him ask in faith,

696
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:49,031
"Nothing wavering:

697
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:54,436
for he that waverth
is like the wave
of the sea..."

698
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,710
( music playing )

699
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:10,652
"A double-minded man is
unstable in all his ways."

700
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,108
( panting )

701
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,616
( wood clatters )

702
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,249
( spits )

703
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,646
Uncle Wade?

704
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,851
Uncle Wade?

705
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,696
Morning, Uncle Wade.

706
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,064
Papa went to town,

707
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,167
said you needed
to set those traps.

708
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:46,708
It's true
what you said...

709
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,077
about Mom and all.

710
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,950
Good man stands up
for his family...

711
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,253
for his country.

712
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:01,757
He didn't even
fight in the war.

713
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,296
Uncle Wade...

714
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:13,035
when you leave,
I wanna go with you.

715
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,439
I wanna see
what the world's
like out there,

716
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:20,308
see all the things
you've seen...

717
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,712
fight alongside you.

718
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,914
I don't want
to stay here

719
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,282
and become
like my father.

720
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:28,817
Hell, I wish the war
wasn't over,

721
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:29,918
so that when
I was old enough,

722
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,320
I could've fought
and killed all
them dirty Yankees,

723
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:33,822
just like you did.

724
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,967
( chair clatters )

725
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:53,408
You wanna know
what it was like?

726
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,685
You really think
you can do what I do?

727
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:06,288
Do you?

728
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,224
- Do you?!
- ( yelps )

729
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,793
( breathing heavily )

730
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,471
( water splashes )

731
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:58,073
Hi there.

732
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,410
I came here to be alone.

733
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,780
Abigail,
wait, wait, wait.

734
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:08,984
Were you a part of it?

735
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,419
- I tried to stop it,
but my father--
- You're a coward.

736
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:15,490
None of this would've
happened if it weren't
for your stupid uncle..

737
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,993
And your whole
godless family.

738
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,238
I'm sorry.

739
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,792
Leave with me.

740
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:55,163
We can go away
from all of this.

741
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,832
What?

742
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,600
I can get a job in town.

743
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,503
I'd take care of us,
Abby. You know I would.

744
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,172
I--We could start
a family of our own.

745
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,474
Don't be foolish.

746
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,143
I couldn't leave them.

747
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,511
Sure you could.

748
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,613
Sure you could.
They'd be all right.

749
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,481
What about your mother?

750
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:18,186
Think your brother
could take care of her
like you do?

751
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:25,093
Ain't nothing left
for me here...

752
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,301
nothing but you.

753
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,024
( kissing )

754
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,327
How were things
in town today?

755
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,029
Good and nice.

756
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:36,631
Ain't nothing
but boring old flowers.

757
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:40,035
They got roses up past
the McCluskey house.

758
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:44,506
I don't want you
going near there,
okay, Abigail?

759
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,508
I was just riding by.

760
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:51,613
You steer clear
of there. You hear me?

761
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:58,219
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could put
the past behind us?

762
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:01,056
What is done
cannot be undone.

763
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,392
Families
have been desperate
because of the war.

764
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:09,464
You haven't been here,
and so you don't what
it's been like.

765
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:13,668
I believe I have
a fairly good idea

766
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,604
of what the war
was like, Abby.

767
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,706
I was there.

768
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,574
But not here.

769
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:25,213
We're blessed
that Papa's good
at what he does.

770
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:28,350
We had food
when other families didn't.

771
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,354
Does that make it okay?

772
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,291
The Lord teaches us
to forgive.

773
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:38,259
Ain't that right, Papa?

774
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,328
Seamus:
That's right, Abigail.

775
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,036
I'm sorry.

776
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:53,508
I'm sorry for that
whole wretched family.

777
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,310
Wheezing pig
of a father,

778
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:57,545
brain-dead mother,
retard for a boy.

779
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:58,747
Who's the other boy?
Marcus?

780
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:02,350
I've known him since
he was young, and he was
always kind of soft.

781
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,519
Now he's just like
the rest of 'em,

782
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,054
a slave to his old man,

783
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,155
a good-for-nothing
coward.

784
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:08,523
He ain't like him.

785
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:17,432
Why are you
defending him?

786
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:22,537
You said it yourself.

787
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,608
They do what
their father tells them.

788
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:39,320
Say grace, Abigail.

789
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:44,025
( sighs )

790
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:46,327
May this food
restore our strength,

791
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,630
giving new energy
to tired limbs,

792
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:51,066
new thoughts
to weary minds,

793
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,667
giving new visions
to dried spirits

794
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,503
and new warmth
to cold hearts.

795
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,305
And once refreshed,

796
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,407
may we give
new pleasure to you,

797
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,042
who gives us all.

798
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,112
Please be with Mama
in Heaven.

799
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,482
( music playing )

800
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:24,065
( moaning )

801
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,851
- ( music stops )
- ( gun clicks )

802
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,604
Go back to sleep, Sammy.

803
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,190
( water splashing )

804
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:29,898
That feel good,
sweetheart?

805
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,135
( footsteps )

806
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,451
Hey, Mama.

807
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:52,687
How you doing?

808
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,698
Hey.

809
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:16,544
You look tired, Pa.
I could--

810
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,947
I can take over.

811
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,722
You hear that, Doris?

812
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:32,493
Your boy's
gonna take care of you.

813
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,330
Mm.

814
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,567
Mm.

815
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,404
( kiss )

816
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,245
Mm.

817
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,566
There's something I
haven't told you, Mama.

818
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,537
I got a girl.

819
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,565
Would you mind
if I had this?

820
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,336
Will you please--
Please, Mama.

821
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:49,504
( moans )

822
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,005
- Everything's--
- ( grunts )

823
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:52,473
It's all right,
Mama. Please.

824
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,474
- ( moaning )
- We're--

825
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,942
We're gonna be happy
together, Mama.

826
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,111
It's all right.
It's all right.

827
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:58,546
( shushing )
It's all right.

828
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,014
It's all right,
please, Mama!

829
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,649
We're gonna
be happy--

830
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,418
Mama, please,
please, please!

831
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,586
I need this, Mama!
Please!

832
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,922
I need--( gasping )

833
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:15,930
Oh.

834
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:18,833
Oh.

835
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,336
( music playing )

836
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:51,466
We can't
keep doing this.

837
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,800
Doing what?

838
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,836
This.

839
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:57,805
Meeting in secrecy
all the time.

840
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:58,806
( rocks clatter )

841
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,476
What if someone was
to find out about us?

842
01:13:01,478 --> 01:13:02,477
Don't worry
about that.

843
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,412
Your father's the one
who doesn't--

844
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:06,581
Don't worry
about it, Abigail.

845
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:13,488
And so you're gonna turn
your back on him and run?

846
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,427
If it means
we can be together.

847
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:40,715
It's beautiful.

848
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:47,588
This--This is
our way out of here.

849
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:49,624
We don't even need
to run away.

850
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:52,727
We can just
leave together.

851
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,033
I love you, Abigail.

852
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,783
( water splashes )

853
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,790
Hi there, Wade.

854
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,862
( water splashes )

855
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:04,966
Can I ask you a question?

856
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,269
Can I try on your hat?

857
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,238
Please?

858
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:12,907
- It'd mean a lot to me.
- I gotta be--

859
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:16,511
It'd mean a lot to me.
I'm not gonna mess it up.

860
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:21,816
What do you think?

861
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:22,617
Do I look smart?

862
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,719
Yeah, you look smart.
Can I have my hat?

863
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:26,821
That's a little bit
of a woman's hat.

864
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:27,722
Hold on. Hold that.

865
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,790
Let me see
how you look with my hat.

866
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,959
That's a man's hat.
Look at that.

867
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:34,128
Look at that.
Look at you.

868
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,765
You look good.

869
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,767
That's real nice.

870
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,878
( music playing )

871
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,227
( music playing only )

872
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,356
- ( water splashing )
- ( gasping )

873
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:37,191
Do you really think--
Look at me!

874
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:39,961
Look at me!
Look at me.

875
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:40,828
( coughing )

876
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:44,031
Stay away
from that girl.

877
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:48,736
( gasping )

878
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,745
( coughing )

879
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,761
( match flicks )

880
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:41,816
( sobbing )

881
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:13,380
Marcus.

882
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:16,984
You turn around,
and look at me, son.

883
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,060
Was it him
that done this to you?

884
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:28,429
Now don't you
lie to me, boy.

885
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,899
I promise you, Pa,
it was an accident.

886
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,000
An accident?

887
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:33,801
Yeah.

888
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:34,769
Like what's gonna happen

889
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:38,472
to that girl of yours,
you don't tell me
the truth.

890
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,474
What?
You don't think I know

891
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:44,745
where my son goes
damn near every day?

892
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,848
Don't you hurt her.

893
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,483
Was it him?!

894
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,519
Was it him?!

895
01:19:57,493 --> 01:20:00,227
( birds chirping )

896
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:12,006
Get out of here.

897
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,791
( sighs )

898
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:43,404
Pull.

899
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,180
Howdy.

900
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:14,461
Before Earl Van Dorn
became General,

901
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:19,066
he was in charge
of Confederate forces
of Texas.

902
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:24,672
Mostly we were all on
recruiting trips then.

903
01:22:24,674 --> 01:22:28,142
He has a taste
for finer things
in life,

904
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:30,077
including bird
for dinner.

905
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,548
Well, we come across
these two pups,

906
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:38,986
and he asked,
"Who's good
with animals?"

907
01:22:39,722 --> 01:22:41,722
I said, "I am."

908
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:45,192
Well, he says,
"Train them dogs."

909
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,329
And I did.

910
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:51,065
I trained them up
good and proper.

911
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,199
I'd bag a bird.

912
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,233
They'd go
and retrieve it

913
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:56,537
before I could blow
the smoke off my muzzle.

914
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:01,208
I loved them dogs.

915
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,451
Well, one night,

916
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:14,021
old Van Dorn wants
to join the hunt.

917
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:17,124
He wants to bag
himself a bird,
and he does.

918
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:20,194
It's big,
it's beautiful,

919
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:23,030
colors like a rainbow.

920
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,633
That bird goes down
over the horizon.

921
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:29,003
Them dogs take off.

922
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:32,740
Thing is,
they don't come back.

923
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,311
So we go
charging after 'em,

924
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:42,349
and we find them,
and they're tearing
that bird to pieces.

925
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:47,054
Limb from limb,

926
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:49,023
eating pieces whole,

927
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,226
blood on their snouts,
and it's in their teeth,

928
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:57,564
and Van Dorn tells me
to put them dogs down.

929
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:01,101
Once they
got the taste for it,

930
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:03,203
they can't be trusted.

931
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:08,442
Didn't feel right...

932
01:24:12,515 --> 01:24:14,481
but it was an order.

933
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:16,517
He told me to do it,

934
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:22,222
and so I shot
them dogs in the head
right then and there.

935
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:29,596
I think about
them dogs a lot.

936
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:34,201
Was it
their nature to kill?

937
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:39,073
I was training them
to go against it.

938
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:44,778
'Cause if you do that
to God's creatures
long enough...

939
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:48,482
something's gotta give.

940
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,090
( music playing )

941
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:11,772
( horses neigh )

942
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:21,448
( horse neighs )

943
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,716
Wade!

944
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:23,717
( snorts )

945
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,653
( neighs )

946
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:33,827
( horse neighing )

947
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:58,619
We got some business, son.

948
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:02,589
( horse neighs )

949
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,334
All right.

950
01:26:14,937 --> 01:26:18,172
Both your sons scream
like women, Randolph.

951
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:19,573
( neighs )

952
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:21,341
What you wager I slit

953
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,411
your whole family's
throats, you fat
son of a bitch!

954
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:26,613
- ( neighs )
- ( rifle fires )

955
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,451
( traps rattle )

956
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,822
Oh, no.

957
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,692
Abigail: No!
( wails )

958
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:41,695
( running footsteps )

959
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:46,500
( Abigail sobbing )

960
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:52,272
Seamus: You press
right there, Abigail.

961
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:54,374
Right there,
push on it.

962
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,210
You gotta
push on it.

963
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:59,379
- You okay, boy?
- ( Abigail sobbing )

964
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:01,915
- Okay. You'll be okay.
- ( patting )

965
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:03,517
You're gonna be all right.

966
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:04,618
Sammy.

967
01:27:05,487 --> 01:27:05,986
Wade: Sammy?

968
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:08,388
- You're gonna be okay.
- ( horse neighs )

969
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,758
- ( Abigail sobbing )
<i>- ( horses neighing )</i>

970
01:27:14,863 --> 01:27:16,597
You'll be okay.

971
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,332
( sobbing )

972
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:19,466
You're gonna
be okay, boy.

973
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:22,302
Wade: Sammy, you are fine.
You're fine, Sammy.

974
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:23,537
Sammy, you're fine.
Look at me.

975
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:26,240
Look at me, Sammy.
Look at me.

976
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:27,841
Sammy, look at me.

977
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:29,610
I love you.

978
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:31,678
Sammy, look at me.

979
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,746
Sammy!
Sammy, you're okay.

980
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,282
- You're gonna be fine.
- Go with the Lord, my son.

981
01:27:35,284 --> 01:27:37,584
There's nothing
wrong with you.

982
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:40,354
You be with the Lord.

983
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:42,422
Sammy.

984
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:43,757
Sammy.

( Abigail sobbing )

01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,033
( gasps )

987
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,559
You killed
