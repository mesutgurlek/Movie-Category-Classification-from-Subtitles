<i>Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! ¿ Qué quieres?</i>

35

You know,

41
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,353
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

42
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,233
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

43
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,395
Don't shoot me.

44

Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

45

You think you're pretty damn good,

In case you didn't know it there's more to

I admit your record is unrivalled.

89
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,709
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.

90

He lives clean

It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

Stay with it, son.

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,791
- Jim, I got a real good job in Las Cruces.
- Las Cruces?

160
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,309
We're gonna move there in two weeks.

161
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,878
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.

162
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm an independent woman now
and I got my own life to live.

163
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,999
I know, but you can
make your life right here.

164
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,918
<i>- Oh, Jim.
- (car pulls up)</i>

165
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,318
One day you're gonna meet some real
nice gal who won't mind sitting up nights,

166
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,479
waitin' to see if you're
gonna come home in one piece.

167
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,115
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's a nice town, it'll be good for Sally.

168
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,394
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.

169
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,236
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Bobby Drew.

170
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,679
Boyfriend?

171
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,750
I heard a lot about you. You were in the
Marines, won a Silver Star and everything.

172
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,469
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

173
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,310
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope
you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?

174
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,351
Uh, yeah, sure.

175
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,313
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

176
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,680
Bye. See you later.

177
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,596
Bye, Mom! See ya!

178
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,835
<i>(Sally) I'm ready to take Foxy out now.</i>

179
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,997
<i>- (Dakota) Just be patient.
- OK.</i>

180
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,872
All right. I'm ready to go.

181
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,151
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

182
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,431
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

183
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,358
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

184
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,916
Hey. How'd you like to bite that in the butt,
develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?

185
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,838
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

186
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,632
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

187
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,399
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

188
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,640
just before he got himself squashed
in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

189
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,548
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

190
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,671
But nobody can prove it.

191
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,191
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.

192
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,278
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

193
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,630
- Sally!
- Foxy!

194
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,599
- Sally!
- Help me!

195
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,395
Help!

196
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,553
It's all right. It's OK.

197
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,633
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

198
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,191
Thank you.

199
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,914
- What's your name?
- Sally.

200
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,191
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

201
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,713
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

202
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,150
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

203
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,111
<i>(car horn)</i>

204
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,438
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

205
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,438
And now you're my partner.

206
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,313
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

207
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,556
Pretty good.

208
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,353
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

209
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,869
Is that right?

210
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,755
Ranger Brown. Sally.

211
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,838
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

212
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,995
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

213
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,636
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

214
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,072
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

215
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,475
Good.

216
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,396
Hey, Foxy.

217
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,629
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

218
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,276
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

219
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,550
Gallop. Let's go.

220
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,238
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

221
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,790
# But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see

222
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,990
# There's a woman from El Paso and I
know she will be comin' here this evening

223
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,310
# She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'

224
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,878
# There's another girl from Dallas...

225
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,190
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

226
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,276
Forget it.

227
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,471
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

228
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,077
<i>(woman) It's Rawley showing off.</i>

229
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,030
This should be very interesting.

230
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,230
I see we are graced with the presence
of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.

231
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,596
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

232
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,116
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

233
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,195
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.

234
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,754
You are a greaser, aren't you?

235
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,956
Excuse me a minute.

236
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,712
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

237
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,831
Let me show you.

238
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,916
Come on, tough guy.

239
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,559
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

240
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,353
Do you wanna join the fun?

241
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,713
This is not my idea of fun!

242
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,193
Please let me apologise. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

243
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,278
Maybe you need some new friends.

244
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,751
Music! Play!

<i>This was my party.</i>

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,555
We should have booked those bastards.

248
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,277
If I locked up every guy who took a swing
at me, half the county'd be behind bars.

249
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,632
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

250

- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

252
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,317
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

- Yes.

I'm calling to verify that shipment
number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

313
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,518
<i>Yes, sir, it certainly did.</i>

314
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,394
<i>- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.</i>

315
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,511
<i>- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.</i>

316
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,756
<i>- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.</i>

317
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,677
<i>(knock at door)</i>

318
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,917
<i>- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?</i>

319
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,873
<i>- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?</i>

320
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,150
<i>- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?</i>

321
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,874
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?

322
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,992
<i>I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.</i>

323
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,998
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

324
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,159
Follow me.

325
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,150
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

326
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,272
- Who?
- The military central computer.

327
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,552
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

328
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,555
- Shit.
- If you get it figured out, kid, let me know.

329
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,719
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

330
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,475
I got it.

331
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,193
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

332
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,309
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

333
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,913
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

334
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,958
<i>(McQuade) Here's our little Judas goat.</i>

335
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,228
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

336
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,669
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

337
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,349
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

338
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,793
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

339
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,753
Let's go.

340
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,518
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

341
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,119
What?

342
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,634
You're learning, kid.

343
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,195
I see I got a lot more to learn.

344
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,039
Come on, kid.

345
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,116
Son of a bitch.

346
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,876
Whoops.

347
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,033
<i>¿ Señora?</i>

348
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,596
<i>¿ Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?</i>

349
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,916
<i>Gracias.</i>

350
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,752
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

351
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,950
Watch it!

352
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,108
Round the front.

353
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,232
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

354
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,995
Goddammit! Shit!

355
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,992
Don't!

356
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,918
- No! No!
- Come on!

357
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,395
<i>(Snow moans and whimpers)</i>

358
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,833
Come on.

359
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,077
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

360
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,637
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

361
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,474
You're gettin' more slippery all the time,
ain't you?

362
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,639
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

363
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,159
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

364
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,918
<i>(Snow) You son of a bitch!</i>

365
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,156
Can I borrow that contraption?

366
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,719
Sure.

367
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,633
What are you gonna do?

368
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,632
Stop! Wait!

369
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,270
<i>(Dakota) Got something to say, pissant?</i>

370
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,154
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

371
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,793
Emilio Falcon?

372
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,957
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

373
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,516
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

374
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,236
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

375
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,877
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico,
to Central America, to terrorists and stuff!

376
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,309
All over the place.

377
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,317
I don't know.

378
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,672
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

379
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,434
Please? Please?

380
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,313
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

381
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,197
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

382
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,470
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.

383
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,194
It has been my pleasure, JJ.

384
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,635
Hang onto him till I get back.

385
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,150
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Señor Falcon.

386
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,034
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

387
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,116
<i>Bueno.</i>

388
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,279
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

389
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,315
<i>(Snow) What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.</i>

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,196
<i>(singing)</i>

391
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,631
What the hell?

392
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,716
Damn!

393
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,234
<i>(singing and sound of vacuum cleaner)</i>

394
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,675
<i>(she sings loudly)</i>

395
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,469
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

396
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,388
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

397
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,913
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

398
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,951
What's this?

399
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,036
Vitamins.

400
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,430
Where's my beer?

401
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,115
In the garbage.

402
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,631
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

403
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,596
Lady...

404
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,157
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

405
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,277
Fine. That's just fine.

406
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,356
<i>Adios.</i>

407
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,192
<i>(door slams)</i>

408
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,952
Shit.

409

Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

410
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,116
Look, uh...

411
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,358
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

412
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,355
What I mean is...

413
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,035
Lola, I...

414
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,356
I'm sorry.

415
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,756
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

416
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,716
Yeah, I know.

417
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,636
<i>(she sobs)</i>

418
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,315
Hey! I'm not the trash.

419
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,759
OK, you're asking for it.

420
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,437
OK. Here.

421
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,116
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

422
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,992
Hey.

423
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,150
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

424
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,430
As you can see, mine's bigger.

425
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,994
Mine's loaded.

426
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,155
<i>(laughs)</i>

427
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,796
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

428
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,831
<i>- (buzzer)
- Damn!</i>

429
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,916
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

430
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,511
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

431
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,315
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

432
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,238
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

433
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,590
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.

434
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,350
However the certain party who is stealing
the guns was once a close friend of mine.

435
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,597
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

436
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,792
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...

437
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,552
Why am I telling you this? You will find
these things out for yourself in good time.

438
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,310
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.

439
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,719
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

440
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,790
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having
a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.

441
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,237
<i>(Falcon) Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.</i>

442
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,990
<i>I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now. (cackles)</i>

443
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,559
<i>- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.</i>

444
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,752
<i>That line's been reported out of order.</i>

445
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,518
Mm-hm.

446
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,916
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

447
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,998
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

448
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,636
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

449
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,150
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

450
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,116
You didn't win here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of your money. How much this time?

451
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,119
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.

452
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,549
Sit still, boy!

453
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,232
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.

454
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,559
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly
inferior to mine, but you're going to like it.

455
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,958
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

456
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,753
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

457
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,589
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

458
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,158
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

459
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,750
You don't play cards, you play people.

460
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,269
Loose lips sink ships.

461
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,550
You understand?

462
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,353
I thought you would.

463
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,677
I just play the cards good and tight.

464
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,394

Captain.

Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

475
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,152
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

476
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,513
- Feds.
- You better read this.

- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

They provide every damn terrorist
organisation in the world with our guns.

480

I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.

481
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,430
You withheld evidence, harboured
a key witness in a federal investigation,

482
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,429
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

483
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,790
I've no choice but to put you on probation.

484

You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

That won't be necessary. Not yet.

- No, I'd better get going.

I don't wanna leave you.

You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

I'm gonna miss you, honey.

- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

508

Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

511
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,519
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

512
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,839
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

513

See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

Get to the point.

- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.

517
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,710
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

<i>(McQuade) There are no roads up here.</i>

520

There's been some activity here. Pretty
well-organised for the middle of nowhere.

There's nothing

01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,951
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

530
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,672
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine by me.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

531
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,920
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

532
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,157
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?

533
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,039
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

534
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,591
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

535
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,197
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

536
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,311
What the hell?

537
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,395
Hang on.

538
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,469

- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,760
Let's go.

540
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,394
A real pretty setup, huh?

541
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,120
It's been too easy.

542
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,596
Let's check around
before we make a move.

543
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,918
Burnside, hold it.

544

- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

545
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,559
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

546
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,557
Get down!

547
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,279
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

548
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,473
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

Rawley, please! Rawley!

554
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,960
I waited a long time for this.

555
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,356
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

556
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,429
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

557
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,990
Get her out of here.

558
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,395
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

559
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,119
Pick him up.

560
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,635
Put him in it.

561

Jim...

623
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,153
I'm so happy you're alive.

624
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,318
Where do you think you're going, dude?

625
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,518
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough round here.
- McQuade.

626
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,235
Get that crap off.

627
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,229
Let's get out of here.

Remember me, greaser?

630
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,078
Yeah. I never forget an asshole.

631
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,594
Stay here.

632
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,075
Oh, shit.

633
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,758
Dammit.

634
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,715
Agh!

635
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,759
Come on. Come on.

636
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,272
Damn! I knew I forgot something.

Welcome to my hacienda, Mr McQuade.

639
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,513
How nice of you to pay a social visit.

640
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,558
Daddy!

Daddy!

Come on.

No! Stop it!

Are you all right, honey?

648
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,595
Gimme that gun.

- Rawley! No!

Come on.

Jim...

652
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,754
I didn't betray you.

653
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:23,359
Rawley killed my husband
and forced me to be his partner.

654
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,916
I had no choice. He would have killed me.

655
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,599
I love you.

656
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,798
Hey, McQuade!

657
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,392
Daddy...

658
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,279
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?

659
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,109
Don't move, don't talk,
and everything will be just fine.

660
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,594
We made a deal, McQuade.

661
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,553
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.

662
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,914
You wanna try for three?

663
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,752
McQuade, wait. Wait!

664
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,917
<i>You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?</i>

665
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,989
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.

666
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,953
You can't leave me! McQuade!

667
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,559
McQuade!

668
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,557
Wait! McQuade!

669
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:41,070
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!

670
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,670
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!

671
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:01,318
Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

672
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,159
And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

673
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,953
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

674
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,675
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

675
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:18,229
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

676
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:22,751
I feel responsible for every move he's
made. After all, I taught him all he knows.

677
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,316
- He has style. The best always have style.
- Bullshit.

Daddy!

679
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,909
- Dad!
- That's my girl.

680
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,511
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

681
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,153
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

682
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,590
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

683
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,156
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

684

Oh, boy. Here we go.

Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

687
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,312
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

688
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,750
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

689

Daddy?

690
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,515
Hostages?

691
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,432
Daddy?

692
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,516
Are you comin'?

693
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,590
See you later. Let's go.

JJ McQuade, you'll never change!

Oh, hell.
