- Oh, Pa, won't you even try them?

459
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,088
- Just take a look.
- Can you read the chart?

460
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,732
Did you ever hear tell
of an eagle wearing spectacles?

461
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,131
- That's true, Pa, but if you just try them...
- Now, listen, all of you.

462
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,770
I've got something to say.

463
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,099
I've decided to withdraw
from the nail shoot.

464
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,242
- No, Pa.
- You can't do that.

465
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,345
I want no wailing or urging.
My decision is irrevocable.

466

And I've had enough glory to last me.
So good night.

Ah.

468

"enough glory"?

469
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,588
He's talking about his pride.

470

He knows he'd get beat,
and he don't wanna be humiliated.

Poor Cadmus. He's so stubborn.

If there was only some way we could
get him to put on glasses just once.

- Not unless he got tricked into it.

think of something?

- You go right ahead.

Well, Cadmus, it's true, then?

480

You're backing out...

481

...and leaving the shooting
to us younger fellas?

Now let's get on with the rules.

Well, we'll need another judge.
You got anybody in mind?

Don't look like
you'll have much competition, Lige.

488
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:22,290
- It'll make a judge's job easy.
- Well, I don't look for any trouble.

Say, how about you for a judge, Gentry?

490
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,632
You can't shoot with that lame arm.
All right with you, Cadmus?

491
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,165
- Oh, it's no consequence to me.
- Glad to help out.

All right, then, now.

- Mary, what are you doing here?
- I'm shooting with the Cherne family.

494
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,172
It ain't legal.
A woman in the shoot. I protest.

495
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,940
I say it is legal. No reason why
a female shouldn't compete.

496
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:49,576
- Uh, what's your ruling, Gentry?
- She's entitled. She's a Cherne.

497
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,155
Maybe making you a judge
wasn't such an all-fired good idea.
