When I was your advocate.

Now look at you.

00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:29,121
You're tragic.

Your hour has passed.

170
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,061
Your railroad will fail
without me.

171
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,229
It's no longer my railroad.

175
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:50,339
Because you are not one of us.

You will never be
from Massachusetts or New York.

177

You will always
be from Mississippi.

you're deluded.

Very good.

189
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,470
Maybe an open frock
with a Fuller waist?

How come I gotta be

don't forget
your Irish kinsmen.

213
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,001
When I land this job,
I'll need two or three.

That's for sure.
Hundred?

- Thousand.
- Ah.

216

We appreciate all you've done
for the railroad.

Both Doc Durant
and the late Mrs. Lily Bell

Have you ever been
to Washington, Mr. Bohannon?

He comes
with my personal recommendation.

250
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,465
He was the Chief Engineer

of the Westwood
and Upclair Railway.

252

Yeah, that sounds like
a Shortline Railroad to me.

253

of two major trestles.

Yes, your son-in-law
comes well-appointed.

as Undersecretary
of the Railroad.

258

Fought with Black Dave Hunter
on the winning side.

260

All due respect, I don't
doubt your son-in-law's ability

00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:58,218
to build pretty Bridges
over stony brook streams,

262
00:20:58,253 --> 00:20:59,219
but that's not
what we're facing

- It's not very accurate.

Here's the beginning
of the red desert.

269
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,562
Now we'll be good along here.

270
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,030
Plenty of grazing
for our feed cattle,

Here's where we start
running out of water.

I've drawn up some designs...
For water cars.

Here are some designs
for dormitory cars.

out of the elements, healthier,

Who will build these?

278
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,215
We'll build 'em together,

279
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,250
just like we'll build
this railroad.

280

Now here we start hitting
real Indian country hard.

Shoshone, Crow, Kiowa...
some friendly, some not.

has he ever been
in Indian territory?

rail and ties here,

to thaw.

Mmmm, river's already
breaking up here South.

was able to work

Then the race is on, gentlemen.

293
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,983
No time to waste.

294
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,686
Now this...

295
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,322
These are plans for organizing
the rail-layers and tie crews.

296
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,957
Think we can get
more steel laid.

297
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,860
Probably 30% more steel

298
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,963
if we follow these regimens.

Were we to take you on
in some capacity,

301
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,977
you'd be paid in U.P. stock.

302
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,713
We feel that that would
make your involvement

303
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,649
more of a personal investment.

I'm already more invested
than you'll ever know.

306

There's a lot of graves
along this railroad,

307
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,026
marked and unmarked.

308
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,907
Some I laid to rest myself
and some... time or two.

309
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:07,834
Point is...

I make no apologies
for my temperament.

311

Mr. Bohannon,
I believe you're bleeding.

312
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,680
Surely not from shaking hands
with a shaving razor.

313
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,848
Wolves, actually.

314
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,620
The kind that bite.

315

Why don't you shake hands
with the new Chief Engineer

I'd rather shake hands
with the devil.

318

You may well
before this is over.

319
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,566
You made 'em think
I was your Butler or something?

320
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,567
I did, and it worked.

321
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,803
Got the job.

322
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,839

I was hoping
we could maintain it similar.

You know why?

349

Mr. Durant's a fine man.

with solid gold.

Wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Bohannon?

That is, of course,

are not my concern.

It's called attrition,
according to Mr. Durant.

The day it's just me and you

He ain't my nigger.

So when do you think
you'll be able

to send out

to commence business?

Mr. Durant
would never do that.

you have no interest

in dealing with me
or my enterprise.

00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:41,538
Better sleeping quarters,
heating throughout.

489
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:43,373
Can we get a cot in here
or something for Mr. Ferguson

490
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,208
for the ride back to Omaha?

491
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:48,812
I loaned Mr. Ferguson money
for passage on the negro car.

492
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:56,819
Mr. Huntington.

493
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:59,655
Collis Huntington,
head of Central Pacific.

494
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,325
Whoa.

495
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,661
I'm glad I caught you, sir.
Been wanting to meet you.

496
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,165
Especially when I heard
you weren't dead.

497
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,803
Mr. Beale, may I have a moment
with Mr. Bohannon, please?

498
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:17,006
The package on the desk
contains your issued stock.

499
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,943
Thank you, Mr. Beale.

500
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,955
You're being paid in stock

501
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,323
because the Union Pacific's lenders

502
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:37,359
have closed their books.

503
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:42,297
Government's guaranteeing us.

504
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,666
Government's in chaos.

505
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,802
Senate wants to impeach the
president for reconstruction.

506
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,505
The house is investigating him

507
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:50,272
for the assassination
of Lincoln.

508
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:51,673
There'll be no new vote

509
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,642
on railroad funding
until next session.

510
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,345
In short, Mr. Bohannon,
you and your railroad are broke.

511
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:58,347
Got stockpiles in Missouri.

512
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,282
I'll be in Wyoming by fall.

513
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:03,118
No, you won't, Mr. Bohannon,
regardless of your pace.

514
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,187
I was making 2 mile a day.

515
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,721
Sometimes 5
when the work was good.

516
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,557
You know
what progress I'm making?

517
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:10,725
- Hmm?
- 12 a day.

518
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,893
12 miles?

519
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:14,296
12 inches a day.
[Chuckles]

520
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,298
Through solid granite.

521
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,166
Now that may
not sound like much,

522
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,335
but I'm almost
through the sierras.

523
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,838
And I just received 5,000 pounds
of Nitroglycerin

524
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,508
and 11,000 Chinamen
who do not get sick

525
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,877
and are happy to work
with half pay.

526
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,145
Now I am backed
by the Bank of England,

527
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,481
funded by all the tons
of glittering gold

528
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,550
found in the streams
of California.

529
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,752
It's the Golden State,
Mr. Bohannon.

530
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,654
Looking forward to meeting you
there at the border then.

531
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:42,156
Oh, you haven't
read the papers, sir.

532
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,825
My friends in congress
have just voted

533
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,993
to lift
my building restrictions.

534
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:48,729
Now, once I'm through the
mountains, it's all downhill.

535
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,731
I intend to cross
the California border

536
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,834
and be in your camp
before you know it.

537
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,936
The stretch between Nebraska
and California is mine.

538
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,874
No, sir, it belongs
to whomever can cross it first.

539
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,776
Now, based on your reputation,

540
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,678
I'm offering you a chance
to cross it with me,

541
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,614
but from the west,
and you'll be paid in gold.

542
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:11,118
Not in some worthless paper.

543
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,088
[Chuckles] Huh.

544
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,426
Well, I...
Already gave my word

545
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,195
to the gentleman
at Credit Mobilier,

546
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:23,964
and that's about all
I got left, so...

Chicago, Omaha,

and all points west.

553
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:47,054
It was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Bohannon.

How you feeling?

563
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:40,777
She came out kicking
and tearing.

564
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:43,446
- She?
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,517
Can I see her?

566
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,552
Yeah.

567
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,325
- She's moving all right.
- [Chuckles]

- You all right?
- Yeah.

569
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:15,477
You can't tell much
with newborns.

570
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:18,547
They're all wrinkled up

571
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,016
and splotchy-looking.

572
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,220
She's beautiful.

573
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,594
Thank you.

574
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:40,435
She like her daddy.
[Chuckles]

I'm glad you're back.

577
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,219
Aye, Mr. Bohannon.

00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,255
You look great.
How was New York?

579
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,691
It was an open sewer,
Mr. McGinnes.

580
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,392
Mm.

581
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:08,096
My new hat don't fit me either.

582
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,998
Welcome back, sir.

583
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:12,667
We're all very excited about,
um, our new prospects west,

584
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,668
aren't we, girls?
Yes.

[All laugh]

586

It'll be a few more days
before we ship out.

587
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,206
We need to collect some crews.

588
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,908
Actually, um...

589
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:24,712
Once the word got back that
you're the new Chief Engineer,

coming in from all over,

began loading up the trains.

That's a nice vote
of confidence, I would say.

You have given us a vision
of this railroad

which will bind our nation.

627

Lord Christ,
when you came among us,

628
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:23,629
you proclaimed God's Kingdom

in towns and lonely places
such as these.

630

Grant that your presence
be known

631
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:34,506
as this railroad
is built across this land.

Every piece of steel we lay

650
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:12,646
puts us closer
to somewheres else.

651
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,881
That's about all I can say.

652
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:19,019
So it's more personal
than just laying rail.

653
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:22,589
You're the writer.
Ho!

654
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:24,924
Mr. Bohannon,
people of this country

655
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:28,161
believe the railroad is robbing
the National Treasury.

656
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:30,530
My job is to dissuade my readers
of that notion.

657
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:33,600
Unfortunately,
our brief interview

658
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,335
was not enough to dissuade me.

659
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:38,104
And it ain't my job
to fix what people think.

660
00:43:38,138 --> 00:43:39,872
In fact, it is.

661
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:42,208
You are the face of the
Transcontinental Railroad now.

662
00:43:42,242 --> 00:43:44,944
And either this is
a brave and noble endeavor,

663
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:47,113
or it's Sodom and Gomorrah.

less miserable.

And for the record,
I covered the war '63 to '65.

I know the difference between
hell and a church social.

810
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,616
Ain't nothin' but wilderness
and Lamonites out here, father.

811
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,985
I said that's enough.

812
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:35,733
You will excuse
my son's manners.

813
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:39,737
He's got some growing
still to do.

814
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:50,948
[Sighs]

815
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:55,652
Tell you what.
Um...

816
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:58,322
Let me see if my surveyors
can't find a way around.

817
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:01,225
Now, that...
that's not a promise.

818
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:03,327
Ift can't be done,
you'll still have to move.

819
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:08,465
But it don't cost nothing
to try.

820
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:15,072
Well, a journey
through these lands

821
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:18,775
at this hour is a foolish one,
Mr. Bohannon.

822
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:21,845
You are welcome to stay
till morning.

823
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:25,615
Much obliged.

824
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:36,493
[Horse neighs]

825
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,170
[Both breathing heavily]

826
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:06,656
[Clatter]

827
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,492
[Gasps]

828
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,308
[Grunting]

829
00:54:29,343 --> 00:54:31,644
Seen me a Mormon man
killed once.

830
00:54:31,678 --> 00:54:34,146
[Grunts] Liberty, Missouri...

831
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,315
During the war.
[Grunts]

832
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:39,117
As if them white folk didn't
have enough to fight about,

833
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,751
county sheriff run him through
with a sword

834
00:54:41,871 --> 00:54:43,388
on account of him
being a "Palgemist."

835
00:54:43,423 --> 00:54:46,158
[Grunts]

836
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,361
Yep, they didn't like them
no "Palgemists"

837
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,468
in Liberty, Missouri.

838
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:57,252
Like they Mormons
didn't like them no negroes.

839
00:54:57,286 --> 00:55:01,723
[Grunts]

840
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,925
Yeah.
They a nasty bunch.

841
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:06,427
[Grunts]

842
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:08,897
I think
you mean "polygamist."

843
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,332
[Exhales] What'd I say?

844
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:13,768
"Palgemists."

845
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:15,069
Well, I knew it was
something like that.

846
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,271
Why a man gotta get
hisself killed

847
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:18,940
over being a polygamist?

848
00:55:18,974 --> 00:55:20,575
It's the custom
of having more than one wife

849
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,943
at the same time.

850
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:23,878
More than one wife, you say?

851
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:25,846
At the same time?

852
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:28,816
Well, damn.
No wonder they nasty.

853
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,957
Sand, mud, lime.

854
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:39,293
Soil like that no good
for the grade, boss.

855
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:42,296
Take a lot of lumber
to build it.

856
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,231
Yeah, rock wall be better,
but that take time

857
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,367
and rock, which we ain't got.

858
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:48,902
I've surveyed several routes
through here, Mr. Bohannon.

859
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:51,705
Sand hills stretch at least
a hundred miles to the north.

860
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,440
We'd have to go South
to get around that farm.

861
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,709
- How far?
- 40 mile, maybe more.

862
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:57,611
40 mile'll put us behind
schedule by five weeks.

863
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,647
Yes, sir.

864
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,187
[Bell rings]

865
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,572
I met the new police chief.

866
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:31,244
You ain't happy,
track runs both ways.

867
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:35,515
[Bell ringing continues]

868
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:38,017
Where's the livestock?
It's complicated.

869
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:39,319
Tell you
what's complicated, son.

870
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,688
3,000 hungry men.

871
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,456
What I mean is

872
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,826
I've been on the job
for two days.

873
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,995
And deciphering these books
is quite the task.

874
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,997
Near as I can tell,

875
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:52,865
Mr. Durant formed
several companies

876
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,935
to supply livestock
to the railroad.

877
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:58,104
Now that he's departed,

878
00:56:58,138 --> 00:57:02,175
the contracts
have been canceled.

879
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:04,277
Then find some other
damn place, Sean.

880
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:06,112
Council Bluffs, Denver,
shit, Chicago...

881
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:10,049
I would, um, but it seems
that Mr. Durant has,

882
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,718
in addition to canceling
our contracts

883
00:57:12,753 --> 00:57:14,653
with his companies,

884
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:18,150
cornered the market on livestock
in Omaha as well.

885
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,625
Shit!

886
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:21,527
Should've killed that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.

887
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:24,697
May I quote you on that,
Mr. Bohannon?

888
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:30,502
You don't say nothing to her
about railroad business.

889
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:33,405
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

890
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,142
- Still here?
- Missed my train.

891
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:40,412
Don't say I didn't warn you.

892
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:47,152
[Knock at door]

893
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:48,854
Oh.

894
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:51,990
We missed you at services
this morning, Mr. Bohannon.

895
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:55,160
[Laughs]

896
00:57:55,194 --> 00:57:58,563
Was there something
I can help you with?

897
00:57:58,598 --> 00:58:01,633
Thought I'd look in is all.

898
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,904
You gave us a good place...

899
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:11,776
High, dry ground
upwind of the slaughterhouse.

900
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:14,679
- Thank you.
- It's good.

901
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:19,317
It's good for the men, I mean.

902
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:23,922
And you?

903
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:30,929
Oh.
Sorry.

904
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:33,064
Uh...
[Sniffs]

905
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:36,067
Railroad has to move a family
of homesteaders off their land.

906
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:40,404
They're digging in.
And, uh, they're Mormon.

907
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:41,739
I wonder if you've had
any cause to know

908
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:44,942
what they might be like
as people.

909
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:46,644
The Latter Day Saints are not

910
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:49,480
a legitimate Church of Christ.

911
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:51,549
They treat their women
as slaves.

912
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,551
They take child brides.

913
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:55,219
They're a violent people.

914
00:58:55,253 --> 00:58:57,254
They'll fight then, you think?

915
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:59,890
It has been their way.
Yes.

916
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:02,159
They got children with 'em.

917
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:04,128
Then you'll find another way.

918
00:59:04,162 --> 00:59:06,931
By God's Grace.

919
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:11,902
God's been slack
with the Grace of late.

920
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:16,006
Then show them yours,
Mr. Bohannon.

921
00:59:20,545 --> 00:59:24,348
What I'm proposing is
a major new commercial hub,

922
00:59:24,382 --> 00:59:27,751
the most important railroad city
in the United States.

923
00:59:27,785 --> 00:59:33,357
And it will be right here
in your backyard.

924
00:59:33,391 --> 00:59:36,993
That is literally my backyard.

925
00:59:37,028 --> 00:59:40,931
You see that pretty confluence
of good sweet-water streams?

926
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:44,434
Well, it ain't much,
but it's on my land.

927
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:47,337
My husband left me all of this
when he passed in '62.

928
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:50,040
Well, it may be
your land now, madam.

929
00:59:50,074 --> 00:59:52,108
But the Union Pacific Railroad

930
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:53,810
will reach it before the year
is out.

931
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,813
And, through eminent domain,
they will claim it.

932
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,114
That's against the law.

933
00:59:58,149 --> 00:59:59,282
It <i>is</i> the law.

934
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:00,950
And by law,

935
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:03,286
the Union Pacific
is compelled to offer you

936
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,355
a fair market price
for your land,

937
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:06,723
currently $1.50 an acre.

938
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:08,458
[Laughter]

939
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:11,327
- I'd never sell for that.
- And you won't have to.

940
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:13,196
Because as a representative

941
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,332
and major stockholder
of Credit Mobilier,

942
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:20,069
I am prepared
to offer you $100 per acre,

943
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:24,974
thus waiving eminent domain.

944
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:27,844
- What's the rub?
- Ah, well...

945
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:30,913
In order to waive
eminent domain,

946
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:34,083
we must build
a railroad terminus

947
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:35,918
and a town on the property,

948
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:37,820
which we will.

949
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:39,855
Every pound of beef,
every ton of ore,

950
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,925
every fruit, vegetable,
every bale of hay

951
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:45,694
from either side
of the Mississippi

952
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,164
must ship through our town.

953
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,534
You will become rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

954
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:53,869
Weren't you in jail
just a month ago?

955
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,437
- Yes.
- And you're broke,

956
01:00:55,472 --> 01:00:56,438
according to the newspapers.

957
01:00:56,473 --> 01:00:57,773
Flat broke.

958
01:00:57,807 --> 01:00:58,907
Well, how do you expect
to pay us

959
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:00,109
for our property then?

960
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:02,578
From construction funds

961
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:05,214
advanced to me
by the Union Pacific Railroad.

962
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:07,549
You were kicked off
Union Pacific for stealing.

963
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:10,085
Union Pacific, Credit Mobilier,

964
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:13,388
different pockets
to the same pair of pants.

965
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,957
When the judge understood that,
I was released.

966
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:17,893
You're in Omaha now, New York.

967
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,461
Money won't buy you
judges here.

968
01:01:19,495 --> 01:01:23,598
Opportunity is a powerful
elixir, Mrs. Palmer.

01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,376
Not like this.

1133
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,575
Well?

1134
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:35,122
All right.
Telegraph the fort.

1135
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:37,191
Tell the major we need help
evicting them homesteaders.

1136
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:41,862
You want a railroad story?

1137
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,531
Follow me.

1138
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:25,795
Mr. Hatch!

1139
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:30,433
This is Cullen Bohannon of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

1140
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:32,802
I have a writ of execution here

1141
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:36,272
for the killing of
my Chief of Police.

1142
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:39,141
Come on out.

1143
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,682
You don't, and these soldiers
will burn you out.

1144
01:12:46,716 --> 01:12:48,150
I won't be able to stop them.

1145
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:54,890
You got one minute,
Mr. Hatch.

1146
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:19,281
United States Cavalry
was not built for waiting.

1147
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:22,350
We didn't come here
to kill women and children.

1148
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:25,854
A disorganized brain
is lacking in moral principles.

1149
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,856
Are you aware of that,
Bohannon?

1150
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,524
Not something I ponder nights.

1151
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:31,326
Moral principles are
the first line of defense

1152
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,895
against criminal behavior.

1153
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:36,297
You learn
something new every day.

1154
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:37,899
Without moral principles,

1155
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:39,968
these Mormons will inevitably
turn to violence

1156
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:43,571
to solve their problems,
just like the heathens.

1157
01:13:43,606 --> 01:13:46,741
Am I right about that, chief?

1158
01:13:46,775 --> 01:13:49,077
What he talking about?

1159
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:10,398
Y'all keep your barrels down.

1160
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:22,676
You and your boys
put your guns down.

1161
01:14:22,711 --> 01:14:25,613
I told you,
stay off my property

1162
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:27,748
or there'll be hell to pay.

1163
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:29,450
And I told you if I couldn't
find a way around,

1164
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:31,418
the U.S. Government would
rightfully claim its land.

1165
01:14:34,122 --> 01:14:37,257
You murdered
my Chief of Police.

1166
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:39,460
He was trespassing.
He was warned.

1167
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:41,528
You have to stand accountable.

1168
01:14:41,563 --> 01:14:44,565
I am the priesthood holder
of my family, Mr. Bohannon.

1169
01:14:44,599 --> 01:14:48,802
Without me,
they will not survive.

1170
01:14:48,837 --> 01:14:50,204
You should've thought
about that

1171
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:52,039
before you pulled that trigger.

1172
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:54,608
They won't survive.

1173
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:57,444
I'll see to it they get to

1174
01:14:57,478 --> 01:14:59,079
the Mormon settlement
at Fort Smith.

1175
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:00,914
How's that?

1176
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:55,034
- He done it.
- Father?

1177
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:11,517
Did you kill that man, son?

1178
01:16:11,551 --> 01:16:12,751
Tell me the truth now.

1179
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,570
Yes, sir.

1180
01:16:31,604 --> 01:16:35,774
Mr. Ferguson,
this boy shoot Dick Barlow?

1181
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:40,011
I ain't sure.

1182
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:47,252
Good God, man, get on with it.

1183
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:49,588
You'd have me hang him?

1184
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:51,389
It's the law, Bohannon.

1185
01:16:51,424 --> 01:16:53,758
You said so yourself, and you
are obliged to uphold it.

1186
01:16:53,793 --> 01:16:57,662
We do not make exceptions
to the law out here.

1187
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,731
You realize he'll hang.

1188
01:16:59,765 --> 01:17:03,068
He's just a boy.

1189
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:04,435
You're gonna tell me the truth.

1190
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:05,703
I told you the truth!

1191
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:08,106
Son, you got a different story,

1192
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,575
you best tell me right now.

1193
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:18,316
He's just a boy.

1194
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,793
Not today he ain't.

1195
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:30,595
All right.

1196
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:36,968
Father.

1197
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:38,703
Come here.

1198
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,205
- Father!
- Come on, boy.

1199
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,175
- Come on.
- Easy.

1200
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:49,113
Father!

1201
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:50,814
Father!

1202
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:52,249
Sorry, son.

1203
01:18:33,453 --> 01:18:36,521

"Life on the prairie is
not worth the powder it takes

1206
01:18:49,886 --> 01:18:51,520
So say the denizens
of Hell On Wheels,

1207
01:18:51,554 --> 01:18:53,889
the rollicking tent city

1208
01:18:53,923 --> 01:18:56,558
that moves with
the transcontinental railroad

1209
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:58,260
as it creeps across the country

1210
01:18:58,294 --> 01:19:01,262
at a pace of two miles per day.

1211
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:03,398
It is no place
for women or children,

1212
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,066
as the men who labor here,

1213
01:19:05,101 --> 01:19:07,902
veterans of the recent conflict,
immigrants,

1214
01:19:07,937 --> 01:19:09,470
and free negroes,

1215
01:19:09,505 --> 01:19:12,106
often take to drink
and un-Christian pursuits

1216
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:15,443
when not swinging a hammer
or laying track.

1217
01:19:15,477 --> 01:19:18,813
Every man here carries a gun,

1218
01:19:18,847 --> 01:19:22,083
which can be had for
as little as $3,

1219
01:19:22,117 --> 01:19:25,653
and a knife,
and goes to church on Sunday.

1220
01:19:32,494 --> 01:19:35,429
Here you can buy a meal for 35¢

1221
01:19:35,464 --> 01:19:37,665
a beer for less than a quarter,

1222
01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:41,736
a suit of clothes for $5
that includes a hat.

1223
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,805
The belongings of the dead
are cheaper than that.

1224
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,708
Any last words, son?

1225
01:19:50,779 --> 01:19:53,647
I came here to meet the man
who replaced "Doc" Durant

1226
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:57,318
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

1227
01:19:57,352 --> 01:20:02,456
I can tell you he is a man
for whom honor is sacred

1228
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:06,460
and virtue impermanent.

1229
01:20:09,964 --> 01:20:12,966
In the brave new wilderness
he calls home,

1230
01:20:13,001 --> 01:20:16,003
integrity is important
to Cullen Bohannon.

1233
01:22:32,004 --> 01:22:34,272
Whether a man of integrity
is what's needed

1234
01:22:34,306 --> 01:22:38,009
to build the railroad,
we don't yet know.

1235
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:40,578
The railroad has always
been the business

1236
01:22:40,613 --> 01:22:42,880
of the unscrupulous
and corrupt.

1237
01:22:53,192 --> 01:22:55,493
You owe me a life

1238
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:57,862
for the one
you took from me today.

1239
01:23:06,705 --> 01:23:10,374
I suspect our new Chief
Engineer to be neither.

1240
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:28,559
And for that, dear reader,

1241
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:31,495
we might all
count our blessings...
