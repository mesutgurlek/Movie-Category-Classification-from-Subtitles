Yes, sir, here it is, 1891.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,515
You'd think everybody'd gone
where he was goin'.

19
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,431
Why, right here in
this little Kansas town...

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,273
there ain't a day
people don't pack up and start out...

<i>Then they're off again.</i>

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,631
Thanks for the outline
of American history...

27
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,870
but all I asked was,
where do the Daltons live?

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,229
Fine folks, the Daltons.
You a friend of theirs?

29
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,675
Knew 'em 20 years ago back in Missouri.

30
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,591
That so?

31
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,559
Too bad about Frank gettin' killed
by outlaws in Indian territory.

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,149
He was the marshal down there.

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,869
Got elected the year
Annie married Tom Freeman.

34
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,758
I understand Ben
has a farm around here.

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,078
It's the best farm in the county.

36
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,038
If they'd only run a few cattle
on that lower 40.

37
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,193
But you can't tell Ben nothin',
nor Bob either for that matter.

38
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,636
And once you get in an argument
with Grat, you got Emmett in your hair.

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,871
You couldn't be persuaded to tell me
where the Daltons live, could you?

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,349
I've only got a few hours
before the stage leaves for Guthrie.

41
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,151
What you wanna go to Guthrie for?

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,152
Well, I've got business-
- I wouldn't be hung in that town.

43
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,392
I got drunk there once with an Indian.
Like to had smallpox.

44
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,516
Listen.

45
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,229
If I ask you just one question,
will you answer "yes" or "no"?

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,151
Well, I'd be glad to, stranger.

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,232
Is the Dalton farm close to town?

48
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,198
Yes.
- Good.

49
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,191
And no.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,276
It's two miles out on the state road.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,033
But the bridge
across Wash Creek's down...

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,236
so you gotta take
the Franklinville Pike...

53
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,151
as far as the schoolhouse.

54
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,515
The schoolhouse, hmm?
- You'll see a windmill there.

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,874
A windmill.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,798
But that's Jim Carter's,
and he's gone to Kansas City.

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,351
But there's a road down that goes-
- Thanks very much, but I think I can find it.

58
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,749
If you're gonna be around here
for a while, young fella, look me up.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,910
We'll get together
and swap stories.

What's your opinion, Tod?
- Has anyone taken
one of these cases to court?

That's right, Tod. Somebody's got
the town folks worked up against us.

Hmm. Why, uh-

Why don't you form
an association or a grange...

303
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,192
like they have in some
of the eastern states?

304
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,713
Then you could pool your interests...

305
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,950
and fight this Kansas Land and
Development Company more effectively.

306
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,430
Would you be willing
to handle it for us, Tod?
- Hold on, Bob. I'm on my way to Guthrie.

307

to find clients for when you've got
all you need right here?

308
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,514
Kansas needs you
more than Oklahoma, Tod.

Well, I thought you were quite impressed
with Kansas, Mr Jackson.

On the Fourth of July.

322
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,235
He put a firecracker
under my chair.

323

Nice, romantic beginning.

I hated him.

Bob changed it for me.

When he wants anything,
he has the manners of a locomotive.

That's funny.

Oh, now,

332
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,238
No good lawyer takes more than
three hours for luncheon.

333
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,915
I'm not such a good lawyer, Julie.
I haven't made much headway
with those land grabs.

334

But you've only
been here a week.

In that time,

Yeah, so I've noticed.

No.

no-account worthless Indian?

But he isn't, so I'm going
to Guthrie where I belong.

What about your work here?

355

If you think I'm gonna stick around

I can't help it
if I'm in love with you.

357
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,229
If I were a man in love with a girl
who was engaged to somebody else...

358
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,030
I'd-I'd go to that other person
and tell him how I felt.

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,079
And what do you suppose
he'd think if I did?

360

I don't suppose he'd like it.

361

That's why I'm going to Guthrie.

Oh, you're like all lawyers.
You can talk well enough in court...

more to say for Ben.

Good luck, Ben.
- Thank you, Julie.

We're all behind ya.
- That's nice of you, Mr Winters.

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,514
How do you feel, Ben?
Sit down right here.

Hello, Ozark.

Be seated.

The case of <i>the People v. Ben Dalton.</i>
Is the State ready?

458
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,914

- Object to what?

462

Would you, uh, have any scruples against
inflicting the death penalty, Mr Osborne?

465
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,915
Not me.
- The State accepts Jim Osborne.

<i>[Judge] You may question</i>
<i>the prospective juror, Mr Jackson.</i>

467
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,392
If it please the court, the defence
has full confidence in Mr Osborne...

468
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,994
in spite of the fact that
he once was accused of stealing a horse.

469
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,514
Objection, Your Honour!
This juror isn't on trial.

470

Nobody ever proved
I stole that horse!

471

Counsel will refrain
from personal remarks.

472
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,476
I apologize, Your Honour.
I'm sure the gentleman
who told me about it was mistaken.

473
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,949
Who said I stole that horse?
What's his name?

474
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,032
I believe it was, uh,
juror number three, Mr Norris.

475
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,588
Who, me?
I never said no such thing!

476
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,116
Any time Jim Osborne wants to steal
a horse, that's his business.

477
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,555
What do you mean, that's my business?

478
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,473
I sold that horse to Ed Pickett.
Didn't I, Ed?

479
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,953
Well, I paid for it. But when I went to
the barn the next morning, it was gone...

480
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,031
and two sets of harness with it!

suppose you tell us in your own words
just what happened.

492
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,519
Well, I'd taken my surveying crew out
to verify the boundary...

of the Kansas Land
and Development Company's property.

494
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,679
Objection, Your Honour. The defence
can prove by three witnesses...

495
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,796
that Rigby and his men
were on the Dalton farm.

496
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,155
Is this true, Mr Rigby?
- It is not.

497
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,038
We've just filed a complaint
against the Daltons for trespassing.

We've owned that property for 10 years!

What occurred next?

501
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,630
Emmett there picked up the surveying
instrument and broke it on a rock.

502
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,393
Then what happened?

503
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,552
Ben Dalton rode up
behind Mason...

504
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,710
and smashed his head in
with the barrel of his gun.

01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,594
Oh, I wanted to tell you before
Ben's trial. Tod wouldn't let me.

Uh-huh. Tod Jackson!

- Why not?

Where are you going?
- I've got something to attend to.

01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,432
Look, if I'm not back tonight,
don't wait for me. I'll meet you
in Denver at the Mountain Hotel.

896
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,796
Wait a minute, Bob.
Me and the boys have been talkin'.

897
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,996
How about taking over the bank
in town before we split up?

898
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,514
Nothing to it, Bob.
- I told you we were through, didn't I?

899
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,239
Now, get out of here
the way we planned- all of you.

900
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,033
I still think we're crazy to pass it up.
- So do I.

901
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,998
It'll be a long time before we're this
close to the old home town again.

902

Uh, Bob says we're through.
- But why?

903
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,954
It's a shame to leave
all that money down there.
- Yeah.

904
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,554
That town owes us plenty.
- It sure does.

905
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,313
It sounds good, but what
about Bob's orders?

906
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,712
He won't even know about it
till we give him his share.

Been up to the capital, I hear.

912
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,470
Did you also hear I found
what I was looking for?

913
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:02,236
Oh, you mean the Kansas Land
and Development Company.
Yes, I did. Uh, sit down, sit down.

914
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:06,279
You covered up pretty cleverly
with your holding company,
dummy directors and Rigby, didn't you?

915
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,555
They all served their purpose.

916
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,837
And a very profitable purpose,
I might add. Have a cigar.

917
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,957
You mean the railroad that's taken
that land off your hands for a right of way.

918
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,953
You know everything, don't you?
- Including something you overlooked.

919
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,951
Did you ever hear of
a federal grand jury, Winters?

920
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,079
Oh-ho! You're wasting your time.
I've faced lots of them.

You should know it takes years
for those fellows to vote on indictment.

Well, there's one jury that won't be out
long when they get this information.

Drop in any time, Jackson.

Why didn't you stay where you were?
I would have come, had you sent for me.

That's fine. There wouldn't be anything

Keep out of it, you say?
That's just the trouble.
