The Cabinet made me hire
these damned detectives.

166
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,464
Drink? Cigar?

167
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,507
Don't mind if I do, sir.

168
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,636
So I understand you let
General McGrath get away.

169
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,096
That's not exactly the way it happened.

170
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,642
-Some half-a-sissy masquerading as--
-Artemus Gordon.

171
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,060
You know him?

172
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,688
Of course. He's the best marshal
I've got. A kind of genius.

173
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,610
Gordon has proven himself as a cunning
operator, with a rapacious intellect.

174
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,488
Nothing will stop him
from completing a mission...

175
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,283
...except maybe the impulsive actions
of a headstrong cowboy.

176
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,410
Who are you, mister?

177
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,704
What do you mean, who am I?

178
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,040
I am the President of the United States.

179
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,541
Wrong answer.

180
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,588
Who are you?

181
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,967
I am the President of the--
I'm Artemus Gordon.

182
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,261
How did you know?

183
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,933
The President went to West Point.
That says Harvard.

184
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,768
Very observant.

185
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,190
Somebody mind telling me
what's going on?

186
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,025
President Grant, um....

187
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,445
Sir, these are perilous times.

188
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,408
I was merely demonstrating how someone,
using the art of disguise...

189
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,745
...could penetrate into the very bowels
of the White House, sir.

190
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,374
You're clever, Gordon.
One day it's going to get you killed.

191
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,793
Like today.

192
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:30,841
And, West, not every situation calls for
your approach of "shoot first...

193
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,843
...shoot later, shoot some more...

194
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,221
...then when everybody's dead,
try to ask a question or two."

195
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,223
Working together will be good.

196
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,600
-Working together?
-With all due respect--

197
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,729
You'll work the way your
Commander in Chief tells you to.

198
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,440
Well, I was coming to that, sir.

199
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,285
GRANT:
Gentlemen, America's top scientists...

200
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,288
...in the fields of physics,
hydraulics, explosives...

201
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:06,126
...all kidnapped in the last year,
and all by General McGrath, it now appears.

202
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,546
You two have been working
on the same case the whole time.

203
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,340
Why did it take so long
to figure it out?

204
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,470
One of us was trying to catch McGrath,
and the other was trying to marry him.

205
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,096
GRANT:
We don't have time for this.

206
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,349
Only one week, if we believe this.

207
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,853
"General Grant,
the scientists you seek...

208
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,647
...are in my employ creating
a weapons system...

209
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,317
...beyond the pale
of contemporary imagination.

210
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,986
I suggest you put
your affairs in order.

211
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,865
You have one week before you will
surrender the U.S. government."

212
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,160
The letter was delivered today
with that cake.

213
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,207
-It's marzipan, isn't it?
GRANT: Careful.

214
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,252
It's McGrath, sir.

215
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,714
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not.

216
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,176
So whom do we seek?
After consulting with Intelligence--

217
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,346
McGrath is on his way to New Orleans.
The longer we stay here...

218
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,973
...the farther he gets.
I don't need Intelligence.

219
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,850
You'd rather rely on stupidity.

220
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,936
I am leaving today for Utah...

221
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,065
...where the transcontinental railroads
will be joined at Promontory Point.

222
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,567
You two are the best I've got.

223
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,778
Put aside your differences...

224
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,532
...and find this madman,
whoever he is, and stop him.

225
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,867
You have one week.

226
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,410
Dismissed.

227
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,545
Gentlemen.

228
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
The Wanderer is at your disposal.

229
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,216
Engine number five, track six.

230
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,427
Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.

231
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,263
Thank you.

232
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,687
-Figures.
-My new invention.

233
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,817
The Bi-Valve Interior Combustion
Twice-Exhausted Bi-Axle Nitro-Cycle.

234
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,945
Save it. Got a train to catch. Hyah!

235
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,992
Not if I catch it first.

236
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,207
Avanti!

237
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,600
Nice horse!

238
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,247
WEST:
Gordon!

239
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,666
Gordon!

240
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,838
Stop the train!

241
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,555
Hey! I'm warning you!

242
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,265
Gordon! Stop the train!

243
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,893
Come in. Have a seat.

244
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,978
Stop the train!

245
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,314
Stop smiling at me!

246
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,571
[YELLS]

247
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,451
How nice of you to drop in.

248
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,411
All right....

249
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,959
Let's drop the beards, the bikes,
the fake boobies.

250
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,337
Let's set that needlepoint aside
and handle this like men.

251
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,882
As a matter of clarification,
this is not needlepoint.

252
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,176
This is needlepoint.

253
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,513
I'm putting the final touches
on my latest invention.

254
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,848
I call it The Impermeable.

255
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,892
It's a vest.
When worn under clothing...

256
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,229
...it can stop any bullet,
fired even at close range.

257
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,815
-Is that so?
-But I haven't tested it fully yet.

258
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,024
Guns.

259
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,696
I find them primitive and unnecessary
if one's done one's proper planning.

260
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,367
I have always felt that allowing any
situation to degenerate into violence...

261
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,661
...constitutes a failure on my part.

262
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,996
Well, Mr. Gordon...

263
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,706
...you failed.

264
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,964
All right, Mr. West,
we'll settle this...

265
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,091
...like men.

266

[GRUNTING]

267
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,441
Ding!

268
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,489
I love this train.

269
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,910
-Cheers!
-Gordon!

270
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,414
While you're down there,
feel free to make use...

271
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,584
...of my Sub-Carriage Inter-Rail
Vehicular Egressor.

272
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,794
I designed it myself!

273
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,217
I've been thinking.
Maybe the president's right.

274
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,221
We should put aside our differences
and work together.

275
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,102
Fight each other all you please.
Harm my train, I'll douse you like dogs.

276
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,313
That's my truffle reduction sauce.

277
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,192
Let's get on about our
president's business, shall we?

278
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,152
-Where to?
-New Orleans.

279
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,738
-Why don't we let Professor Morton decide?
WEST: Who?

280
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,283
I don't need some nobody professor
telling me where to head.

281
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,413
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.

282
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:40,293
Expert in the field of metallurgy.
Discovered in a field of alfalfa.

283
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,462
That's a man's head.

284
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,175
This magnetic collar was found about
six feet away, near his body.

285
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,219
Still trying to figure that out.

286
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,595
That's a man's head.

287
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,391
According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory, a dying person's last image...

288
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,937
...burns into his eyeball like a photo.
Perhaps there's a clue.

289
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,315
I give you Morton's last image.

290
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,069
That's a man's head.

291
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:18,790
Refraction of the lenses causes the image
to appear upside down, so we simply....

292
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,800
That...

293
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,761
...is a man's...

294
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,974
...head.

295
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,059
Voilà!

296
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,146
McGrath.

297
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,857
Something's in his pocket.
It's too fuzzy to see.

298
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,359
Mortification of the aqueous humor's
led to a loss--

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,694

Ah. How about this?
Come as my manservant.

305
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,440
Why, yes'um, Master Gordon!

306
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,611
I swears I'd be delighted!
I sing, I dance for you, sir.

307
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,990
I swears none of the white folks'll
know I'd rather shoot myself...

308
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,326
...than play your damn manservant.

309
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,578
You must wear something.
It's a costume party.

310
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,538
This is all I need to wear.

311
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,790
If you insist on a firearm,
I have something...

312
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,710
...you'll find intriguing.
I designed it to go...

313
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,545
...with this.

314
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,840
Jim West does not wear costumes.

315
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,717
Very well. What's your plan?

316
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,012
I was thinking I'd go
as a government agent...

317
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,389
...who'll kill
General Bloodbath McGrath.

318

An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a
room full of white former slave owners.

319
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,187
You'll win first prize.

320
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,982
Listen, the art of disguise
is what we need to get into the party...

321
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,193

00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,500
WEST: On our way to Utah,
where our President is.

638
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,377
How you feel about that coincidence?

639
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,563
RITA:
Artie.

640
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,526
We wouldn't have known where
Loveless was going if not for her.

641
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,986
Seems a bit ungracious,
if not perilous.

642
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,616
She'd have been in our way.
She and I'd have wound up in the saddle.

643
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,662
That's funny, I got the feeling
she was more interested in me.

644
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,012
I've tried to place myself
in Loveless' shoes.

645
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,181
Good luck with that one.

646
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:03,351
What could a maniac with no
reproductive organs want with Rita?

647
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,397
Which is not to say that Rita
doesn't possess a beauty...

648
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,567
...worthy of a Shakespeare
sonnet or a Botticelli painting.

649
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,444
The curvature of her buttocks...

650
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,822
...and the swell
of that magnificent bosom!

651
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,074
So full, so sumptuous....

652
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,662
So...what were all those foreign
ministers doing at Loveless' party?

653
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,457
This is what really puzzles me.

654
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,001
Did you have any idea
there were so many?

655
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,963
-[WHISPERS] How long has she been here?
-Somewhere around Botticelli's buttocks.

656
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,591
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I am profoundly sorry.

657
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,386
I'll spare you the embarrassment.
Make a sandwich. You're getting off.

658
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,556
I know why those foreign guys
were at Loveless' party.

659
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,435
Mm. This is fantastic.
How do you cook it?

660
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,395
I mean, you can cut it with a fork.

661
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,607
In a daubière. It's a clay pot.
It's a French method.

662
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,400
Foreign ministers.

663
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,445
They were mad about something,
you know, like...

664
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,573
...there was some real bad deal
in Louisiana on purpose.

665
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,949
GORDON:
The Louisiana Purchase.

666
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,410
Mm-hm. And Queen somebody of France
got swindled.

667
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,787
Queen Isabella of Spain.

668
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,081
This is ridiculous.
Coleman, stop the train.

669
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,335
-Miss Escobar's getting off.
COLEMAN: Who the hell is Miss Escobar?

670
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:14,464
A frightened, starving, half-naked
woman who wants to find her father.

671
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,049
Half-naked?

672

Coleman, stop the train!

COLEMAN: We're not putting anybody off
here in the middle of nowhere!

674

Especially if they're half-naked!

675

Please, Jim.
My father's the only family I've got.

676

Am I to sit at home and wait for news
that he's been killed, or do something?

677
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,316
What would you do?

678
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:35,485
I don't have anything against you.

679
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:39,781
What happens when we find Loveless
and you're still on this train?

680
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,241
Jim.

681
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,285
I know you'd never let him
take me back.

682
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,579
I've seen you shoot.

683
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:51,543
I'll assure you any attack by Loveless
would be an exercise in futility.

684
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,212
I'll demonstrate how
my design suggestions...

685
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,382
...have made the Wanderer
completely impervious to attack.

686
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:01,594
Over here, three seemingly
innocent billiard balls, yes?

687
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:07,475
Depress the number, it's a sleeping-gas
bomb effective in under three seconds.

688
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,271
So put your mind at ease.
You are safe within these walls.

689
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,857
I don't know about you,
but I'll sleep better...

...assuming Loveless barges in here
to play pool.

691
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,989
And speaking of sleeping,
I'm really tired, Artie.

692

Could I borrow something to wear?

-I have just--
-I got something you can wear.

It ain't stylish, but it won't explode
when you put it on.

695
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,915
That would be nice.

696
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,720
Loveless kidnapped
a few metallurgists...

697
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,180
...so whatever he's building
will have armor.

698
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,932
He kidnapped a couple chemists...

699
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,226
...so it'll have explosives.

700
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,397
According to you, Rita's father's the
world's foremost expert in hydraulics...

701

...so the thing's gonna move.

702

What could he build that'd make
the president surrender the government?

703
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,072
A bedside heater.

704

What?

705
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,120
Rita needs a bedside heater.
It gets quite chilly.
