There's Indian ponies with riders.

169
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,336
What are they doing?

170
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,271
Watching.

171
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:35,541
They're always out here lately at night.

172
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,046
They could slip up and slit
our throats any minute.

173
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,215
So why don't they then?

174
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:45,421
I don't know.

175
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,226
But I aim to find out.

176
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:59,003
I should have known what they was doin'.

177
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,673
[Fly buzzing]

178
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:07,216
There's always a reconnoitering
before a battle.

179
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:12,291
Why didn't you send someone out yourself?

180
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:18,635
Anybody I would've sent out there
wouldn't have come back alive.

181
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,604
I couldn't spare the men,

182
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,639
the bridge was almost built.

183
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:26,841
Do you think you were being shortsighted?

184
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:33,313
Them some nice shoes.

185
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,383
Clean.

186
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,185
Think you would've volunteered

187
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,421
to go out and scout a thousand Sioux?

188
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,057
[Chatter]

189
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,630
You riding out to the bridge?

190
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,000
I am.

191
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:02,371
It's quite a milestone for you.

192
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,004
It's a milestone for all of us.

193
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,806
Which makes it an ideal time

194
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,575
to talk about your plans for the future.

195
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,941
Shall we?

196
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,026
[Chatter in background]

197
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,956
Don't you like New York?

198
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,929
I have found it's filled
with women like you.

199
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,564
Ohh.

200
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,734
You think
I'm cruel. Hmm?

201
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:06,575
Tell me... what would
you do in my place?

202
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,814
Thomas will write you a check and a letter

203
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,648
of introduction to a family
that's desperate for a governess.

204
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,581
A governess?

205
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:21,352
Please try and see this
in a positive light.

206
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,890
It's a respectable family...

207
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,229
With plenty of marriageable young men.

208
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,566
I'm putting a very bright
future in your hands.

209
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,303
Yes, you are.

210
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,036
Thank you.

211
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,817
Thank you for being the first one
to take her over, Mr. Bohannon.

212
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,981
There were no other volunteers, skipper.

213
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,782
Well, most folks ain't interested

214
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,650
in being crushed, boiled, or drowned.

215
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,318
Good luck, sir.

216
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,721
[Sizzle] Ow.

Ah!

[Metal creaking]

221
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,834
It's all right, Mr. Durant.

222
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,174
It's just the wheels bearing to the track.

223
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,874

[Men laughing and cheering]

227
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,959
You did it, ya bastard!

228
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,362
All right, all right, all right.

229
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,764
She's not here, Mr. Bohannon.

230
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,734
Good job on the
bridge, Mr. Toole.

231
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,869
All right.

232
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,406
Hey, y'all, listen up!

233
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,042
Still got about a day's work ahead of us.

234
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,580
But there's a round
of drinks on Mr. Durant

235
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,583
waiting for you at the starlight tonight!

236
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:13,883
Yeah!
All right!

237
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,019
Come on, lads!
Back to work!

238
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:19,123
You're welcome.

239
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,959
Don't get cocky.

240
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,426
We are still nowhere
near where we need to be.

241
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,360
How far did you tell the board we were?

242
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:26,695
[Sighs]

243
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:28,631
Leave the men to their work.

244
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,799
Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

245
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,142
We need to talk.

246
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,376
You all right,
Mrs. Bell?

247
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:37,550
Mr. Ferguson.

248
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:41,855
Yes. I'm just
closing the office.

249
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:47,427
Mr. Durant is down
at the bridge site.

250
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,696
Can I help you with something?

251
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,299
No, ma'am.

252
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,769
You have a good day.

253
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,469
You, too.

254
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,448
It'd be nice to have some real walls,

255
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,285
keep out the cold, keep you warm.

256
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,652
If your looking for my
husband, he's at work.

257
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,619
I know where he at.

258
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,458
Want to have that talk we was
going to have before you left.

259
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,949
I've been back a while now,

260
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,830
how come this is the first
time you showed up?

261
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:53,334
I got a surprise for you.

262
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:57,306
Surprises ain't been good in my experience.

263
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,775
This one is good.

264
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,812
For you and the baby.

265
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:05,152
You don't got to worry
about the baby no more.

266
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,923
Why you say that?

267
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:12,428
Because it's between me and my husband now.

268
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:15,530
He's got a future on this railroad.

269
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:17,600
I heard you quit.

270
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,405
I'm on my own now.

271
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,076
I built us a house down by the river.

272
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,582
Fresh water, land...

273
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,020
Place where the baby can grow up.

274
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:44,560
A good solid floor and freedom...

275
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:48,495
A fireplace that ain't that smoky.

276
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,764
Stop it.

277
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:52,168
All our love can live there.

278
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:53,535
Can you stop it?

279
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,468
That ain't real.

280
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,802
Yeah, it is.

281
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,936
No, it ain't.

282
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,036
And I got to pretend that that don't exist.

283
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:05,907
Come on. Come on.

284
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,406
No, I got mending to do.

285
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:12,981
Mr. Toole would be real angry
if he knew you were here.

286
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,950
You should probably go.

287
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,684
How would you like to be a very rich man?

288
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:45,585
Seen a lot of rich men
end up in shallow graves.

289
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,421
When the board arrives, they will see
that I have misled the government

290
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,823
on their behalf. [Sighs]

291
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,492
They will move against me.

292
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:57,498
They may even try to have me imprisoned.

293
00:24:57,532 --> 00:25:02,605
The railroad will likely fail and,
well, you'll be out of a job.

294
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,008
I've been in worse spots.

295
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:10,014
I am offering you a full partnership...

296
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:14,148
If you will help me convince them

297
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:16,650
that everything we have
done has been necessary.

298
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,131
Now, why would they believe me?

299
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:32,002
You are an interesting
anomaly, Mr. Bohannon.

300
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,604
A gunslinger and an aristocrat.

301
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:35,905
[Chuckles]

302
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,339
Yeah, wouldn't go that
far in either direction.

303
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:41,908
Look, I am unwell.

304
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:44,346
I simply need you to back me up.

305
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,180
What if they don't believe me?

306
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,922
Well, there's a good chance that
you will share in the blame.

307
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,925
And a jail cell.

308
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,561
From the moment you accept my offer,

309
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,166
all your debts owing to me
will be forgiven.

310
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:08,943
All my debts to you were
buried with doc whitehead.

311
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,667
Sign the check.

312
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,604
[Sighs] I know her.

313
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:37,841
She will not leave the railroad.

314
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,280
This is the best way
for us to be rid of her.

315
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,581
Is it?

316
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:46,316
Have you done something
you Haven't told me about?

317
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:53,019
I will do this my way if your way fails.

318
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,055
Your way.

319
00:26:56,425 --> 00:27:00,528
As long as there's no mess.
Do you assure me?

320
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,966
I'll sign the check...

321
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,238
And then her fate will be
briefly in her hands...

322
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,941
Before it's in mine.

323
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:24,392
[Sighs]

324
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:37,639
Mr. Durant has offered me a
permanent place with the railroad.

325
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:40,974
[Chuckles] He, uh...

326
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,075
He offered me a partnership.

327
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,076
Then it must be your job he's offering me.

328
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,278
[Horses approaching]

329
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:52,247
Whoa, whoa.

330
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:56,120
It's one of our horses. Shit.

331
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:05,998
It's too dangerous
for you to be out here now.

I've been thinking about what you said.

About all you have
is your job... and me.

All I have is this railroad and you.
