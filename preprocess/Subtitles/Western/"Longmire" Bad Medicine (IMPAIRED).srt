Because I found the body.

327
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,649
When?

328
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:27,019
Two days ago.

329
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,122
I was worried about him.

330
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,025
He started talking about...

331
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,027
Killing himself.

332
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:38,697
Though he never put it
quite like that.

333
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,500
He talk about
going back in time?

334
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,737
Yes, that's exactly
how he put it.

335
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,039
How did you know about
the time-travel thing?

336
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,708
Did you talk to David
about the flat tire?

337
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,944
No, I didn't. Hmm.

338
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,747
You were the only one
I talked to about that.

339
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:58,717
Then I guess he'd heard about
your suspicions through me.

340
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,919
I don't think
I'd be betraying him now

341
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:03,922
by telling you that your
suspicions were well-founded.

342
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,758
Did he tell you
something about it?

343
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:08,427
He told me everything about it.

344
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:09,828
He thought that by disabling

345
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:11,663
that car Cady Longmire
was driving,

346
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:12,998
he'd be helping me...

347
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,967
and, of course, you.

348
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,171
He never meant
for anybody to get hurt.

349
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:26,845
So, he confessed to you
and then killed himself.

350
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:30,682
If all that's true,
then where's the body?

351

Hopefully with his ancestors.

If she does,
she'll likely lose her job.

372
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,674
She should not confess
if she did not do it.
