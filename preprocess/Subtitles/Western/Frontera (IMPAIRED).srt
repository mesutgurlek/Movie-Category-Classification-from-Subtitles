OF ROY MCNARY'S LAND.

AND MY .30-06 RELOADS.

523
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,801
I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
THERE HUNTIN', SON.

524
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,571
BESIDES, I ALWAYS
PICK UP MY EMPTIES.

525
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:47,808
I EVEN MAKE A MARK ON 'EM
WITH A SHARPIE,

526
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:53,714
JUST SO I CAN TELL
WHICH ONES ARE MINE.

01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:00,054
THOSE ARE MINE.

528
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:15,036
ANY IDEA HOW
THEY GOT OUT THERE, SON?

529
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:16,270
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

530
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:17,905
WAS THIS YOUR STUPID IDEA?

531
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,807
DON'T YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME!

01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,930
WELL, THE BOYS ARE

01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,932
TWO OF 'EM ARE SAYIN'
THAT THEY WERE SHOOTING

536
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,767
AT THE MEXICANS 'CAUSE
THEY WERE BEATING ON LIVY

537
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,703
AND TRYIN' TO STEAL
HER HORSE.

538
01:16:48,705 --> 01:16:52,807
- YOU KNOW DAMNED WELL
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

539
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,109
- DO I?

540
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,177
I MEAN, YOU THOUGHT
THOSE MEXICANS

541
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:57,945
WERE BEATIN' ON LIVY TOO.

542
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,716
I SAT HERE AND LISTENED TO
YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU PULLED UP,

543
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,918

WERE SHOOTING AT THE MEXICANS.

548
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:18,966
LIVY DIDN'T DIE OF
A GUNSHOT WOUND, ROY.

549
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,703
THAT'S A FACT.

550
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:28,009
HE'S MY SON,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

551
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,313
- LIVY WAS MY WIFE.

552
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:41,022
WHO WAS THE SHOOTER?

553
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,591

554
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:45,893
AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO

555
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:50,931

FLORA, CAN IT WAIT?

560
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,689

563
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:21,262
SHE SAID ONE
OF THE ILLEGALS ASKED HER

564
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:23,064
TO CALL OVER HERE FOR HER.

565
01:18:23,066 --> 01:18:26,801
SHE SAID THE WOMAN
IS MIGUEL RAMIREZ'S WIFE.

566
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:11,212
- MELINA RAMIREZ?

WE, UH, BOTH HAVE TO PEE.

- NO, NO, DON'T.

576
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:21,942
- MISS FLORA,
SHE CAN'T BE IN THERE.

577
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:23,043
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

578
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,445
