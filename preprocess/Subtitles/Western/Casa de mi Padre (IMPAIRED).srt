00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,942
You don't sound happy, Armando.

171
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,366
Are you jealous of your brother?

172
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,072
Jealous?

173
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,661
No, Manuel, I could never
be jealous of Raul.

174
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,379
Maybe I love him too much,
and I am concerned.

175
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,835
Concerned?

176
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,046
I don't know.

177
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,506
He has changed.

178
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,433
I think you are jealous.

179
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,352
I am jealous.

180
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,814
If I had a woman like this...

181
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,267
I would never get out of bed.

00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,788
Can I not share in your joke?

184
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,127
I'm afraid not, Miss Lopez.

185
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,300
The joke was about you.

186
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,341
Do you ride?

187
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,472
I haven't in a long time,

188
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,889
but I would like to.

189
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,394
- Esteban, please check on the herd.
- Yes.

190
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,393
- I shall meet you there later.
- Of course.

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,349
You ride well, Miss Lopez.

192
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,939
Good control, nice poise.

193
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,143
That is a difficult horse.

194
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,773
You have ridden before.

195
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,399
From the time I could walk,
my father put me on the back of a horse.

196
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,234
I see.

197
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,409
When I was nine,
my father was murdered in his bed.

198
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,911
They took me to the city
to live with my uncle.

199
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,162
Interesting.

200
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,335
My uncle was very mean.

201
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,541
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me
and burned me with his cigarettes.

202
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,841
Interesting.

203
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,467
I ran away from him when I was 12.

204
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,850
But he found me, and beat me, and said
he would marry me when I was grown up.

205
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,303
Interesting.

206
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
And your uncle?

207
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,439
I have not seen him in a long time.

208
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,567
I have to ask you something.

209
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,364
Do you love Raul?

210
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,163
Raul has been very good to me,
and I have been good to him.

211
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,408
Do you love him?

212
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,959
I must know.

213
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,088
A race. I will show you how well I ride!
Giddy up!

214

217

What is this place?

218
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,751
It is called.

219
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,380
The Pond of the Seven Tears.

220
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,132
I swam here as a boy.

221
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,187
It is the most beautiful spot
I have seen in all my life.

222
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,724
How did you know to ride here?

223
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,940
The wind told me.

224
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,109
Sometimes the wind talks to me.

225
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,987
This is the place my mother was killed.

226
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,697
This was her favorite place.

227
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,415
I have much work to do.

228
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,841
Go then. I am only drying my hair.

229
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,634
Okay, but do not be long.

230
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,587
There are bandits in these hills.

231
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,014
Armando will protect me.

232
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,432
Ah. Yes.

233
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,308
My son,

234
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,560
this was my father's rifle.

235
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,148
He passed it on to me when I was a boy,

236
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,775
and today I am giving it to you.

237
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,326
Go. You must build our ranch.

238

Armando.

239
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,298
What do you want?

240
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,833
Armando, give me the gun.

241

- Boy, give me the gun!
- No.

No! Let me go! No!

It was a long time ago.

247

I could stay here forever.

248
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,838

(IN SPANISH) Armando, I
need you to help me.

509
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,830
Of course.

510
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,832
We know that your brother is a drug dealer.

511
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:36,931
We also know that he is here
to take over the territory of the Onza.

I don't think I can help you, Mr...

The name is Parker.

515
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,361
I think you can help me.

516
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,194
(IN ENGLISH) He's scared shitless.

517

He's gonna shit his pants.

(IN SPANISH) Listen, you piece of shit.

519
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,789
I make one call,

520
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,996
and I can get 10 helicopters

521
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,831
to come up over that hill

522
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,043
and turn your ranch

523
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,877
into a lit fart.

524
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,051

BLANCARDO: It is better this way, Armando.

526
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,319
Talk to Raul.

527
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,322
Find out for this man.

528
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,153
Now go find out.

529

Tomorrow will be a great day
for the Alvarez family.

It's a pleasure to share
it with all of you.

My sister, Carmen,
has come from Guadalajara.

My other sister, Margarite,
has come from Puerto Vallarta.

My cousin, Hernan, and his wife, Doleta.

(IN SPANISH) Tomorrow will be
a double celebration.

543
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:06,538
The return of my son, Raul, to his land.

544
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:10,083
Also, he brought home this precious woman

545
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,911
with whom he gets to have sex.

546
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,416
I propose a toast to Sonia.

547
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,168

551

I'd also like to propose a toast

552
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,927
and thank those who have come from so far.

553
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,772
But I would like to
specially thank someone,

554
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,272
someone who many of you have often
called stupid, imbecile, fat head,

555
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,106
but he's a guy with a big heart.

556
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,282
I propose a toast

557
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,325

558
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,368
For your happiness, Armando.

559

Well, Armando?

560
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,925
You aren't going to toast
to your brother's happiness?

561
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,970
Yes.

562
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,764
To Raul's happiness.

563
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,221
May you enjoy all of life's pleasure.

564
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,275
Even if it means the
destruction of this family!

for you to be at your brother's wedding.

that Raul is mixed up in this business?

It is your business too.

We can change him.

there's something you need to know.

585
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,960
What is it that I must know?

586
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,886
This drug dealer they call the Onza.

587
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,056
He is my uncle.

588
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,633
I understand.

589
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,604
He will never stop until
he has what he wants.

590
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,354
You come from trouble,
and you carry it with you.

Then save us.

You must tell her a lie.

678
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:13,596
Tell her Raul has married
a beautiful woman,

679
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,648
and that she will have children

680
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:22,524
and the Alvarez family is known

681
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:27,951
throughout Mexico as an honorable family.

682

I will tell her a lie.

683
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:42,712
Because I am ashamed
of the truth, Armando.

684
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:51,474
