He was Thomas' bookkeeper for years.

I need him here while Thomas is away.

He ain't talking to me, is he?

169
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,103
I need to review your work. Please.

170
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:42,428
This right here?
This ain't right.

171
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:51,183
Ah. Is that a new rifle, Mr.
Bohannon?

172
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,734
Matter of fact...
It is.

174
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,952

I don't know.

178
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:18,005
Perhaps you should have asked
him before you killed him.

Really?

180
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,051
Mmm.
Mr. Bohannon.

181
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,223

Amen. Thirsty ain't a big enough word

How about a barrel?

That big enough for you?

Heh. What did you mean, barrel?

193
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,307
Might be able to help you find one.

See, now, I'm thinking...

200
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,532
It was the Sioux made you
cut that hair real close.

201
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,172
Are you one of the tribe now?

202
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,383
No, I cut my hair to
avoid those nasty lice,

203

Mr. Bohannon.

I do not fraternize with heathens.

I know it was you
that armed the Indians.

206
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,970
And you took a harmless
drunk, and you lit a fuse.

207
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,738
It's you that's responsible
for that massacre out there,

208
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,005
and you're going to confess to it.

You're out your damn mind.

We are very much alike, in that way.

that you do not like the killing,

but you just can't stop,

224

because death is coming
for all of us.

It is invigorating.

You must have felt something similar

229
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:18,337
when you choked the life
out of Harper.

230
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:23,858
You set me up on that account.
That's on you.

No, no, no, no.

Mr. Bohannon, Harper was a
terrified, innocent man.

You must have felt some
doubt as to his guilt.

But that doubt...

wrapping 'round his throat.

that certain thrill, Jah?
