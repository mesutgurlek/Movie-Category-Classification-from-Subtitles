00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,893
(faint heartbeat thumps)

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,117
Ti

00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,297

12
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,267
( coughing )

13
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,922
(wood creaking)

14
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,512
Woman:
We have been expecting you.

15
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,574
Please, sit down.

16
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,594
Man:
Eat.

17
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,143
Man:
That's $10,000.

18
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,442
- Whose is it?
- For you.

19
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,076
Me?

20
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,038
(Wry chuckle)

21
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,798
Our land has been conquered
by a barbaric race.

22
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,084
We would like you to escort
the present heirto the throne

23
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,379
back to our people in Spain
so she can help to lead the army

24
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,422
and overthrow the barbarians.

25
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,140
For many years, a great number
of poor people has sacrificed

26
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,932
to collect this money.

27
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,771
- For what?
- Woman: For me.

28
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,279
I have the great honor to present
Princess Elizabeth Maria de Borgos...

29
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,494
direct descendant
of one of our most noble families.

30
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,753
And we're willing to pay any amount
for her safe conduct to Spain.

31
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,710
Well, I don't know who you are,

32
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,301
and I don't know nothin'
about no barbarians.

33
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,219
Hell, I don't even know where
this place Spain is you're talkin' about.

34
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,763
But I'll tell you one thing <i>--</i>

35
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,977
- You raise this pot here...
- ( coins rattling)

36
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,986
to $50,000 gold,

37
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,990
lady, I'll take you any goddamn place
you want to go.

38
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,197
Is that the kind of respect
you show for royalty?

39
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,334
Look...

40
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,837
business is business,

41
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,717
and I happen to be
a businessman.

42
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,468
And besides,

43
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,721
if I really thought
you were a princess,

44
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,224
well, I'd ask for $100,000.

45
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,929
(clattering)

46
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,850
(woman screaming)

47
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,023
(screaming )
Let me go!

48
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,987
(screaming continues)

49
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,652
Where is the girl?

50
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,617
Leave him alone!
He knows nothing!

51
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,781
Where is she?

52
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,950
( Old woman struggling,
screaming )

53
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,119
Let me go!

54
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,163
(screaming )

55
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,380
What the hell is that
supposed to be? Mm!

56
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,179
Excuse me, pal.

57
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,185
This belongs to me.

58
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,774
( Chuckles)

59
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,482

(screaming )

61
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,038
(train whistle blares)

62
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,893
- What's that?
- It was built by the Moors

63
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,895
when they came here
years ago

64
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,933
to help my people
conquer the barbarians.

65
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,978
In this place, they once kept
the treasure of Rodrigo.

66
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,523
- The what?
- The treasure of Rodrigo.

67
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,844
(thundering hoof beats)

68
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,700
(exhales sharply)

69
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,465
Who's that?

70
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,725
Our enemies, the barbarians.

71
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,227
What about them?

72
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,764
- The Moors.
- The what?

73
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,979
- The Moors.
- Now, lady,

74
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,568
them people are fixin' to "fonch"
upon one another.

75
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
Best we get the hell
out of here.

76
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,276
Get your stuff.

77
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,905
Them's the barbarians, right?

78
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,625
And them's the Moors, right?

79
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,039
Yes.

80
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,050
(exhales sharply)

81
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,466
Now, this is a dangerous country.

82
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,181
They're fightin' everywhere.
Let's go. Come on.

83
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,095
Come on!

84
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,809
Wait!

85
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,398
That's the Moorish army.
They've come to help my people.

86
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,154
- You must do something!
- What do you want me to do?

87
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,566
I command you to help my army!

88
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,905
And I command you
to shut up, lady,

89
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,537
because you're gettin'
on my nerves.

90

93
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,517

107
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,165
(shouting )

108
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,973
Let's go!

109
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,496
You butchers!
You pigs!

110
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,003
You stupid woman!

111
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,415
You don't understand
who you're speaking to!

112
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,256
No, you are the one
who doesn't understand.

113
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,513
I am a princess,
Elizabeth Maria de Borgos.

114
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,014
( Groans)

115
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,016
Let me welcome you to Spain

116
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,982
and offer you the hospitality
of my humble house.

117
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,273
I accept nothing
that is already mine.

118
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,533
I am the rightful ruler
of this land.

119
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,286
You own nothing
but the army of that man!

120
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,742
Look.

121
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,380
This little woman here
fell off her horse

122
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,712
a few days back
and hurt her head.

123
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,344
Now she's crazy.

124
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,893
Ah, come on, you guys.

125
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,180
If you really think
she's a princess,

126
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,440
you're all crazy.

127
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,478
She's not a princess,
she's an ill-bred bitch!

128
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,941
Just hold on there.

129
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,948
I'm supposed to get $50,000

130
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,737
for delivering her,
whatever she is.

131
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,745
How much is that?

132
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:01,159
It would buy you 2,000 horses.

133
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,669
Stupid foreigners.

134
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,798
You <i>come</i> to my country,
and you insult me.

135
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,709
- I kill you both!
- Diego!

(sword scrapes)

137
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,548
If I've told you once,

138
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,514
I've told you a hundred times <i>--</i>

139
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:24,228
You must never lose control
in front of the men.

140
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,020
Diego, hang him.

141
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,945
By his feet.

144
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,839

(laughing continues)

148
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,901
Now, let's talk this thing over.

149
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,937
We can make a deal.

150
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,607
Hell, <i>I'll</i> take $25,000.

151
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,946
Hang him!

( laughing )

153
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,784
Hey, come back here!
Where are you going?

154
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,297
Where are you going,
you bunch of foreigners?

155
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,755
You can't treat a man like this!

156
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,636
Hey! Cut me down!

157
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,299
I ain't no goddamn dog!

158

You barbaric sons of bitches!

159
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,764
I'm gonna get you!

160
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,682
I'll kill you!

(faint shouting)

162

My name is Morelia.
You are among friends.

He's dying.

Listen, ask him
about my money, will ya?

186

There's no way to pay you

until Rodrigo's treasure
has been found.

Look, lady, a deal's a deal.

I was supposed to bring her to you,
and I did,

Please, tell us
the secret of the treasure.

The princess...

195

who can claim the treasure.

to claim it.

336
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,631
All right.

337
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:29,849
I'll release her, and then we'll go
and claim it together...

338
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,354
partner.

339
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,496
Princess: I don't know what kind
of arrangement you have made,

340
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,287
but I will not go anywhere
with this man.

341
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,581
Now, look.

342
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,296
I don't care nothin' about him,

343
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,508
I don't care nothin' about that treasure,
and I don't care nothin' about you.

344
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,140
You don't care nothing
about anything.

345
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,891
Right.

346
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,052
I just want to get my money

347
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,224
and get out of this trashy
goddamn country of yours.

348
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,984
But you know
we can't trust him.

349
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,612
One thing at a time, lady.
One thing at a time.

350
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,622
(exclaims)

351
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,232
(all humming)

352
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:54,998
How would you girls like to visit
the States someday?

353
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,999
( Thinking )
Oh, dear God,

354
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,753
they got some ugly-looking women
in this country.

355
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,085
( Creaking )

356
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,669
Sombra:
Hey, partner.

357
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,428
I think you'd better come inside.

358
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,434
I can't worry about danger.

359
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,728
This is something I must do.

360
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,164
<i>HEY-</i>

361
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,420
Now, where do you think
you're going?

362
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,832
This is not your affair.

363
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,468
Look, lady,
until I get my money,

364
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,629
everything's my affair.

365
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,925
Now, somebody tell me what the hell's
going on around here.

366
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,812
I'm sorry. This is one
of our most sacred traditions.

367
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,849
The princess will not be able
to claim the treasure

368
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,985
unless she makes the long journey
through the trials of death.

369
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,738
- The what?
- Man: The trials of death,

370
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,447
a venture full of magic
and the unknown.

371
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,160
They are the only way
to claim Rodrigo's treasure.

372
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,825
After many men had died
in the attempt,

373
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,165
a time came when
no one else would try.

374
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,501
So the tradition and the secret
of the treasure

375
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,042
were lost and forgotten.

376
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,676
Man:
Now, mister, you're crazy.

377
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,805
We got a little woman here.

378
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,888
Now, if all them guys got killed tryin',
how do you expect her to do it?

379
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,768
She doesn't have to.

380
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,272
If the heir apparent
is a woman or a child,

381
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,184
a loyal subject
who must carry no weapon

382
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,977
may be appointed instead.

383
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,614
But she insists on going.

384
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:58,743
I'm going,
and nobody can stop me.

385
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,077
<i>Lady...</i>

386
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,121
I'll not only stop you,

387
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:11,964
but I'll break
your goddamn legs for you.

388
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,380
Now, we got a problem here.

389
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:20,347
We got a serious problem here.

390
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,888
All right, what are we gonna do
about this thing?

391
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:28,526
Well, I could certainly do
this kind of thing better than you.

392
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,482
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

393
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,195
However, there is
one small problem.

394
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,859
What's that?

395
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,995
Well, you know how it is
when one's crippled.

396
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:45,035
You'll have some good days...
and some bad.

397
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,296
And today is just one of those
bad days, right?

398
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,922
Ah.

399
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,136
You know, I'm really happy
you came along, partner.

400
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,720
That's very nice
of you to say.

401
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,805
All right, what do I have to do?

402
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,269
(bell tolling)

403
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,072
(tolling stops)

404
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,695

(voices laughing)

426
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,340
Now, all you people
in them coffins,

427
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,844
I don't believe
in this kind of stuff.

428
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,846
You hear me?

429
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,851
So don't be trying to turn me
into no damn wolf.

430
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,977
( Howling )

Hey!

(shout echoing)

Now, what the hell
kind of treasure is that?

449
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,662
Maybe it's old or something.

- What happened?
- ( groaning )

455
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,634
Tell me what happened in here.

456

They...
(groans)

457
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,845
(doors opening)

458
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,999
There. You see?

459
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,836
I told you.
They plotted together.

460
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,592
Where is my treasure?

461
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,549
( Chuckles)

462
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,182
But, mister,

463
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,265
now you've got to
get me a doctor,

464
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,897
because I've turned black all over,
and I think I'm gonna die.

465
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,308
Search him!

466

- ( Man gasps )
- ( people shrieking )

467
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,371
Oh, my God!
Zepeda's necklace!

468
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,041
- The Scorpion's Sting.
- Man: The what?

469
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,084
It's called the Scorpion's Sting.

470
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,097
Death comes to whoever claims it.
They say El Cid had it at Valencia.

471
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,553
Three days later...

472
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,217
he was dead!

473
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,059
Shut up!
Give it to him!

474

( Gasping )

475
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,403
T-Take it.

476
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,405
Take it.

477
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,068
You take it, or I'll drive this dagger
through your black throat.

478
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,987
All right.

479
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,951
<i>I'll take it.</i>

480
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,458

- ( Sombra laughing )
- What?

483
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,088
Nothing.
( chuckles )

484
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,303
- It was nothing.
- Why do you laugh?

485
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,184
Please, Diego.

486
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,437
In another moment,
you'll lose your temper and he'll be dead,

487
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,439
and then you'll never
find your treasure.

488
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,943
Don't listen! Don't listen.
He tried to betray you.

489
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,853
That's right, Diego.
Listen to

490
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,819
<i>H </i>

of a new hat with feathers!

493
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,030
Now, come.

494
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,621
Come, sweet counselor.
Tell us.

495
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,287
If I did betray Diego for the treasure,
where is it?!

496
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,377
I...

497

I d-- I don't know.

498
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,057

You think that
Diego is a fool,

501
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,148
that you can whisper anything
that you like into his ears

502
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:19,187
and he will believe you <i>--</i>
well, you're wrong!

Diego knows better than that.

in my hands, I would bring it to him!

If you won't tell me, then take
your secret to the grave with you.
