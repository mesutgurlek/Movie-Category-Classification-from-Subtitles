1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,311
( crickets chirping )

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,480
( hawk squawking )

3
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,821
( distant howling )

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,287
( birds twittering )

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,418
( loud squawking )

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,716
( distant howling )

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,104
( squawking )

8
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,489
( hawk squawks )

9
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,373
Our beloved ancestors
had given us a beautiful home,

10
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,335
a place of amazing
naturaI wonders.

11
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,755
The rocks, the sand,
the cactus.

12
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,091
( chuckles )
Nothing was better.

13
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,803
And then one day,
Felicity arrived here.

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,265
And she built Felicity City.

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,069
Narrator: At first glance,
it's a town like most others--

16
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,115
its sheriff constantly
on the lookout for evildoers,

17
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,284
his senses like a puma.

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
( bell tolling )

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,125
And like all respectable towns,

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,503
FeIicity City
has its very own church.

21
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,466
Except here in this town,

22
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,304
if you see folks hurrying around
earIy Sunday morning...

23
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,516
it's because they are
on their way

24
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,812
to give their respects
to Felicity.

25
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,275
You see, my friends, it's not called
FeIicity City for nothing.

26
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,154
Heh! What is this,
some kind of jug?

27
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,948
No, not at all.

28
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,452
Very ancient, Ming Dynasty.
Very expensive.

29
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,455
Very ancient?
You gotta be kiddin' me.

30
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,124
After aII I've done for you,
you come here with an old jug?

31
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,169
You know, I think
l'm going to take a pass

32
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,463
on the oId jug,
if you don't mind.

33
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,217
Ming Dynasty.
Very expensive. Very ancient.

34
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,094
l think this idiot
actually believes it.

35
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,598
He's so darn cute
when he says "Ming Dynasty."

36
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,767
So true.
( laughs )

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,186
Yeah! Ha!
He's cute, all right.

38
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,522
Next time don't bring me no jug.
Get out.

39
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,359
- Who's next?
- Aha.

40
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,363
Ha ha, my darling Felicity.
( chuckIes )

41
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,033
( rattling )

42
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,869
Personally, l would have preferred
Iiving on the prairie

43
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,914
like my ancestors. But...

44
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,541
- ( coins rattIing )
- ...l made a promise long ago

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,461
that has kept me
tied to this place--

46
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,464


a promise
to watch over someone.

47
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,091
- ( slaps )
- Ugh!

48
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,219
- ( thumps )
- Uhh!

49
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,054
Cinderella.

50
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,225
Let go of poor Bob McDonagan
this instant.

51
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,687
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry, but l had no choice.

52
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,982
These two had to learn to remove
their hats when seeing a lady

53
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,150
and not to spit.

54
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,910
Oh, no, no, no, don't you
look at me like that, Cinderella.

55
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,330
( chuckles )
You're straying down a crooked path,

56
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,249
- so stop your grinning.
- ( ostrich grunts )

57
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,293
( grunts )

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,253
lt's incredible.

59
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,298
There's not a single guy
in this miserabIe town

60
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,009
who demonstrates
the least bit of chivalry.

61
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,719
Hyah!

62
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,347
Okay, so we're not in Mrs. Blah Blah's
lofty circle or anything,

63
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,892
but who cares? l mean, really,
can't they see l'm a girl?

64
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,813
I was just sitting there thinking
that if l answered her question,

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,774
she wouId most sureIy
punch me right in the nose,

66
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,112
when suddenIy, something
completely unexpected happened

67
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,449
that would finally allow me
to keep my promise.

68
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,161
A teIegram!
An actual telegram !

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,205
( panting )

70
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,957
- lt's for your mother.
- Stepmother.

71
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,752
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.
Would you mind bringing it to her?

72
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,962
- l mean, l don't dare.
- ( spits )

73
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,715
You see, l have no gift
to bring her.

74
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,053
- ( sighs )
- Dogs: And with this axe,

75
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,013
chopping very hard for--

76
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,474
- for your grace and beauty--
- Yeah.

77
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,977
- --we makes--
- Uh, make-- this lovely beaver.

78
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,145
( girl laughing )

79
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,399
Well, it's something, l suppose.
Very pretty.

80
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,070
But I'm not about to give
my daughters' hands to just anyone.

81
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,697
You two are poor,
and this ain't the lottery.

82
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,574
- Oh, yeah, but--
- Felicity: Listen.

83
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,328
l ain't bartering my little angels
for a worthIess piece of wood.

84
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,373
- Right, darIings?
- Yeah, that's right, fellas.

85
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,625
l guess you ain't really
suited for us.

86
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,835
Yeah, that's too bad, boys.

87
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,670
( laughs )
Better luck to you next time.

88
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,881
( dog moans )

89
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,676
So that's it, huh?
A town of ingrates.

90
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,178
l've taken
everything from them

91
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,305
and now they've got
nothing left to give.

92
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,308
What the heck am l going
to do now for fun?

93
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,143
- l'm exhausted.
- ( door opens )

94
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,187
What are you doing here
in the house?

95
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,189
l told you to cut up
aII the wood.

96
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,441
I'm bringing my gift,
like everyone else does.

97
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,405
- Here, fetch.
- ( sniffs )

98
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,825
- ( screams )
- Oh!

99
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,035
- Ugh!
- ( dog growling )

100
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,039
Y'all better go get yourselves
aII gussied up, my darIings.

101
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,209
- ( daughter groaning )
- A prince is coming to my town!

102
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,212
( train whistle wailing )

103
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,409
Andale!
( laughs )

104
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,995
( train whistle blows )

105
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,875
( gunshots firing )

106
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,877
( gasps )

107
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,171
( ringing )

108
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,216
Goodness gracious,
what a ruckus.

109
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,428
Discovering the New World
requires certain sacrifices.

110
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,804
l suppose.

111
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,933
( gunfire continues )

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,987
( yelps )

113
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,120
( whistle tweeting )

114
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,082
Hyah!

115
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,438
( yelps, moans )

116
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,275
( grunts )

117
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,626
Woman:
Oh.

118
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,505
Man: An extraordinary face, haggard
by the hard climate of the West.

119
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,798
Very authentic.

120
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,762
( garbled )
Your money or your life.

121
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,100
AIIow me. I don't understand
a word you're saying, my friend.

122
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,103
( grunts )
Gracias, señor.

123
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,189
What I said to you was,
"Your money or your life."

124
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,524
lt's up to you.

125
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,235
For lgor's sake,
would it be too much to ask

126
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,238
to be able to play a simple game
of cards without being interrupted?

127
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,033
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm going
to have to cut this conversation short.

128
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,035
( yells )

129
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,580
( grunts )

130
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,790
( grunting )
Whoa!

131
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,463
Ah!

132
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,465
( howls )

133
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,138
( squawking )

134
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,353
( growling )

135
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,982
( train whistle tweets )

136
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,902
( grunting, sighing )

137
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,322
( all cheering, applauding )

138
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,286
( brakes screech )

139
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,747
( hissing )

140
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,128
That was fantastic!

141
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,255
This certainly is
a new worId.

142
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,092
Oh, my Lord. If I can just
find someone to play cards with--

143
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,969
l mean some real players.

144
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,096
l hope you have been
discreet, Mother.

145
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,932
As you know,
we are strictly incognito here.

146
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,435
Oh, Vladimir.

147
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,438
Your mother is not a gossip
and you know it.

148
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,608
l can assure you, my son,
that l haven't breathed a word

149
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,611
of our journey here
to a single living soul.

150
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,279
l am sorry.

151
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,239
You're wonderful.

152
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,577
( all cheering )

153
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,997
How lovely. Thank you.

154
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,999
- Not a word, Mother?
- Oh!

155
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,336
( Mother laughs )

156
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,590
Welcome, welcome, Your Highnesses,
to Felicity City.

157
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,384
Oh!

158
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,553
l am Felicity.

159
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,306
- And what you see is all me.
- ( fIy buzzes )

160
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,643
Having you here is a great honor
for simple people like us--

161
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,520
l mean, like them.

162
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,651
Please, l'd like to introduce you
to my daughters.

163
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,821
Melody? Harmony?

164
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,739
Where are those girls?

165
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,576
Oh, there are
my dearest darlings!

166
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,163
- At their studies as always.
- ( flute tweets )

167
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,207
Beautiful, aren't they?

168
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,750
Oh!

169
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,837
Ah! Who would have
expected to find

170
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,756
in such a dry and
hostile-seeming place like this--

171
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,677
Such tempting and juicy salads?
It's aImost a miracIe.

172
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,096
They'll take good care of you.

173
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,306
Your Highness, it's all arranged.

174
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,518
- They'll be your guardian angels.
- Duchess: Oh!

175
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,021
Oh, and there's going to be
a ball in your honor tonight.

176
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,524
Oh. Ha!

177
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,694
A ball?
What a stroke of luck, Mother.

178
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,406
l thought we were going to discover
the West and its rude austerity.

179
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,784
Eh! The carriage!

180
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,203
( tires screech, rumbling )

181
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,498
Ah, my violin.

182
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,959
Sheriff:
The law is unequivocal.

183
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,128
Train attacks are a crime.

184
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,214
Yes indeed,
l gotta make a point here.

185
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,383
( jaw harp twanging )

186
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,637
( grunts )

187
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,891
As if l didn't already have
enough to do, thanks to Felicity.

188
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,810
Now l'm forced to be a flunky
for the tourists.

189
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,189
Um, Cinderella, uh uh uh...

190
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,398
lt's true.

191
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,818
l mean, who cares about some stuffy
prince and duchess of so-and-so?

192
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,905
Prince VIadimir
Semyonovich Sergeyev Pichikov,

193
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,573
- at your service.
- ( Iaughs )

194
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,741
And your name is?

195
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,786
Uh, my name?
WeII, it's--

196
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,704
it's more of a nickname, really.

197
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,041
lt's Cinderella.
Her name is Cinderella.

198
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,336
Well, Cinderella, if you don't mind,
l'll take my violin with me.

199
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,504
lt's fragile.

200
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,547
And the rest?

201
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,300
l mean your luggage,
shouId I take it to--

202
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,803
To the saloon, yes.

203
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,640
CouId I pIease
have my violin back now?

204
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,642
Yes.

205
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,853
- All right, then.
- The violin.

206
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,731
- Give him back his violin.
- Right!

207
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,401
Thank you.
So long, cowgirl.

208
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,074
( chuckling )

209
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,700
Got something to say,
Little Cloud?

210
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,829
SiIence is the friend of he
who wants an unbroken nose.

211
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,205
( sniffs )

212
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,421
Sheriff:
Oh! What an awful waste.

213
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,466
Do you ever think
about your mother?

214
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,094
lmagine her extreme
disappointment.

215
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,054
- ( bolt clicking )
- Sheriff: Yep!

216
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,474
Well, underneath it all,
l'm sure you're sorry.

217
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,562
Bleh! Bleh!

218
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,480
( squawking )

219
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,736
Yes, yes, yes!
I won again.

220
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,989
No, you didn't.
You cheated again.

221
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,700
Oh! Vladimir!

222
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,037
Oh! My cruel, torturing,
pitiIess, heartIess son.

223
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,749
You are still angry
at your poor old mother, aren't you?

224
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:41,212
Okay, okay, okay!
l announced our arrival.

225
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,173
But in the end,
what does it change, hmm?

226
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,717
What does it change?

227
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,387
- ( crowd cheering )
- Absolutely nothing, Mother.

228
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,682
( girl squealing )

229
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,435
FeIicity:
Everything's got to be perfect!

230
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,689
First one to slack off
gets buried in the desert, you hear me?

231
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,802
So, Harmony,
can you lend me your girdle,

232
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,638
the one that makes me
look skinny?

233
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,599
Oh! You are such
a little cheapskate.

234
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,560
Huh?
Check it out, Melody.

235
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,897
CindereIIa's
trying to look like a girl!

236
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,483
( MeIody Iaughing )
She looks ridiculous.

237
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,652
Come on, just let me through.

238
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,404
Ow! Don't touch me
with those filthy little paws of yours.

239
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,906
What's going on over here?

240
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,743
Ma! CindereIIa just tried
to poke Harmony's eye out.

241
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,497
You gotta punish her, Ma.
Ha ha! Give her what she deserves.

242
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,875
- Go on and get ready, my darlings.
- ( Harmony Iaughing )

243
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,420
Now as for you,
you ungrateful little wretch,

244
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,840
how dare you try to mangle
my precious little beauties

245
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,969
on the very day a prince
has come here to my town?

246
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,763
Get Iost!
Get out of here, vermin!

247
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,723
( Cinderella sighs )

248
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,769
l want you packed up
and out of my saloon!

249
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,356
l'll be glad to get rid of you
once and for aII!

250
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,191
( both grunting )

251
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,610
Oh.

252
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,278
ls something wrong,
Cinderella?

253
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,739
No, not really.

254
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,785
l mean, l just--
I-- I gotta go.

255
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,831
She is shy, isn't she?

256
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,752
No? A little wild,
perhaps?

257
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,216
( rider yells )

258
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,968
Whoa!

259
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,562
( grunts, screams )

260
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,243
Argh!
What have l done to deserve

261
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,997
you worthless bunch of lazy,
brainless, good-for-nothing idiots?

262
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,666
You are not even capable
of attacking a stupid train.

263
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,671
Must l survive on a paltry diet
of cactus and vuIture eggs?

264
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,506
Madre mío!

265
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,885
- ( ship horn bellowing )
- ( laughs )

266
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,804
No. l am sorry.
It is my fauIt.

267
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,850
l am the one responsible.
( chuckIes )

268
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,644
Sí, my compañeros.
Sí, sí.

269
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,648
l know, l still have much work to do
on my management skiIIs.

270
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,192
( laughs )

271
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,319
Give me that, amigo.

272
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,404
- ( thumps )
- ( yells )

273
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,284
There, that should be enough
to motivate all of you.

274
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,495
Or should l toss another?

275
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,872
( bird squawking )

276
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,376
Rider:
Whoa! Whoa!

277
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,463
( grunting )

278
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,382
Argh!

279
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,135
Where have you been?
What took you so long?

280
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,554
Jefe, on the train

281
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,349
there was a young prince
and also an old duchess.

282
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,185
A prince and a duchess?

283
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,645
Sí.

284
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,564
They got huge rings
the size of ostrich eggs.

285
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,442
Rings like ostrich eggs?
They're in town?

286
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,945
Sí, jefe.
l saw them like l see you now.

287
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,573
The prince was talking
to Cinderella and Little Cloud.

288
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,327
And is this Mad Storm
a friend of the prince and duchess?

289
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,913
No, jefe, no.
( laughs )

290
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,666
His name
is not Mad Storm, jefe.

291
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,335
His name is actuaIIy
Little Cloud, you see.

292
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,254
Little Cloud-- ugh!

293
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,257
( laughs )

294
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,718
Amigos,
we're back in business.

295
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,096
Here, take this, amigo.

296
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,848
That's for bringing me
the good news.

297
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,434
Thank you, jefe.
( screams )

298
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,021
And that's for getting caught
by the stupid sheriff.

299
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,149
What are you
waiting for, then?

300
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,317
Go there and find them !
AndaIe!

301
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,112
Bring them back here,
but not the Mad Storm

302
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,781
and his troublesome
little pest.

303

322
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,190
So, my lovely little prince,

323
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,983
you should check out
my darling daughters.

324
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,027
Spittin' image of their mother,
don't you think?

325
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,113
Spitting is indeed
the right word.

326
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,784
( music playing )

327
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,536
( all chattering )

328
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,665
Duchess:
What a lovely evening.

329
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,459
l'm having
such a wonderful time.

330
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,672
After that horrid trip,
this game is exactly what l needed.

331
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,635
Oh!
Full house!

332
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,262
Oh!

333
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,640
Duchess:
He's so sad, poor man.

334
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,433
( laughs )

335
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,228
MeIody:

336
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,897
You heard good
what Felicity said, right, Bob?

337
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,065
Yeah, Bob.

338
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,318
"Only our princesses are entitled
to be beautiful tonight."

339
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,486
Yeah, Bob.

00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,406
MeIody:

Ah, you ain't pretty.
Go on in.

342
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,371
Hey, Bob, are you sure?
She had lots of charm.

343
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,331
No, she didn't.

344
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,921
( sobbing )

345
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,093
lf you're trying to humor me,
l'm not in the mood.

346
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,970
You know, Cinderella,

347
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,889
when you were only as tall
as a baby sparrow,

348
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,392
your mother made me promise
to watch over you.

349
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,853
Wow!
Well, isn't that great?

350
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,980
We get to hear the party
instead of going to it.

351
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,275
This is it, Cinderella.
It's time.

352
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,277
l'm going to help you.
You're going to the ball.

353
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,862
No way.

354
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,698
lf l go there, l'm toast.
And you can't help me.

355
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,117
You can't even put your boots on
by yourseIf.

356
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,869
You're right about that.

357
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,289
But what about the bandit ship
in the shifting sands?

358
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,043
That and, well,
what's the other time when you--

359
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,255
well-- l was--
well, the bandit ship--

360
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,965
don't forget, that was me.

361
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,092
( sighs )

362
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,470
l am a shaman,
don't forget.

363
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,181
I may be
a little old and gray,

364
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,102
but believe me,
you will go to the ball.

365
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,315
( tambourine rattling )

366
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,317
( howls )

367
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,695
( speaking gibberish )

368
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,741
What are you doing,
Little Cloud?

369
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,576
- What is all this?
- Shh.

370
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,538
Admire how one summons
the celestial creatures.

371
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,667
- ( babbling )
- ( sparking )

372
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,546
Mmm, l don't get it.
l must have skipped a tambourine bit.

373
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,174
But no worries.
You must stay positive.

374
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,509
l know l'll get it.

375
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,887
- Well, it's been fun...
- ( gurgIing )

376
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,681
...but maybe you should cut back
on the cactus juice.

377
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,768
( turkeys gobbling )

378
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,938
( singing )

379
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:35,413
( gobbling )

380
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,873
( chanting,
gobbling continue )

381
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,931
Ooh! The visitor will be blown away
when he sees you.

382
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,641
- Good job.
- ( applause )

383
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,269
( all hooting, applauding )

384
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,899
Excuse me, but it's time for me
to retire into the arms of Morpheus.

385
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,735
Huh?
Who the heck is that?

386
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,530
Aw, lucky her!

387
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,659
( distant voices
overIapping )

388
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:20,291
Huh? Hey, no way, miss.
You're way too pretty.

389
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,209
Yeah, sorry.

390
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,211
( thumping )

391
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,673
( music playing )

392
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,773
- lsn't she pretentious?
- ScandaIous!

393
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,868
Good evening, miss.

394
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,120
PIease aIIow me
to introduce myself.

395
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,956
- l am--
- Prince Vladimir Piffpov.

396
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,958
Talk of the town, it seems.

397
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,294
- Eh, Pichikov.
- A pleasure.

398
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,214
May l-- could l perhaps
offer you--

399
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,133
Offer me a drink?
Of course.

400
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,178
Two, please.

401
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:19,099
To the Wild West
and its beautiful ladies.

402
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,936
- ( coughs )
- Stuff's pretty harsh, isn't it?

403
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,481
The appIe aftertaste
caught me off guard.

404
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,399
lt tastes very good.

405
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,859
( squeaking )

406
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,071
- Shall we dance?
- ( tango music resumes )

407
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,174
lncredible!

408
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,135
l throw a ball with the prince
and he slips through your hands?

409
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,304
Who is this woman?
Huh?

410
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,516
- I don't know, Ma.
- lt must be Morpheus.

411
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,018
Come on! What are you
waiting for, dummies?

412
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,896
We're not going to let that stranger
swipe our prince.

413
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,190
Go on, get moving!

414
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,444
Vladimir: Don't look now,
but l think we're being followed.

415
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,862
They're just jealous.

416
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,282
Jealous? But of whom?

417
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,660
- Well...
- Do you mean of you?

418
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,039
What do you say
you and l lose them?

419
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,710
Something l've wanted to do
for quite some time.

420
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,386
Both:
Aw! Ma!

421
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,930
Don't worry,
my little darlings.

422
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,807
We have other means.

423
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,561
Come on, you,
time for you to do your job.

424
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,565
You are gonna get your prize.
l promise.

425
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:54,361
Oh, oh, oh!
No, no, you mustn't be shy now.

426
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,530
Let's continue to play,
shall we?

427
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,117
May I be so boId
as to tempt fate with you

428
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,161
and join your little game?

429
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,495
( yells )

430
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,750
Duchess: Why, of course!
The more, the merrier.

431
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,711
lf you would,
go easy on me, madam.

432
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,963
lt's my very first time
playing.

433
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,091
Oh! You're a beginner.

434
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,010
How marvelous.

435
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,804
We're going to have
some reaI fun now.

436
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,931
l'm almost certain of it.

437
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,394
( cackling )

438
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,954
Mmm !

439
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,247
Ho ho!

440
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,626
( Felicity laughing )

441
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,300
Ah! Ha ha!

442
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,885
Oh!

443
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,845
( chips rattling )

444
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,986
( cackling )

445
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,991
Felicity: l guess
l really smoked you, didn't l?

446
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,453
- ( laughing )
- l think it's time for me to retire.

447
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,624
When I Iose, I don't toIerate
arrogance and crass vulgarity very well.

448
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,545
Oh, now, please don't be upset,
Your Excellency.

449
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,589
It's just a case
of beginner's luck.

450
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,342
Hey, how about you and l
play one last hand?

451
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,512
- lf you win, you take it all.
- Oh?

452
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,682
But if l win, you give me
your son's hand

453
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,517
for one of my
darling daughters.

454
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,688
( both giggling )

455
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,024
Oh ho ho ho ho!

456
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,486
l've never heard of anything
so ridiculous.

457
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,155
What do you take me for?

458
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,657
Hey, l'm just saying.

459
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,367
You really lost big.

460
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,537
Fortunes change,
as l'm sure you know.

461
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,623
Unless you like losing?

462
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,502
Hit me.

463
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,588
( growls softly )

464
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,757
( squawking )

465
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,388
Ha ha!

466
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,182
( Felicity cackling )

467
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,391
( Melody, Harmony laughing )

468
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,685
Felicity: We're gonna be royal!
Can you beIieve it?

469
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,313
We're gonna be royal,
my darIings!

470
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,608
And that makes us
the "cream de la cream."

471
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,360
The cream de la cream !
That's what we are!

472
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,696
l love cream, though!

473
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,115
Maybe we'II even
have ourselves a butler!

474
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,576
( all laughing )

475
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,749
I beg you,
let me play another round

476
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,667
to earn back the hand
of my son.

477
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,295
What?
Did she just belch somethin'?

478
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,424
Ha ha ha ha!
You don't "tolerate vulgarity," huh?

479
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,635
Well, now, you're just going
to have to live with it!

480
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,678
( laughs )

481
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,765
VIadimir:
So beautiful.

482
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,602
CindereIIa:
The desert is-- wow.

483
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,606
VIadimir: Yes, this moonbeam
from heaven delicately revealing

484
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,943
the gentle dunes,
soft and round.

485
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,238
- And this mouth...
- Mouth?

486
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,449
( laughs )
What mouth?

487
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,202
This one.

488
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,746
Your face
is my landscape,

489
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,123
treasure at the end
of the worId.

490
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,960
Wait, listen.

491
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,880
l need-- l need
to tell you something.

492
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,091
l'm not the girl
you think l am.

493
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,759
Undoubtedly.

494
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,221
An angel that falls from heaven
inevitabIy hides a mystery.

495
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,890
Oh, boy,
you sure can talk.

496
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,185
- ( squawking )
- Hey, what's going on?!

497
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,812
- Cinderella: Hey!
- Whoa oh oh!

498
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,690
Oh, no, this is not happening.
Not now.

499
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,859
( squawking )

500
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,988
Come and get it,
pretty boy.

501
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,992
- ( grunts )
- Whoa!

502
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,828
Hyah!

503
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,915
Whoa!
lntimidating, isn't she?

504
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,465
CindereIIa: This might get
a little bumpy, Your Highness.

505
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,595
Vladimir: l certainly hope so.
Whoo-hoo!

506
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,435
( yelps )

507
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,687
( grunts )

508
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:43,609
VIadimir:
Whoa-aa!

509
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,028
( laughs )

510
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,038
Okay, amigos.

511
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,372
- ( Captain gasps )
- ( Felicity growls )

512
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,417
What are y'all doing here,
you big dummies?

513
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,793
- ( bird squawking )
- Huh?

514
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,714
( yells )

515
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,051
( all shouting )

516
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,346
- Melody: What the heck?
- Harmony: IncredibIe!

517
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,680
( bell rings )

518
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,849
So what's your pleasure,
Your Highness?

519
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,060
Mmm,
a shot of cactus juice.

520
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,519
Make it a double.

521
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,651
First mate: Your attention, please.
May l have your attention, please?

522
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,196
This is a kidnapping.
Cooperate and no one will be hurt.

523
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,031
CindereIIa:
Except you.

524
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,409
Hey.

525
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,164
Oh!

526
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,707
The duchess!
The duchess!

527
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,209
- ( slaps )
- Oh!

528
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,920
Ha ha, amazing.
Truly remarkable.

529
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,755
Ugh!

530
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,050
( laughs )
Oh!

531
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,136
My dear man,
if you want a dance with me,

532
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,431
you'll have to be
a lot more sophisticated than this.

533
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,724
Perhaps-- whoo!

534
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,268
Put down my mother. Ah!

535
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,853
Right-- whew.

536
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,981
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

537
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,777
( laughs )

538
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,406
Harmony:
That's it, Ma! Watch out.

539
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,575
You got it, Ma!

540
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,662
No, left, Ma.
Go Ieft.

541
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,123
- ( gasps )
- Get out of the way.

542
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,377
Oh, oh,
this is so much fun!

543
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,338
Oh, Vladimir,
this is fantastic.

544
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,632
lt reminds me
of the days of my youth.

545
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,510
Stay right there, Mother.
You'll be fine.

546
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,304
- Vladimir?
- Yes?

547
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,851
You're never going to forgive me.
Oh, those horrid cards.

548
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,060
Come to the point, Mother.

549
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,938
l made a huge mistake--

550
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,649
an enormous mistake.

551
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,235
So did I.
l fell in love.

552
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,029
You did?

553
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,072
ls she here?
l want to see her.

554
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,158
There, with the chair.

555
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,743
Hyah!

556
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,583
Howdy.

557
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,429
- Ah!
- Hey.

558
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,098
- Cinderella: Ahh!
- Please, l don't have time for you now.

559
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,309
Bunch of bumpkins!

560
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,436
- Ow.
- ( turkey gobbling )

561
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,772
Wait a minute.
Why are you here?

562
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,858
- ( jackaI howIing )
- Oh, bison's horns!

563
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,152
I forgot to teII her
that the magic stops working

564
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,488
at the twelfth cry
of the jackaI.

565
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,033
Hey, what's happening
to me?

566
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,495
Oh, that rotten little shaman
and his two-bit magic.

567
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,871
( grunts )

568
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,291
- ( groans )
- Whoa!

569
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,168
No!
Please let me go.

570
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,546
You should know that l love
fine clothes,

571
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,174
jewels and refinements,
but that goes without saying.

572
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,842
Oh!

573
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,261
( both grunting )

574
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,140
- Ah!
- Felicity: Good job, my girl.

575
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,559
( grunts )

576
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,897
( groans )
Who let these lowlifes in?

577
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,941
- ( all shouting )
- Vladimir: Wait, Mother.

578
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,984
- Stop them. They've got my mother.
- Pirates: We gotta get out of here!

579
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,071
Hey, come back here!

580
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,490
Y'all follow me.

581
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,453
Mother!

582
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,289
( rifle cocking )
Give me back my royals

583
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,416
or l'll pulverize you!
( rapid gunfire )

584
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,169
( pirates yelping )

585
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,839
We must go after them.

586
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,633
There must be some way we can
stop them and get my mother back.

587
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,093
( grunts )

588
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,636
Take him to my place.

589
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,140
Felicity, you've gone
too far this time.

590
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,268
As an officer of honest folks'
good night's sIeep,

591
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,272
l must remind you of the laws
pertaining to unruIy noises.

592
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,648
( puffs )

593
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,108
Okay.

594
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,947
( Vladimir sighing )

595
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,372
( twangs )

596
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,459
( murmurs )
My princess...

597
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,921
Well, it looks like our young
prince here is gonna Iive.

598
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,133
My princess!
l have to go save my princess.

599
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,428
( laughs )
l'm afraid you can't,

600
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,973
'cause you're getting married tomorrow.
He's cute, ain't he?

601
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,641
Vladimir:
l'm getting married tomorrow?

602
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,768
ls that some kind of joke?

603
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,313
Nah, you're ours, baby.
l won you at cards.

604
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,481
( crashes )

605
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,400
Cards?

606
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,152
Mother,
what have you done?

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,655
Um, l like sports, animals,
hiking in the woods,

608
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,365
and getting caught
in a summer rain.

609
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,160
Oh, you know what l like?
l like goin' shopping,

610
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,287
real loud country music,

611
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,623
and cuddling by the fire.
( giggles )

612
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,167
This is just
one big nightmare.

613
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,002
l'm sorry, sweet ladies,

614
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,172
but my heart is already taken
by a mysterious beauty.

615
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,841
l'll marry the one
who lost this tooth for me.

616
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,177
MeIody:
He's into teeth?

617
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,429
But my most pressing need
right now

618
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,514
is to go save my mother and--

619
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,725
Hush, my prince.

620
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,645
- We're all one big family now.
- ( grunts )

621
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:16,066
You'll catch on.
We already love you.

622
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,526
- ( birds squawking )
- First mate: Amigos!

623
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,528
( all applauding )

624

Gracias, gracias.
Muchas gracias.

625
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,118
Duchess:
Vladimir? Vladimir?

626
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,288
( all laughing )

627
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,751
( rattling )

628
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,713
( gasps )
Oh!

629
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,468
Oh ho ho! Traveling under
these horrible conditions!

630
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,720
This had better be
worth it, gentlemen.

631
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,722
Uh...

632
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,849
the woman
with sickly, pale skin

633
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,228
wears big, beautifuI stones
that shine just like diamonds.

634
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,982
( Iaughs )
That's because they are diamonds.

635
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,527
You poor, ignorant miscreant
little clown.

636
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,071
( all laughing )

637
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,573
Dark Lopez will scalp your wig

638
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,909
and read the weather report
with your intestines.

639
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,620
( growls )
What's wrong with you people?

640
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,414
You're embarrassing me.

641
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,916
What do l need louts
like you for?

642
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,501
You're all savages.

643
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,128
( grunts )

644
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,131
Ah, my lady Duchess.
( laughs )

645
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,091
With whom
do l have the honor?

646
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,928
Capitán Barbazul.
But my friends call me jefe.

647
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,557
Oh ha ha!
You remind me of a distant cousin, sir--

648
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,811
- admiral of the lmperial Fleet.
- Ho ho ho! My dear Duchess,

649
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,688
we've barely met each other

650
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,940
and we're already exchanging
compIiments.

651
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,527
He was a drunk--
a disgrace to the family.

652
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,778
( all laughing )

653
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,324
You are ticklish
like a small bubble of champagne.

654
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,744
Allow me to accompany you
to your quarters. This way.

655
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,247
Why, yes, of course.
l was beginning to worry.

656
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,374
( rattling, squeaks )

657
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,502
Where is the other haIf
of my business, you idiot?

658
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,422
- Where is the prince?
- Mi capitán...

659
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,549
there was a little bit
of a complication.

660
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,135
A complication?

661
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,220
Ah.

662
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,558
Another blow from that damn Big Storm
and his irritating IittIe pest.

663
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,934
No, jefe.

664
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,520
They were there this time.
And as I toId you,

665
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,606
he's not called
Big Storm, jefe, but--

666
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,192
( gags )
he's called Little Cloud. Oh!

667
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,818
Duchess:
l'm waiting!

668
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,238
l am all yours, lady Duchess.
( laughs )

669
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,157
I want him,
you hear me?

670
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,327
lf not, you'll be eating sand
for the rest of eternity.

671
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,829
- ( grunts )
- ( moaning )

672
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:42,003
Oh, what a waste.
lt was a brand-new one.

673
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,671
Vladimir:
lt's simple.

674
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,384
You set me free, I don't marry anyone,
and you keep the ladies for yourselves.

675
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,303
Everyone wins.
Got it?

676
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,390
- Bob?
- Uh, not really.

677
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,600
Well, hmm...

678
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,357
What is that thing?

679
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,983
Uh, a violin.

680
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,780
- Huh?
- Uh, a musical instrument.

681
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,533
No?

682
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,411
Uh, a piece of wood.

683
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,371
Oh.

684
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,959
( plays lullaby )

685
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,003
( Bob smacking lips )

686
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,220
- ( music continues )
- l'm the one he wants.

687
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,223
- No.
- ( Melody snoring )

688
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,184
l'm the one.

689
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,895
l'm gonna have to remember

690
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,357
to get rid
of that stupid guitar.

691
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,569
Can't be putting up
with that every day.

692
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,197
Cinderella: We can't just
leave him there like that.

693
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,699
Little Cloud:
Whoa.

694
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,451
A squaw in Iove
is more careless

695
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,119
than a bIind chick
on the edge of a canyon.

696
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,081
- lf you say l'm in love one more time--
- ( chuckIes )

697
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,500
It's beside the point.
l'd do this for anybody.

698
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,711
( lullaby continues )

699
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,312
lf you're thinking he'll remember you,
then you might as weII forget it.

700
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,023
l don't care if he remembers me.
l am what l am.

701
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,401
So you don't want
to get married after all?

702
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,237
( laughs )
He's just kidding.

703
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,157
We'd better get a move on.
We can't stay here.

704
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,783
You?

705
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,369
Oh, it's just you.

706
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,539
- Good to see you too.
- Sorry. l took you for someone else--

707
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,958
- a young Iady.
- You trying to say l'm not one?

708
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,461
No, what l'm trying
to say is...

709
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,338
there was a young woman.
And never mind.

710
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,049
Okay, enough with all
the papoose taIk.

711
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,426
Look, we must
leave this place quickly

712
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,011
if you want to find
old "Squaw Feathers."

713
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,264
- He means your mother.
- Mm-hmm.

714
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,271
( dog barking )

715
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:13,196
"This is the reason why,
by this certified document,

716
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,909
I hereby officiaIIy appoint Capitán
lgnatius Lopez Santamaria Barbazul"--

717
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,327
that's me--

718
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,330
"as sole inheritor of my lands,

720
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,668
Humph.

721
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,421
( groaning, sighs )

722
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,006
- Eh!
- ( snake rattles )

723

"...complete fortune

- ( groans )
- Uh-oh.

725
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,349
There, all it needs
is your signature now.

726
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,184
Oh, l see.

727
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,145
And afterward,
what, may l ask,

728
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,147
do you intend to do
with me?

729
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:52,569
Afterwards?
Uh, Duchess, afterwards...

730
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,530
l'm afraid once we're finished,
I must kiII you.

731
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,198
( gasps )
No, really?

732
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,034
Please understand,
it is rather difficult

733
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,537
to inherit from someone
who is stiII aIive.

734
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,914
The paperwork alone
would be overwhelming.

735
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,791
Oh oh oh!

736
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:11,379
You pretend to be tough,
but my intuition says otherwise.

737
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,465
I know--
let's play a few hands, shall we?

738
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,758
( grumbling )

739
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,136
Let my rattlers
take care of her, jefe.

740
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,555
- ( snakes rattle )
- She'll sign that before sunrise.

741
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,808
- Oh oh oh!
- Silencio!

742
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,729
- Duchess?
- ( moans )

743
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:31,691
Duchess, it's a priviIege to have
someone of your stature aboard.

744
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,526
l will agree to postpone
your signing

745
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,737
out of respect
for your royal person-ness.

746
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,780
Oh, you are too kind.

747
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,034
Tell me, sir, would you please ask
your manservant there

748
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,411
to fetch me a nice pot
of sarsaparilla?

749
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,581
( groans )
His manservant?

750
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,793
l am Dark Lopez the Bandit!
Son of Carbon XlV the Nefarious!

751
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,920
- l have--
- You heard what the lady said.

752
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,881
Go and find her
some sarsaparilla.

753
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,093
Go to Hades and back
if necessary.

754
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:04,140
( violin whines )

755
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,603
Helping a stranger
like you're doing with me--

756
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,938
it's so rare.

757
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,192
- lt's-- it's magical. Oh!
- ( ostrich moans )

758
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,278
I reaIIy don't want
to seem ungrateful, old man,

759
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,947
but couId you possibIy
give me back my violin?

760
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,283
- No.
- Okay. l see.

761
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,451
( violin whines )

762
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,620
Could you please play
a little more gently then?

763
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,705
- It's fragiIe.
- ( scraping )

764
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,749
- ( ostrich honks )
- Ahh!

765
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,710
( laughs )

766
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,505
F-sharp is always a little bit
awkward for me.

767
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,674
l'm happy to entertain,

768
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,801
but my heart's
not really into it.

769
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:44,305
No, my mother has been abducted
by dangerous, IawIess bandits,

770
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,101
and I myseIf bareIy escaped
the horror of a shotgun marriage

771
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,395
aII to be stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere

772
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,314
with a tone-deaf lndian
and a pigtailed cowgirl.

773
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,317
What?
Did he say "pigtailed cowgirl"?

774
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,987
Ah, sorry, I seem to have
forgotten myself. lt's the stress.

775
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,032
We pull him from Felicity's claws,
offer to save his mother,

776
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,784
and this is the thanks we get?

777
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,537
The sign of the scorpion
never touches the royal pony.

778
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,956
Or is it the sign of the horse?
l can never remember.

779
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:14,043
WeII, if he thinks he's so cIever,
he can go save his duchess by himself.

780
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,336
- Chicken!
- Chicken?

781
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,006
My ancestors were proud conquerors.
I Iaugh at the smeII of danger.

782
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,341
( laughs )

783
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,177
Without question, Cinderella,
your prince has cIass.

784
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,887
He's not my prince.

785
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,017
( Bobs snoring )

786
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,061
Uh...

787
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,313
Oh, my prince!

788
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,357
( grunting )

789
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,944
Where's my prince?

790
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:48,703
Make me forget that l should
smash you both like the bugs you are.

791
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,204
We'll find him, my darlings.

792
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:54,417
He's our son,
our sweet cream icing,

793
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,836
our hot cherry turnover.

794
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,433
Heads up, Ma!

795
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,102
- Should we go left or right?
- Straight ahead!

796
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,773
- ( grunts )
- ( girls scream )

797
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,319
Come on, gallop faster,
you overgrown imbeciles!

798
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,863
( laughing dumbly )

799
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,244
( violin whines )

800
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,415
- ( ostrich groans )
- ( grunts )

801
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,292
( grunts )

802
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,755
This animaI
is just unmanageable.

803
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,217
Sometimes the F-sharp
is a little bit awkward.

804
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,761
Need a hand, Prince?

805
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,304
Ah.

806
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,098
Uh, thank you, Cinderella.

807
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,017
LittIe CIoud,
could you please stop playing?

808
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,269
You're torturing my poor ostrich.
Can't you see that?

809
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,315
Oh, brother, here you go.
lt's a Stradivarius knockoff

810
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,359
made from really cheap wood,
if you ask me.

811
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,153
( chuckIes )
Strings made in the South Pole.

812
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,863
Your violin is a piece of dung.

813
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,408
lf you please, old man, l do not intend
to discuss this with you, aII right?

814
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,828
Your violin looks like a drum.

815
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,957
Little Cloud is quite unique.

816
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,959
You've known him a long time,
l gather?

817
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,253
Since forever.
He's my guardian.

818
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,506
Mmm. lt's important to have friends
you can reIy on.

819
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,050
So do you have a sweetheart?

820
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,428
Um, well, l don't know.

821
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,390
That'II depend
on a lot of things.

822
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,351
Ah, it seems l've hit
a sore spot.

823
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,228
( distant squawking )

824
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,939
Whoa.

825
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,526
This looks like a perfect place
for us to rest for the night

826
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,863
before we head into Barbazul's
territory.

827
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,740
And l hope the soothing darkness
of night

828
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,952
wiII give some courage
to my little Blind Chick.

829
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,913
BIind Chick
is your nickname?

830
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,916
- Why? Got a problem with that?
- Not at all.

831
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,627
A blind chick is very cute

832
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,088
and quite easy to catch.

833
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,513
Duchess:
Ah! Full house.

834
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,975
( groans )
The fates are against me.

835
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,769
First it's that Mad Storm
and his annoying little pest.

836
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,730
And now a duchess
who aIways wins!

837
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,940
Oh ho ho ho!

838
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,819
They say unlucky at cards
means Iucky in Iove.

839
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,279
( footsteps approaching )

840
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,830
This isn't what l usually eat.
What is it?

841
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:42,084
l gave your manservant a recipe
for a fine omeIet.

842
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,129
It's made
Princess-of-Tuscany style.

843
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,006
An omelet?

844
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,638
Ha, my lady Duchess, it's a marvel!
A triumph!

845
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,973
lt's a total catastrophe.

846
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,059
You put too much
nutmeg in it.

847
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,270
That's right!
There's way too much nutmeg in this.

848
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,772
What were you thinking,
you imbeciIe?

849
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,857
Don't you even know
how to make a simple omelet?

850
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,485
Start over! Go on!

851
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,404
HonestIy, I just don't know
what to do with him anymore.

852
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,449
Perhaps you might try
imposing a IittIe...

853
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,035
hard-nosed discipline.

854
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,207
- ( thumping )
- Ahh!

855
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,086
( groans )

856
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,297
( laughs )

857
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,800
- How was that, huh?
- Not bad.

858
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,179
I think perhaps
a little bit too nice.

859
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,098
Too nice?!

860
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,141
We'll see how nice l am

861
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,477
when l lay my hands on your son,
Duchess.

862
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,189
lt'll be your signature on the paper
or his head in my hand.

863
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,942
And we'll see
if you think l'm nice then.

864
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,653
Oh ho ho ho ho!
My son?

865
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,156
But my dear friend,
my son will cut you to pieces.

866
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,200
Bring the next dish!

867
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,828
( groans )

868
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,959
Vulture sashimi
filleted and cold-wrapped,

869
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:09,255
in fresh-cut green beans picked
from the garden this very morning.

870
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,132
( snarls )

871
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,020
( gulps )

872
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,356
LittIe CIoud,
l congratulate you.

873
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,151
This little impromptu shish kabab
is wonderfuI.

874
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,822
Oh, yes, my friend. Country rats
are always better than city ones.

875
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,158
- Ugh!
- ( Cinderella laughs )

876
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,788
Beautiful night.

877
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,125
MoonIight is ideaI
for opening hearts.

878
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,628
- You think?
- Yes, l do.

879
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,841
Don't you worry, Prince.

880
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,052
We will get
your mother back.

881
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,388
I'm not too worried.
l've got one feisty mother.

882
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,016
It's reaIIy those bandits
who should be worried.

883
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,893
Then what's
eating you, huh?

884
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,438
Oh, weII,
l guess l can tell you.

885
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,648
Last night at the ball,
I had a reveIation.

886
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,150
Uh, what do you mean?

887
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,445
Last night l fell, Cinderella--
fell in love

888
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,656
with a girl so beautiful
she makes the stars blush.

889
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,242
Everything about her
exudes feminine perfection,

890
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,079
incomparabIe grace--
charming and quite slim.

891
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,707
A bit like you, really,
except she's--

892
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,793
Oh, you should have
seen her in action.

893
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,713
Speaking of which-- ha ha--
this is her tooth.

894
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,925
She lost it while bravely fighting
the intruders by my side.

895
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,552
And afterwards, she disappeared.

896
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,764
- Um, about the tooth...
- Yes?

897
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,016
A lifelong commitment
because of a tooth--

898
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,060
does that really make sense?

899
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:50,397
Well, it's not glamorous, but...

900
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,984
Well, forget your toothless princess.
There are Iots of princesses,

901
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,862
- some of them pigtailed.
- l love pigtails.

902
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:02,034
Hey, Vladimir, look around you
with your heart.

903
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,412
( laughs )
Are you talking about you?

904
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,456
No, l'm talking about Felicity--

905
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,959
a huge princess
and no pigtails.

906
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,254
Excuse me, Cinderella.
You're so nice.

907
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,840
l mean it.

908
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,761
( violin playing )

909
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,309
Hmm, l smell bad vibes.

910
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,147
l don't think he's into
pigtaiIed cowgirIs.

911
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,857
'Night.

912
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,614
- ( music continues )
- Felicity: Cinderella.

913
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,324
( girls sobbing )

914
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,951
Smoke that
little vermin good.

915
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,413
Oh, this music
is so romantic.

916
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,250
- What are you waiting for?
- ( sobbing )

917
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,003
l can't do it...

918
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,630
because of the prince's
piece of wood.

919
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,300
Oh, give me that,
you idiot.

920
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,012
( bullets whistle )

921
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,347
CindereIIa:
Take cover!

922
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,856
Get in the wagon.
We'll crush 'em with it.

923
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,316
lt'll be cleaner that way.

924
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,152
lt is said that where
the bear can slip through,

925
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,363
the tiny mouse cannot.
No, wait, it's the opposite.

926
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,033
Anyway, follow me!

927
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:38,047
So what do tiny mice do now?

928
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,882
l'm not really sure.

929
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,593
l should consult my peace pipe
when l can.

930
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,429
Any bright ideas,
Your Serene Highness?

931
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,224
Uh, parry and thrust,
charge with gusto?

932
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,517
- I am stiII thinking.
- Okay, so it's up to me.

933
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,561
You two keep going!

934
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:04,531
Hey, Felicity, did you lose your prince?
Too bad!

935
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,992
Guess he didn't want a big bag
of mashed potatoes like you

936
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,453
- for a mother-in-law!
- ( grunts )

937
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,747
- ( bomb whistling )
- Hyah!

938
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,339
( gasps )
Cinderella really dressed you down, Ma.

939
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,258
That's just not right.

940
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,260
Get her!

941
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,554
Get that little vermin!
( growIs )

942
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,934
- ldiots, can't you go any faster?
- Both: Yeah!

943
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,480
- Felicity: Hey! Ah-hh!
- ( gunfire rattIing )

944
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,651
Let's fall back now!

945
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,902
( grunting )

946
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,530
Hey, stop!
You hear me? Stop!

947
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,324
( grunts )
What are you doing?

948
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,993
All right, make music!

949
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,205
- ( vioIin scrapes )

950
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,292
( all yell )

951
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,089
( Little Cloud laughing )

952
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,674
Like l keep saying,

953
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,802
F-sharp is aIways
a little bit awkward.

954
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,971
( laughs )

955
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,312
( Harmony grunting )

956
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,482
( Felicity yelling )
CindereIIa!

957
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,610
( grunts )

958
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,742
- Ah-hh!
- Ah!

959
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,328
That was great.
Very tasty.

960
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,040
Ah, it's pretty good,
this sarsaparilla.

961
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,709
- The duchess knows her stuff.
- Yeah.

962
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,129
- This is fair trade, no?
- DefiniteIy.

963
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,427
( whispering )
Barbazul's men are close by.

964
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,473
We must be cautious as the beaver
and silent as the earthworm.

965
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,974
Doo doo doo doo!

966
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,602
My, it's truly magnificent here.

967
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,314
Or as my princess
would say, "Wow!"

968
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,485
Hey, what is it, champ?
You see something over there?

969
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:08,155
Never speak again
unless you want to get us all shot.

970
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,200
And enough about that princess.
It's getting reaIIy oId.

971
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,744
- Pardon?
- "Wow!"

972
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,247
- Your princess sounds ridiculous.
- Listen, I wiII not permit you to--

973
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,250
Shh.
Silent as the earthworm, remember?

974
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,629
Do you hear that, Little Cloud?
And where was your little dancer

975
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,215
when FeIicity
was putting her claws into you?

976
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,384
And who was saving your skin
making you shut up

977
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,553
when you were screaming like some
Iunatic when you needed to be siI--

978
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,847
Silent as the worm.

979
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,850
And cautious as the beaver.

980
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,644
( birds singing )

981
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,437
( squawking )

982
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,482
Hyah!

983
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,151
Little Cloud:
Hide! Quickly as you can!

984
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,614
Cinderella:
Hyah!

985
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,421
Oof!

986
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,431
Argh!

987
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,103
Hey, Cinderella!

988
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,276
( screeching )

989
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,626
( garbled shouting )

990
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,468
( fly buzzing )

991
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,021
Okay...

992
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,106
Okay.

993
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,319
- Okay.
- Huh?

994
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,949
Everybody do
as the old shaman does.

995
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,660
Okay, come along now.

996
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,220
( grunts )

997
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,057
Go, go, go, go, go!

998
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,558
Go!

999
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,110
And now we go.

1000
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,997
( grunts )

1001
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,378
Come on, Prince.
Let's go.

1002
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,879
Thanks, little cowgirl.

1003
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,549
Aw, forget it,
Prince Blah-Blah Whatever.

1004
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,611
Hey!
Look over there.

1005
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,281
lt's a big cave.
Let's go.

1006
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,909
( humming )

1007
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,745
Hey, can't you ever
stop goofing off?

1008
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,999
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

1009
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,750
( rumbles )

1010
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,550
( bird squawking )

1011
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,052
Follow the old shaman. Hurry!

1012
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,929
( Little Cloud laughing )

1013
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,978
( grunting )
Ah!

1014
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,606
Ooh-ow!
That's prickly.

1015
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,734
Hey, Ma, can we
take a breather?

1016
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:17,613
Nah! We ain't stopping
till we find our little prince

1017
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,073
and the filthy vermin
who helped him.

1018
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,827
Hope that heat didn't get him
and bake his brain.

1019
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,955
Those fools should have never
Iet him out of that room

1020
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,749
without his little hat.

1021
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:32,377
- ( grunts )
- Move it, you big ugly beast!

1022
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,339
( Bob laughs )

1023
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,861
This is for you, Cinderella.

1024
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,416
Why have you helped me
like this, Cinderella,

1025
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,543
with all the risks
and dangers involved?

1026
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,295
What do you think?

1027
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,631
l don't know.

1028
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,800
You're kind of an angel--

1029
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,886
an angeI
fallen from heaven.

1030
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,432
- Cinderella?
- Yes?

1031
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,061
- Would you smile for me?
- What for?

1032
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,688
Because l need to know.

1033
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:37,025
And if for once you say that me,
Cinderella,

1034
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,945
- am this princess of your dreams--
- Huh?

1035
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,281
No more lovey-dovey talk!
We've got a probIem.

1036
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,575
We'll soon be leaving
the beIIy of the earth

1037
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,869
and not in a good way.
Hang on!

1038
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,371
( all shouting )

1039
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,958
Hold on like a mouse
to a baby's skuII!

1040
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,670
( both screaming )

1041
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,633
( squawking )

1042
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,886
( Cinderella grunts )

1043
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,726
WeII, then,
considering where l am,

1044
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,187
it seems the great shaman's journey
ends here.

1045
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,314
( bird squawks )

1046
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,079
Bueno!
Jefe will be very happy

1047
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,457
when I bring to him
this excellent news.

1048
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:38,253
Ow! Ah, jefe!
lf you would just listen--

1049
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,758
Disturbing me while l'm making
macaroons for the duchess.

1050
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,468
l ought to hang you.

1051
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,679
But, jefe, on the deck!
Look, you'll see!

1052
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,016
l was right in the middle of preparing
the custard-- the most important part.

1053
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,684
- Ahh!
- ( grunts )

1054
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,437
( grunting )

1055
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,817
Barbazul:
Bueno!

1056
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,862
Now we can finally get down
to the business at hand.

1057
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,406
( laughs )
Go and get the duchess.

1058
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,825
Yi-ii!

1059
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,536
Here is your sombrero, jefe.

1060
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,873
- Oh! Madre de Dios!
- ( garbled groaning )

1061
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,668
I toId you to never
let that little pest on board.

1062
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:22,422
Now that she's here,
Big Storm can't be far away.

1063
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,801
Not Big Storm, jefe.
His name is Little--

1064
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:26,968
Ah!

1065
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,096
Welcome. We've been
impatiently waiting for you.

1066
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,098
l'm so glad to see you
aboard my ship.

1067
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,476
- You are too kind.
- ( Cinderella grunts )

1068
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,852
Ah!

1069
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,524
How l hate that infuriating little pest.
Tie her up right away!

1070
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,734
You may wish to be
a bit more respectful to her.

1071
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,861
She might summon
Big Storm after aII.

1072
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,280
Believe me,
that would be a bad idea.

1073
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:51,326
Vladimir!
You've finally come!

1074
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,745
Just in time to have tea.

1075
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,997
Well, not exactly a proper tea,

1076
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,124


since someone
who will remain nameless

1077
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:01,336
walked away and didn't finish
making the macaroons!

1078
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,754
( laughs )

1079
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,841
Lady Duchess,
that no longer matters,

1080
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,177
for l regret to inform you
that teatime has been canceled.

1081
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,388
Mother,
you are incomparable.

1082
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,056
Oh!

1083
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,309
l see you've brought someone along
to keep you company.

1084
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,062
Now who is this charming
little pigtailed cowgirl?

1085
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,189
( garbled )
Jeez, it must run in the family.

1086
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,234
- Her name is Cinderella.
- Hmm, she's a big pest.

1087
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,695
Thanks to her, we're here.
You have no idea the many dangers

1088
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,238
her and l have faced
together.

1089
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,032
Why didn't you call us?
We would have rushed to your aid.

1090
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,951
lsn't that right, Barba?

1091
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,870
( grunts )
This one to the mast,

1092
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,913
secureIy attached
so she can't get away.

1093
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,707
Andale!

1094
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,709
lf my princess could be here,

1095
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,711
she wouId beat
these little bandits up.

1096
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,254
CindereIIa:
Hmm hmm hmm !

1097
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,339
Enough of this!

1098
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,551
The time has come
to sign the paper, Duchess.

1099
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,721
Oh ho ho ho ho!
My poor friend,

1100
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,640
you actually believe my son
wiII Iet you do that?

1101
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,601
( laughs )

1102
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,562
( grunts )

1103
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,524
Ah! WeII,
unfortunately, Mother,

1104
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,776
l just might disappoint you
this time.

1105
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,073
( grunting )

1106
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,909
Barbazul:
Listen to me, Duchess,

1107
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,537
on this ship, when you dive,
you do not return aIive.

1108
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,582
Oh, l see.
You're making threats now?

1109
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,002
l am so disappointed in you.
l mean, really now.

1110
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,504
l never imagined so petty.

1111
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,841
( growls )

1112
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,928

- Whoa ho! Ahh!

1113
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,889
Whoa-ah!

1114
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,892
Whoa-aa!

1115
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:42,520
Everyone to your stations.
Prepare for combat, on the double!

( birds squawking )

1120
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,627
Be sure not to do anything
to my prince, you idiot.

1121
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,087
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1122
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,257

( moaning )

1124
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,184
Felicity, you little witch!

1125
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:25,271
Get them immediately!
Make macaroons of them. Hurry!

1126

Duchess:
Oh!

1129
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,759
Jefe, we are done for!

1130
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,929
Keep bailing,
you useless bunch of idiots!

1131
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,097
You're worthless.

1132
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,057
l'm so sorry, jefe.

1133
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,851
l'll go grab your Parmesan.

1134
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:07,022
- And l will go get the nutmeg.
- Jefe? Jefe?

1135
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,441
We are out of sarsaparilla.

( Duchess laughing )

1137
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,827
Hyah!

( grunting )

1139
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,218
Barbazul:
Deserters! Cowards! Sheep!

1140
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,803
Get back here!

1141
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,681
How dare you abandon ship
right in the middle of a battle?

1142
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,225
l'll skin
every one of you alive!

1143
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,811
Excuse me, but l believe
I can definiteIy say

1144
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,772
with a boldness that even
amazes me

1145
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,149
that you wiII not be
skinning anyone alive.

1146
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,069
( grunts )

1147
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:58,490
Bueno, then l'll have to settle
for shortening your line of succession.

1148
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:01,659
Do not worry, my princess.
l'm coming.

1149
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,371
- Hyah!
- Ha ha.

1150
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,959
You can try to escape,

1151
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:13,004
but that's not going to happen.
l'm going to cut you into pieces!

1152
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:16,257
( grunts )
Then l'm going to feed you

1153
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,134
to the fishes!

1154
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,844
Ha ha! Got you.

1155
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,180
You know,
just between you and me,

1156
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,891
l prefer you
to the one at the ball.

1157
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,976
( Cinderella grunts )

1158
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,604
l'm gonna take you apart!

1159
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,981
Oh!

1160
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:34,025
l'll squash you...

1161
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,444
like a tiny little bug!

1162
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,988
( grunts )

1163
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,657
Oof!

1164
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:45,036
Believe me, l know Vladimir.
There are some looks that cannot lie.

1165
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,746
Mother, please,

1166
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,457
it's very hard to concentrate
with you talking on incessantly.

1167
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,127
Sí. I am sorry,
but l must agree.

1168
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,380
What l am doing here
is muy importante.

1169
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,382
Excuse me, my dears.

1170
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,676
Carry on. We'll just watch.

1171
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,053
- ( grunting )
- ( laughing )

1172
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,514
- Huh? Huh?
- Ahh!

1173
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,851
Olé!

1174
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,064
( Harmony moans )

1175
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,283
Ahh!

1176
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,910
- Huh?
- ( blasts )

1177
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,831
Duchess:
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1178
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,876
- Oh!
- ( grunts )

1179
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:36,171
( garbIed )
Ah, no, no, no!

1180
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,380
Oh!

1181
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,340
Thank you.

1182
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:43,344
Enough of all this kidding around.
Duchess, you must sign now.

1183
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:47,307
You sound Iike a broken record.
lt's getting quite tiresome, you know.

1184
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,602
No offense, but l really think
you should strongly consider

1185
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,104
- a new line of work.
- ( grunts )

1186
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,315
Oh! What is happening?

1187
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:58,359
But then again,
who am l to say?

1188
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:02,697
- You certainly are original.
- ( Barbazul grunting )

1189
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,868
Thank you again
for being so decisive,

1190
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,204
but about this tooth l have--

1191
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,623
can l please have a smile?

1192
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,501
- You never give up, do you?
- ( gunfire popping )

1193
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,712
l'm wondering,
Your Grace...

1194
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,548
Your girlfriends
were missing you.

1195
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,009
You didn't feeI
welcome enough with us,

1196
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,220
so you decided
to see the country?

1197
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,388
Right, we certainly do have
a lot to talk about.

1198
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,973
But for the moment,
this vessel is sinking,

1199
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,600
so it's not really the time or--

1200
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:34,103
Wrong! We'll pick things up
right where we Ieft off.

1201
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,315
Now you're aII ours.
Bring me the captain.

1202
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,111
FeIicity:
And you, nasty little beast,

1203
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,697
wait till you see what l have
in store for you.

1204
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:47,992
- Right, darIings?
- Yeah, it's gonna be the best.

1205
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,745
First up, we're gonna scratch your eyes
right out of your head.

1206
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,206
Second, we're gonna cut off
one of your Iegs.

1207
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,041
It'II be too funny
to see you limping.

1208
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,502
And third, we're not sure,
but we'll think of something.

1209
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,797
( grunting )

1210
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,640
Ah!

Come on!

( laughs )

1213
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:21,359
But, Felicity, there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

1214
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,653
CIam up!
You're the captain, right?

1215
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:27,490
You can marry people, right?
So marry us.

1216
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,242
Both:
Uh, yeah!

1217
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,619
But this is crazy, Ma.

1218
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,706
He's mine, girls.
lt's my turn.

1219
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,000
l'm gonna be a princess.
Y'all hear me?

1220
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,628
Maybe we'll make you two
a IittIe brother.

1221
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,046
Right, Prince?

1222
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:45,466
Well, l am certainly honored by your
proposaI, but I reaIIy don't think so.

1223
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,470
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it.

1224
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,473
We are gathered here together
to celebrate the marriage--

1225
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,641
Skip that.

1226
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,144
Prince, do you take Felicity here
as your IawfuI--

1227

- No!
- Bobs: Yeah, yeah!

1228
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:58,604
They said yes. Move on.

1229
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:02,692
FeIicity, do you take
this Prince Vladimir here

1230
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,862
to be your lawful wedded husband

FeIicity:
Help me! l can't get up! Help!

1237
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,230
Mother, watch out.

( Cinderella grunting )

1239

Hold on.
Grab my hand.

1240
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,865
Don't go near him,
you IittIe monster.

l won him fair.
He's mine.

1242
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,373
- Prince!
- Just give me your hand.

1243
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,707
Come on.

Major heads up, Ma!

1246
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,509
Super major heads up, Ma!

1247

My prince!
You're supposed to be mine.

- Not afraid?
- Afraid?

l do not want to rush you, but--

1256
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,472

Oh! Who's that strange person?

Hop on!
Hurry, come on.

You mean we're going
without jefe Barbazul?

1262

And who is this strangely dressed,
smelly old man?

1263
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,202
Whoa. Even a flower must wait
for the rain to bathe.

1264
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,871
Oh! No offense.

1265
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,498
( boat creaking )

1266
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,876
- The tooth!
- Cinderella: The tooth?

1267
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,461
Please come on!

1268
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,422
Oh, of all the stupid
wiId-goose chases.

1269
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,965
- Go on.
- No.

1270
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,301
When the mother hen sees
the fragiIe chick in danger,

1271
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,136
does she Ieave,
or does she stay?

1272
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,347
Exactly!

1273
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:40,892
Mother hen is really cheeky!

1274
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,438
( coughing )

1275
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,316
( fire crackling )

1276
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,068
Would you stop?
This is pointless.

1277
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,572
lt's me.

1278
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,407
l've known that for a while.

1279
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,743
I thought you'd Iike
to have all your teeth

1280
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,287
to eat our wedding cake.

1281
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,333
( sizzling )

1282
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:14,675
- Little Cloud: Oh oh oh!
- Vladimir!

1283
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,594
Oh, Cinderella.

1284
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,597
Yee-hah!

1285
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:27,188
Duchess: You're a tyrant!
A rogue assassin.

1286
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,942
You almost made me fall over
and die of grief!

1287
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,489
Ah, finally, Prince,

1288
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:39,200
l'll be your princess.

1289
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,161
Oh ho!
( spits )

1290
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,206
( both laugh )

1291
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,967
LittIe CIoud:
Now, many moons have passed.

1292
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:59,512
People have erased Felicity
from their memories,

1293
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,140
and life has returned
to its natural course.

1294
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,725
As for Cinderella,

1295
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,186
l think she's found
her Prince Charming.

1296
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,815
Nice guy--
horrible musician, but nice.

1297
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,317
And l kept my promise.

1298
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:17,321
As for the little ones, they'll just
have to get along without me.

1299
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,408
- ( steam hissing )
- ( bell ringing )

1300
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,335
( whistle squealing )

1301
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,848
l'm afraid l'm not one
for long goodbyes.

1302
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,642
l hope they won't be
too angry.

1303
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,690
( violin scrapes )

1304
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,609
( ostrich grunts )

1305
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,487
Eh.
( chuckles )

1306
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:02,575
But what is certain--
l will miss them both.

1307
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,678
( train whistle squeals )

1308
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,308
( mariachi music playing )

1309
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:50,081
Ho. Oh...

1310
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,166
What horrid cards.

1311
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,294
And presto! Oh!

1312
01:17:55,462 --> 01:18:00,299
Ah, my dear Duchess,
it is a pleasure to see you again.

1313
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,759
Oh!

1314
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,136
Jefe Barbazul!

1315
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,722
Ha. Why don't we talk
a little business?

1316
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,725
Oh! Oh-hh!

1317
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,770
( grunts )
What is it? What's wrong, my dear?

1318
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,940
Speak to me.
Santa María, Madre de Dios!

1319
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,151
Oh! I'm such
a horrible monster.

1320
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:21,070
Such a mindless brute.

1321
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,198
Oh, my Duchess, please,
you can't do this to me.

1322
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,827
l've gone through sand and fire
to find you once again.

1323
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,205
l-- l think of you every second
of the day.

1324
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,958
Who cares
about that ridiculous will?

1325
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,211
It's-- it's you
that l really want.

1326
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,339
Santa María!
Madre de Dios!

1327
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:43,008
Quickly,
bring me the salts,

1328
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,137


some ammonia
and sarsaparilla!

1329
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:48,264
♪ Un, dos, tres... ♪

1330
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:51,934
( singing in Spanish )
