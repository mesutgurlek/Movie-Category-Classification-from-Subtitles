[Chuckling] Oh!

151
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:50,018
How'd everything go up there?
I still serve the best
coffee in Bottleneck!

152
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,081
What'd Keogh have
on his mind?

153
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,720
Oh, he was just getting
a little curious about
that real estate business!

154
00:11:56,796 --> 00:12:00,596
I think I'll have
to buy myself an option
on his curiosity!

155
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,531
[Gunshots]

156
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:08,140
I think you'll
have to buy yourself
a whole new sheriff!

157
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,175
If you can find one!

158
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,246
What are ya doing?
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

159
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,187
What's the matter with you?
Oh, Miss Frenchy, I was
just tryin' to shut out!!!

160
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,851
The boomin' and the bangin'
of them there pop guns!

161
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,622
What do you expect
in a town like this?
I expect I's gonna remain!!!

162
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:33,324
A mass
of quiverin' flesh!
[Thudding]

163
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,663
What's comin' up,
a new gold rush?

164
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,067
We never got anything
like that in New Orleans!

165
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:41,595
Maybe so, maybe so,
but it was a heap
more peaceful!

166
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:46,373
I'd like to sink my
chattering teeth in some
good ol' Louisiana oysters!

167
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:50,177
Here, sink your teeth Into this!
Maybe that will stop the chattering!

168
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,412
Oh, it will help!
Thanks!
[Knock At Door]

169
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,580
- Come in!
- They're waitin'
for ya, Frenchy!

170
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,853
The longer they wait,
the better they like it!

171
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:03,453
[Applause, Cheering]

172
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:11,101
 All I do
is dine with 'em 

173
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,937
 And split a pint
of wine with 'em 

174
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:20,877
 Respectable as can be 

175
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:26,977
 Yet here's what
they say to me 

176
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:30,580
 You've got that look 

177
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:34,114
 That look that
leaves me weak 

178
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:38,960
 You with your eyes
across the table technique 

179
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:42,364
 You've got that look 

180
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,802
 That look between the lines 

181
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:50,900
 You with your let's get
more than friendly designs 

182
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,741
턎 should be brave and say 

183
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,304
 Let's have no more of it 

184
00:13:56,382 --> 00:14:01,445
 But oh, what's the use
when you know 

185
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:05,617
 I love it 

186
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:10,628
 You'll only kill my will

 Before I speak 

188
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,757
 So turn on
that low left hook 

189
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,894
 That look that
leaves me weak

 You've got that look

 That look that
leaves me weak

 I love it

Whoopee!

201

 You'll only kill my will
before I speak

[Cheering Continues]

206
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,037
Quiet! Shut up!

207
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,442
Folks, an important
announcement by our mayor,

208
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,811
the honorable Hiram J! Slade!

209
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,519
Fellow citizens,

210
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:46,490
our esteemed sheriff,
Mr! Joseph Keogh,

211
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,223
has been suddenly
called out of town
on urgent business!

212
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,458
He'll be gone permanent!

213
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,491
[Man] Yippee!
So it becomes necessary for
me to appoint somebody!!!

214
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,131
To fill out
the unexpired term!

215
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:05,075
Therefore, with the power
conferred on me!!!

216
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,011
By statute number 85-E,

and other statutes
thereunto appertainin',

I do hereby appoint
to the post of sheriff...

219
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,447
that paragon of courage,

220
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,549
that credit
to his community,

221

and you drink 'em down!

I set 'em up
and you drink 'em down!

236

This is getting
monotonous!

237
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,309

drinking to yourself?

the sheriff?

Well, sure, you are!
Then I am off the liquor!

245
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:14,735
A man has gotta choose
between the bottle
and the badge!

00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,708
[Laughter, Cheering]

Why, he didn't say that...
or did he?

Laugh, you fools!

249
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:33,982
I'm tellin' ya this town
of Bottleneck has gotta
respect law and order,

250
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,152
or I'll put
everybody in jail!

00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,162
[Laughing]

252

Now you can see why I chose
such a strong-minded man!

00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:47,163
[Laughter]
We're all with ya, Sheriff!

254
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,731
If you need any help,
I'll be your deputy!
No need to bother!

255
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,268
I want a deputy like I was
when Destry was my boss!

256
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:59,181
Why, we handled a much
tougher and ornery a crowd
than I see present!

257
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:02,379
Why, when we started shootin',
they ran outta town so fast,

258
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:06,255
the breeze from their coattails
set off a sizeable windmill!

259
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,259
[Laughter]

260
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,421
But Destry is dead!
That makes him
the right man for the job!

261
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,864
Saves us
a lot of trouble!
Is that so?

262
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,926
Well, young Tom ain't dead,
and his father brought him up!!!

263
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:21,871
To be the toughest
and fightinest man that
ever growed up in the west!

264
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:26,878
He ain't got as big
a name as his pa,
but he cleaned up Tombstone!

265
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:30,609
And I'm sendin' for him
to be my deputy!

266
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,174
And when he gets here!!!

267
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,243
Destry will ride again!

268
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,255
[Laughter]

269
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,945
Hey, driver, how many times
do I have to tell you!!!

270
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:09,681
To take it easy
on those bumps?
I got a schedule to keep!

271
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,747
Pull in your neck!
I'll pull a neck in,
but it won't be mine!

272
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,089
[Laughing]

273
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,863
You just wait 'til
we get to a stop!

274
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,060
[Woman] Oh, Jack,
leave the driver alone.

275
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,161
Trip's almost over!
I don't mind the bumps!

276
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:29,639
I do! If he
don't take it easy,
I'll blow his head off!

277
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,199
Please don't mind
my brother, Mr. Destry.

278
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,509
He's always threatening
to blow people's heads off.

279
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:38,812
I had a friend once!
His name was Stubbs!

280
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:43,048
He was always goin' around
threatenin' to blow
people's heads off!

281
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,649
One day, a fella came along
and took him up on it!
Well?

282
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:51,219
Well, folks say that
now Stubbs' forehead!!!

283
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:55,324
Is holdin' up
the prettiest tombstone
in Green Lawn Cemetery!

284
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,426
Very funny.

285
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,199
I been handlin' cattle
around these parts
for quite a spell!!!

286
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,206
And met some
of the toughest
hombres they got,

287
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,504
and I'm still here.

288
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,704
This ain't no ornament!

289
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,270
Pretty good with it!

290
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,373
So was Stubbs!

291
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,680
Meaning just
exactly what?

292
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:17,654
Well, I just mean
you gotta be careful
who you meet up with!

293
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,887
You know, you got some
pretty peculiar ideas
for a deputy sheriff!

294
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,987
- But they make sense!
- Oh, so I'm supposed
to ride!!!

295
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:28,056
In this confounded
contraption gettin'
bumped around like this!!!

296
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:33,036
And grin like a baboon!
Well, maybe you should take up
a hobby, like me!

297
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,802
You'd be surprised
the genuine rage
you can work off!!!

298
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,400
Just by carving
a little piece of wood!

299
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,503
Are you sure
your name is Destry?

300
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,819
Folks is always
askin' me that!

 LittleJoe 

304
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,972
 Whatever happened to him,
I don't know 떰

305
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,305
Hey, boss, stage is a-comin'!

306
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,476
How far away?
On the upper ridge.

307
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,644
Oh, doggone it, doggone it!

308
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,654
Come here!

309
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,747
Gimme a hand!

310
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:28,122
Is Destry really comin'?
You're darn tootin' he is,

311
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,889
and when he gets here,
there will be a lot
of folks a-goin'!

312
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,954
Come on! Put that
chair in place!

313
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,592
Here! There's
a nickel for ya!

314
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:39,297
Jiminy, Wash!
You look like a real sheriff!

315
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:43,000
[Laughs] I ain't
got time to argue!

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,678
Lily Belle? Lily Belle?

318
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:50,840
What you want?
Coach is comin'!
Destry will be here any minute!

319
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,214
I ain't half finished his room yet!
Where's Callahan?

320
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,152
- Maybe he's in the saloon!
- Maybe? More than likely!

321
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,815
When you see that no-good
Russian lummox, tell him
to get over here!

322
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,189
I'll tell him!
I'll tell him!
Callahan!

323
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,228
Callahan!

324
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,862
How much have
you got left?

325
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:10,231
I tap you, Callahan!
Please, Frenchy!
I am not Callahan!

326
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:13,635
Callahan was my wife's
first husband, and he's dead!

327
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:16,732
I am Boris Alexanderovich
Stavrogin, and I like to be
called by my name!

328
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,472
All right, Callahan,
what do you do?
Deal!

329
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:25,007
King! Ace!
Can you beat it?
Is my credit good?

330
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:28,451
No, no, not this time!
Oh, please, Frenchy!

331
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,954
Still want to bet, huh?
Uh-huh!

332
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,287
All right!

333
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,292
Thirty bucks
against your pants!

334
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,261
My pants? Oh, no!

335
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,197
Thirty bucks, huh?
Mm-hmm!

336
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:44,429
My pants! Thirty bucks!

337
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,836
Yee-ha-ha!
Here he comes, folks!

338
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:51,672
Stagecoach comin'
around the bend!
Get ready, everybody!

339
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:55,145
Come on! Destry will be
here any minute! Kent,
you better prepare yourself!

340
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:58,411
You're gonna meet a man!
Callahan! Callahan!

341
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:02,215
Scoot on home!
Lily Belle's lookin' for you!

342
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,949
I'll be right back,
Frenchy!
Oh, I won't be here then!

343
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,821
Then we can call it all off!
No, no, no! You make up
your mind right now!

344
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,726
Oh! Oh, what to do,
what to do!

345
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:13,788
If I leave, I probably
could have won the pot
and if I stay, I might lose it,

346
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:16,630
and if I don't go
and help with the baggage,
my wife will skin me alive!

347
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:18,636
Oh, your wife will
skin you alive anyway!

348
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:21,400
Come on! Maybe
you've got me beat!

349
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:24,567
Aha! I've been waiting
for you to tell me
I've got you beat!!!

350
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:28,477
So I would think I have not got
you beat, but I personally know
I have got you beat!!!

351
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,607
With my two kings
against your lonely ace!

352
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:33,617
Haven't I, Frenchy?

353
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,778
Thirty bucks
against your pants!

354
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,319
Oh, what to do, what to do!

That's just a small sample
of what you buzzards are
gonna get from now on!

360
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:25,600
Welcome to Bottleneck, Tom!

Well, friend, I think...

362
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:32,640
You ain't Destry?
Oh, that's me!

Put down that
dern bird, will ya?

370
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,893
Well, my mistake was certainly
a pardonable one! How do
you do, Mrs! Destry?

371
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,299
Oh, wrong again!
Yes, I'm Janet Tyndall!

372
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,803
Oh, well, you'll be
needin' rooms anyway!
I'll show ya across!

373
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:02,773
Oh, come on, Mr! Destry!
You'll be wantin' a nice,
strong cup of tea!

374
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,775
Tea?
[Laughing]

375
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:08,836
Tea for Destry? Are you
crazy? What he wants
is some strong liquor!

376
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,882
Come on to the saloon!

377
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,474
You want
a cup of tea?
[Laughing]

378
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,487
Oh, come on, Callahan!
I can't wait here all day!

379
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:24,253
Frenchy,
have I got you beat?

380
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,093
Why don't you
call me and find out?

381
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,060
I'll call!

382
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:36,130
I'll bet my pants!

383
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,142
Two aces!

384
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,271
I was right! Why didn't
I listen to myself?

385
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,975
Hand over those pants!

386
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,110
But, Frenchy, I can't!
It's undignified!
Think of my position!

387
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:51,451
I've met every king in Europe!
Now you've met two aces
in Bottleneck!

388
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,616
Off with those pants!
No, Frenchy,
you really don't mean it!

389
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,286
Get him, boys, get him!
Ohh!

390

Everybody's laughin' at ya!

391
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:03,030
Tom, you made an impression
in this town that's gotta
be eradicated right now!

392
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,069
Well, Wash, don't you think
them first impressions!!!

393
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,196
Are darn fool things
to jump at, though?

394
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:10,639
Around here, you gotta jump
first or you don't live long!

395
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,768
Where's the saloon?
Down here! Come on!

396
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,278
What you were
just sayin' reminds me
of a friend of mine!

397
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,941
He woke up
in the middle of the night
and thought he saw!!!

398
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,951
A great big white hand
comin' up at him over
the edge of the bed!

399
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,216
So he got his gun out
from under his pillow
and he aimed,

400
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,985
and he shot a great big hole
right through his own foot!

401
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,289
No!
Yeah! Now he shouldn't
have gone!!!

402
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,228
By that first impression,
should he? Huh?

403
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:35,824
[Laughing]
Well, it was a darn fool...

404
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,960
Aw, come on!

405
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:48,573
Oh, that was
just Callahan,
Lily Belle's husband!

406
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,445
Come along in here!
Meet the folks!

407
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,746
Well, folks, here he is!

408
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,687
I want ya all
to meet my new deputy,
Thomas Jefferson Destry!

And this is Slade,
our mayor!
How are you, sir?

412
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:06,622
Oh, Frenchy! Frenchy!
Oh, here's the gal
you gotta meet!

413
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,666
[Laughing]

414
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,032
This is Frenchy!
Howdy, ma'am!

415
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,094
[Together]
How's the weather up there?

416
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,971
Yeah, yeah! Ah, come on!
You can do better than that!

417
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,237
[Wash]
You know, Frenchy is
the real boss of Bottleneck!

418
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:23,543
Oh, well, always like
to know who's boss!
You'll find out!

419
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:26,709
Come on, everybody!
Have a drink
on Callahan's pants!

420
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,844
[Cheering]

421
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:41,055
Mr! Destry,
before we start drinking,

422
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:44,159
I think you and me ought
to come to an understanding!

423
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,466
Well, I'm all for folks
understanding each other!

424
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,564
That's a mighty
fine idea, Mr! Kent!
I'm glad you agree with me!

425
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,542
So I'll start by telling you
that I have a...

426
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,545
very peculiar hobby!

427
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:57,207
Uh-huh! So have I!

428
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,843
Mine's, uh, carving napkin
rings! What's yours?

429
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:06,654
Mine's collecting
deputy sheriff s guns!

430
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:10,491
Whenever I meet a new deputy,
I always ask him for his gun!

431
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:12,689
And I ask him real nice!

432
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,698
Well, I'm sorry, Mr! Kent!

433
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:18,133
I'm afraid this here is
one gun your collection's
gonna be minus!

434
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:27,036
You mean I'm gonna
have to take it?
If you can!

435
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:31,674
Now hold on, hold on!
Don't get excited here!

436
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,685
I was just tryin' to tell ya
that I ain't got any guns!

437
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,492
See, if I woulda
had a gun there,

438
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,087
why, one of us
might have got hurt,
and it might have been me!

439
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:49,395
I wouldn't like that!
Would I?

440
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:00,634
[Laughing]

441
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:09,843
Tweet-tweet!
I'm a canary!
Where's my cage?

442
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:13,584
It's gettin' sunny!
Where's my parasol?

443
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:19,996
Folks, seems like
we got a deputy that
knows what's good for him!

444
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:22,124
[Laughing]

445
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:28,767
If he don't carry a gun,
he can't get into any trouble!

446
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,808
[Laughter]

447
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,310

Sheriff Keogh went?
- I didn't say!

Now listen, my son!
I'm an older man than you are!

I can account for them,
but you... You've got
to listen to me!

640
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:40,996
All right, Wash,
now what's on your mind?

As though I ain't
been tryin' to tell ya!

You've got to behave like
I expect ya to behave!
Where's the sheriff?

I'm always your pa!

killed a lot of men

You see, Tom!
Even that little kid...

660

Reminds me of a kid
I used to know!

ma and pa with a crowbar!

No!
Yes, he did.

Now the judge said to him,
"Do ya got anything to say
for yourself?"

664

And the kid said,
"Well, I just hope that
Your Honor has some regard!!!

outta my house!

I talk to Claggett!

What do you want
to see Claggett for?

687

Him's the man I want to put
off this... Who's the sheriff
around here?

I tell ya!
You ain't gonna do
this to us, mister!

Than let 'em have
this ranch, but that paper

to it! Don't it, Wash?

Sure, it does!

But I told you what
that woman did to me!

The game was as crooked
as a hog's tail!

I don't doubt that,
but it's your word
against theirs!

00:48:59,149 --> 00:49:02,084
Now hold on, ma'am!
Don't start throwin'
anything!

745
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:04,586
I just come over here
to apologize!
Apologize for what?

746
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:07,590
For not knowin'
who's the real boss
of Bottleneck!

747
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:15,865
My coffee, Clara!
Don't let me interfere
with your dinner, ma'am!

748
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:17,901
It's breakfast!

749
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,868
Breakfast, huh?

750
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,806
Kinda late in the day
for breakfast, isn't it?

751
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:30,510
Mind if I, uh,
sorta sit down
and visit for a while?

752
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,515
Suit yourself!
Thank you!

753
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:35,518
Does he get some?
I don't mind if I do
join you in a cup!

754
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,817
That's what I was hopin' for...
a chance to get neighborly!

755
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:43,326
So you found out what's
good for yourself, huh?
I came here to do a certain job,

756
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:47,728
and I figured I'd better
start usin' a little
horse sense, you know?

757
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:51,290
'Course I coulda come
bargin' in here with
all sorts of remarks,

758
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:54,337
like, uh!!! Couple of rumors
I just heard about you!

759
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,773
That you not only sing
down at that saloon,

760
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,275
but you also take part
in crooked poker games,

761
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,437
cheatin' folks
out of their ranches!

762
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:08,109
- Who said that?
- Oh, it's just a rumor,
of course, you know!

763
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:11,211
It ain't true!
Anybody with half
an eye could see!!!

764
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:14,519
That you wouldn't be party
to any action like that!

765
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,322
I'll take that!
I wouldn't want to have
this coffee spilt in my lap!

766
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:22,361
Just what are
you getting at?

767
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,561
Well, when you have hot coffee
spilt in your lap, you sorta!!!

768
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,161
Get up quick
and turn your back and!!!

769
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:31,503
Never know what's
gonna happen, do ya?

770
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,634
Now you get out!
Get out! Clara!
All right! All right!

771
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:39,342
I'm comin'!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! I'm goin'!

772
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,977
I've seen hundreds like you,
from Jacksonville
to Sacramento!

773
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,987
You all think easy pickin's
will last forever!

774
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:47,683
Mind your own business!
You're heading for trouble!
Trouble is my business!

775
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:51,751
You'll have plenty from me!
I do as I like, understand?

776
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:54,798
Anyone who gets in my way
is taken care of!
Like Keogh!

777
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:56,799
Yes, just like that!

778
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,570
That's what I thought!

779
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:04,340
What are you
going to do?
Don't get scared!

780
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:06,842
I'm not scared of anything!
You get out of town!!!

781
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,243
Before it's too late for you!
I don't think you're half
as bad as you make out to be!

782
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:13,340
Never mind what I am!
No!

783
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:23,085
Now, I bet you got
kind of a lovely face
under all that paint there!

784
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,930
Why don't you
wipe it off someday
and have a good look!

785
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:41,043
Figure out how
you can live up to it!

786
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,429
[Clara] That's the
peculiarest-actin'man...

787
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:02,522
I ever did see.

788
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:05,033
But he's got personality.

789
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,565
Mmm! He sure has!

790
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:17,446
[Indistinct Chatter]

791
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:20,449
What's that thing?
It's one of the new
chamois skins!

792
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:23,008
Takes the shine
off your nose!
Land sakes!
What'll they...

793
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:25,020
Look, girls!
Look at that!

794
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,022
Chamois skins.
Takes the shine off
your nose, she says.

795
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,752
Look! Isn't that lovely?

796
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:32,660
You should've seen
the parasol that
came with it!

797
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,163
About the size of a pie!
Ohh! It must've
been darling!

798
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:38,497
Make the most of it today!
Everybody in town'll
copy it tomorrow!

799
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:40,935
Including your wildcat friend
across the street!

800
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:44,770
I'd like to make
a dress for her:
Half tar, half feathers!

801
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:48,539
You came out on the coach
with Mr! Destry!
What's your opinion of him?

802
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:51,080
I know a little about him!
Apparently very nice!

803
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:53,582
Certainly different from
the rest of the men you meet
out in this country!

804
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,414
I'll say he's different!
'Course I may be
a little prejudiced!

805
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,183
After all, it's kinda hard
to judge character!!!

806
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:02,714
Through eight gallons
of water!
[Knocking]

807
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:06,160
Mrs! Callahan,
may I speak to you
just a moment, please?

808
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,460
Certainly, Mr! Loupgerou!
Come right in!

809
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:10,523
That is a little bit
impossible!

810
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:12,501
Would you please
come over here?

811
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:16,232
Uh, excuse me, girls!
Certainly!

812
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:20,933
What's the matter?
Prunes every day
for breakfast I don't mind!

813
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,275
Torn sheets
I've got used to!

814
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:26,976
But pants, I cannot swallow!
What are you
talkin' about?

815
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,178
Pants!
Mine are gone!
Oh!

Oh!
[Embarrassed Chuckling]

Don't go away!

819
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:43,760
Ouch!
Take off them pants!

820
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,961
Ohh!

821
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:49,563
Listen here,
my little sugar plum,
y'all can't do this to me!

I'll "y'all" you,
you misfit cossack you!
Take off them pants!

823

Now listen, Lily Bellchka,

824
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:57,537
I can't keep goin' around
without pants!

You ain't goin' around!
Take off them pants!

826
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:03,452
Oh, how can I learn
to be a cowboy!!!

827
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,921
If you won't let me
go out and gamble?
A fine gambler you are!

828
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,517
You oughta be
ashamed of yourself,
losin' your pants!

829

Callahan...
may he rest in peace...

830
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,429
[Speaking Russian]
What? Well, he may
have had his faults,

831
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:18,297
but at least
when he gambled, he won!
I'm sick of Callahan!

832
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,599
I'm sick of hearing his name!
Worse, I'm sick of wearing
his name!

833
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:25,233
All I want to do
is to be a cowboy
and wear my own pants!

834
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:28,836
Well, you won't get 'em!
Just sit there and gaze
on them features!

Please watch them
a little closer after this!

We'd have been all right
if we'd kept on shootin'!

847
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:05,709
Instead of sendin' for him!
They had the law
on their side!

The law!
I got something
to say about that!

00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,718
It's none
of your affair!

850
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:12,118
Kent's got ahold of
every ranch in the valley!!!

851
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:14,623
And he wants to charge two bits
for every head of cattle!

852
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:16,659
All you men do
is talk,

853
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:18,957
and when the time comes,
you do what Kent says!

854

Lily Belle, maybe Destry
knows what he's a-doin'!

855

It's time the decent people
of this town got rid
of them hoodlums!

watery-eyed sheriff!!!

And that gun-shy,
lady-fingered deputy ofhis.

858
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:32,498
I heard what you just said,
Tyndall.

859
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:35,909
What are you gonna do about it?
The first thing
we'd better do!!!

860
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:38,971
Is ask Mrs! Callahan
if she'll take care
of the Claggetts!

Don't turn your back
on me, you!

And I ain't gonna pay
Kent's fancy prices!

864
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,923
Now what do you aim to do?

865
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:49,925
Nothin' at present!
That's what I thought!

866
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:52,484
I'll get somethin' done,
if I have to take the law
in my own hands!

867
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:57,124
Nobody's gonna set themselves up
above the law around here,
ya understand?

868
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,395
I got somethin'
to say to you!

869
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:02,233
Maybe I could
illustrate it better
if I told you a story!

870
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:05,138
I used to have a friend
that was an opry singer,

871
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,369
but he went into
the cement business!

872
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:09,435
One day,
he fell into the cement!

873
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:13,313
And now he's the cornerstone
of the post office
in St! Louis, Missouri!

874
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:16,216
He shoulda stuck
to his own trade!

875
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,254
You'd better stick to yours!

876
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:26,859
That fella Tyndall
is gonna make trouble,
sure as I'm standin' here!

877
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,923
What are we gonna do?
What do you say
we get ready for supper?

878
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,869
How can you talk of eatin'
at a time like this?
'Cause I'm hungry!

'Cause you're hungry!

I suppose I'm supposed
to stand he... Ohh!

Well!

I'm waiting for
a stagecoach!
Uh-huh!

What are my pants
doing on your legs?

884
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,619
These are the legs
of a Stavrogin
of Bardicheff!

remain on them

He was a great wine drinker!

he'd come into town
with a new load of stock,

he'd rush right
into the first saloon!

I had a friend in Louisiana
like that!

he came to town he went
to the nearest oyster house!

Please?

But he told me to tell you,

Did he say that?

Gee, that's bad if he

Now wait a minute!

You know, that's how
they shot my father!

1345
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:38,450
They didn't dare
face him either!

1346
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:45,090
They didn't give us
a chance, did they?

Why do you just stand here
like sheep?

1353

Why don't you stop them?
Go back where you belong!

Wherever I belong,

You shut your mouth.

I wouldn't wait around
for my man to get killed
